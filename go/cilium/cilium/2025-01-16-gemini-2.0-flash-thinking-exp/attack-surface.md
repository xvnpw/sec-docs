# Attack Surface Analysis for cilium/cilium

## Attack Surface: [Cilium Agent Host System Compromise](./attack_surfaces/cilium_agent_host_system_compromise.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Cilium Agent Host System Compromise
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability in the Cilium agent allows an attacker to escape the container context and gain control of the underlying host operating system.
    *   **How Cilium Contributes:** The Cilium agent runs with elevated privileges on each node to manage networking and security policies. Its direct interaction with the kernel and host networking stack increases the potential impact of a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A malicious container exploits a buffer overflow in the Cilium agent's BPF processing logic, allowing code execution on the host.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the node, including access to sensitive data, the ability to compromise other containers on the same node, and potential for lateral movement within the cluster.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Cilium agent software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Implement robust container security measures (e.g., seccomp profiles, AppArmor/SELinux) to limit the capabilities of containers, reducing the attack surface available to exploit the agent.
        *   Regularly audit Cilium agent configurations and ensure adherence to security best practices.
        *   Consider using a security scanner to identify vulnerabilities in the Cilium agent container image.

## Attack Surface: [Kernel Exploitation via Malicious BPF Programs](./attack_surfaces/kernel_exploitation_via_malicious_bpf_programs.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Kernel Exploitation via Malicious BPF Programs
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects or manipulates BPF programs loaded by Cilium to exploit vulnerabilities within the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem.
    *   **How Cilium Contributes:** Cilium heavily relies on eBPF for network policy enforcement and observability. This introduces the risk of kernel vulnerabilities being exploited through malicious BPF code.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a BPF program that triggers a use-after-free vulnerability in the kernel's BPF verifier, leading to kernel code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Kernel-level compromise, potentially leading to full control over the node and impacting all workloads running on it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the underlying Linux kernel updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Utilize Cilium's built-in BPF program verification and hardening features.
        *   Implement runtime security monitoring to detect and prevent the loading of suspicious BPF programs.
        *   Follow Cilium's recommendations for secure BPF program development and deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Inter-Agent Communication Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_inter-agent_communication_manipulation.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthorized Inter-Agent Communication Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or manipulates communication between Cilium agents on different nodes to bypass network policies or disrupt network connectivity.
    *   **How Cilium Contributes:** Cilium agents communicate with each other to synchronize network policies and share state. If this communication is not properly secured, it becomes a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack on the communication channel between two Cilium agents, modifying policy updates to allow unauthorized traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing network segmentation, allowing unauthorized access between services, potential for data exfiltration or denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable mutual TLS (mTLS) between Cilium agents to encrypt and authenticate inter-agent communication.
        *   Ensure proper network segmentation and isolation to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
        *   Regularly review and audit Cilium network policies to detect any unauthorized changes.

## Attack Surface: [Cilium Operator Compromise Leading to Cluster-Wide Policy Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/cilium_operator_compromise_leading_to_cluster-wide_policy_manipulation.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Cilium Operator Compromise Leading to Cluster-Wide Policy Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the Cilium Operator, allowing them to manipulate network policies and security configurations across the entire Kubernetes cluster.
    *   **How Cilium Contributes:** The Cilium Operator has cluster-wide permissions to manage Cilium resources and interact with the Kubernetes API. Compromise of the Operator has significant blast radius.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Cilium Operator's API or gains access to its credentials, allowing them to modify NetworkPolicy objects to permit unauthorized network traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread security breaches, bypassing of network segmentation, potential for data exfiltration, and disruption of services across the cluster.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to the Cilium Operator's deployment and configuration.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Kubernetes API server, limiting the Operator's effective permissions where possible (least privilege principle).
        *   Regularly audit the Cilium Operator's logs and activities for suspicious behavior.
        *   Secure the container image used for the Cilium Operator and keep it updated.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Cilium Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_cilium_custom_resource_definitions__crds_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Exploitation of Cilium Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the controllers or validation logic for Cilium's custom resource definitions (CRDs) are exploited to inject malicious configurations.
    *   **How Cilium Contributes:** Cilium introduces its own CRDs for managing network policies and other features. Weaknesses in how these CRDs are handled can create attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious `CiliumNetworkPolicy` object that bypasses intended security controls due to a flaw in the CRD controller.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing network policies, potential for unauthorized access between services, and disruption of network functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Cilium updated to benefit from fixes to CRD controller vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement admission controllers in Kubernetes to validate Cilium CRD objects before they are applied.
        *   Regularly review and audit Cilium CRD configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Control Plane Data Store Compromise (e.g., etcd)](./attack_surfaces/control_plane_data_store_compromise__e_g___etcd_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Control Plane Data Store Compromise (e.g., etcd)
    *   **Description:** Unauthorized access to or compromise of the underlying data store used by Cilium (often etcd in Kubernetes) allows for manipulation of Cilium's configuration and state.
    *   **How Cilium Contributes:** Cilium relies on a data store to persist its configuration. If this data store is compromised, Cilium's security can be undermined.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the etcd cluster used by Kubernetes and modifies Cilium's configuration to disable network policies or allow unauthorized traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of Cilium's functionality, allowing for arbitrary network access and bypassing all security controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the data store (e.g., etcd) with strong authentication, authorization, and encryption.
        *   Restrict network access to the data store to only authorized components.
        *   Regularly back up the data store to allow for recovery in case of compromise.
