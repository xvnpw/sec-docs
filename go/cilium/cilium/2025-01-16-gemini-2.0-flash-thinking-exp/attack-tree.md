## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] 1. Exploit Cilium Agent Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__1__exploit_cilium_agent_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

* **[CRITICAL] 1. Exploit Cilium Agent Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]:**
    * **1.1. Exploit Known CVEs in Cilium Agent [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the Cilium Agent for which exploits may be readily available. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the agent's context, potentially compromising the entire node.
    * **1.3. Exploit Privilege Escalation within Cilium Agent [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers aim to gain higher privileges within the Cilium Agent than initially possessed. This allows them to bypass intended security controls and perform actions they are not authorized for.
        * **1.3.1. Exploit Incorrect RBAC/Authorization within Cilium Agent [HIGH RISK]:** Misconfigurations in the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or authorization mechanisms within the Cilium Agent can grant excessive permissions to unauthorized entities, allowing for privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Cilium Network Policies [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_cilium_network_policies__high_risk_.md)

* **2. Manipulate Cilium Network Policies [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers attempt to alter or bypass the network policies enforced by Cilium to gain unauthorized network access.
    * **2.1. Exploit Misconfigured Network Policies [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers exploit incorrectly configured network policies that are overly permissive, allowing unintended network traffic.
        * **2.1.1. Overly Permissive Egress Policies [HIGH RISK]:** Network policies allow outbound connections to a wider range of destinations than necessary, potentially enabling data exfiltration or communication with malicious command and control servers.
        * **2.1.2. Insufficiently Restrictive Ingress Policies [HIGH RISK]:** Network policies allow inbound connections from unauthorized sources or on unintended ports, granting attackers access to services they should not reach.
    * **[CRITICAL] 2.3. Inject Malicious Network Policies [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers successfully inject their own malicious network policies into the Cilium system to grant themselves unauthorized access or disrupt network traffic.
        * **[CRITICAL] 2.3.1. Compromise the Cilium Operator [HIGH RISK]:** By compromising the Cilium Operator, an attacker gains the ability to manipulate and inject arbitrary network policies, effectively controlling network segmentation and access.
        * **[CRITICAL] 2.3.2. Exploit Kubernetes API Server Vulnerabilities to Inject Policies [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes API server to directly manipulate Cilium's network policy objects, bypassing normal authorization channels.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Cilium Service Mesh (if enabled) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_cilium_service_mesh__if_enabled___high_risk_.md)

* **3. Exploit Cilium Service Mesh (if enabled) [HIGH RISK]:**  If Cilium's service mesh features are active, attackers target the inter-service communication and security mechanisms.
    * **3.1. Impersonate a Service Identity [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers attempt to assume the identity of a legitimate service within the mesh to gain unauthorized access to other services and resources.
        * **3.1.1. Steal or Forge Service Account Tokens [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers steal or forge service account tokens, which are used to authenticate services within the mesh, allowing them to impersonate those services.
    * **3.2. Man-in-the-Middle Attack within the Service Mesh [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers position themselves between two communicating services within the mesh to intercept and potentially modify the traffic.
        * **3.2.1. Exploit Weaknesses in Mutual TLS (mTLS) Configuration [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations or weaknesses in the mutual TLS (mTLS) setup used for secure communication within the service mesh, allowing them to intercept or decrypt traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] 5. Exploit Cilium Operator Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__5__exploit_cilium_operator_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

* **[CRITICAL] 5. Exploit Cilium Operator Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within the Cilium Operator, which manages the lifecycle and configuration of Cilium components.
    * **5.1. Exploit Known CVEs in Cilium Operator [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the Cilium Operator, potentially gaining control over its functionalities.
    * **5.2. Exploit Privilege Escalation within Cilium Operator [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers aim to gain higher privileges within the Cilium Operator, allowing them to perform administrative tasks and potentially compromise the entire Cilium deployment.
    * **5.3. Compromise the Cilium Operator's Configuration [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to and modify the Cilium Operator's configuration, potentially disrupting the Cilium infrastructure or creating backdoors.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Cilium's External Connectivity Features (e.g., LoadBalancer, NodePort) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_cilium's_external_connectivity_features__e_g___loadbalancer__nodeport___high_risk_.md)

* **6. Exploit Cilium's External Connectivity Features (e.g., LoadBalancer, NodePort) [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers target the mechanisms Cilium uses to expose services externally.
    * **6.1. Exploit Misconfigurations in External Service Access [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in how services are exposed externally (e.g., through LoadBalancer or NodePort), gaining unintended access to those services.
