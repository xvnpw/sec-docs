## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Cilium Network Policies [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_cilium_network_policies__high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path encompasses scenarios where an attacker circumvents the intended network security policies enforced by Cilium. This can be achieved through various means, making it a significant concern.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Policy Enforcement Logic [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_policy_enforcement_logic__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents a fundamental weakness in Cilium's core security mechanism. If the logic responsible for enforcing network policies has vulnerabilities, attackers can bypass these policies regardless of how well they are configured.

This includes exploiting bugs in the eBPF programs that implement the policies or flaws in the Cilium agent's policy evaluation process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigure Network Policies [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigure_network_policies__high-risk_path_.md)

This is a common and often easily exploitable high-risk path. Incorrectly configured network policies can inadvertently allow unauthorized traffic.

This includes:

*   **Overly Permissive Policies:** Policies that grant broader access than necessary, allowing attackers to communicate with sensitive services.
*   **Incorrect Identity Matching:** Policies that fail to correctly identify the intended source or destination, leading to policies being applied to the wrong entities.
*   **Policy Conflicts Leading to Unexpected Behavior:** Complex policy sets can have conflicting rules, resulting in unintended allowances that attackers can exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cilium's Identity System [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cilium's_identity_system__high-risk_path_.md)

Cilium relies on identities (primarily Kubernetes Service Accounts) to enforce policies. Compromising this system allows attackers to bypass policy restrictions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Kubernetes Service Account Tokens [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_kubernetes_service_account_tokens__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical node as it directly allows an attacker to assume the identity of a legitimate service. If an attacker obtains a valid Service Account token, they can authenticate as that service and bypass network policies intended for it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cilium Agent Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cilium_agent_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

The Cilium agent runs on each node and is responsible for enforcing network policies. Compromising the agent can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical node because successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the node where the Cilium agent is running.

This could be achieved through vulnerabilities in the agent's gRPC or HTTP APIs, or through vulnerabilities in its dependencies. Gaining RCE on the agent grants the attacker significant control over the node's networking and potentially the entire node.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cilium Operator Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cilium_operator_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

The Cilium Operator manages the deployment and configuration of Cilium. Compromising it can lead to widespread impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

Similar to the agent, RCE on the operator allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the operator's context.

This could be through vulnerabilities in its interaction with the Kubernetes API or in its dependencies. Gaining RCE on the operator allows attackers to manipulate the Cilium deployment, potentially disabling security features or injecting malicious configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cilium's Service Mesh Capabilities (if enabled) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cilium's_service_mesh_capabilities__if_enabled___high-risk_path_.md)

If Cilium's service mesh features are enabled, new attack vectors emerge related to traffic management and routing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Cilium's Service Mesh Control Plane [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_cilium's_service_mesh_control_plane__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents vulnerabilities in the components responsible for managing the service mesh.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to:

*   **Manipulate Traffic Routing:** Redirect traffic to malicious endpoints or intercept sensitive data.
*   **Inject Malicious Responses:**  Alter the responses sent by services, potentially leading to application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations in Service Mesh Policies [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_in_service_mesh_policies__high-risk_path_.md)

Similar to network policies, misconfigured service mesh policies can create security gaps.

*   **Bypass Authentication or Authorization Checks:** Incorrectly configured policies might fail to properly authenticate or authorize requests, allowing unauthorized access to services within the mesh.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Cilium [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_cilium__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents a high-impact, albeit potentially lower likelihood, attack vector.

Compromising the build or distribution process of Cilium could lead to the injection of malicious code into the Cilium binaries or container images.

This would affect all users who download and deploy the compromised version of Cilium, potentially leading to widespread compromise.

This includes:

*   **Compromise Cilium Build Process:** Injecting malicious code during the software build process.
*   **Compromise Cilium Container Images:** Injecting malicious code into the official Docker images.
*   **Compromise Dependencies:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Cilium.
