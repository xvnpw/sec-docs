# Attack Surface Analysis for cilium/cilium

## Attack Surface: [Cilium Operator API Exposure](./attack_surfaces/cilium_operator_api_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the Cilium Operator's Kubernetes API.
*   **Cilium Contribution:** Cilium Operator exposes a Kubernetes API for managing Cilium resources like network policies and identities, a core part of Cilium's control plane.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Kubernetes API and manipulates CiliumNetworkPolicy objects to bypass network restrictions and access sensitive services.
*   **Impact:** Network policy bypass, unauthorized access to resources, potential data breaches, and service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes to restrict access to the Cilium Operator API to only authorized users and services.
    *   Regularly audit and review RBAC configurations to ensure they are up-to-date and correctly configured.
    *   Employ network policies to restrict access to the Cilium Operator's service itself, limiting access to only necessary components within the cluster.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/custom_resource_definitions__crds__manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious manipulation of Cilium's Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) within Kubernetes.
*   **Cilium Contribution:** Cilium relies on CRDs to extend the Kubernetes API for its specific functionalities, including network policies (CiliumNetworkPolicy, CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy) and identities (CiliumIdentity), which are fundamental to Cilium's operation.
*   **Example:** An attacker with sufficient Kubernetes privileges modifies a CiliumNetworkPolicy CRD to introduce overly permissive rules, effectively bypassing intended network segmentation and allowing unauthorized traffic flow.
*   **Impact:** Network policy bypass, security control circumvention, potential privilege escalation by manipulating identity assignments, and disruption of Cilium's intended operation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strict RBAC policies for accessing and modifying Cilium CRDs, limiting these permissions to only necessary service accounts and administrators.
    *   Implement validation webhooks to automatically validate the integrity and correctness of Cilium CRD configurations upon creation or modification, preventing malicious or erroneous configurations.
    *   Regularly audit CRD configurations for anomalies and deviations from expected configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Cilium Operator Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/cilium_operator_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of security vulnerabilities within the Cilium Operator component itself.
*   **Cilium Contribution:** The Cilium Operator is a critical cluster-level component directly developed and maintained by the Cilium project, responsible for managing Cilium agents and resources.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers and exploits a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Cilium Operator, gaining control over the operator and potentially the entire Cilium deployment, allowing for widespread network manipulation.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of Cilium control plane, disruption of network policy enforcement, potential compromise of the Kubernetes cluster, and significant security breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Cilium Operator updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities promptly.
    *   Follow security best practices for container image security, including using minimal base images and regularly scanning for vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement robust monitoring and logging for the Cilium Operator to detect suspicious activities and potential attacks.

## Attack Surface: [eBPF Program Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/ebpf_program_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the eBPF programs used by Cilium or in the kernel's eBPF subsystem.
*   **Cilium Contribution:** Cilium heavily relies on eBPF programs, which are custom code developed and integrated by the Cilium project, for core functionalities like network filtering, policy enforcement, and observability.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a Cilium eBPF program to bypass network policies, gain kernel-level privileges on a node, or trigger a kernel panic leading to a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Network policy bypass, kernel-level compromise of nodes, potential data breaches, denial of service, and instability of the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the underlying Linux kernel updated to the latest stable version with security patches, as kernel updates often include fixes for eBPF subsystem vulnerabilities.
    *   Keep Cilium updated to the latest stable version, as Cilium developers actively work to ensure the security of their eBPF programs and release updates to address discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   Leverage kernel hardening techniques and security profiles where possible to limit the potential impact of eBPF vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Cilium Agent Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/cilium_agent_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of security vulnerabilities within the Cilium Agent running on each Kubernetes node.
*   **Cilium Contribution:** The Cilium Agent is a core component directly developed and maintained by the Cilium project, responsible for enforcing network policies and managing network connectivity on each node.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Cilium Agent to bypass network policies on a specific node, gain control over the agent process, or potentially escalate privileges to the node level.
*   **Impact:** Node-level network policy bypass, potential node compromise, disruption of network services running on the node, and localized security breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Cilium Agent updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow security best practices for container image security and deployment of the Cilium Agent container.
    *   Implement resource limits and security contexts for the Cilium Agent container to restrict its capabilities and limit the impact of potential compromises.
    *   Monitor Cilium Agent logs for suspicious activities and anomalies.

## Attack Surface: [Secrets Management for Encryption Features (IPsec/WireGuard)](./attack_surfaces/secrets_management_for_encryption_features__ipsecwireguard_.md)

*   **Description:** Compromise of secrets used for encryption key management in Cilium's IPsec or WireGuard encryption features.
*   **Cilium Contribution:** Cilium directly integrates and manages IPsec and WireGuard encryption features, including the handling of cryptographic keys.
*   **Example:** Encryption keys for IPsec or WireGuard are stored insecurely as Kubernetes Secrets without proper encryption or access control, allowing an attacker to retrieve these keys and decrypt network traffic or disrupt encrypted communication.
*   **Impact:** Decryption of network traffic, exposure of sensitive data in transit, disruption of encrypted communication channels, and potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize secure secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secret management services to store and manage encryption keys instead of relying solely on default Kubernetes Secrets.
    *   Implement strict access control for secrets, limiting access to only authorized components and services that require them.
    *   Encrypt secrets at rest within the secret management system.
    *   Rotate encryption keys regularly to limit the window of opportunity for compromised keys.
