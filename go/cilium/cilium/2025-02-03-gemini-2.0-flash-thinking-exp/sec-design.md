# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Cilium aims to provide secure network connectivity, observability, and control for cloud-native applications, particularly in Kubernetes environments.
  - The project prioritizes high performance, scalability, and security for modern, dynamic workloads.
  - A key goal is to simplify and automate network management and security in complex cloud-native deployments.
  - Cilium seeks to be a leading open-source solution for cloud-native networking, fostering a strong community and ecosystem.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in Cilium could lead to significant breaches in user environments, impacting application availability and data confidentiality.
  - Performance issues or instability in Cilium could disrupt critical business applications relying on network connectivity.
  - Lack of adoption or community support could hinder the long-term viability and development of Cilium, impacting users who depend on it.
  - Compliance violations due to insecure network configurations or lack of auditability could result in legal and financial repercussions for users.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are conducted for all code changes. (Implemented via GitHub Pull Requests and community review process, described in project's contribution guidelines.)
  - security control: Static code analysis is likely used as part of the development process. (Inferred from common open-source development practices and CI/CD pipelines, details might be in repository's configuration files.)
  - security control: Unit and integration tests are implemented to ensure code quality and functionality. (Evident from the repository's test directory and CI/CD configurations.)
  - security control: Vulnerability scanning of dependencies is likely performed. (Inferred from standard software supply chain security practices, might be integrated into CI/CD.)
  - security control: Container image signing and verification are likely employed for release artifacts. (Inferred from best practices for container image distribution and security, details might be in release documentation.)
  - security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Kubernetes is leveraged for authorization. (Described in Cilium documentation regarding Kubernetes integration and security policies.)
  - security control: Network policies are enforced by Cilium to control traffic flow between pods and services. (Core functionality of Cilium, documented extensively.)
  - security control: Encryption of network traffic using technologies like WireGuard or IPsec can be configured. (Feature of Cilium, documented in security and encryption sections.)
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: As an open-source project, the speed of response to newly discovered vulnerabilities might be influenced by community availability and the severity of the issue.
  - accepted risk: Complex configurations might introduce misconfigurations leading to security gaps if not properly managed.
  - accepted risk: Third-party dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities that are not immediately identified or patched by the Cilium project.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities in code changes.
  - security control: Establish a formal Security Response Team and a documented vulnerability disclosure process to handle security issues effectively.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits to identify and address potential weaknesses in Cilium's design and implementation.
  - security control: Enhance supply chain security by using signed commits, Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), and verifying dependencies' integrity.
  - security control: Provide security hardening guides and best practices for deploying and configuring Cilium in various environments.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Cilium relies on Kubernetes authentication mechanisms (e.g., kubeconfig, service accounts) for API access and control plane interactions.
    - Mutual TLS (mTLS) is used for securing communication between Cilium components and for service mesh functionalities.
  - Authorization:
    - Kubernetes RBAC is used to control access to Cilium APIs and resources.
    - Cilium Network Policies provide fine-grained authorization for network traffic based on identities and labels.
    - Policy enforcement should be least-privilege based, ensuring only necessary permissions are granted.
  - Input Validation:
    - All inputs to Cilium APIs, including network policy definitions and configuration parameters, must be rigorously validated to prevent injection attacks and misconfigurations.
    - Input validation should be performed on both the control plane and data plane components.
  - Cryptography:
    - Cryptographic protocols like TLS and WireGuard/IPsec must be used to protect sensitive data in transit.
    - Strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices should be employed.
    - Secrets management for cryptographic keys and sensitive configuration data should be secure and robust, ideally leveraging Kubernetes Secrets or dedicated secrets management solutions.
