## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Cilium [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_cilium__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application leveraging weaknesses in Cilium.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Cilium Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_cilium_weaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This is the overarching approach. The attacker will focus on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within Cilium itself to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Cilium Control Plane [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_cilium_control_plane__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Compromising the Cilium Agent: Gaining control over the agent allows manipulation of network policies and potentially node compromise.
    *   Compromising the Cilium Operator: Gaining control over the operator can lead to cluster-wide policy manipulation and potentially Kubernetes cluster compromise.
    *   Exploiting Kubernetes API Server Interaction (Cilium specific): Weaknesses in how Cilium interacts with the Kubernetes API can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or manipulate Cilium configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Compromise Cilium Agent [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__compromise_cilium_agent__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Cilium Agent Vulnerability [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Cilium Agent [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Exploit known CVE in Cilium Agent (e.g., buffer overflow, insecure deserialization) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers can leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the Cilium Agent code to execute arbitrary code on the node where the agent is running. This could be through network-based attacks or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the agent processes input.
        *   **Privilege Escalation in Cilium Agent [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Exploit misconfiguration or vulnerability to gain root/admin privileges on Agent node [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Even without RCE, attackers might exploit misconfigurations or local vulnerabilities within the Cilium Agent process to escalate their privileges to root or administrator level on the underlying node. This could involve exploiting file permission issues, insecure handling of credentials, or other local privilege escalation techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Kubernetes API Server Interaction -> Abuse Cilium RBAC Permissions [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_kubernetes_api_server_interaction_-_abuse_cilium_rbac_permissions__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit overly permissive RBAC roles granted to Cilium components [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) might be misconfigured, granting Cilium components (or service accounts associated with them) overly broad permissions to Kubernetes resources. Attackers who compromise a Cilium component (or gain access to its service account credentials) could then abuse these excessive permissions to manipulate Kubernetes objects, potentially bypassing security controls or gaining further access within the cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Cilium Data Plane (eBPF) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_cilium_data_plane__ebpf___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit eBPF Vulnerabilities in Cilium Programs [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Kernel Exploitation via eBPF Bugs [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Trigger vulnerabilities in Cilium's eBPF programs leading to kernel crashes or exploits [CRITICAL NODE]:** Cilium heavily relies on eBPF programs for network policy enforcement and visibility. Bugs in these eBPF programs, if triggered by crafted network traffic or specific conditions, could lead to kernel-level vulnerabilities. Exploiting these kernel vulnerabilities can grant attackers complete control over the node, as they are executing code directly within the kernel. This is a very severe attack vector due to the deep level of access it provides.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Exploit Cilium Network Policy Implementation -> Policy Misconfiguration [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/7__exploit_cilium_network_policy_implementation_-_policy_misconfiguration__critical_node__high-risk__9301ec5f.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Overly Permissive Policies [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Policies that unintentionally allow access to sensitive application components [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Human error during policy creation can lead to policies that are too permissive. These policies might unintentionally allow network access to sensitive application components (databases, internal services, etc.) from unauthorized sources. Attackers can exploit these overly permissive rules to gain access to protected resources that should have been restricted.
    *   **Policy Gaps [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Missing policies that fail to restrict access to critical services or namespaces [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Oversights or incomplete policy definitions can result in "gaps" in network security.  Critical services or namespaces might not have sufficient network policies applied to restrict access. Attackers can exploit these gaps by targeting services or namespaces that lack adequate policy protection, gaining unauthorized access due to the absence of intended restrictions.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Exploit Cilium Service Mesh Features (If Enabled) -> Envoy Proxy Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/8__exploit_cilium_service_mesh_features__if_enabled__-_envoy_proxy_vulnerabilities__critical_node__h_e5936a99.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Envoy Proxy Vulnerabilities (Cilium uses Envoy as Proxy) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **RCE in Envoy Proxy [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Exploit known CVEs in the version of Envoy used by Cilium [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** If Cilium is configured to use its service mesh features, it leverages Envoy proxy. Envoy, like any complex software, can have vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit known CVEs in the specific version of Envoy used by Cilium to achieve Remote Code Execution on the Envoy proxy instances. Compromising Envoy allows attackers to intercept and manipulate application traffic, potentially bypassing L7 policies, stealing credentials, or injecting malicious content.

These high-risk paths and critical nodes represent the most significant threats when using Cilium. Focusing mitigation efforts on these areas will provide the most impactful security improvements.
