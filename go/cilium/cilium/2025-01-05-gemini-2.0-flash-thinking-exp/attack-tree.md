## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Cilium Control Plane](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_cilium_control_plane.md)

**High-Risk Path: Gain Access to Cilium Control Plane**

* **AND Gain Access to Cilium Control Plane [CRITICAL NODE]:** This path represents a high-value target for attackers. Successful compromise grants broad control over Cilium's configuration and policies, potentially affecting all applications managed by it.

    * **OR Exploit Cilium Operator Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** The Cilium Operator manages the lifecycle of Cilium components. Exploiting vulnerabilities here can provide attackers with control over the entire Cilium deployment.
        * **Exploit known CVEs in Cilium Operator [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in the Cilium Operator can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access.
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: Critical
            * Effort: Medium
            * Skill Level: Intermediate/Advanced
            * Detection Difficulty: Moderate
    * **OR Compromise etcd Datastore [CRITICAL NODE]:** Cilium uses etcd to store its configuration and state. Compromising etcd allows attackers to directly manipulate Cilium's behavior.
        * **Exploit etcd vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the etcd datastore can grant attackers unauthorized access or control.
            * Likelihood: Low
            * Impact: Critical
            * Effort: High
            * Skill Level: Advanced
            * Detection Difficulty: Very Difficult
        * **Gain access to etcd credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:** Obtaining valid credentials for accessing the etcd datastore allows attackers to bypass authentication and directly interact with Cilium's configuration.
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: Critical
            * Effort: Medium
            * Skill Level: Intermediate
            * Detection Difficulty: Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Cilium Network Policies](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_cilium_network_policies.md)

**High-Risk Path: Bypass Cilium Network Policies**

* **AND Bypass Cilium Network Policies:** This path focuses on circumventing Cilium's core security mechanism, potentially allowing unauthorized access to application resources.

    * **OR Exploit Vulnerabilities in Policy Enforcement Engine (eBPF) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Cilium uses eBPF programs to enforce network policies at the kernel level. Exploiting vulnerabilities in these programs can lead to policy bypass.
        * Trigger bugs in eBPF programs leading to policy bypass: Exploiting specific bugs in the eBPF code can cause the policy enforcement to fail, allowing unauthorized traffic.
            * Likelihood: Low
            * Impact: Significant
            * Effort: High
            * Skill Level: Expert
            * Detection Difficulty: Very Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cilium Service Mesh (if enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cilium_service_mesh__if_enabled_.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Cilium Service Mesh (if enabled)**

* **AND Exploit Cilium Service Mesh (if enabled):** If the service mesh functionality is enabled, attackers can target vulnerabilities in its components to compromise inter-service communication.

    * **OR Exploit Envoy Proxy Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** Cilium uses Envoy as its proxy for service mesh functionality. Exploiting vulnerabilities in Envoy can compromise communication between services.
        * **Exploit known CVEs in the Envoy proxy used by Cilium [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific version of Envoy used by Cilium can allow attackers to intercept, modify, or disrupt service-to-service communication.
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: Significant
            * Effort: Medium
            * Skill Level: Intermediate/Advanced
            * Detection Difficulty: Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Cilium Agent on a Node](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_cilium_agent_on_a_node.md)

**High-Risk Path: Compromise Cilium Agent on a Node**

* **AND Compromise Cilium Agent on a Node [CRITICAL NODE]:** Gaining control of the Cilium agent running on a node allows attackers to manipulate network traffic for all pods on that node.

    * **OR Exploit Cilium Agent Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** The Cilium agent is responsible for enforcing network policies and managing connectivity on a node. Exploiting vulnerabilities in the agent itself can grant attackers significant control.
        * **Exploit known CVEs in the Cilium agent [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in the Cilium agent can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the node or gain unauthorized control over its networking.
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: Critical
            * Effort: Medium
            * Skill Level: Intermediate/Advanced
            * Detection Difficulty: Moderate
