# Attack Surface Analysis for cilium/cilium

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Cilium Agent API](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_cilium_agent_api.md)

**Description:** The Cilium Agent exposes an API on each node for management and control. If this API is not properly secured, it can be a point of attack.
*   **How Cilium Contributes:** Cilium introduces this API as a core component for its functionality.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Cilium Agent API and modifies network policies to allow unauthorized access to sensitive services.
*   **Impact:**  Network segmentation bypass, security policy manipulation, potential for denial of service or data exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Cilium Agent API (e.g., mutual TLS).
    *   Restrict access to the API to authorized users and components only (network policies, firewall rules).
    *   Avoid exposing the API publicly.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of eBPF Programs](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_ebpf_programs.md)

**Description:** Cilium heavily relies on eBPF programs running in the kernel. Vulnerabilities in these programs or the eBPF subsystem itself can be exploited.
*   **How Cilium Contributes:** Cilium introduces and manages custom eBPF programs for network filtering and security enforcement.
*   **Example:** A crafted network packet triggers a vulnerability in a Cilium eBPF program, leading to a kernel panic or privilege escalation on the node.
*   **Impact:** Node compromise, potential for cluster-wide impact if the compromised node is critical.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Cilium updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for eBPF vulnerabilities.
    *   Enable BPF sandboxing features if available and applicable to your environment.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of the Cilium Operator](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_the_cilium_operator.md)

**Description:** The Cilium Operator manages Cilium components across the cluster. If compromised, an attacker gains significant control over the network and security policies.
*   **How Cilium Contributes:** Cilium introduces the Operator as a central management component.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Cilium Operator or gains access to its credentials, allowing them to modify network policies cluster-wide, potentially isolating services or allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Cluster-wide network disruption, security policy bypass, potential for data exfiltration or denial of service at scale.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the Cilium Operator's deployment (e.g., strong RBAC, network isolation).
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Operator's API.
    *   Regularly audit the Operator's configuration and access logs.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Compromised Encryption Keys (IPsec/WireGuard)](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_compromised_encryption_keys__ipsecwireguard_.md)

**Description:** Cilium can use IPsec or WireGuard for encrypting network traffic. Weak or compromised encryption keys can allow attackers to decrypt and intercept communication.
*   **How Cilium Contributes:** Cilium provides the option to enable encryption using these protocols.
*   **Example:** An attacker obtains the encryption keys used by Cilium and can decrypt network traffic between pods, potentially exposing sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, eavesdropping on network communication.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong and randomly generated encryption keys.
    *   Implement secure key management practices.
    *   Ensure proper configuration of IPsec or WireGuard to avoid downgrade attacks to weaker ciphers.
