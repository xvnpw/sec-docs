# Threat Model Analysis for cilium/cilium

## Threat: [Policy Bypass via Incorrect Selector Matching](./threats/policy_bypass_via_incorrect_selector_matching.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could exploit a misconfiguration in Cilium network policy selectors (e.g., labels, namespaces) to make their malicious pod appear as a legitimate target or source, bypassing intended policy restrictions. They might try to craft pod labels or deploy their workload in a namespace that inadvertently grants them more access than intended.
*   **How:** By creating a pod with labels or being deployed in a namespace that matches overly broad or incorrectly defined selectors in a `CiliumNetworkPolicy`.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to services, potential data exfiltration, lateral movement within the cluster.
**Affected Component:** `cilium-agent` (policy enforcement module).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement thorough testing of network policies after deployment and updates.
*   Use specific and well-defined labels for policy targeting.
*   Employ namespace-based segmentation and enforce policies at the namespace level.
*   Utilize tools to visualize and audit network policy configurations.

## Threat: [Spoofing via Ingress Policy Misconfiguration](./threats/spoofing_via_ingress_policy_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could exploit a weakly configured ingress policy that doesn't properly validate the source of incoming traffic.
*   **How:** By sending traffic with a spoofed source IP address or identity that matches the allowed sources in the ingress policy, gaining unauthorized access to services.
**Impact:** Bypassing intended security controls, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
**Affected Component:** `cilium-agent` (policy enforcement module).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict ingress policies that explicitly define allowed source IP ranges or identities.
*   Utilize Cilium's identity-based policies to verify the identity of the source endpoint.
*   Avoid relying solely on IP addresses for ingress policy enforcement, as these can be easily spoofed.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) on Service Discovery Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__on_service_discovery_communication.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker who has compromised a node or has network access could attempt to intercept or manipulate the communication between Cilium agents involved in service discovery.
*   **How:** By eavesdropping on network traffic or by injecting malicious responses to service discovery requests.
**Impact:** Redirecting traffic intended for a legitimate service to a malicious endpoint, potentially leading to data theft, credential harvesting, or further compromise.
**Affected Component:** `cilium-agent` (service discovery module).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure secure communication channels between Cilium agents, potentially using encryption for inter-agent communication.
*   Implement mutual authentication between Cilium components to verify their identities.
*   Harden the nodes where Cilium agents are running to prevent compromise.

## Threat: [Key Compromise leading to Decryption of Network Traffic](./threats/key_compromise_leading_to_decryption_of_network_traffic.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could gain access to the keys used for encrypting network traffic (e.g., IPsec keys, WireGuard private keys).
*   **How:** By exploiting vulnerabilities in key storage mechanisms, compromising nodes where keys are stored, or through insider threats.
**Impact:**  The attacker can decrypt network communication between pods, exposing sensitive data transmitted within the cluster.
**Affected Component:** `cilium-agent` (encryption module - IPsec or WireGuard).
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement secure key management practices, such as using dedicated key management systems or hardware security modules (HSMs).
*   Encrypt keys at rest.
*   Rotate encryption keys regularly.
*   Minimize the number of individuals with access to encryption keys.

## Threat: [Exploiting Implementation Flaws in Encryption Protocols](./threats/exploiting_implementation_flaws_in_encryption_protocols.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could leverage known vulnerabilities or implementation flaws in the IPsec or WireGuard protocols as implemented by Cilium.
*   **How:** By crafting specific network packets or exploiting weaknesses in the protocol handshake or encryption algorithms.
**Impact:**  Bypassing encryption, potentially leading to man-in-the-middle attacks or the ability to decrypt network traffic.
**Affected Component:** `cilium-agent` (encryption module - IPsec or WireGuard).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Cilium updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches addressing known protocol vulnerabilities.
*   Follow best practices for configuring IPsec or WireGuard, ensuring strong encryption algorithms and secure parameters are used.

## Threat: [Malicious eBPF Program Injection](./threats/malicious_ebpf_program_injection.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker who has gained sufficient privileges (e.g., root access on a node or compromised the Cilium control plane) could inject malicious eBPF programs.
*   **How:** By directly writing to eBPF maps or by manipulating Cilium's control plane to deploy custom eBPF programs.
**Impact:**  Interception and modification of network traffic, exfiltration of data, or even gaining persistent control over the node.
**Affected Component:** `cilium-agent` (eBPF program execution), `cilium-operator` (potential injection point).
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly control access to nodes and the Cilium control plane using strong authentication and authorization.
*   Implement integrity checks for Cilium's eBPF programs.
*   Monitor for unexpected eBPF programs being loaded or modified.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Cilium Agent or Operator](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_cilium_agent_or_operator.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could leverage known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the `cilium-agent`, `cilium-operator`, or other Cilium components.
*   **How:** By sending specially crafted network requests, manipulating API calls, or exploiting other attack vectors specific to the vulnerable component.
**Impact:**  Code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or privilege escalation within the Cilium infrastructure, potentially leading to wider cluster compromise.
**Affected Component:** `cilium-agent`, `cilium-operator`.
**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Cilium updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
*   Subscribe to Cilium security advisories and promptly apply recommended updates.
*   Implement network segmentation to limit the blast radius of a potential compromise.
*   Follow security best practices for deploying and managing Kubernetes applications.
