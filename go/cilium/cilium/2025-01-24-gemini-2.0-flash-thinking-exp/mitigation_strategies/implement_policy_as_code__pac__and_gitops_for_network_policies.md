        *   **Automated Rollback Triggers:**  Potentially integrate automated rollback triggers based on monitoring and alerting systems.
        *   **Staged Rollouts:**  Combine rollback with staged rollouts for safer policy updates.

#### 4.2. Threat Mitigation Assessment

The mitigation strategy effectively addresses the identified threats:

*   **Unauthorized Policy Changes (High Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **High**. Pull requests and peer review significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized changes. Git history provides a clear audit trail, making it easy to identify and investigate any unauthorized modifications. GitOps prevents direct manual changes in the cluster, enforcing the Git-centric workflow.
*   **Policy Drift (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **High**. GitOps deployment ensures that the deployed policies are always synchronized with the Git repository, eliminating policy drift. Any manual changes made directly in the cluster will be automatically overwritten by the GitOps tool, maintaining consistency.
*   **Lack of Auditability (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **High**. Git repository provides a complete and immutable audit trail of all policy changes, including who made the changes, when, and why (through commit messages and pull request discussions). This significantly improves auditability and simplifies incident response and compliance efforts.

#### 4.3. Impact Analysis

*   **Risk Reduction:**  As outlined above, the strategy provides **High Risk Reduction** for all identified threats.
*   **Security Posture Improvement:**  Significantly enhances security posture by enforcing a controlled and auditable process for managing network policies, reducing the attack surface and minimizing the risk of misconfigurations.
*   **Operational Efficiency Improvement:**  Automates policy deployment and rollback, reducing manual effort and improving operational efficiency. Consistency and reduced errors lead to less troubleshooting and faster incident resolution.
*   **Developer Workflow Improvement:**  Provides a clear and collaborative workflow for managing network policies, integrating seamlessly with modern development practices. Developers can use familiar Git workflows to propose and review policy changes.
