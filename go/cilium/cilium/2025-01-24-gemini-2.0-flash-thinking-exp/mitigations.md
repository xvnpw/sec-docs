*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Policy as Code (PaC) and GitOps for Network Policies
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Version Control:** Store all **Cilium Network Policy** definitions in a Git repository.
    2.  **Branching Strategy:** Implement a branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, develop, main) to manage **Cilium Network Policy** changes.
    3.  **Pull Requests:** Require pull requests for all **Cilium Network Policy** modifications, ensuring peer review before merging.
    4.  **Automated Validation:** Integrate automated **Cilium Network Policy** validation tools (e.g., linters, schema validators) into the CI/CD pipeline to catch errors early.
    5.  **GitOps Deployment:** Utilize a GitOps tool (e.g., Argo CD, Flux) to automatically synchronize **Cilium Network Policy** changes from the Git repository to the Cilium deployment.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Weak Encryption Algorithms (Medium Severity):**  Using outdated or weak encryption algorithms in **Cilium** can make encryption less effective and vulnerable to attacks.
    *   **Protocol Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Vulnerabilities in encryption protocols used by **Cilium** can be exploited to bypass encryption or compromise security.
    *   **Key Compromise (Medium Severity):**  While less likely with **Cilium's** automated key management for WireGuard, key compromise is always a potential risk, and regular review of **Cilium's encryption setup** can help mitigate it.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Weak Encryption Algorithms (Medium Risk Reduction):**  Regular reviews and updates ensure that strong and current encryption algorithms are used in **Cilium**.
    *   **Protocol Vulnerabilities (Medium Risk Reduction):**  Staying informed about protocol vulnerabilities and updating **Cilium's encryption configurations** helps mitigate risks.
    *   **Key Compromise (Low Risk Reduction):**  While key rotation is beneficial, the impact is lower in **Cilium WireGuard** scenarios where key management is largely automated. Regular review of **Cilium's encryption** still provides a layer of assurance.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No formal process for reviewing and updating **Cilium encryption configurations** is in place. Encryption is not currently enabled, so this is not yet relevant but will be important if encryption is implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establishment of a scheduled review process for **Cilium encryption configurations**. Definition of key rotation policies if applicable within **Cilium**. Documentation of current **Cilium encryption configurations** and review findings.
