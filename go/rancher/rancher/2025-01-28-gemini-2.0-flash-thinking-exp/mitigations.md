# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rancher/rancher

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Rancher UI and API Access](./mitigation_strategies/implement_multi-factor_authentication__mfa__for_rancher_ui_and_api_access.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Rancher Access
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Rancher-Compatible MFA Provider:** Select an MFA provider that Rancher supports (e.g., Google Authenticator, FreeRADIUS, Okta, AD FS, PingFederate, Keycloak, SAML, OIDC).
    2.  **Configure Authentication Provider in Rancher:**  Navigate to Rancher's Global Settings -> Authentication and configure your chosen MFA provider. This involves providing necessary connection details and credentials within Rancher's authentication settings.
    3.  **Enable MFA Enforcement in Rancher:** Within the configured authentication provider settings in Rancher, enable MFA enforcement. Rancher allows you to enforce MFA for all users or specific roles through its authentication provider integration.
    4.  **User Enrollment via Rancher UI:** Guide users to enroll in MFA through the Rancher UI during their login process. Rancher will redirect users to the MFA provider for enrollment based on the configured settings.
    5.  **Testing Rancher MFA:** Verify MFA functionality by attempting to log in to the Rancher UI and API. Rancher should now require the second factor authentication step after successful username/password authentication.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Rancher UI/API (High Severity):**  Compromised user credentials alone are insufficient for access to Rancher, requiring a second factor enforced by Rancher's authentication system.
    *   **Account Takeover of Rancher Users (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of attackers gaining control of Rancher user accounts, even if passwords are leaked, as Rancher enforces MFA.
*   **Impact:** **High Reduction** for both Unauthorized Rancher Access and Rancher Account Takeover threats. MFA, configured and enforced through Rancher, significantly increases security.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** MFA is not currently configured or enforced within Rancher for UI or API access. Rancher's authentication settings need to be configured to enable MFA using a compatible provider.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Rancher](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_role-based_access_control__rbac__in_rancher.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Rancher Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Rancher Global, Project, and Cluster Roles:** Audit the default and any custom roles defined within Rancher at the Global, Project, and Cluster levels. Understand the permissions granted by each Rancher role.
    2.  **Apply Least Privilege in Rancher RBAC:**  Within Rancher, assign users and groups the *least* privileged roles necessary for their tasks. Utilize Rancher's RBAC system to restrict access to Rancher features and managed Kubernetes clusters based on need-to-know.
    3.  **Define Custom Rancher Roles (If Needed):** If the default Rancher roles are not granular enough, create custom roles within Rancher to precisely control permissions for specific Rancher resources and actions.
    4.  **Assign Rancher Roles via Rancher UI/API:**  Assign roles to users and groups through the Rancher UI or Rancher API. Manage user access to Rancher and managed clusters directly within Rancher's user management system.
    5.  **Regularly Audit Rancher RBAC:**  Periodically review user role assignments within Rancher to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with the principle of least privilege. Use Rancher's audit logs to monitor RBAC related activities.
    6.  **Leverage Rancher Project and Cluster Scopes:** Utilize Rancher's Project and Cluster scopes to further refine RBAC. Ensure users are granted access only to the specific Projects and Clusters they require within Rancher.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Rancher and Managed Clusters (High Severity):** Prevents users with lower Rancher roles from gaining unauthorized administrative privileges within Rancher or the managed Kubernetes clusters controlled by Rancher.
    *   **Unauthorized Actions via Rancher (Medium Severity):** Limits the actions users can perform within Rancher and on managed clusters, preventing unintended or malicious configuration changes through Rancher.
    *   **Data Breaches via Rancher Access (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized access to cluster configurations and potentially sensitive data managed through Rancher by controlling access via Rancher RBAC.
*   **Impact:** **Medium to High Reduction** depending on the granularity and enforcement of Rancher RBAC. Rancher's RBAC is key to controlling access to the entire managed Kubernetes environment.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic Rancher RBAC is in place, but a detailed review and tightening of Rancher specific permissions are needed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A comprehensive audit of existing Rancher roles and assignments is required. Custom Rancher roles may be needed for more precise control within Rancher. Regular Rancher RBAC audits are not yet scheduled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Rancher Server and Agents](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_rancher_server_and_agents.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Rancher Update and Agent Management via Rancher UI/CLI
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Rancher Release Notes and Security Advisories:** Regularly check Rancher's official release notes and security advisories for announcements of new versions, security patches, and recommended upgrade paths.
    2.  **Utilize Rancher Upgrade Features:** Use Rancher's built-in upgrade features (available in the Rancher UI and CLI) to perform controlled upgrades of the Rancher server and managed cluster agents.
    3.  **Test Rancher Updates in Staging Rancher Environment:** Before applying updates to production Rancher, thoroughly test them in a staging Rancher environment that mirrors the production setup. This includes testing Rancher server upgrades and agent upgrades on representative managed clusters.
    4.  **Apply Rancher Updates Methodically via Rancher UI/CLI:** Follow Rancher's documented upgrade procedures, using the Rancher UI or CLI, to update the Rancher server and agents in a phased and controlled manner.
    5.  **Verify Rancher Update Success via Rancher UI:** After applying updates, use the Rancher UI to verify that the Rancher server and agents are running the expected versions and are functioning correctly. Check Rancher logs for any upgrade related errors.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Rancher Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Rancher updates include patches for known security vulnerabilities in the Rancher server and agents, preventing attackers from exploiting these Rancher-specific flaws.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Rancher (Medium Severity):** Some Rancher vulnerabilities could lead to DoS attacks against the Rancher management plane. Updates mitigate these Rancher-specific DoS risks.
    *   **Data Breaches via Rancher Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Vulnerabilities in Rancher components could potentially be exploited to gain unauthorized access to Rancher's configuration and managed cluster information. Rancher updates address these risks.
*   **Impact:** **High Reduction** for known Rancher vulnerability exploitation. Keeping Rancher updated is crucial for securing the Rancher management platform itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Rancher updates are applied, but not on a strict schedule and staging environment testing of Rancher updates is sometimes skipped.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formalize a Rancher update schedule and mandatory staging environment testing *specifically for Rancher updates* before production deployments. Utilize Rancher's upgrade features consistently.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Communication Between Rancher Server and Managed Clusters via Rancher Agents](./mitigation_strategies/secure_communication_between_rancher_server_and_managed_clusters_via_rancher_agents.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Secure Rancher Agent Communication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Ensure TLS Encryption for Rancher Agent Communication:** Verify that communication between the Rancher server and agents in managed clusters is always encrypted using TLS. Rancher agents are designed to communicate securely over TLS by default.
    2.  **Minimize Network Exposure of Managed Clusters to Rancher Server:**  Reduce the network accessibility of managed clusters to the Rancher server. If possible, use private networks or VPNs for communication between Rancher server and agents. Limit the ports exposed from managed clusters to the Rancher server to only those strictly necessary for Rancher agent communication.
    3.  **Network Segmentation for Rancher Management Network:** Consider isolating the network used for Rancher server and agent communication from other networks to limit the potential impact of a compromise in either the Rancher server or a managed cluster.
    4.  **Regularly Review Rancher Agent Configuration:** Periodically review the configuration of Rancher agents and the network setup to ensure that secure communication practices are maintained and that no unnecessary network exposure exists.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Rancher Management Traffic (High Severity):** TLS encryption for Rancher agent communication prevents eavesdropping and manipulation of management traffic between Rancher and managed clusters.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Managed Clusters via Rancher Agent Channel (Medium Severity):** Secure communication channels reduce the risk of attackers intercepting or hijacking Rancher agent communication to gain unauthorized access to managed clusters through the Rancher management plane.
    *   **Data Breaches via Intercepted Rancher Management Data (Medium Severity):** Encrypted Rancher agent communication protects sensitive management data (cluster configurations, secrets in transit) from being intercepted during transmission between Rancher and managed clusters.
*   **Impact:** **High Reduction** for MitM attacks and improved protection of Rancher management traffic. Secure Rancher agent communication is fundamental to Rancher security.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. TLS is used for Rancher agent communication, but network exposure of managed clusters to the Rancher server could be further minimized.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement stricter network segmentation for the Rancher management network. Review and minimize network ports exposed from managed clusters to the Rancher server specifically for Rancher agent communication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Rancher Cluster Templates and Profiles for Security Baselines](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_rancher_cluster_templates_and_profiles_for_security_baselines.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Rancher Cluster Templates and Profiles for Security Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Secure Cluster Templates in Rancher:** Create Rancher cluster templates that incorporate security best practices and desired security configurations for Kubernetes clusters. This includes settings for network policies, security contexts, RBAC defaults, and enabled security features.
    2.  **Utilize Rancher Cluster Profiles for Configuration Management:**  Employ Rancher cluster profiles to enforce consistent security configurations across all managed clusters. Profiles allow you to define and apply standardized security settings to clusters provisioned through Rancher.
    3.  **Version Control Rancher Templates and Profiles:**  Treat Rancher cluster templates and profiles as code and manage them under version control. This allows for tracking changes, auditing configurations, and rolling back to previous secure baselines if needed.
    4.  **Regularly Update Rancher Templates and Profiles:**  Periodically review and update Rancher cluster templates and profiles to incorporate new security best practices, address emerging threats, and align with evolving security policies.
    5.  **Enforce Template/Profile Usage in Rancher:**  Establish processes and policies to ensure that all new Kubernetes clusters provisioned through Rancher are created using approved and security-hardened Rancher cluster templates and profiles.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Security Misconfigurations in Rancher Managed Clusters (Medium to High Severity):** Rancher templates and profiles help prevent security misconfigurations by enforcing consistent and pre-defined security settings during cluster provisioning.
    *   **Configuration Drift in Security Settings (Medium Severity):** Profiles help maintain consistent security configurations across clusters over time, reducing configuration drift and ensuring a standardized security baseline.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium Severity):** Using templates and profiles can aid in meeting security compliance requirements by ensuring clusters are provisioned and configured according to defined security standards.
*   **Impact:** **Medium to High Reduction** in security misconfigurations and improved consistency of security posture across managed clusters. Rancher templates and profiles are powerful tools for security standardization.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No. Rancher cluster templates and profiles are not currently actively used to enforce security baselines during cluster provisioning.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Develop and implement Rancher cluster templates and profiles that incorporate desired security configurations. Establish a process for using these templates and profiles for all new cluster creation in Rancher. Implement version control and regular updates for templates and profiles.
