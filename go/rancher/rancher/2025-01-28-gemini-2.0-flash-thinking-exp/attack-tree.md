## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Rancher Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_rancher_exploitation.md)

This is the ultimate goal. Success means the attacker has compromised the application managed by Rancher, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Rancher Server [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_rancher_server__high-risk_path_.md)

Rancher Server is the central management plane. Compromising it grants the attacker broad control over all managed clusters and applications.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting software vulnerabilities in Rancher Server itself.
    *   Bypassing Rancher Server authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Rancher Server API.
    *   Exploiting misconfigurations in Rancher Server setup.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in Rancher Server dependencies.
    *   Social engineering Rancher administrators to gain access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Rancher Server Software Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_rancher_server_software_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This involves targeting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Rancher Server software.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Identify Known Rancher Server CVEs:** Searching public vulnerability databases for known CVEs affecting the installed Rancher Server version and exploiting them.
    *   Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities through security research, fuzzing, and penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authorization Bypass Vulnerabilities (RBAC) -> Attempt privilege escalation by exploiting RBAC misconfigurations [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authorization_bypass_vulnerabilities__rbac__-_attempt_privilege_escalation_by_exploiting_rba_af5c669e.md)

Rancher uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in RBAC can allow attackers to escalate their privileges and gain unauthorized access.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Identifying and exploiting weaknesses in Rancher's RBAC implementation.
    *   Exploiting misconfigurations in RBAC policies to gain higher privileges than intended.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rancher Server API Vulnerabilities -> Look for common API vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, broken auth, rate limiting bypass) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rancher_server_api_vulnerabilities_-_look_for_common_api_vulnerabilities__e_g___injection__b_c5a67a9f.md)

Rancher Server exposes an API for management. API vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or control.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting common API vulnerabilities such as injection flaws (SQL, command), broken authentication or authorization, rate limiting bypass, and others in Rancher API endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Rancher Server Configuration Errors [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_rancher_server_configuration_errors__high-risk_path_.md)

Misconfigurations in Rancher Server setup can create security loopholes.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Identify and exploit misconfigurations in Rancher Server setup:** Analyzing Rancher Server configuration files and settings to find and exploit insecure configurations.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Identify exposed management interfaces or services:** Discovering and exploiting accidentally exposed management interfaces or services of Rancher Server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rancher Server Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rancher_server_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

Rancher Server relies on various dependencies (libraries, containers, OS). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Identify vulnerabilities in Rancher Server's dependencies (libraries, containers, OS):** Analyzing Rancher Server's container images and dependencies to identify vulnerable components.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies:** Employing automated vulnerability scanning tools to detect vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit known vulnerabilities in identified dependencies:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in the identified vulnerable dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Social Engineering Rancher Administrators [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__social_engineering_rancher_administrators__high-risk_path_.md)

Targeting Rancher administrators through social engineering tactics to gain access to their credentials or Rancher Server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Phishing attacks targeting Rancher administrators:** Crafting phishing emails to trick administrators into revealing their credentials.
    *   Manipulating administrators through other social engineering techniques to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Managed Kubernetes Cluster via Rancher [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_managed_kubernetes_cluster_via_rancher__high-risk_path_.md)

Compromising the Kubernetes clusters managed by Rancher. This can be achieved through Rancher itself or by directly targeting the clusters if Rancher access is compromised.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in Rancher Agents running on managed clusters (though not marked as high-risk in this sub-tree, it's a related concern).
    *   Abusing Rancher's cluster management features.
    *   Exploiting Rancher's Kubernetes API access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Abuse Rancher's Cluster Management Features for Malicious Purposes [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__abuse_rancher's_cluster_management_features_for_malicious_purposes__high-risk_path_.md)

Leveraging Rancher's intended functionalities for malicious activities within managed clusters.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Leverage Rancher's features to deploy malicious workloads:** Using Rancher's UI or API to deploy containers containing malicious code into managed clusters.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Abuse Rancher's networking features to compromise cluster network:** Manipulating Rancher's network policy management to gain unauthorized network access within the cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Rancher's Kubernetes API Access [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_rancher's_kubernetes_api_access__high-risk_path_.md)

Rancher provides access to the underlying Kubernetes API. If Rancher access is compromised, this API access can be abused for full cluster control.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Leverage compromised Rancher access to directly interact with Kubernetes API:** Using Rancher-provided Kubernetes credentials to directly access and control the Kubernetes API, bypassing Rancher's management layer for direct cluster manipulation.
