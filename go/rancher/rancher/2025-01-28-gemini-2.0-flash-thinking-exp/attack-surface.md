# Attack Surface Analysis for rancher/rancher

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_api_access.md)

*   **Description:**  Rancher API endpoints are accessible without requiring authentication, allowing unauthorized users to interact with the Rancher Server and potentially managed clusters.
*   **Rancher Contribution:** Rancher's extensive REST API, if not properly secured, can expose sensitive functionalities and data without authentication checks. Misconfigurations in Rancher's authentication setup or vulnerabilities in API endpoint definitions can lead to this issue.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses a Rancher API endpoint intended for authenticated users, due to a misconfiguration or vulnerability, and is able to list all Kubernetes clusters managed by the Rancher instance, including sensitive configuration details.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (exposure of cluster configurations, secrets, user data), unauthorized cluster management, potential denial of service, complete compromise of managed infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Authentication Enforcement:** Ensure Rancher's authentication is correctly configured and enforced for *all* API endpoints. Regularly audit API access controls.
    *   **RBAC Implementation:** Implement and strictly enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Rancher to limit API access based on user roles and the principle of least privilege.
    *   **API Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the Rancher API authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Network Segmentation & Firewalling:**  Restrict network access to the Rancher API to authorized networks and users using firewalls and network segmentation.

## Attack Surface: [API Injection Vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Command Injection)](./attack_surfaces/api_injection_vulnerabilities__sql_injection__command_injection_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within Rancher API endpoints that allow attackers to inject malicious code through API parameters or request bodies. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the Rancher Server or unauthorized data access/modification.
*   **Rancher Contribution:** Rancher's API processes user inputs for various operations like cluster creation, user management, and resource configuration. Lack of proper input validation and sanitization in Rancher's API handlers can introduce injection points.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious API request to create a new user in Rancher, injecting SQL code into the username parameter. This injected SQL code is executed against Rancher's database, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication or gain administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, arbitrary code execution on the Rancher Server, complete compromise of the Rancher platform and potentially managed clusters.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices & Input Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data processed by Rancher API endpoints. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Regular Code Reviews & Security Training:** Conduct thorough code reviews focusing on input handling and injection vulnerabilities. Train developers on secure coding principles and common injection attack vectors.
    *   **Static & Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST/DAST):** Utilize SAST and DAST tools to automatically identify potential injection vulnerabilities in Rancher's codebase and running instances.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider deploying a WAF in front of the Rancher Server to detect and block common injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Rancher UI](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_rancher_ui.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Rancher web UI that allow attackers to inject malicious scripts. These scripts can execute in other users' browsers when they interact with the Rancher UI, leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or malicious actions performed on behalf of the victim user within Rancher.
*   **Rancher Contribution:** Rancher's dynamic web UI, if not carefully developed, can be susceptible to XSS if user-supplied or server-generated data is not properly encoded before being rendered in the browser.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a Kubernetes namespace annotation within Rancher. When an administrator views the namespace details in the Rancher UI, the script executes, stealing their Rancher session cookie and allowing the attacker to impersonate them and manage clusters.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, credential theft, account takeover, unauthorized cluster management, potential for further attacks on managed clusters via compromised Rancher accounts.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Output Encoding:** Implement robust and context-aware output encoding for all user-generated content and server-side data rendered in the Rancher UI. Use appropriate encoding libraries and frameworks.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Implementation:** Enforce a strict Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources, significantly reducing the impact of XSS attacks.
    *   **Regular UI Security Scanning:** Perform automated security scans of the Rancher UI using specialized tools to detect and remediate potential XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Awareness for UI Developers:** Train UI developers on XSS vulnerabilities, secure front-end development practices, and the importance of proper output encoding and CSP.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to induce the Rancher Server to make requests to attacker-controlled or unintended internal/external resources. This can be exploited to access internal services, cloud metadata, or perform port scanning from the Rancher Server's network context.
*   **Rancher Contribution:** Rancher Server interacts with managed clusters, cloud providers, external authentication systems, and other services. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in how Rancher handles URLs and makes outbound requests can create SSRF opportunities.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits an SSRF vulnerability in Rancher by manipulating a URL parameter in an API request. This forces the Rancher Server to make a request to the cloud provider's metadata endpoint, exposing sensitive credentials and configuration information to the attacker.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, exposure of sensitive data (cloud metadata, internal service data), potential for further attacks on internal networks or cloud infrastructure originating from the trusted Rancher Server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict URL Validation & Sanitization:** Implement rigorous validation and sanitization of all URLs and hostnames used by Rancher, especially those derived from user input or external sources.
    *   **Network Segmentation & Least Privilege Outbound Access:** Segment the Rancher Server network to limit its access to internal resources and restrict outbound connections to only necessary destinations. Use allowlists for outbound traffic.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary URL Schemes & Protocols:**  Restrict the URL schemes and protocols that Rancher Server is allowed to use for outbound requests to only those absolutely required.
    *   **Regular SSRF Vulnerability Scanning & Penetration Testing:** Regularly scan and test Rancher Server for SSRF vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual penetration testing techniques.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Agent-Server Communication (Man-in-the-Middle - MITM)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_agent-server_communication__man-in-the-middle_-_mitm_.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of proper encryption or certificate validation in the communication channel between Rancher Agents and the Rancher Server. This allows attackers to intercept, eavesdrop on, or modify communication, potentially compromising managed Kubernetes clusters.
*   **Rancher Contribution:** Rancher Agents communicate with the Rancher Server to manage Kubernetes clusters. If this communication is not secured with robust TLS and proper certificate verification, it becomes vulnerable to MITM attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker positioned on the network between a Rancher Agent and the Rancher Server intercepts their communication. Due to weak or missing TLS certificate validation, the attacker can impersonate the Rancher Server, sending malicious commands to the agent and gaining control over the managed Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of managed Kubernetes clusters, data interception, unauthorized cluster management, potential for denial of service across managed infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce TLS & Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Ensure all communication between Rancher Agents and the Rancher Server is encrypted using TLS. Implement mutual TLS authentication to verify the identity of both the agent and the server, preventing impersonation.
    *   **Robust Certificate Management:** Implement a strong certificate management system for Rancher Server and Agents. Use valid, trusted certificates, ensure regular rotation, and secure storage of private keys.
    *   **Network Security & Monitoring:** Secure the network infrastructure between Rancher Agents and the Rancher Server. Implement network monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious network activity.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Communication Channels:** Periodically audit the security configuration of the Rancher Agent-Server communication channels to ensure TLS and certificate validation are correctly implemented and enforced.

## Attack Surface: [Excessive Rancher Agent Permissions](./attack_surfaces/excessive_rancher_agent_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** Granting Rancher Agents overly broad or unnecessary permissions within managed Kubernetes clusters. If an agent is compromised, these excessive permissions can be exploited to cause significant damage within the managed cluster.
*   **Rancher Contribution:** Rancher's default configurations or misconfigurations by administrators can lead to Rancher Agents being granted overly permissive roles (e.g., `cluster-admin`) in managed Kubernetes clusters.
*   **Example:** A Rancher Agent is compromised due to a vulnerability on the underlying node. Because the agent has `cluster-admin` privileges, the attacker can now completely control the managed Kubernetes cluster, deploy malicious workloads, access all secrets, and potentially pivot to other systems within the cluster network.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of managed Kubernetes clusters, data breach within clusters, denial of service, privilege escalation within the cluster, potential for lateral movement to other systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Agents:** Grant Rancher Agents only the *minimum* necessary permissions required for their management functions within managed clusters. Avoid granting `cluster-admin` unless absolutely essential and justified.
    *   **Fine-grained RBAC for Agents:** Implement and carefully configure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies specifically for Rancher Agents to restrict their access to specific namespaces, resources, and verbs.
    *   **Regular Permission Reviews & Audits:** Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to Rancher Agents in managed clusters. Identify and remove any unnecessary or overly broad permissions.
    *   **Agent Node Security Hardening & Monitoring:** Harden the security of the nodes where Rancher Agents are deployed. Implement security monitoring and intrusion detection systems on agent nodes to detect and respond to potential compromises.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Rancher Dependencies Leading to Rancher Server Compromise](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_rancher_dependencies_leading_to_rancher_server_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities in third-party libraries, frameworks, or container images used by the Rancher Server that can be exploited to directly compromise the Rancher Server itself.
*   **Rancher Contribution:** Rancher Server relies on a complex software stack, including Go libraries and container images. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies, if exploitable in the Rancher Server context, can directly lead to Rancher Server compromise.
*   **Example:** A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability is discovered in a Go library used by the Rancher Server. If Rancher is using a vulnerable version, attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain arbitrary code execution on the Rancher Server, potentially leading to complete system takeover.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of Rancher Server, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, potential for widespread impact across all managed clusters controlled by the compromised Rancher Server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning & Vulnerability Management:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools to continuously monitor Rancher Server components and container images for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Proactive Patch Management & Upgrades:** Establish a robust patch management process to promptly update Rancher Server and its dependencies to the latest versions, including security patches. Prioritize security updates.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring & Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases relevant to Rancher's dependencies and Go ecosystem to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Security & SBOM Management:** Implement supply chain security best practices, including generating and managing Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for Rancher components to track dependencies and facilitate vulnerability management.
