This section provides a deep analysis of the attack vectors associated with compromising managed Kubernetes clusters via Rancher.

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities in Rancher Agents running on managed clusters

*   **Description:** Rancher Agents (rancher-agent) are deployed on each managed Kubernetes cluster to facilitate communication and management by the Rancher server. Vulnerabilities in these agents could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the managed cluster. Although marked as "not high-risk" in the sub-tree context, it's still a relevant attack vector for cluster compromise via Rancher.

*   **Potential Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**
    *   **Software vulnerabilities in rancher-agent:**  Bugs in the agent code itself (e.g., buffer overflows, injection vulnerabilities, insecure deserialization).
