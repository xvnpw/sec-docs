# BUSINESS POSTURE

Rancher is a multi-cluster management platform for Kubernetes. The primary business goal of Rancher is to simplify and centralize the management of Kubernetes clusters across diverse infrastructure environments, including on-premises datacenters, public clouds, and edge locations. This addresses the increasing complexity of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters and aims to provide a consistent and efficient operational experience.

Business priorities for Rancher include:
- Simplifying Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management (provisioning, upgrading, scaling, deletion).
- Providing centralized visibility and control over multiple Kubernetes clusters.
- Enabling consistent policy enforcement and security across clusters.
- Supporting hybrid and multi-cloud Kubernetes deployments.
- Empowering DevOps teams to manage Kubernetes infrastructure efficiently.

Key business risks associated with Rancher include:
- Security vulnerabilities in the platform could compromise managed Kubernetes clusters and workloads.
- Operational failures in Rancher could disrupt the management of critical Kubernetes infrastructure.
- Lack of adoption or user dissatisfaction could hinder the platform's business success.
- Integration challenges with diverse infrastructure environments and Kubernetes distributions.
- Competitive pressure from other Kubernetes management solutions.

    - requirement: RBAC should be consistently enforced across Rancher and managed Kubernetes clusters.
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege should be applied when assigning user permissions.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: All user inputs to Rancher UI and API must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, command injection).
    - requirement: Input validation should be performed on both client-side and server-side.
    - requirement: Sanitize user inputs before displaying them in the UI or using them in backend processes.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Sensitive data at rest (e.g., secrets, credentials) must be encrypted.
    - requirement: All communication channels involving sensitive data must be encrypted in transit (TLS/HTTPS).
    - requirement: Use strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Kubernetes cluster management: Ensuring the availability, security, and integrity of managed Kubernetes clusters is paramount. Disruption to cluster management can impact all workloads running on those clusters.
- Application deployment and lifecycle management: Rancher facilitates application deployment and management on Kubernetes. Protecting this process ensures applications can be reliably deployed and updated.
- Access control and authentication: Secure access to Rancher and managed clusters is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and malicious activities.
- Policy enforcement: Rancher's policy engine helps enforce security and compliance policies. Protecting this process ensures consistent security posture across managed environments.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Kubernetes cluster credentials (sensitive): Credentials to access managed Kubernetes clusters (kubeconfig files, API tokens). Compromise can lead to full cluster control.
- Rancher configuration data (sensitive): Rancher settings, user configurations, cluster configurations. Compromise can lead to misconfiguration or unauthorized access.
- User credentials (sensitive): Usernames and password hashes or tokens for Rancher access. Compromise can lead to unauthorized access to Rancher.
- Audit logs (sensitive): Logs containing user actions and system events. Sensitive for security monitoring and incident response.
- Monitoring and logging data (less sensitive but important): Metrics and logs from Rancher and managed clusters. Important for operational visibility and troubleshooting, can contain some sensitive information.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
