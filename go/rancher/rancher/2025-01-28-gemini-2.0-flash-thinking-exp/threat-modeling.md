*   **Threat:** Rancher Server Denial of Service (DoS)
*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Rancher Server with requests or exploits resource exhaustion vulnerabilities to make it unavailable. This could be achieved through volumetric attacks, application-layer attacks targeting specific API endpoints, or exploiting resource leaks within Rancher Server itself.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Inability to manage Kubernetes clusters. Operations teams cannot deploy, scale, or monitor applications. Incident response is hampered. Business disruption due to lack of cluster management.
*   **Affected Rancher Component:** Rancher Server Infrastructure (network layer, application layer)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on Rancher Server API endpoints.
    *   Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
    *   Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to absorb volumetric attacks.
    *   Configure resource limits and quotas for Rancher Server processes.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual traffic patterns and resource usage.

## Threat: [Compromised Rancher Agent](./threats/compromised_rancher_agent.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Rancher Agent
*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a Rancher agent running on a managed cluster node by exploiting vulnerabilities in the agent itself. Once compromised, the agent can be used as a foothold within the cluster and Rancher management plane.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Initial access to a managed Kubernetes cluster and potential access to Rancher management functions through the agent connection. Attackers can potentially escalate privileges within the cluster, move laterally to other nodes, exfiltrate data from workloads, or disrupt applications running in the cluster, and potentially manipulate Rancher managed resources.
*   **Affected Rancher Component:** Rancher Agent (agent process running on managed nodes)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Harden the operating system and infrastructure of nodes running Rancher agents.
    *   Implement strong node security practices (e.g., regular patching, security hardening).
    *   Segment networks to limit the impact of agent compromise.
    *   Monitor agent activity for suspicious behavior.
    *   Regularly update Rancher agent versions.

## Threat: [Insecure API Access](./threats/insecure_api_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure API Access
*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the Rancher API due to weak or missing authentication, or by bypassing authorization controls within Rancher. This could be through brute-forcing weak credentials, exploiting default credentials, or leveraging vulnerabilities in the Rancher authentication/authorization mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Unauthorized management of all Rancher resources and managed clusters. Attackers can create, modify, or delete clusters, deploy malicious workloads, access sensitive data managed by Rancher, and disrupt operations.
*   **Affected Rancher Component:** Rancher API (authentication and authorization modules)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong authentication for API access (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0, SAML/LDAP integration).
    *   Implement robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Rancher to restrict API access based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Regularly review and audit API access logs.
    *   Disable or restrict access to API endpoints that are not required.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities (e.g., Injection, Broken Authentication)](./threats/api_vulnerabilities__e_g___injection__broken_authentication_.md)

*   **Threat:** API Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within the Rancher API endpoints themselves. This could include injection flaws (SQL injection, command injection), broken authentication or authorization logic specific to Rancher API, or other common API security vulnerabilities present in Rancher's API implementation.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Depending on the vulnerability, attackers could gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, escalate privileges within Rancher, or cause denial of service. Impact can range from data breaches to complete system compromise of Rancher and managed clusters.
*   **Affected Rancher Component:** Rancher API Endpoints (specific API functions and handlers)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Rancher Configuration
*   **Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., credentials, API keys, private keys, Kubernetes cluster credentials) is stored directly within Rancher configurations, backups, or logs in an unencrypted or insecure manner. Attackers who gain access to these Rancher configurations or backups can extract the sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Exposure of sensitive credentials and secrets managed by Rancher. Attackers can use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to managed clusters, external systems integrated with Rancher, or other sensitive resources managed through Rancher.
*   **Affected Rancher Component:** Rancher Configuration Storage, Backup System, Logging
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to store and manage sensitive information used by Rancher and for managed clusters.
    *   Avoid storing secrets directly in Rancher configurations or code.
    *   Encrypt backups of Rancher data.
    *   Implement access controls for Rancher configuration files and backups.
    *   Redact sensitive information from Rancher logs where possible.

## Threat: [Malicious Rancher Images or Binaries](./threats/malicious_rancher_images_or_binaries.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Rancher Images or Binaries
*   **Description:** Attackers distribute compromised Rancher Server or agent images or binaries through unofficial or untrusted channels, or by compromising official distribution channels. Users unknowingly download and deploy these malicious Rancher components.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Immediate system compromise upon deployment of malicious Rancher components. Attackers gain full control of the Rancher environment and managed clusters.
