# Threat Model Analysis for rancher/rancher

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials for Rancher Admin User](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials_for_rancher_admin_user.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in to the Rancher UI or API using well-known default credentials (like 'admin/password') or easily guessable passwords if the initial administrator password was not changed. They could also use brute-force techniques.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Rancher platform, granting the attacker full control over all managed Kubernetes clusters. This could lead to data breaches, deployment of malicious workloads, service disruption, and the ability to pivot to other systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Rancher Authentication Service (specifically the local user authentication mechanism).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for the initial administrator account and all subsequent local users.
    *   Immediately change the default administrator password during initial setup.
    *   Consider disabling local authentication entirely and relying on more robust external authentication providers (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, SAML, OAuth).
    *   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.

## Threat: [Insufficiently Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./threats/insufficiently_granular_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could exploit overly permissive roles assigned to users or groups within Rancher. This allows them to access resources or perform actions beyond their intended scope, such as modifying cluster configurations, accessing sensitive secrets, or deploying malicious workloads.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential for malicious modifications to infrastructure, escalation of privileges within managed clusters, and potential data breaches or service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Rancher Authorization Service, Rancher API (specifically endpoints related to RBAC management).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege when assigning roles within Rancher.
    *   Regularly review and audit assigned roles and permissions.
    *   Utilize Rancher's built-in roles and create custom roles with specific permissions as needed.
    *   Avoid granting broad "cluster-admin" or "project-owner" roles unnecessarily.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated or Improperly Authenticated Access to Rancher API](./threats/unauthenticated_or_improperly_authenticated_access_to_rancher_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to access the Rancher API without proper authentication or by exploiting weaknesses in the authentication mechanisms. This could involve bypassing authentication checks or exploiting vulnerabilities in API key management.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to cluster configurations, deployment information, and other sensitive data managed by Rancher. Attackers could potentially manipulate the infrastructure, deploy malicious workloads, or exfiltrate data.
*   **Affected Component:** Rancher API Gateway, Rancher Authentication Middleware.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure all Rancher API endpoints require proper authentication.
    *   Enforce the use of strong API keys and rotate them regularly.
    *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the API to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.
    *   Securely store and manage API keys, avoiding embedding them directly in code or configuration files.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/api_vulnerabilities_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the Rancher API code, such as injection flaws or deserialization vulnerabilities, to execute arbitrary code on the Rancher server.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Rancher platform and potentially the underlying infrastructure. Attackers could gain full control of the server, access sensitive data, and pivot to other systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Various Rancher API endpoints and backend services.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure coding practices during Rancher development, including input validation, output encoding, and protection against common web application vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing of the Rancher API.
    *   Keep Rancher and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Secrets by Rancher](./threats/insecure_storage_of_secrets_by_rancher.md)

*   **Description:** Rancher stores secrets used for managing Kubernetes clusters and integrations. If this storage is not properly secured (e.g., lack of encryption at rest), attackers who gain access to the Rancher database or underlying storage could retrieve these sensitive credentials.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to compromise of managed Kubernetes clusters, cloud provider accounts, and other integrated systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Rancher Data Store (e.g., etcd, embedded database), Rancher Secrets Management module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that Rancher encrypts sensitive data at rest, including secrets stored in its database.
    *   Follow best practices for securing the underlying storage where Rancher data is persisted.
    *   Consider using external secret management solutions integrated with Rancher for enhanced security.

## Threat: [Rancher Agent Compromise on Managed Clusters](./threats/rancher_agent_compromise_on_managed_clusters.md)

*   **Description:** If the Rancher agent running on a managed Kubernetes cluster is compromised (e.g., through a vulnerability in the agent itself or by exploiting misconfigurations within Rancher's agent deployment mechanisms), attackers could gain control over the node where the agent is running and potentially the entire cluster.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the compromised Kubernetes cluster, allowing for data breaches, deployment of malicious workloads, service disruption, and lateral movement within the cluster.
*   **Affected Component:** Rancher Agent.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Rancher agent software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Secure the communication channels between the Rancher server and the agents (e.g., using mutual TLS).
    *   Harden the operating system and runtime environment of the nodes where the Rancher agent is running.
    *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a compromised agent.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Communication Between Rancher Server and Agents](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_communication_between_rancher_server_and_agents.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could intercept and potentially manipulate communication between the Rancher server and the agents running on managed clusters if the communication channels are not properly secured (e.g., lack of TLS encryption or improper certificate validation within Rancher's communication setup).
*   **Impact:** Ability to control or disrupt managed Kubernetes clusters by injecting malicious commands or intercepting sensitive information.
*   **Affected Component:** Rancher Agent, Rancher Server communication channels.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that communication between the Rancher server and agents is always encrypted using TLS.
    *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication and authorization between components.
    *   Properly configure and validate TLS certificates within Rancher's configuration.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Rancher's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_rancher's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Rancher relies on various third-party libraries and components. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the Rancher platform.
*   **Impact:** Potential compromise of the Rancher platform, depending on the severity and exploitability of the vulnerability. This could range from denial of service to remote code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** Various Rancher components that rely on vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly scan Rancher's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
    *   Keep Rancher and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Implement a process for promptly addressing identified vulnerabilities.
