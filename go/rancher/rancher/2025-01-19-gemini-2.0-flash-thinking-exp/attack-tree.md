## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Managed by Rancher](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_managed_by_rancher.md)

* The ultimate goal of the attacker. Success signifies a complete security breach, potentially leading to significant damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rancher Server Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rancher_server_vulnerabilities.md)

* Represents attacks targeting the central control plane. Successful exploitation grants broad control over managed clusters and applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Rancher CVEs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_rancher_cves.md)

* Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in Rancher software.
    * Mitigation: Implement a robust patching strategy and promptly apply security updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Underlying OS/Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_underlying_osdependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attackers target vulnerabilities in the operating system or libraries used by the Rancher server.
    * Mitigation: Keep the underlying OS and dependencies up-to-date with security patches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise External Authentication Provider (LDAP, AD, OIDC)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_external_authentication_provider__ldap__ad__oidc_.md)

* Attackers compromise the external system used for authenticating Rancher users.
    * Mitigation: Secure the integration with external authentication providers, enforce MFA, and monitor for suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Managed Cluster via Rancher](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_managed_cluster_via_rancher.md)

* Focuses on gaining control over the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure through Rancher. This allows direct manipulation of running applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rancher Agent Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rancher_agent_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attackers target vulnerabilities in the Rancher agents running on managed Kubernetes nodes.
    * Mitigation: Ensure Rancher agents are kept up-to-date and implement network segmentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Rancher API for Malicious Deployment](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_rancher_api_for_malicious_deployment.md)

* Attackers use the Rancher API to deploy malicious workloads or modify existing ones.
    * Mitigation: Implement strict authorization controls on the Rancher API and regularly audit API usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rancher's Access Control Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rancher's_access_control_mechanisms.md)

* Encompasses methods to bypass or abuse Rancher's authentication and authorization systems, granting unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Valid API Keys/Tokens through Social Engineering or Phishing](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_valid_api_keystokens_through_social_engineering_or_phishing.md)

* Attackers trick legitimate users into revealing their API keys or tokens.
    * Mitigation: Implement security awareness training, enforce MFA, and monitor for suspicious API key usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authorization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authorization_flaws.md)

* Attackers exploit weaknesses in Rancher's RBAC or authorization logic to gain access to resources they shouldn't.
    * Mitigation: Implement a well-defined and granular RBAC strategy and regularly audit role assignments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Compromised User Accounts](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_compromised_user_accounts.md)

* Attackers leverage legitimate user credentials obtained through various means to perform malicious actions.
    * Mitigation: Enforce strong password policies, MFA, and monitor user activity for anomalies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Workload Deployment Process via Rancher](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_workload_deployment_process_via_rancher.md)

* Targets the process of deploying and updating applications, allowing attackers to inject malicious code or configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Container Images](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_container_images.md)

* Attackers compromise the CI/CD pipeline or container registries to inject malicious code into container images used by Rancher.
    * Mitigation: Secure the CI/CD pipeline and container registries, implement image scanning, and use image signing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Deployment Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/modify_deployment_configurations.md)

* Attackers alter deployment configurations through Rancher to introduce vulnerabilities or malicious components.
    * Mitigation: Implement version control for deployment configurations and require approval workflows for changes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rancher's Catalog/App Management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rancher's_catalogapp_management.md)

* Attackers introduce malicious Helm charts or applications into catalogs used by Rancher.
    * Mitigation: Carefully vet and control the sources of Helm charts and applications and implement security scanning for catalog content.
