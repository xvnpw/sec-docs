# Attack Surface Analysis for rancher/rancher

## Attack Surface: [Rancher Server Compromise](./attack_surfaces/rancher_server_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Rancher Server instance.

**How Rancher Contributes:** Rancher acts as the central control plane, managing credentials and access to all downstream Kubernetes clusters. Compromising it provides a single point of control over the entire infrastructure.

**Example:** Exploiting an unpatched vulnerability in the Rancher Server application allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, leading to full control of the server.

**Impact:** Complete control over all managed Kubernetes clusters, including the ability to deploy malicious workloads, steal secrets, disrupt services, and potentially pivot to other internal networks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Rancher Server updated with the latest security patches.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for Rancher Server access (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
* Harden the underlying operating system and container runtime of the Rancher Server.
* Regularly audit Rancher Server access logs.
* Implement network segmentation to limit access to the Rancher Server.
* Secure the Rancher Server's data store (etcd or embedded database) with encryption and access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Rancher API Exposure and Abuse](./attack_surfaces/rancher_api_exposure_and_abuse.md)

**Description:**  The Rancher API is exposed without proper authentication or authorization, or vulnerabilities in the API allow for malicious actions.

**How Rancher Contributes:** Rancher provides a powerful API for managing clusters and workloads. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in this API can be directly exploited.

**Example:** An unauthenticated API endpoint allows an attacker to list all managed clusters and their configurations, potentially revealing sensitive information. Another example is an API vulnerability allowing arbitrary workload deployment.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to manage Kubernetes clusters, deploy malicious applications, retrieve secrets, and potentially disrupt services.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong authentication and authorization for all Rancher API requests.
* Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
* Regularly audit API access logs.
* Secure the API endpoint with network segmentation and access controls.
* Validate all input to the API to prevent injection attacks.
* Keep Rancher Server updated to patch API vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of Rancher Agents on Managed Clusters](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_rancher_agents_on_managed_clusters.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the Rancher agent running on a managed Kubernetes cluster node.

**How Rancher Contributes:** Rancher relies on agents deployed on managed clusters for communication and control. Compromising an agent can provide a foothold within the cluster.

**Example:** Exploiting a vulnerability in the Rancher agent software allows an attacker to execute commands on the underlying node, potentially leading to cluster-wide compromise.

**Impact:** Control over the compromised node, potential for lateral movement within the cluster, access to secrets and resources within the cluster.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Rancher agents updated to the latest security patches.
* Harden the underlying operating system and container runtime of the agent nodes.
* Implement network segmentation to isolate managed clusters.
* Monitor agent activity for suspicious behavior.
* Secure the communication channel between the Rancher Server and agents (e.g., using TLS).

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Credential Management by Rancher](./attack_surfaces/insecure_credential_management_by_rancher.md)

**Description:** Rancher manages sensitive credentials for accessing managed clusters, and vulnerabilities in how it stores or distributes these credentials can be exploited.

**How Rancher Contributes:** Rancher stores and manages kubeconfig files and other credentials necessary to interact with downstream clusters. Insecure handling of these secrets increases the attack surface.

**Example:** Rancher storing kubeconfig files in an unencrypted format or allowing unauthorized access to these files through the UI or API.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to managed Kubernetes clusters, allowing attackers to perform any action within those clusters.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Rancher encrypts sensitive credentials at rest and in transit.
* Implement strong access controls for accessing and managing cluster credentials within Rancher.
* Regularly rotate cluster credentials.
* Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly within Rancher configurations if possible; consider using external secret management solutions.

## Attack Surface: [Rancher UI Vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/rancher_ui_vulnerabilities__xss__csrf_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Rancher user interface allow attackers to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of authenticated users (XSS) or perform unauthorized actions on their behalf (CSRF).

**How Rancher Contributes:** Rancher's UI is a primary interface for managing the platform. Vulnerabilities here can be leveraged to compromise user accounts and potentially the entire Rancher environment.

**Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a Rancher page that, when viewed by an administrator, steals their session token. Another example is crafting a malicious link that, when clicked by an authenticated user, creates a new administrative user.

**Impact:** Account compromise, privilege escalation, unauthorized management actions, potential for further exploitation of the Rancher environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Rancher Server updated to patch UI vulnerabilities.
* Implement proper input sanitization and output encoding in the Rancher UI.
* Implement anti-CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
* Educate users about the risks of clicking on untrusted links.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of content the browser is allowed to load.
