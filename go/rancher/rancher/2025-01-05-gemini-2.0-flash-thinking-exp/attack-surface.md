# Attack Surface Analysis for rancher/rancher

## Attack Surface: [Rancher API Exposure](./attack_surfaces/rancher_api_exposure.md)

- **Description:** Unauthenticated or improperly authenticated access to the Rancher API allows attackers to manage clusters, deploy workloads, and access sensitive information.
- **How Rancher Contributes:** Rancher provides a comprehensive API for managing Kubernetes clusters. If not secured, this powerful interface becomes a primary attack vector. Rancher's central role in orchestrating clusters amplifies the impact of API compromise.
- **Example:** An attacker discovers an open or poorly secured Rancher API endpoint. They use this to deploy a malicious container that compromises nodes in a managed cluster.
- **Impact:** Full cluster compromise, data breaches, denial of service, unauthorized resource consumption.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Enforce strong authentication for all API access (e.g., API keys, bearer tokens).
    - Implement robust authorization mechanisms (RBAC) to restrict API access based on the principle of least privilege.
    - Secure the Rancher API endpoint with TLS/HTTPS and proper certificate management.
    - Implement API rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and denial of service.
    - Regularly audit API access logs for suspicious activity.
    - Restrict network access to the Rancher API to authorized sources.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Rancher Agents](./attack_surfaces/compromised_rancher_agents.md)

- **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the `rancher-agent` running on managed nodes allows attackers to gain control of the node and potentially the entire cluster.
- **How Rancher Contributes:** Rancher relies on the `rancher-agent` for managing and communicating with downstream clusters. A compromised agent provides a foothold into the managed environment.
- **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the `rancher-agent` to execute arbitrary code on a worker node. This allows them to access sensitive data or pivot to other nodes in the cluster.
- **Impact:** Node compromise, potential cluster compromise, data exfiltration, disruption of workloads.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep the `rancher-agent` updated to the latest version with security patches.
    - Secure the communication channel between the Rancher Server and the agents using TLS and mutual authentication.
    - Implement network segmentation to limit the blast radius of a compromised agent.
    - Regularly monitor the health and integrity of the `rancher-agent` on managed nodes.

## Attack Surface: [Rancher UI Vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/rancher_ui_vulnerabilities__xss__csrf_.md)

- **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Rancher UI allow attackers to execute malicious scripts in user browsers or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **How Rancher Contributes:** Rancher's web-based UI is a primary interface for users. Vulnerabilities in the UI can be exploited to target administrators and operators.
- **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a Rancher UI page. When an administrator visits this page, the script executes, potentially stealing their credentials or performing actions on their behalf.
- **Impact:** Account takeover, privilege escalation, unauthorized management actions, data manipulation.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement robust input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS attacks.
    - Implement anti-CSRF tokens to prevent CSRF attacks.
    - Regularly scan the Rancher UI for vulnerabilities using automated tools.
    - Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or attachments.
    - Enforce strong Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/weak_authentication_and_authorization.md)

- **Description:** Weak password policies, lack of multi-factor authentication, or improperly configured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) can allow unauthorized users to access and manage Rancher and its managed clusters.
- **How Rancher Contributes:** Rancher's authentication and authorization mechanisms control access to its features and the managed Kubernetes clusters. Weaknesses here can grant attackers significant control.
- **Example:** An attacker uses brute-force techniques to guess a weak password for a Rancher administrator account. They then use this access to manage clusters and deploy malicious workloads.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, cluster compromise, data breaches.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, expiration).
    - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Rancher users.
    - Implement and enforce granular RBAC policies based on the principle of least privilege.
    - Regularly review and audit user permissions and roles.
    - Integrate with secure and reputable identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, OIDC).
