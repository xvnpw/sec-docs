## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rancher Server Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rancher_server_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Rancher Server Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**

*   This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in the central Rancher server application. Success here grants significant control over the managed Kubernetes clusters.
*   **Exploit API Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**
    *   Attackers target vulnerabilities in the Rancher API, which is used for programmatic interaction with the platform.
    *   **Authentication Bypass (Critical Node):**
        *   Attackers aim to circumvent the authentication mechanisms of the Rancher API, gaining unauthorized access without valid credentials.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Node):**
        *   Attackers seek to exploit vulnerabilities that allow them to execute arbitrary code directly on the Rancher server, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Exploit Underlying OS/Infrastructure Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):**
    *   Attackers target vulnerabilities in the operating system, virtualization layer, or cloud infrastructure where the Rancher server is deployed. Compromising this layer can directly impact the Rancher server's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Rancher Agent/Node Communication](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_rancher_agentnode_communication.md)

**Compromise Rancher Agent/Node Communication (High-Risk Path):**

*   This path focuses on attacking the communication channel between the Rancher server and the Kubernetes nodes it manages.
*   **Agent Credential Theft/Compromise (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   Attackers attempt to steal or compromise the credentials used by Rancher agents to authenticate with the Rancher server. Successful compromise allows impersonation of agents and potential command execution on managed nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rancher's Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rancher's_authentication_and_authorization_mechanisms__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Rancher's Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**

*   This path targets weaknesses in how Rancher verifies user identities and controls access to resources.
*   **Exploiting Misconfigured RBAC in Rancher (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   Attackers exploit overly permissive or incorrectly assigned roles within Rancher's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. This allows them to gain unauthorized access to resources and perform actions beyond their intended privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Rancher's Cluster Management Features](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_rancher's_cluster_management_features.md)

**Manipulate Rancher's Cluster Management Features:**

*   **Modify Cluster Settings to Enable Malicious Activities (High-Risk Path):**
    *   Attackers aim to alter cluster-level configurations within Rancher to weaken security controls. This could involve enabling privileged containers, disabling network policies, or making other changes that facilitate further attacks on the managed workloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rancher's Workload Management Features **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rancher's_workload_management_features__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Rancher's Workload Management Features (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**

*   This path focuses on abusing Rancher's features for deploying and managing applications within the Kubernetes clusters.
*   **Inject Malicious Container Images (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   Attackers leverage Rancher's workload deployment capabilities to deploy container images that contain malware, vulnerabilities, or backdoors. This directly compromises the applications running within those containers.
*   **Modify Workload Deployments to Gain Access (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   Attackers attempt to modify existing workload deployments through Rancher. This could involve adding privileged containers, mounting sensitive host volumes, or altering other deployment settings to gain unauthorized access to the running application's environment or data.
