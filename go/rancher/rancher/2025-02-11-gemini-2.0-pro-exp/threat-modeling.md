# Threat Model Analysis for rancher/rancher

## Threat: [Unauthorized Rancher API Access via Leaked Credentials](./threats/unauthorized_rancher_api_access_via_leaked_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains valid Rancher API credentials (e.g., API keys, service account tokens, user passwords) through phishing, credential stuffing, social engineering, or by finding them exposed in code repositories, logs, or configuration files. The attacker then uses these credentials to directly interact with the Rancher API, bypassing the UI.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete control over Rancher and all managed clusters.
    *   Ability to deploy malicious workloads, delete existing workloads, modify configurations, and exfiltrate sensitive data.
    *   Potential for lateral movement to other systems if credentials are reused.
*   **Rancher Component Affected:**
    *   Rancher API server (`/v3`)
    *   Authentication and Authorization modules
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust secret management practices (e.g., using HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets, avoiding hardcoding credentials).
        *   Enforce short-lived API tokens and implement token revocation mechanisms.
        *   Design API endpoints with least privilege in mind.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all Rancher users.
        *   Use strong, unique passwords.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys and service account tokens.
        *   Store credentials securely (e.g., using a password manager).
        *   Be vigilant against phishing attacks.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Rancher RBAC](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_rancher_rbac.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with limited privileges within Rancher (e.g., a project member) exploits a vulnerability in Rancher's RBAC system or a misconfiguration (e.g., overly permissive role bindings) to gain higher privileges (e.g., cluster-admin or project-owner).  This could involve manipulating role bindings, exploiting bugs in permission checks, or leveraging default roles that are too permissive.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Ability to modify cluster configurations, deploy malicious workloads, delete resources, and access sensitive data within the scope of the escalated privileges.
    *   Potential for complete cluster compromise if cluster-admin privileges are obtained.
*   **Rancher Component Affected:**
    *   Rancher API server (`/v3`)
    *   RBAC authorization module (`authz`)
    *   User and Group management components
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Regularly audit and test the RBAC implementation for vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices to prevent privilege escalation bugs.
        *   Provide clear and concise documentation on RBAC best practices.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege (PoLP) â€“ grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   Regularly review and audit user roles and role bindings.
        *   Avoid using default roles unless absolutely necessary, and customize them to be less permissive.
        *   Use custom roles to define granular permissions.
        *   Monitor Rancher audit logs for suspicious RBAC changes.

## Threat: [Malicious Node Registration](./threats/malicious_node_registration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a server outside of Rancher's control and attempts to register it as a legitimate node within a Rancher-managed cluster.  The attacker might forge registration tokens or exploit vulnerabilities in the node registration process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   The attacker can inject malicious workloads into the cluster.
    *   Potential for data exfiltration from other workloads running on the compromised node.
    *   The attacker could use the compromised node as a stepping stone to attack other parts of the cluster or network.
*   **Rancher Component Affected:**
    *   Rancher Agent (running on managed nodes)
    *   Rancher Server's node registration API (`/v3/clusterregistrationtokens`, `/v3/nodes`)
    *   Cluster provisioning and management components
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for node registration (e.g., using mutually authenticated TLS with client certificates).
        *   Validate node attributes (e.g., hostname, IP address) during registration.
        *   Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force registration attempts.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Use secure node registration methods (e.g., pre-shared keys, certificates).
        *   Regularly audit the list of registered nodes and investigate any suspicious entries.
        *   Implement network segmentation to isolate the Rancher management plane from untrusted networks.
        *   Use Rancher's node templates and node pools to enforce consistent and secure configurations for new nodes.

## Threat: [Denial of Service against Rancher Server](./threats/denial_of_service_against_rancher_server.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Rancher server with a large number of requests (e.g., API calls, UI requests), overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and making it unavailable to legitimate users. This could also be caused by misconfigured or runaway workloads within managed clusters consuming excessive resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Inability to manage Rancher and managed clusters.
    *   Disruption of services relying on Rancher.
    *   Potential for data loss if Rancher server crashes.
*   **Rancher Component Affected:**
    *   Rancher API server (`/v3`)
    *   Rancher UI server
    *   Underlying infrastructure (e.g., etcd, load balancers)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement rate limiting for API requests.
        *   Optimize API performance to handle high load.
        *   Design Rancher for high availability (HA).
    *   **Users:**
        *   Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple Rancher server instances.
        *   Implement resource quotas and limits for Rancher users and projects.
        *   Monitor Rancher server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        *   Configure Rancher for HA to ensure redundancy.
        *   Implement appropriate network security controls (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems).

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data via Rancher UI or API](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_via_rancher_ui_or_api.md)

*   **Description:**  Due to misconfigured RBAC or a vulnerability in the Rancher UI or API, sensitive information (e.g., cluster credentials, service account tokens, environment variables) is exposed to unauthorized users.  This could occur if a user is granted access to a project or cluster they shouldn't have, or if an API endpoint inadvertently leaks sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise of Rancher-managed clusters.
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Potential for lateral movement to other systems.
*   **Rancher Component Affected:**
    *   Rancher API server (`/v3`)
    *   Rancher UI
    *   RBAC authorization module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Regularly audit API endpoints and UI components for potential information disclosure vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strict input validation and output encoding.
        *   Follow secure coding practices to prevent data leaks.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Implement strict RBAC policies to limit access to sensitive data.
        *   Use Kubernetes namespaces to isolate workloads and their associated secrets.
        *   Regularly review and audit user permissions.
        *   Avoid granting overly permissive roles.
        *   Use a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to store and manage sensitive data.

## Threat: [Tampering with Rancher Configuration via GitOps](./threats/tampering_with_rancher_configuration_via_gitops.md)

*   **Description:** If Rancher is configured to use GitOps for configuration management, an attacker could gain access to the Git repository and modify the configuration files. This could lead to the deployment of malicious workloads, changes to security settings, or other unauthorized modifications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Deployment of malicious workloads.
    *   Weakening of security posture.
    *   Disruption of services.
    *   Potential for complete cluster compromise.
*   **Rancher Component Affected:**
    *   Rancher's GitOps integration components (e.g., Fleet)
    *   Continuous Delivery module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for Git repositories.
        *   Use signed commits to ensure the integrity of configuration changes.
        *   Implement webhook validation to prevent unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Securely store Git repository credentials.
