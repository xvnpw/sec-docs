# Attack Surface Analysis for rancher/rancher

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Rancher Admin Credentials](./attack_surfaces/compromised_rancher_admin_credentials.md)

*Description:* An attacker gains full administrative access to the Rancher *server itself*.
*How Rancher Contributes:* Rancher's centralized management model makes its admin credentials the single most valuable target for an attacker seeking control over *all* managed resources. This is a *direct* consequence of Rancher's architecture.
*Example:* An attacker uses a brute-force attack against the Rancher UI, leveraging a weak admin password.
*Impact:* Complete control over all managed Kubernetes clusters and Rancher's configuration, enabling widespread damage and data theft.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Enforce strong, unique passwords and mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) for *all* Rancher logins, especially administrators.
    *   Integrate Rancher with a secure, centrally managed identity provider (IdP) and enforce strong authentication policies through the IdP.
    *   Regularly review and audit Rancher user accounts and permissions, removing inactive accounts and enforcing least privilege *within Rancher*.
    *   Implement robust monitoring and alerting for suspicious login attempts and account activity *on the Rancher server*.

## Attack Surface: [RBAC Misconfiguration (Rancher-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/rbac_misconfiguration__rancher-specific_.md)

*Description:* Overly permissive roles and bindings *within Rancher's own RBAC system*, granting users excessive access to Rancher's features and managed clusters. This is distinct from Kubernetes RBAC.
*How Rancher Contributes:* Rancher introduces *its own* layer of RBAC *on top of* Kubernetes RBAC. Misconfiguration *within Rancher's RBAC* is a direct attack vector against Rancher itself.
*Example:* A user is accidentally granted the `cluster-admin` role *in Rancher*, giving them full control over all clusters *through the Rancher UI and API*, even if their Kubernetes RBAC permissions are limited.
*Impact:* A compromised user account (even a non-admin) can have a significantly larger blast radius, potentially leading to cluster compromise or data breaches *via Rancher*.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege *within Rancher's RBAC system*.
    *   Regularly audit *Rancher's* RBAC configurations, using both automated tools and manual reviews. Focus specifically on Rancher roles and bindings.
    *   Use Rancher's project-level isolation features to limit the scope of user access *within Rancher*.
    *   Implement clear, documented RBAC policies and procedures *specific to Rancher*.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Rancher Server Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_rancher_server_dependencies.md)

*Description:* The Rancher *server software itself* relies on third-party libraries and container images, which may contain known vulnerabilities exploitable *directly on the Rancher server*.
*How Rancher Contributes:* This is inherent to Rancher's construction as a software application. The vulnerability exists *within the Rancher deployment*.
*Example:* A vulnerable version of a logging library used by the Rancher server is exploited, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code *on the Rancher server*.
*Impact:* Direct compromise of the Rancher server, leading to potential control over all managed clusters.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Regularly update *Rancher itself* to the latest stable release, which includes updated dependencies.
    *   Use a vulnerability scanner to scan *Rancher's container images* for known vulnerabilities *before* deployment.
    *   Implement a software bill of materials (SBOM) to track all dependencies *of Rancher*.
    *   Monitor security advisories specifically for *Rancher and its dependencies*.

## Attack Surface: [API Token Leakage/Misuse (Rancher API)](./attack_surfaces/api_token_leakagemisuse__rancher_api_.md)

*Description:* Rancher API tokens, used for programmatic access *to the Rancher API*, are leaked or used inappropriately.
*How Rancher Contributes:* Rancher's API is a core component, and API tokens are the direct means of authentication to that API. This is a *Rancher-specific* attack vector.
*Example:* A Rancher API token with cluster-admin privileges is accidentally exposed in a public forum, allowing an attacker to directly control clusters *via the Rancher API*.
*Impact:* An attacker with a valid Rancher API token can interact with the Rancher API *directly*, potentially modifying resources, deploying workloads, or exfiltrating data. The impact depends on the token's permissions *within Rancher*.
*Risk Severity:* High (depending on token permissions)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Treat Rancher API tokens as highly sensitive credentials. Never store them in source code or insecure locations.
    *   Use a secrets management solution to store and manage *Rancher API tokens*.
    *   Issue API tokens with the minimum necessary permissions *within Rancher*.
    *   Regularly rotate *Rancher API tokens*.
    *   Monitor *Rancher API* usage for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed etcd (Used by Rancher)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_etcd__used_by_rancher_.md)

*Description:* Direct, unauthorized network access to the etcd cluster *used by Rancher to store its configuration*.
*How Rancher Contributes:* Rancher *relies on* etcd for its operation.  Exposure of *Rancher's etcd* is a direct attack on Rancher's data store.
*Example:* An attacker gains network access to the etcd port (usually 2379) on the Rancher server nodes and can directly modify Rancher's configuration data *within etcd*.
*Impact:* Complete control over Rancher's configuration, effectively a full Rancher compromise. The attacker can manipulate *Rancher's data directly*.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Ensure that the etcd cluster used *by Rancher* is *not* exposed to the public internet or untrusted networks.
    *   Use strong authentication and authorization for etcd access *by Rancher*.
    *   Encrypt etcd data at rest and in transit *for Rancher's etcd cluster*.
    *   Implement network policies to restrict access to the etcd port to only authorized components (specifically, the Rancher server).
    *   Regularly audit etcd access logs *related to Rancher*.
