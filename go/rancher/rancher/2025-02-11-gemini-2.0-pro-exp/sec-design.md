Okay, let's create a design document for the Rancher project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Rancher is a complete software stack for teams adopting containers. It addresses the operational and security challenges of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across any infrastructure, while providing DevOps teams with integrated tools for running containerized workloads.  Given its role in managing Kubernetes clusters, which often host critical applications and data, the business posture leans towards high availability, security, and operational efficiency.  The target audience includes enterprises and organizations with significant reliance on containerized workloads, suggesting a lower risk appetite than a very early-stage startup.

Business Priorities:

*   Enable organizations to run Kubernetes everywhere.
*   Provide centralized management and visibility for multiple Kubernetes clusters.
*   Simplify Kubernetes operations and reduce the operational burden on teams.
*   Ensure the security and compliance of Kubernetes deployments.
*   Offer a consistent user experience across different Kubernetes distributions and infrastructure providers.

Business Goals:

*   Increase adoption of Rancher as a leading Kubernetes management platform.
*   Maintain high customer satisfaction and retention.
*   Expand the ecosystem of integrations and supported technologies.
*   Drive innovation in the Kubernetes management space.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security breaches that compromise customer Kubernetes clusters or data.
*   Service downtime or performance degradation that impacts customer applications.
*   Inability to keep pace with the rapidly evolving Kubernetes ecosystem.
*   Loss of customer trust due to security or operational failures.
*   Competition from other Kubernetes management solutions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Rancher implements RBAC to control user access to resources within the platform and managed clusters. Described in Rancher documentation and implemented in the codebase.
*   security control: Authentication: Rancher supports various authentication providers, including local authentication, Active Directory, LDAP, and SAML. Described in Rancher documentation and implemented in the codebase.
*   security control: Pod Security Policies (PSPs) / Pod Security Admission (PSA): Rancher allows administrators to define and enforce PSPs/PSA to control the security context of pods running in managed clusters. Described in Rancher documentation and implemented as Kubernetes configurations.
*   security control: Network Policies: Rancher supports the configuration of Kubernetes Network Policies to control network traffic between pods and namespaces. Described in Rancher documentation and implemented as Kubernetes configurations.
*   security control: Encryption in Transit: Rancher uses TLS to encrypt communication between its components and with managed clusters. Described in Rancher documentation and implemented using standard TLS libraries.
*   security control: Audit Logging: Rancher provides audit logs to track user activity and system events. Described in Rancher documentation and implemented in the codebase.
*   security control: Regular Security Updates: The Rancher team releases regular security updates and patches to address vulnerabilities. Described in Rancher release notes and security advisories.
*   security control: Hardened Base Images: Rancher uses hardened base images for its components to minimize the attack surface. Described in Rancher build process.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Components: Rancher relies on various third-party components, such as Kubernetes, etcd, and various container runtimes. Vulnerabilities in these components could impact Rancher's security.
*   accepted risk: Complexity of Kubernetes Security: Kubernetes itself is a complex system, and misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in Kubernetes could impact Rancher's security.
*   accepted risk: User Misconfiguration: Rancher provides extensive configuration options, and users could inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities through misconfiguration.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing of the Rancher platform.
*   Provide enhanced security hardening guides and best practices for deploying and operating Rancher.
*   Offer integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems for centralized security monitoring.
*   Implement a robust secrets management solution for storing and managing sensitive credentials.
*   Introduce supply chain security measures to verify the integrity of Rancher components and dependencies.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Integration with enterprise identity providers (IdPs).
    *   Secure password management policies.
    *   Session management with appropriate timeouts.

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained RBAC with least privilege principles.
    *   Support for attribute-based access control (ABAC).
    *   Regular review and auditing of user permissions.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection).
    *   Sanitize user inputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   Implement appropriate error handling to avoid information disclosure.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Securely manage cryptographic keys.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    *   Regularly review and update cryptographic configurations.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer("Developer") --> GitRepository("Git Repository (GitHub)")
    GitRepository --> CIEnvironment("CI Environment (GitHub Actions/Jenkins)")
    CIEnvironment --> BuildTools("Build Tools (Make, Docker)")
    BuildTools --> SASTScanner("SAST Scanner (e.g., SonarQube)")

    SASTScanner --> CIEnvironment
    DependencyCheck --> CIEnvironment
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  The CI environment (GitHub Actions or Jenkins) is triggered by code changes.
3.  Build tools (Make, Docker) are used to compile the code and build container images.
4.  SAST scanners (e.g., SonarQube) are run to analyze the code for security vulnerabilities.
5.  Dependency checks (e.g., Dependabot) are performed to identify vulnerable dependencies.
6.  If all checks pass, the container images are pushed to a container registry (Docker Hub, Quay.io).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code Review: All code changes are reviewed by other developers before being merged.
*   security control: SAST Scanning: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is performed to identify vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Dependency Scanning: Dependencies are scanned for known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Build Automation: The build process is automated to ensure consistency and repeatability.
*   security control: Signed Commits: Developers are encouraged to sign their commits to ensure authenticity.
*   security control: Container Image Signing: Container images can be signed to ensure their integrity.
