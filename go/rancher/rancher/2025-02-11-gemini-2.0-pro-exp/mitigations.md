# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rancher/rancher

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege (Rancher-Specific RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege__rancher-specific_rbac_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege within Rancher's RBAC system.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Roles:** Analyze all user and service account activities *within the Rancher UI and API*. Identify the *minimum* set of Rancher-specific permissions required for each role.
    2.  **Custom Rancher Roles:** Create custom Global Roles, Cluster Roles, and Project Roles in Rancher.  *Do not* rely solely on built-in roles. Start with the built-in templates as a *base*, but modify them to be *more restrictive*.
    3.  **Granular Rancher Permissions:** Within each role, grant permissions at the most granular level possible *within Rancher's context*. For example, restrict access to specific clusters, projects, or Rancher features (e.g., catalogs, multi-cluster apps).
    4.  **Regular Audits:** At least quarterly, review all Rancher roles and user/group assignments *within the Rancher UI*. Remove any unnecessary permissions. Document the rationale for each permission granted.
    5.  **Avoid `admin`:** Never use the default Rancher `admin` user for routine tasks. Create a dedicated administrator account with a strong, unique password and MFA, used only for exceptional circumstances.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Rancher UI/API) (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of users gaining access to Rancher features and managed resources they shouldn't have.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (within Rancher) (Severity: High):** Limits the ability of a compromised Rancher user account to gain higher-level Rancher privileges.
    *   **Insider Threats (Rancher-Specific) (Severity: Medium-High):** Mitigates the damage a malicious or negligent insider can cause *within the Rancher management plane*.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Rancher RBAC) (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the impact of accidental misconfigurations that grant excessive Rancher permissions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Rancher UI/API):** Significantly reduces the attack surface of the Rancher management plane.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (within Rancher):** Makes it much harder for attackers to gain control of Rancher itself.
    *   **Insider Threats (Rancher-Specific):** Limits the potential damage from malicious or accidental actions within Rancher.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Rancher RBAC):** Minimizes the blast radius of mistakes in Rancher's RBAC configuration.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Custom Cluster and Project Roles are defined for specific teams.
    *   Global Roles are limited to a small number of administrators.
    *   Regular audits are *not* consistently performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized, documented process for regular role audits (at least quarterly), specifically focusing on Rancher permissions.
    *   Granular permission refinement within existing custom roles (moving towards even more restrictive Rancher permissions).

## Mitigation Strategy: [External Authentication Provider Integration (Rancher-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/external_authentication_provider_integration__rancher-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Securely integrate and manage external authentication providers *within Rancher*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secure Communication:** Ensure all communication between Rancher and the external provider uses secure protocols. Validate certificates.
    2.  **Precise Group Mapping (Rancher Roles):** Map external groups to *Rancher roles* with *extreme care*. Avoid overly broad mappings. Use specific, narrowly defined groups, and map them to the *least privileged* Rancher roles necessary.
    3.  **Regular Mapping Review (Rancher UI):** At least quarterly, review and update the group-to-Rancher-role mappings *within the Rancher UI*. Ensure mappings reflect current organizational structure and user responsibilities. Remove stale mappings.
    4.  **Monitoring (Rancher Logs):** Monitor Rancher's logs for authentication events related to the external provider.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised External Credentials (Impacting Rancher) (Severity: High):** Reduces the impact of stolen credentials from the external provider on Rancher access.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (to Rancher) (Severity: High):** Limits access to Rancher based on properly configured external group memberships *and their mapping to Rancher roles*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised External Credentials (Impacting Rancher):** Precise group mapping to Rancher roles significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (to Rancher):** Limits access to authorized users based on external group membership and appropriate Rancher role assignments.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Integration with Active Directory using LDAPS.
    *   Basic group mapping to Rancher roles.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized, documented process for regular review of group-to-Rancher-role mappings *within Rancher*.
    *   More granular group mappings (using more specific AD groups and mapping them to more restrictive Rancher roles).

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Key Management (Rancher API)](./mitigation_strategies/api_key_management__rancher_api_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement strict controls over Rancher API keys.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Limited Scope (Rancher Context):** When creating Rancher API keys, assign the *narrowest possible scope* (Global, Cluster, or Project) and the *minimum required Rancher permissions*.
    2.  **Short Lifespan:** Set short expiration times for Rancher API keys. Rotate keys regularly.
    3.  **Secure Storage:** *Never* store Rancher API keys in source code, configuration files, or environment variables directly. Use a secrets management solution.
    4.  **Usage Monitoring (Rancher Audit Logs):** Monitor Rancher API key usage for suspicious activity *using Rancher's audit logs*. Look for unusual patterns, access from unexpected locations, or excessive API calls.
    5.  **Revocation (Rancher UI):** Immediately revoke any Rancher API keys that are suspected of being compromised *via the Rancher UI*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Rancher API Keys (Severity: High):** Reduces the impact of stolen or leaked Rancher API keys.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (via Rancher API) (Severity: High):** Limits access to Rancher resources based on API key permissions.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (via Rancher API) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from using compromised keys to gain higher-level access *within Rancher*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Rancher API Keys:** Short lifespans and secure storage significantly reduce the risk.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (via Rancher API):** Limited scope and permissions minimize the potential damage.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (via Rancher API):** Makes it harder for attackers to escalate privileges within Rancher.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Rancher API keys are used for some external integrations.
    *   No consistent policy for key rotation or lifespan.
    *   API keys are stored in environment variables in some cases (insecure).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized policy for Rancher API key creation, scope, lifespan, and rotation.
    *   Consistent use of a secrets management solution for storing Rancher API keys.
    *   Implementation of Rancher API key usage monitoring *via Rancher's audit logs*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audit Logging for Rancher Actions](./mitigation_strategies/audit_logging_for_rancher_actions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable, collect, and analyze *Rancher's* audit logs.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Rancher Audit Logging:** Ensure Rancher's *own* audit logging is enabled. Configure the audit log level appropriately.
    2.  **Centralized Collection:** Collect *Rancher's* audit logs to a central location.
    3.  **Regular Review (Rancher-Specific Events):** Regularly review the audit logs, focusing on *Rancher-specific actions* (user logins, role changes, cluster creation, etc.).
    4.  **SIEM Integration (Rancher Logs):** Integrate *Rancher's* audit logs with a SIEM system.
    5.  **Alerting (Rancher Events):** Configure alerts for specific *Rancher-related* events.
    6.  **Retention Policy (Rancher Logs):** Define a retention policy for *Rancher's* audit logs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (to Rancher) (Severity: High):** Provides evidence of unauthorized access attempts to the Rancher UI or API.
    *   **Insider Threats (Rancher-Specific) (Severity: Medium-High):** Helps detect and investigate malicious or negligent actions by insiders *within the Rancher management plane*.
    *   **Configuration Changes (Rancher Settings) (Severity: Medium):** Tracks changes to Rancher's configuration, allowing for identification of unauthorized or accidental modifications *to Rancher itself*.
    *   **Security Incidents (Involving Rancher) (Severity: High):** Provides crucial information for investigating and responding to security incidents that involve the Rancher server or its management functions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (to Rancher):** Enables detection and investigation of unauthorized access to Rancher.
    *   **Insider Threats (Rancher-Specific):** Provides an audit trail for insider actions within Rancher.
    *   **Configuration Changes (Rancher Settings):** Allows for tracking and auditing of configuration changes to Rancher.
    *   **Security Incidents (Involving Rancher):** Facilitates incident response and forensic analysis related to Rancher.

*   **Currently Implemented:**

    *   Defined retention policy for *Rancher's* audit logs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restricted Cluster Template Enforcement (Rancher Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/restricted_cluster_template_enforcement__rancher_feature_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Use Rancher's Cluster Templates to enforce secure cluster configurations.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Secure Defaults (Rancher Templates):** Create Cluster Templates *within Rancher* that define secure default settings for all new clusters.
    2.  **Mandatory Settings (Rancher Templates):** Make critical security settings *mandatory* within the Rancher templates, preventing users from overriding them.  This includes settings that Rancher *can* enforce, such as:
        *   **Rancher-managed Network Policies:** Define default network policies to isolate workloads *using Rancher's project/namespace constructs*.
        *   **RKE Configuration Options:** Specify secure settings for RKE-provisioned clusters (e.g., etcd encryption, API server flags).
        *   **Node Template Settings:** Define secure configurations for nodes managed by Rancher.
        *   **Allowed Registries:** Restrict image pulls to trusted registries *through Rancher's settings*.
    3.  **Regular Review (Rancher Templates):** Regularly review and update the Cluster Templates *within Rancher*.
    4.  **Enforcement (Rancher UI/API):** Enforce the use of Cluster Templates for all new cluster creation *through Rancher's UI and API*. Prevent users from creating clusters outside of the defined templates.
    5.  **Version Control (Rancher Templates):** Store Cluster Templates in a version control system.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**

    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation (in Rancher-Provisioned Clusters) (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in misconfigured clusters *created through Rancher*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Insecure Cluster Configurations (via Rancher):** Eliminates the risk of creating clusters with known security weaknesses *using Rancher*.
    *   **Configuration Drift (Managed by Rancher):** Maintains consistency and reduces operational complexity *for Rancher-managed resources*.
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation (in Rancher-Provisioned Clusters):** Significantly reduces the attack surface of newly provisioned clusters *created through Rancher*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Cluster Templates are defined.
    *   Not all security-relevant settings are mandatory.
    *   Templates are not consistently enforced.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Making all critical security settings *mandatory* within the Rancher templates.
    *   Strict enforcement of template usage for all new cluster creation *within Rancher*.
    *   Regular review and updates to the templates based on security best practices, *specifically focusing on Rancher-configurable options*.
    *   Version control for Rancher Cluster Templates.
