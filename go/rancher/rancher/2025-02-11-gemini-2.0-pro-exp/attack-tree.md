## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Rancher Server [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_rancher_server__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical attack vector.  Gaining control of the Rancher server grants the attacker full control over the entire Rancher environment, including all managed Kubernetes clusters, workloads, and data.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **1.1 Exploit Rancher Server Vulnerabilities**
        *   **1.1.1 Exploit Known CVEs (Unpatched System) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   *Description:* Attackers actively scan for and exploit known, unpatched vulnerabilities in software.  Rancher, like any software, is susceptible to CVEs.  If the Rancher server is not promptly patched, it becomes an easy target.
            *   *Likelihood:* High (if unpatched)
            *   *Impact:* Very High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
            *   *Mitigation:* Implement a robust and *automated* patching process for Rancher Server.  Monitor for new CVEs *proactively*.
        *   **1.1.2 Exploit Misconfigured Authentication/Authorization**
            *   **1.1.2.1 Weak/Default Rancher Admin Credentials [HIGH RISK]**
                *   *Description:* Using weak, easily guessable, or default passwords for Rancher administrator accounts is a common and extremely dangerous vulnerability.
                *   *Likelihood:* Medium
                *   *Impact:* Very High
                *   *Effort:* Very Low
                *   *Skill Level:* Novice
                *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy (with login attempt monitoring)
                *   *Mitigation:* Enforce strong, unique passwords.  Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Regularly audit user accounts.
    *   **1.3 Social Engineering/Phishing**
        *   **1.3.1 Target Rancher Administrators [HIGH RISK]**
            *   *Description:* Attackers use phishing emails, malicious websites, or other social engineering techniques to trick Rancher administrators into revealing their credentials or installing malware.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* Very High
            *   *Effort:* Low/Medium
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (user awareness training helps)
            *   *Mitigation:* User awareness training.  Implement email security gateways.  Use MFA.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Rancher Agent (on Managed Nodes) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_rancher_agent__on_managed_nodes___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  The Rancher Agent runs on each node managed by Rancher.  Compromising an agent gives the attacker control over that node, allowing them to access resources, potentially escalate privileges, and move laterally within the cluster.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **2.1 Exploit Rancher Agent Vulnerabilities**
        *   **2.1.1 Exploit Known CVEs (Unpatched Agent) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   *Description:* Similar to the Rancher server, the Rancher Agent can have vulnerabilities.  Unpatched agents are easy targets.
            *   *Likelihood:* High (if unpatched)
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
            *   *Mitigation:* Implement a robust and *automated* patching process for Rancher Agents.
    *   **2.2 Compromise Node Hosting Rancher Agent**
        *   **2.2.2 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Host OS [HIGH RISK]**
            *   *Description:* If the underlying operating system of the node running the Rancher Agent is vulnerable, the attacker can compromise the node and, consequently, the agent.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium (if unpatched)
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Medium
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate/Advanced
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
            *   *Mitigation:* Keep the host OS patched and hardened.  Use a minimal OS image.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Abuse Rancher Features/Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/3__abuse_rancher_featuresconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Even without directly compromising the Rancher server or agent, an attacker with some level of access (e.g., compromised user credentials, misconfigured RBAC) can abuse Rancher's features to achieve malicious goals.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **3.1 Deploy Malicious Workloads**
        *   **3.1.1 Use Compromised Rancher Credentials to Deploy Malicious Pods [HIGH RISK]**
            *   *Description:* If an attacker gains access to Rancher credentials (through phishing, credential stuffing, etc.), they can use the Rancher UI or API to deploy malicious containers or pods.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium (if credentials compromised)
            *   *Impact:* High/Very High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (with workload monitoring)
            *   *Mitigation:* Strong authentication (MFA), least privilege access, workload monitoring.
        *   **3.1.2 Exploit Misconfigured Kubernetes RBAC [HIGH RISK]**
            *   *Description:* Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) governs what actions users and service accounts can perform within a cluster.  Misconfigured RBAC (e.g., overly permissive roles) can allow an attacker to gain excessive privileges.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium (common misconfiguration)
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low/Medium
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
            *   *Mitigation:* Implement and strictly enforce Kubernetes RBAC policies.  Follow the principle of least privilege.  Regularly audit RBAC configurations.
