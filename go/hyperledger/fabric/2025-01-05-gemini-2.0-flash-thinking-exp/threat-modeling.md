# Threat Model Analysis for hyperledger/fabric

## Threat: [Compromised Member Identity](./threats/compromised_member_identity.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains the private key or certificate of a legitimate member. This could happen through various means, and the attacker can then leverage the Fabric client SDK or directly interact with peer nodes to impersonate the member.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions on the blockchain, potential financial loss, data breaches, reputational damage, and disruption of network operations.

**Affected Component:**
*   `fabric-ca` (for initial identity enrollment)
*   Peer nodes (during transaction submission and validation)
*   Client SDK (used by the attacker to interact with the network)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong key management practices, including secure key generation, storage (e.g., using hardware security modules - HSMs), and rotation.
*   Educate members about phishing and social engineering attacks.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible for accessing key material.
*   Regularly audit access controls and permissions within the Fabric network.
*   Implement certificate revocation mechanisms and monitor for suspicious activity on peer nodes.

## Threat: [Membership Service Provider (MSP) Configuration Vulnerabilities](./threats/membership_service_provider__msp__configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Incorrect or insecure configuration of the MSP definition within the Fabric network can allow unauthorized entities to join the network or gain elevated privileges. This involves manipulating Fabric configuration files and potentially interacting with `fabric-ca`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the network, potential for malicious actors to participate in consensus or endorse transactions they shouldn't, and compromise of network integrity.

**Affected Component:**
*   MSP configuration files (e.g., `configtx.yaml`, channel configuration)
*   `fabric-ca` (if used for managing identities within the organization)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and test MSP configurations before deploying changes to the Fabric network.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining organizational units and roles within the MSP.
*   Securely store and manage MSP configuration files, limiting access to authorized personnel.
*   Implement access controls to restrict who can modify MSP configurations within the Fabric network.
*   Regularly audit MSP configurations for any deviations from the intended setup.

## Threat: [Certificate Authority (CA) Compromise](./threats/certificate_authority__ca__compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the private key or infrastructure of the `fabric-ca` server. This allows the attacker to issue arbitrary certificates for unauthorized entities or revoke legitimate certificates, directly impacting the trust and operation of the Fabric network.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the network's identity framework, ability for attackers to impersonate any member, denial of service through certificate revocation, and loss of trust in the network.

**Affected Component:**
*   `fabric-ca` server and database
*   All Fabric components relying on certificates issued by the compromised CA (peers, orderers, clients)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong security measures for the `fabric-ca` infrastructure, including physical security, access controls, and regular security audits.
*   Use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the CA's private key.
*   Implement redundancy and disaster recovery plans for the `fabric-ca` service.
*   Regularly monitor `fabric-ca` logs for suspicious activity.
*   Consider using an offline root CA and an intermediate issuing CA for better security within the Fabric PKI.

## Threat: [Smart Contract (Chaincode) Logic Vulnerabilities](./threats/smart_contract__chaincode__logic_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws or bugs in the smart contract code deployed on the Hyperledger Fabric network can be exploited by malicious actors through transaction invocation. This directly interacts with the Fabric peer nodes where the chaincode is executed.

**Impact:** Data corruption on the ledger maintained by Fabric peers, unauthorized transfer of assets managed by the chaincode, denial of service by exhausting resources on peer nodes, and manipulation of application logic within the Fabric network.

**Affected Component:**
*   Chaincode (the deployed smart contract)
*   Peer nodes (where the chaincode is executed)
*   State database (where the chaincode data is stored on the peer)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Employ secure coding practices during chaincode development.
*   Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits of the chaincode before deployment on the Fabric network.
*   Utilize static analysis tools and fuzzing techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities in the chaincode.
*   Implement robust input validation and error handling within the chaincode logic.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining access controls within the chaincode using Fabric's endorsement policies.

## Threat: [Peer Node Compromise](./threats/peer_node_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of a Fabric peer node's operating system or the `peer` process itself. This allows direct access to the ledger data stored on the peer, the ability to manipulate transactions before endorsement (though consensus mitigates finality), and the potential to disrupt the peer's participation in the Fabric network.

**Impact:** Potential data breaches from the peer's ledger storage, manipulation of transactions before endorsement is finalized, denial of service by taking the peer offline, and exfiltration of sensitive information.

**Affected Component:**
*   Peer node software (`peer` binary)
*   Ledger storage on the peer
*   Gossip communication module within the peer

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Harden peer node operating systems and the environment where the `peer` process runs.
*   Implement strong access controls and authentication mechanisms for accessing peer nodes.
*   Regularly patch and update peer node software and dependencies provided by Hyperledger Fabric.
*   Monitor peer node logs for suspicious activity.
*   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems around peer node infrastructure.

## Threat: [Orderer Node Compromise](./threats/orderer_node_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of one or more Fabric orderer nodes or the `orderer` process. This is a critical vulnerability as orderers are responsible for the core function of ordering transactions into blocks within the Fabric network.

**Impact:** Network paralysis, transaction censorship by a malicious orderer, potential for manipulating the order of events recorded in the ledger, and complete loss of network availability if a sufficient number of orderers are compromised.

**Affected Component:**
*   Orderer node software (`orderer` binary)
*   Ordering service consensus mechanism (e.g., Raft) implemented within the Fabric orderer

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong security measures for orderer nodes, similar to peer nodes.
*   For production environments, use a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) ordering service like Raft with a sufficient number of orderers to tolerate failures and attacks as recommended by Hyperledger Fabric best practices.
*   Securely manage the cryptographic keys used by the orderers, potentially using HSMs.
*   Implement strict access controls to the orderer nodes.
*   Regularly monitor orderer logs and performance metrics for anomalies.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) on Peer or Orderer Nodes](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__on_peer_or_orderer_nodes.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods Fabric peer or orderer nodes with a large volume of requests or exploits vulnerabilities in the Fabric software to consume excessive resources, making the node unavailable to participate in the network.

**Impact:** Network downtime, inability to process transactions through the Fabric network, and disruption of business processes relying on the blockchain.

**Affected Component:**
*   Peer nodes
*   Orderer nodes
*   Network infrastructure supporting the Fabric components

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the impact on the business, can be critical for core infrastructure)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting and traffic filtering mechanisms at the network level.
*   Deploy firewalls and intrusion prevention systems to protect Fabric infrastructure.
*   Ensure sufficient resources are allocated to handle expected transaction loads on peer and orderer nodes.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual traffic patterns targeting Fabric components.

## Threat: [Data Leakage from Private Data Collections](./threats/data_leakage_from_private_data_collections.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data stored in Fabric's private data collections is inadvertently or maliciously exposed to unauthorized parties within the Fabric network. This could be due to misconfigured collection policies or vulnerabilities in the chaincode logic interacting with the private data features of Hyperledger Fabric.

**Impact:** Breach of confidential information intended to be private within the Fabric network, violation of privacy regulations, and potential legal repercussions.

**Affected Component:**
*   Private data collection definitions within channel configurations
*   Chaincode logic accessing private data using Fabric APIs
*   Peer nodes holding private data in separate databases

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design and implement access control policies for private data collections using Fabric's built-in mechanisms.
*   Minimize the amount of sensitive data stored directly on the blockchain, even within private data collections.
*   Encrypt private data at rest and in transit within the Fabric network.
*   Regularly audit access to private data collections and the chaincode logic that interacts with them.
*   Ensure chaincode logic accessing private data is thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities that could lead to unintended disclosure.
