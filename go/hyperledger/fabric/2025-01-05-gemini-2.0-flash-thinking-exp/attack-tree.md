## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Identity and Membership Service (MSP)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_identity_and_membership_service__msp_.md)

**Description:** Targeting the core identity and access management system of the Fabric network. Successful exploitation can grant attackers widespread unauthorized access.

**Likelihood:** Varies depending on specific attacks within this category.

**Impact:** Critical - Undermines the entire trust model of the network.

**Effort:** Ranges from Low to High depending on the specific attack.

**Skill Level:** Ranges from Beginner to Advanced depending on the specific attack.

**Detection Difficulty:** Ranges from Moderate to Very Difficult depending on the specific attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Certificate Authority (CA)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_certificate_authority__ca_.md)

**Description:** Gaining control over the entity responsible for issuing and managing digital certificates within the Fabric network.

**Likelihood:** Low to Medium depending on the specific attack.

**Impact:** Critical - Allows the attacker to forge identities, impersonate legitimate users, and disrupt the network.

**Effort:** Moderate to High.

**Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.

**Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CA Software Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ca_software_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the software running the Certificate Authority.

**Impact:** Issue Rogue Certificates, Revoke Valid Certificates

**Likelihood:** Low-Medium

**Impact:** Critical

**Effort:** Moderate-High

**Skill Level:** Intermediate-Advanced

**Detection Difficulty:** Moderate-Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering of CA Administrator](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_of_ca_administrator.md)

**Description:** Tricking or manipulating a CA administrator into revealing credentials or performing actions that compromise the CA.

**Impact:** Issue Rogue Certificates, Revoke Valid Certificates

**Likelihood:** Low-Medium

**Impact:** Critical

**Effort:** Low-Moderate

**Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate

**Detection Difficulty:** Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Private Keys of Authorized Identities](./attack_tree_paths/steal_private_keys_of_authorized_identities.md)

**Description:** Obtaining the private keys associated with legitimate users or nodes within the Fabric network.

**Impact:** Impersonate Valid Identities, Execute Unauthorized Transactions

**Likelihood:** Medium-High

**Impact:** Significant

**Effort:** Ranges from Low to High depending on the specific attack.

**Skill Level:** Ranges from Beginner to Advanced depending on the specific attack.

**Detection Difficulty:** Ranges from Moderate to Very Difficult depending on the specific attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise End-User Systems/Wallets](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_end-user_systemswallets.md)

**Description:** Gaining access to the systems or wallets where end-users store their private keys. This can be achieved through malware, phishing, or other common endpoint security attacks.

**Impact:** Impersonate Valid Identities, Execute Unauthorized Transactions

**Likelihood:** Medium-High

**Impact:** Significant

**Effort:** Low-Moderate

**Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate

**Detection Difficulty:** Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Smart Contract (Chaincode) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_smart_contract__chaincode__vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Identifying and exploiting weaknesses in the code of the smart contracts deployed on the Fabric network.

**Impact:** Manipulate Application State, Steal Assets, Disrupt Operations

**Likelihood:** Medium-High

**Impact:** Significant-Critical

**Effort:** Ranges from Low to Moderate.

**Skill Level:** Intermediate.

**Detection Difficulty:** Moderate.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logic Flaws in Chaincode](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logic_flaws_in_chaincode.md)

**Description:** Taking advantage of errors or oversights in the business logic implemented within the chaincode. This can involve incorrect access controls, flawed algorithms, or mishandling of data.

**Impact:** Manipulate Application State, Steal Assets, Disrupt Operations

**Likelihood:** Medium-High

**Impact:** Significant-Critical

**Effort:** Low-Moderate

**Skill Level:** Intermediate

**Detection Difficulty:** Moderate
