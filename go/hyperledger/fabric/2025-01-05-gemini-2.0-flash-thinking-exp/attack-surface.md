# Attack Surface Analysis for hyperledger/fabric

## Attack Surface: [Chaincode Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/chaincode_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Chaincode Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Flaws or bugs in the smart contract code (chaincode) that can be exploited by malicious actors.
    *   **How Fabric Contributes:** Fabric executes user-defined chaincode on peer nodes, making the security of this code critical to the overall network security. The isolated execution environment doesn't prevent logic errors within the code itself.
    *   **Example:** A chaincode function responsible for transferring assets has a logic error allowing a user to transfer more assets than they own (double-spending).
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, financial loss, violation of business logic, denial of service on specific channels or peers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the severity of the vulnerability and the value of the assets at risk).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure coding practices for chaincode development (input validation, error handling, etc.).
        *   Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits of chaincode by independent security experts.
        *   Utilize static analysis and vulnerability scanning tools on chaincode.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining chaincode permissions and access controls.
        *   Implement robust testing strategies, including unit, integration, and security testing.

## Attack Surface: [Certificate Authority (CA) Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/certificate_authority__ca__key_compromise.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Certificate Authority (CA) Key Compromise**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker gains access to the private keys of the Certificate Authority responsible for issuing identities within the Fabric network.
    *   **How Fabric Contributes:** Fabric relies heavily on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and the CA for identity management and authentication of network participants. Compromise of the CA undermines the entire trust model.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises the CA server and obtains the root CA private key. They can then issue valid certificates for malicious actors, allowing them to impersonate legitimate members or launch attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Complete breakdown of trust within the network, ability for attackers to impersonate any member, endorse malicious transactions, and potentially take control of the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store CA private keys using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).
        *   Implement strict access controls and multi-factor authentication for CA administrators.
        *   Regularly audit CA infrastructure and logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Implement key rotation policies for CA keys.
        *   Consider using a hierarchical CA structure to limit the impact of a single CA compromise.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Endorsement Policies](./attack_surfaces/weak_endorsement_policies.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Weak Endorsement Policies**
    *   **Description:**  The endorsement policies defined for chaincode are not sufficiently robust, allowing transactions to be validated and committed with insufficient agreement from trusted organizations.
    *   **How Fabric Contributes:** Fabric's endorsement policies control which organizations must endorse a transaction for it to be considered valid. Weak policies create opportunities for malicious actors to manipulate the ledger.
    *   **Example:** A chaincode for transferring high-value assets requires endorsement from only one organization. If that organization is compromised or colludes, they can unilaterally approve fraudulent transactions.
    *   **Impact:** Ledger manipulation, data integrity issues, potential for double-spending or unauthorized asset transfer.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design endorsement policies based on the criticality of the data and the trust relationships between organizations.
        *   Require endorsements from multiple independent organizations for sensitive transactions.
        *   Regularly review and update endorsement policies as the network evolves.
        *   Utilize more complex endorsement policies that consider roles and attributes of endorsers.

## Attack Surface: [Orderer Node Compromise](./attack_surfaces/orderer_node_compromise.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Orderer Node Compromise**
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access and control over one or more orderer nodes in the Fabric network.
    *   **How Fabric Contributes:** Orderers are responsible for ordering transactions into blocks and maintaining the shared ledger. Compromise of an orderer can severely disrupt the network's operation and integrity.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises an orderer node and begins censoring valid transactions or introduces malicious transactions into the block sequence.
    *   **Impact:** Network disruption, censorship of transactions, potential for ledger forking, and loss of confidence in the network's integrity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for orderer administrators.
        *   Secure the infrastructure hosting orderer nodes with robust security measures.
        *   Utilize a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism (like Raft in Fabric) with a sufficient number of orderers to tolerate failures or compromises.
        *   Regularly monitor orderer logs and performance for suspicious activity.
        *   Implement secure communication channels between orderers and peers.
