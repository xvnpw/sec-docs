## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Fabric Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_fabric_application__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal. Achieving this means successfully exploiting one or more of the underlying attack paths to compromise the application's security posture.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Fabric Network Infrastructure [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_fabric_network_infrastructure__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on attacking the core components of the Hyperledger Fabric network itself. Success here can have widespread and severe consequences.

    *   **2.1. Compromise Orderer Node [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   Orderers are critical for transaction ordering and consensus. Compromising them can lead to:
            *   **2.1.1. Consensus Disruption (Raft/Kafka specific) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Byzantine Fault Injection (Raft leader election manipulation) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers can attempt to manipulate the Raft leader election process to gain control or disrupt consensus.
                *   **Kafka Broker Compromise (Kafka based ordering) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** If Kafka is used for ordering, compromising Kafka brokers can allow attackers to manipulate transaction order or disrupt the ordering service.
            *   **2.1.2. Manipulate Transaction Ordering (Integrity) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Orderer Compromise (Direct Access) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Gaining direct access to the orderer node allows attackers to directly manipulate the order of transactions, leading to critical integrity breaches.
            *   **2.1.3. Information Disclosure (Confidentiality) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Logging/Monitoring Data Leakage [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Orderer logs and monitoring data might contain sensitive information. If not secured properly, attackers can access this data for reconnaissance or direct data breaches.

    *   **2.2. Compromise Peer Node [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   Peers store the ledger and execute chaincode. Compromising them can lead to:
            *   **2.2.1. Data Theft from Ledger (Confidentiality) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Exploit Peer Software Vulnerability (e.g., Fabric code, OS) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the peer software or underlying OS can grant attackers access to the peer's file system and ledger data.
            *   **2.2.2. Data Tampering in Ledger (Integrity) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Peer Compromise & Ledger Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Once a peer is compromised, attackers can directly manipulate the ledger data stored on that peer, leading to integrity violations.
            *   **2.2.3. Channel Hijacking/Data Leakage (Confidentiality/Integrity):**
                *   **Compromise Channel MSP (Membership Service Provider) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** If the MSP for a channel is compromised on a peer, attackers can potentially impersonate members of that channel or gain unauthorized access to channel data.

    *   **2.3. Compromise Certificate Authority (CA) / Membership Service Provider (MSP) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   CA/MSPs manage identities and trust within the Fabric network. Compromising them is extremely critical.
            *   **2.3.1. CA Key Compromise (Identity Theft, Impersonation) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Weak Key Generation/Storage [HIGH RISK PATH]:** If CA private keys are generated weakly or stored insecurely, attackers can steal them.
                *   **CA Software Vulnerability [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Vulnerabilities in the CA software itself can be exploited to extract private keys or gain control of the CA.
                *   **Insider Threat/Malicious Administrator [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Malicious insiders with administrative access to the CA can directly steal or misuse CA keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Chaincode (Smart Contract) Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_chaincode__smart_contract__vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

Chaincode contains the core application logic and data access rules. Vulnerabilities here can directly impact the application's functionality and data.

    *   **3.1. Logic Bugs in Chaincode (Integrity, Confidentiality, Availability) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Access Control Bypass in Chaincode Logic [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Flaws in chaincode's access control logic can allow unauthorized users to perform actions or access data they shouldn't.
        *   **Data Validation Failures [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Insufficient input validation in chaincode can lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or vulnerabilities.
        *   **Business Logic Flaws (e.g., incorrect state transitions) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Errors in the chaincode's business logic can lead to incorrect state updates, financial losses, or other application-specific issues.

    *   **3.2. Chaincode Backdoors/Malware (Integrity, Confidentiality) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Malicious Code Injection during Development [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers can inject malicious code into chaincode during the development process.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Compromised Dependencies) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Compromised dependencies used by the chaincode can introduce vulnerabilities or malicious functionality.
        *   **Insider Threat - Malicious Chaincode Deployment [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Malicious insiders with deployment privileges can deploy backdoored or malicious chaincode.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Application-Fabric Integration (Client SDK) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_application-fabric_integration__client_sdk___high_risk_path_.md)

Vulnerabilities in how the application integrates with Fabric through the Client SDK can be exploited.

    *   **4.1. Insecure Key Management in Application [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   If the application doesn't securely manage cryptographic keys used for interacting with Fabric (e.g., storing keys in plaintext, hardcoding keys), attackers can steal these keys and impersonate the application.
    *   **4.2. Application Logic Vulnerabilities Exploiting Fabric Features [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Information Leakage through Application APIs exposing Fabric Data [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Application APIs that expose Fabric data without proper access control or sanitization can leak sensitive information.
        *   **Business Logic Flaws in Application leveraging Fabric Functionality [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Flaws in the application's business logic that interacts with Fabric can be exploited to manipulate data or processes on the blockchain.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Social Engineering / Insider Threat [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__social_engineering__insider_threat__high_risk_path_.md)

Human factors are always a significant risk.

    *   **5.1. Phishing Attacks against Network Participants [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   Phishing attacks can target users or administrators to steal credentials, which can then be used to gain access to Fabric components or application systems.
    *   **5.2. Insider Malicious Actions (Data Theft, Sabotage) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   Malicious insiders with legitimate access can intentionally steal data, disrupt services, or sabotage the Fabric application.
    *   **5.3. Compromised Administrator Accounts [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   If administrator accounts are compromised (e.g., through weak passwords, lack of MFA), attackers can gain full control over Fabric components and the application.
