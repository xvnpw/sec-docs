# Threat Model Analysis for hyperledger/fabric

## Threat: [Compromised Certificate Authority (CA)](./threats/compromised_certificate_authority__ca_.md)

*   **Description**:
    *   An attacker gains control of a Certificate Authority (CA) server or its private key, which is a core component of Fabric's identity management.
    *   They can issue valid certificates for any identity within the Fabric network (peers, orderers, clients).
    *   This allows impersonation of legitimate users and bypasses Fabric's fundamental trust model.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Critical.** Complete breakdown of trust within the Fabric network's identity system.
    *   Unauthorized access to all Fabric network resources and data.
    *   Ability to perform malicious transactions and manipulate the ledger, undermining data integrity.
    *   Network takeover and complete compromise of Fabric security.
*   **Affected Component**:
    *   Membership Service Provider (MSP) - relies on CA for identity validation.
    *   Certificate Authority (CA) component - the source of identity compromise.
*   **Risk Severity**: **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   **Strong CA Security**: Implement robust physical and logical security for CA servers.
    *   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)**: Store CA private keys in HSMs for enhanced protection.
    *   **Regular CA Audits**: Conduct frequent security audits of CA infrastructure and processes.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for CA administrators to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for suspicious CA activity.

## Threat: [Stolen or Compromised Member Private Keys (Critical Identities)](./threats/stolen_or_compromised_member_private_keys__critical_identities_.md)

*   **Description**:
    *   An attacker obtains the private key of a *critical* Fabric network member, such as a peer, orderer, or network administrator. This is directly related to Fabric's identity management.
    *   This could be through targeted attacks, insider threats, or exploitation of vulnerabilities in key storage.
    *   With these keys, attackers can impersonate core Fabric components or administrators.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **High to Critical** (Critical if orderer or admin keys are compromised, High for peer keys).
    *   Unauthorized transactions and data access, potentially bypassing Fabric's access controls.
    *   Manipulation of network configurations if administrator keys are compromised, directly affecting Fabric governance.
    *   Denial of service by disrupting critical Fabric components like peers or orderers.
*   **Affected Component**:
    *   Membership Service Provider (MSP) - relies on key validity.
    *   Peer and Orderer nodes - compromised if their keys are stolen.
    *   Client SDKs and applications - if admin client keys are stolen.
*   **Risk Severity**: **High** (Peer Keys) to **Critical** (Orderer/Admin Keys)
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   **Secure Key Storage**: Enforce HSMs or encrypted keystores for critical Fabric component keys (peers, orderers, admins).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Limit the number of administrator identities and their scope.
    *   **Key Rotation**: Implement regular key rotation for critical Fabric identities.
    *   **Access Control and Monitoring**: Implement strict access controls and monitoring for systems storing private keys.

## Threat: [Orderer Service Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/orderer_service_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description**:
    *   An attacker targets the Fabric ordering service, a central component for transaction ordering and block creation.
    *   They flood the orderer with excessive transaction requests or exploit vulnerabilities in the orderer software itself.
    *   This directly disrupts Fabric's core function of transaction processing and consensus.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **High.** Network downtime and inability to process transactions within the Fabric network.
    *   Halting Fabric network operations and preventing block creation, stopping all application activity.
    *   Potential data inconsistencies if transactions are partially processed before the DoS on the Fabric ledger.
*   **Affected Component**:
    *   Ordering Service (Orderer nodes) - the direct target of the DoS.
*   **Risk Severity**: **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   **Rate Limiting (Fabric Level)**: Implement rate limiting on transaction submissions at the Fabric gateway or within the application interacting with Fabric.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Scaling (Orderer)**: Monitor orderer resource utilization and scale orderer resources to handle expected Fabric transaction load.
    *   **Firewall and Network Security (around Orderer)**: Use firewalls and network security to protect the orderer network infrastructure.
    *   **Regular Security Patching (Orderer Software)**: Keep orderer software up-to-date with the latest Fabric security patches.

*   **Description**:
    *   An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Fabric peer node, a fundamental component for ledger storage and chaincode execution.
    *   This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in the peer software, insecure peer server configuration, or targeted attacks.
    *   Compromised peers directly expose Fabric ledger data and chaincode execution environment.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **High.** Data breaches and unauthorized access to Fabric ledger data stored on the peer.
    *   Manipulation of chaincode execution *on that specific peer*, potentially leading to inconsistent state if not detected by consensus.
    *   Denial of service by disrupting peer operations, impacting Fabric network performance and availability.
*   **Affected Component**:
    *   Peer Node - the compromised component.
    *   Ledger (data stored on the peer) - directly exposed.
    *   Chaincode (installed on the peer) - execution environment compromised.
*   **Risk Severity**: **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:

*   **Description**:
    *   Unauthorized access to Fabric ledger data stored on peer nodes, a core data repository of the Fabric network.
    *   This could be through peer node compromise, insider threat with access to peer storage, or vulnerabilities in Fabric's data access controls.
    *   Even with Private Data Collections, vulnerabilities in Fabric's access control mechanisms could lead to data exposure.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **High to Critical** (Critical if highly sensitive data is breached).
    *   Exposure of sensitive business data and confidential information stored within the Fabric ledger.
    *   Violation of privacy regulations if personal data is stored on the Fabric ledger and breached.
    *   Reputational damage and loss of trust in the Fabric application and network.
*   **Affected Component**:
    *   Ledger (state database and block storage) - the location of the data breach.
    *   Peer Node - where ledger data is stored and accessed.
    *   Private Data Collections (if used) - potential bypass of intended privacy.
*   **Risk Severity**: **High** to **Critical**
