# Threat Model Analysis for hyperledger/fabric

## Threat: [Compromised Certificate Authority (CA)](./threats/compromised_certificate_authority__ca_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the Certificate Authority. They might issue fraudulent certificates for new identities, revoke legitimate certificates causing disruption, or impersonate existing network members.

**Impact:**  Complete loss of trust in the network's identity system. Unauthorized entities could join, legitimate members could be locked out, and malicious transactions could be authorized.

**Affected Component:** Fabric-CA server and its underlying key material.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for CA administrators.
* Secure the CA's private key material using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).
* Regularly audit CA operations and logs.
* Implement a robust disaster recovery plan for the CA.
* Consider using an intermediate CA to limit the scope of a potential compromise of the root CA.

## Threat: [Key Material Compromise (Peer, Orderer)](./threats/key_material_compromise__peer__orderer_.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains the private keys of a peer node or orderer node. They could then impersonate that entity, endorse malicious transactions (for peers), or manipulate the ordering process (for orderers).

**Impact:**  Unauthorized actions on the network, data manipulation, potential for double-spending or other fraudulent activities, and disruption of network services.

**Affected Component:**  Peer node's local MSP, Orderer node's local MSP.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store private keys securely using HSMs or secure enclaves.
* Implement strong access controls on systems storing key material.
* Use strong passwords or passphrases to protect key stores.
* Regularly rotate cryptographic keys.
* Implement secure key management practices and policies.

## Threat: [Malicious Chaincode Deployment](./threats/malicious_chaincode_deployment.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges deploys a malicious chaincode onto a channel. This chaincode could contain vulnerabilities, intentionally manipulate data, or disrupt the application's functionality.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access to data, denial of service, and potential financial loss or reputational damage.

**Affected Component:**  Peer nodes (where chaincode is installed and executed), chaincode lifecycle management processes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls for chaincode deployment and management.
* Implement a thorough chaincode review and testing process, including security audits.
* Utilize formal verification methods for critical chaincode logic.
* Implement a secure chaincode upgrade process.
* Consider using chaincode packaging and signing to ensure authenticity.

## Threat: [Chaincode Vulnerabilities](./threats/chaincode_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Deployed chaincode contains programming errors or security flaws (e.g., logic bugs, integer overflows, access control bypasses). Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate data, bypass intended business logic, or cause unexpected behavior.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access, financial loss, and disruption of application functionality.

**Affected Component:** Deployed chaincode on peer nodes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Employ secure coding practices during chaincode development.
* Conduct thorough static and dynamic analysis of chaincode.
* Implement comprehensive unit and integration testing for chaincode.
* Regularly update chaincode dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Consider using security-focused chaincode development frameworks or libraries.

## Threat: [Peer Node Compromise](./threats/peer_node_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a peer node, potentially through exploiting OS vulnerabilities, weak credentials, or supply chain attacks. They can then access ledger data, endorse malicious transactions (if the compromised peer is an endorser), or disrupt network operations by taking the peer offline.

**Impact:** Data breaches, potential for malicious transaction endorsement, disruption of network services, and potential tampering with local state database.

**Affected Component:** Peer node (including ledger storage, chaincode execution environment, and gossip communication module).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls and regularly patch the operating system and Fabric binaries on peer nodes.
* Harden the peer node's operating system and file system.
* Use secure key management practices for peer identities.
* Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems.
* Regularly monitor peer node logs and resource utilization.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Channel Data](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_channel_data.md)

**Description:** An unauthorized organization or member gains access to data within a channel they are not intended to see. This could be due to misconfigured access control policies or vulnerabilities in the channel access management.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breaches and exposure of sensitive business information.

**Affected Component:** Channel configuration, MSP definitions, peer node's ledger data.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the sensitivity of the data).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully design and implement channel access control policies.
* Regularly review and audit channel configurations and MSP definitions.
* Utilize private data collections for sensitive information requiring restricted access within a channel.

## Threat: [Private Data Collection Exposure](./threats/private_data_collection_exposure.md)

**Description:** Data stored in a private data collection is exposed to unauthorized parties within the same channel. This could be due to vulnerabilities in the private data collection mechanism or misconfigurations.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breaches and exposure of highly sensitive data intended for a limited set of organizations.

**Affected Component:** Private data collection implementation on peer nodes, chaincode logic interacting with private data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (due to the sensitive nature of private data).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly test and audit chaincode logic interacting with private data collections.
* Ensure proper configuration of private data collection policies.
* Consider using zero-knowledge proofs or other privacy-enhancing technologies for highly sensitive data.
