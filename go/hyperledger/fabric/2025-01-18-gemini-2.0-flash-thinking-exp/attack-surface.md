# Attack Surface Analysis for hyperledger/fabric

## Attack Surface: [Ledger Tampering via Compromised Endorsement](./attack_surfaces/ledger_tampering_via_compromised_endorsement.md)

**Description:** Malicious actors compromise a sufficient number of endorsing peers to approve fraudulent transactions, leading to the inclusion of invalid data in the ledger.

**How Fabric Contributes:** Fabric's endorsement policy mechanism defines the set of peers required to endorse a transaction. If these peers are compromised, the security of the ledger is at risk.

**Impact:** Loss of asset integrity, financial losses, reputational damage, and erosion of trust in the network.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust endorsement policies requiring endorsements from diverse and highly secure organizations.
*   Regularly audit and monitor the security of endorsing peers.
*   Utilize Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the private keys of endorsing peers.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication for peer administrators.
*   Employ intrusion detection and prevention systems on peer infrastructure.

## Attack Surface: [Orderer Manipulation Leading to Transaction Reordering or Omission](./attack_surfaces/orderer_manipulation_leading_to_transaction_reordering_or_omission.md)

**Description:** Attackers compromise orderer nodes, potentially manipulating the order of transactions within blocks or omitting legitimate transactions entirely.

**How Fabric Contributes:** Fabric's ordering service is responsible for the atomic ordering of transactions. Compromise of orderers can directly impact the integrity and fairness of the transaction flow.

**Impact:** Data inconsistencies, denial of service for specific transactions, unfair advantages for malicious actors, and disruption of network operations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Choose a robust and fault-tolerant ordering service consensus mechanism (e.g., Raft with a sufficient number of nodes).
*   Secure the infrastructure of orderer nodes with strong access controls and monitoring.
*   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for communication between peers and orderers.
*   Regularly audit the logs and behavior of orderer nodes.
*   Consider geographically distributed orderer nodes for increased resilience.

## Attack Surface: [Certificate Authority (CA) Compromise](./attack_surfaces/certificate_authority__ca__compromise.md)

**Description:** Attackers compromise the Certificate Authority, allowing them to issue fraudulent certificates and impersonate legitimate network participants (peers, orderers, clients).

**How Fabric Contributes:** Fabric relies heavily on PKI and CAs for identity management and authentication. A compromised CA undermines the entire trust model of the network.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the network's identity system, enabling impersonation, unauthorized access, and data manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong security measures for the CA infrastructure, including HSMs for private key protection.
*   Restrict access to the CA to authorized personnel only.
*   Implement robust logging and monitoring of CA operations.
*   Consider using a hierarchical CA structure for better isolation.
*   Regularly audit the CA's security configuration and practices.

## Attack Surface: [Membership Service Provider (MSP) Configuration Tampering](./attack_surfaces/membership_service_provider__msp__configuration_tampering.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to MSP configuration files and modify them to grant themselves or others illegitimate access and privileges within an organization's domain.

**How Fabric Contributes:** MSPs define the membership and roles within a Fabric network. Tampering with MSP configurations can bypass access controls and grant unauthorized permissions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, ability to perform actions on behalf of legitimate members, and potential disruption of organizational operations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure MSP configuration files with strict access controls and encryption.
*   Implement version control and auditing for MSP configuration changes.
*   Regularly review and validate MSP configurations.
*   Store MSP configurations securely and separately from other application data.

## Attack Surface: [Chaincode Vulnerabilities Leading to State Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/chaincode_vulnerabilities_leading_to_state_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the smart contract code (chaincode) are exploited to manipulate the ledger state in an unauthorized manner.

**How Fabric Contributes:** Fabric executes chaincode to process transactions and update the ledger state. Vulnerable chaincode can be exploited to bypass intended business logic.

**Impact:** Loss of asset integrity, financial losses, data corruption, and violation of business rules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement secure coding practices for chaincode development, including thorough input validation and access control checks.
*   Conduct rigorous security testing and code reviews of chaincode before deployment.
*   Utilize static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in chaincode.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining chaincode access controls.
*   Implement a robust chaincode lifecycle management process with appropriate approvals and testing.
