## Attack Tree Path: [1. Chaincode Exploitation Path](./attack_tree_paths/1__chaincode_exploitation_path.md)

*   **[A2] Exploit Logic Flaws in Existing Chaincode [!]:**
    *   *Description:*  The attacker identifies and exploits vulnerabilities in already deployed chaincode. This is a direct attack on the running system and doesn't require deployment privileges.
    *   *Examples:*  Exploiting phantom reads, double-spend vulnerabilities, incorrect access control, integer overflows, or other logic errors.
    *   *Mitigation:* Rigorous code review, static analysis (using tools like Mythril), dynamic analysis (fuzzing), formal verification, and security audits.

*   **[A2a] Find Static Analysis Tools (e.g., Mythril) [!]:**
    *   *Description:* The attacker uses static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the chaincode source code without executing it.  The *effective use* of these tools is the critical aspect.
    *   *Examples:* Using Mythril, Slither, or other security-focused static analyzers to find common chaincode vulnerabilities.
    *   *Mitigation:*  Developers should also use these tools proactively to identify and fix vulnerabilities *before* deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Chaincode Injection via Admin Compromise Path](./attack_tree_paths/2__chaincode_injection_via_admin_compromise_path.md)

*   **[A3] Deploy Malicious Chaincode (e.g., Upgrade):**
    *   *Description:* The attacker leverages the chaincode upgrade process (or initial deployment) to replace legitimate chaincode with a malicious version.
    *   *Examples:*  Replacing a payment processing chaincode with one that diverts funds to the attacker's account.
    *   *Mitigation:*  Strict chaincode lifecycle management, multi-signature approvals for upgrades, code signing, and robust access controls.

*   **[A3a] Gain Admin Access (e.g., compromised MSP) [!]:**
    *   *Description:* The attacker obtains administrative privileges, often by compromising a Membership Service Provider (MSP). This is a critical step as it grants extensive control over the network.
    *   *Examples:*  Compromising an MSP administrator's credentials, exploiting a vulnerability in the MSP software, or using social engineering.
    *   *Mitigation:*  Strong authentication (multi-factor), principle of least privilege, secure key management (HSMs), regular security audits of MSP configurations, and intrusion detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Credential Theft via Social Engineering Path](./attack_tree_paths/3__credential_theft_via_social_engineering_path.md)

*   **[B2] Leverage Default Credentials (e.g., weak passwords):**
    *  *Description:* Attackers try default or weak credentials to gain access.
    *  *Examples:* Trying default passwords for peer or orderer nodes.
    *  *Mitigation:* Never use default credentials. Enforce strong password policies.

*   **[B2a] Use Social Engineering to Gain Access [!]:**
    *   *Description:* The attacker uses social engineering techniques to trick users or administrators into revealing credentials or granting access.
    *   *Examples:*  Phishing emails, phone calls impersonating IT support, or other deceptive tactics.
    *   *Mitigation:*  User education and awareness training, strong authentication (multi-factor), and a culture of security awareness.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Private Key Theft via Phishing Path](./attack_tree_paths/4__private_key_theft_via_phishing_path.md)

*   **[C1] Steal Private Keys [!]:**
    *   *Description:* The attacker obtains private keys, which are essential for signing transactions and proving identity. This is a direct path to unauthorized control.
    *   *Examples:*  Stealing private keys from compromised machines, intercepting key material during transmission, or tricking users into revealing their keys.
    *   *Mitigation:*  Secure key management (HSMs), multi-factor authentication, secure key storage, and user education.

*   **[C1a] Use Phishing Attacks (e.g., email) [!]:**
    *   *Description:* The attacker uses phishing attacks to trick users into revealing their private keys or installing malware that steals keys.
    *   *Examples:*  Sending emails that appear to be from a legitimate source, asking users to enter their private keys on a fake website.
    *   *Mitigation:*  User education and awareness training, email security gateways, and strong authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Cryptographic Weakness Exploitation (Low Likelihood, High Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/5__cryptographic_weakness_exploitation__low_likelihood__high_impact_.md)

*    **[C2a] Use Crypto Algorithm Weaknesses (e.g., weak keys):**
    *   *Description:* The attacker exploits weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms or key generation processes used by Fabric.
    *   *Examples:*  Using brute-force attacks against weak keys, exploiting known vulnerabilities in cryptographic libraries, or using quantum computing (in the future).
    *   *Mitigation:*  Use strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and key sizes, regularly review cryptographic configurations, and stay informed about advancements in cryptanalysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Ordering Service Exploitation (Conditional - If Misconfigured)](./attack_tree_paths/6__ordering_service_exploitation__conditional_-_if_misconfigured_.md)

*   **[B1] Exploit Ordering Service Vulnerabilities:**
    *   *Description:*  Attacking the ordering service, which is crucial for transaction ordering and consensus.
    *   *Examples:*  Denial-of-service attacks, exploiting vulnerabilities in the ordering service software.
    *   *Mitigation:*  Keep ordering service software up-to-date, implement robust network security controls, and monitor for suspicious activity.

*   **[B1a] Find Publicly Exposed Ordering Service Endpoints:**
    *   *Description:*  Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in an exposed ordering service.
    *   *Examples:*  Scanning for open ports associated with the ordering service.
    *   *Mitigation:*  Ensure the ordering service is *not* publicly exposed. Use firewalls and network segmentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Endorsing Peer Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/7__endorsing_peer_exploitation.md)

*   **[B3] Attack Endorsing Peers (e.g., compromised nodes):**
    *   *Description:*  Compromising endorsing peers to influence transaction validation.
    *   *Examples:* Exploiting vulnerabilities in the peer software.
    *   *Mitigation:* Keep peer software up-to-date, implement robust network security controls, and monitor for suspicious activity.

*   **[B3a] Find Known Exploits (e.g., CVEs):**
    *   *Description:*  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the peer software or its dependencies.
    *   *Examples:* Using publicly available exploit code for unpatched vulnerabilities.
    *   *Mitigation:*  Regularly apply security patches and updates.
