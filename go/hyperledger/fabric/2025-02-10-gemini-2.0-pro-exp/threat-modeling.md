# Threat Model Analysis for hyperledger/fabric

## Threat: [CA Compromise (Root or Intermediate)](./threats/ca_compromise__root_or_intermediate_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains full control over a Fabric Certificate Authority (CA) server. The attacker can issue fraudulent certificates, impersonating any network participant.
*   **Impact:** Complete network compromise. Attacker can read all data, modify the ledger, and disrupt the network. Loss of trust in the entire system.
*   **Affected Component:** Fabric CA server (all functions related to certificate issuance and management).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect CA private keys.
    *   Implement strict multi-factor authentication and access control for CA administrators.
    *   Regularly audit CA logs and configurations.
    *   Implement robust intrusion detection and prevention systems specifically for the CA server.
    *   Use a physically secure environment for CA servers.
    *   Implement certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and ensure clients validate them.
    *   Use intermediate CAs; limit the scope of each CA.

## Threat: [Rogue Peer Enrollment](./threats/rogue_peer_enrollment.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker successfully enrolls a malicious peer into the Fabric network, bypassing or exploiting weaknesses in the membership service provider (MSP) and enrollment process.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise. The rogue peer can inject false data, refuse to endorse valid transactions, or disrupt consensus. The extent depends on endorsement policies.
*   **Affected Component:** Membership Service Provider (MSP), Enrollment process, Peer joining logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Require multi-organization approval for new peer enrollment.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for peer enrollment, verifying organizational identity.
    *   Use TLS for all peer communication.
    *   Monitor peer behavior for anomalies (e.g., unusual endorsement patterns, connection attempts).
    *   Implement robust network segmentation to limit the impact of a rogue peer.

## Threat: [Chaincode Vulnerability Exploitation (e.g., Integer Overflow, Injection)](./threats/chaincode_vulnerability_exploitation__e_g___integer_overflow__injection_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious transaction that exploits a vulnerability within the deployed chaincode (e.g., integer overflow, injection flaw, logic error) to manipulate the ledger state in an unauthorized manner.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, potential financial loss, unauthorized access to assets or data. The specific impact depends on the vulnerability and the chaincode's function.
*   **Affected Component:** Specific chaincode functions, chaincode runtime environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thorough chaincode security audits and penetration testing *before* deployment.
    *   Use secure coding practices (e.g., input validation, safe arithmetic libraries, avoiding external calls).
    *   Formal verification of chaincode logic where feasible.
    *   Implement access control *within* the chaincode.
    *   Regularly update chaincode to address vulnerabilities (using Fabric's upgrade mechanisms).
    *   Use a linter and static analysis tools during chaincode development.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) on Ordering Service](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__on_ordering_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Fabric ordering service with a high volume of requests (valid or invalid), overwhelming its capacity and making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Network unavailability. No new transactions can be processed, halting all business operations that rely on the Fabric network.
*   **Affected Component:** Ordering Service (Raft or Kafka consensus mechanisms, orderer nodes).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a highly available and scalable ordering service configuration (multiple orderers, properly configured Raft or Kafka).
    *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling *specifically for the ordering service*.
    *   Use network firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems configured to protect the orderers.
    *   Monitor orderer performance and scale resources as needed.
    *   Implement DDoS mitigation techniques tailored to the ordering service protocol.

## Threat: [Private Data Leakage on Public Channel](./threats/private_data_leakage_on_public_channel.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is mistakenly written to a public Fabric channel, or a misconfiguration exposes a private channel to unauthorized participants. This is a direct result of incorrect Fabric configuration or chaincode logic.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach. Sensitive data is exposed to unauthorized parties.
*   **Affected Component:** Channel configuration, chaincode logic (incorrect channel usage).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly enforce the use of private channels and private data collections for sensitive data.
    *   Thoroughly review channel configurations and chaincode logic *before deployment*.
    *   Implement access control policies at the channel level.
    *   Educate developers about Fabric's privacy features and *require* training.
    *   Use automated tools to scan chaincode for potential data leakage vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [SideDB (CouchDB/LevelDB) Direct Access (on a Fabric Peer)](./threats/sidedb__couchdbleveldb__direct_access__on_a_fabric_peer_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the state database (CouchDB or LevelDB) *on a Fabric peer*, bypassing the chaincode and Fabric's access controls. This is a vulnerability *within the Fabric peer's deployment*.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity and confidentiality compromise. The attacker can read, modify, or delete data directly, bypassing Fabric security.
*   **Affected Component:** Peer's state database (CouchDB or LevelDB), peer's operating system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely configure the state database (strong passwords, access controls, *following Fabric documentation*).
    *   Implement file system encryption for the peer's data directory.
    *   Use network segmentation to isolate the peer's database *from external access*.
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems *on the peer itself*.
    *   Regularly patch and update the database software and operating system *of the peer*.
