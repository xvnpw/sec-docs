# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for 99designs/gqlgen

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable GraphQL Introspection in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_graphql_introspection_in_production.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Production Environment:** Determine how your application distinguishes between development and production environments (e.g., environment variables, build flags).
    2.  **Locate gqlgen Server Configuration:** Find the code where your `gqlgen` GraphQL server is initialized. This is typically in your main application file or a dedicated server setup file.
    3.  **Disable Introspection Flag:**  Within the `gqlgen` server configuration, locate the setting that controls introspection. Set this option to disable introspection based on your production environment detection.  For example, using `srv.DisableIntrospection = true` after creating the `gqlgen` handler.
    4.  **Deploy and Test:** Deploy your application to your production environment and verify that introspection is disabled by attempting an introspection query.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Exposing the GraphQL schema via introspection allows attackers to understand the API structure and identify potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of information disclosure by preventing unauthorized schema access.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** Introspection is enabled by default in `gqlgen` and needs to be explicitly disabled for production.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Server initialization code, specifically within the `gqlgen` handler configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Query Complexity Limits](./mitigation_strategies/implement_query_complexity_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Complexity Rules:** Analyze your GraphQL schema and resolvers to assign complexity scores to each field based on resource consumption.
    2.  **Set Complexity Threshold:** Determine a maximum complexity threshold for queries based on server capacity.
    3.  **Implement Complexity Calculation:** Utilize `gqlgen`'s mechanisms or libraries to calculate query complexity based on defined rules.
    4.  **Enforce Limits:** Implement middleware or directives in `gqlgen` to intercept queries, calculate complexity, and reject queries exceeding the threshold.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Complex queries can overload the server, leading to DoS attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (High Impact):** Effectively mitigates DoS attacks by preventing resource exhaustion from overly complex queries.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** Query complexity limits are not enabled by default in `gqlgen`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   GraphQL server middleware or directives and complexity rule definitions within `gqlgen` configuration or resolvers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Query Depth Limits](./mitigation_strategies/implement_query_depth_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Maximum Depth:** Decide on a reasonable maximum query depth for your application.
    2.  **Configure Depth Limiting Middleware/Directive:**  Use `gqlgen` features or libraries to implement query depth limiting.
    3.  **Enforce Limits:** Integrate depth limiting into your `gqlgen` server pipeline to reject queries exceeding the maximum depth.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Deeply nested queries can cause stack overflow errors or resource exhaustion, leading to DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (Medium Impact):** Reduces DoS risk from excessively nested queries, preventing resource exhaustion.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** Query depth limits are not enabled by default in `gqlgen`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   GraphQL server middleware or directives configured within the `gqlgen` server setup.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Field-Level Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/implement_field-level_authorization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Authorization Rules:** Define authorization rules for each field in your GraphQL schema based on roles or permissions.
    2.  **Implement Authorization Logic in Resolvers:** Within resolvers, implement checks using the `gqlgen` context to verify user permissions before resolving field values.
    3.  **Enforce Authorization:** Use conditional logic in resolvers to authorize access and return errors for unauthorized requests.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Users might access sensitive data or operations they are not permitted to, leading to data breaches.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Impact):** Significantly reduces unauthorized access risk by enforcing granular access control at the field level within `gqlgen` resolvers.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Potentially Partially Implemented:** Basic authentication might exist, but field-level authorization within `gqlgen` resolvers is likely missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Within GraphQL resolvers, adding authorization checks to resolvers handling sensitive data or operations, leveraging `gqlgen` context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Customize GraphQL Error Handling](./mitigation_strategies/customize_graphql_error_handling.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Custom Error Formatter:** Implement a custom error formatter function using `gqlgen`'s `SetErrorPresenter`.
    2.  **Sanitize Error Messages for Production:** In the formatter, differentiate environments and replace detailed error messages with generic ones in production. Log details securely server-side.
    3.  **Avoid Exposing Internal Details:** Ensure production errors do not reveal server paths or sensitive implementation details.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Default error responses can leak server details, aiding attackers in reconnaissance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Impact):** Reduces information disclosure risk by preventing sensitive server details in error responses customized via `gqlgen`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** Default error handling is used by `gqlgen` unless customized.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   GraphQL server setup code, configuring the error formatter using `srv.SetErrorPresenter` in `gqlgen`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation in Resolvers](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_in_resolvers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Arguments:** Review your schema and resolvers to identify input arguments.
    2.  **Define Validation Rules:** Define validation rules for each input argument based on data types, formats, and business logic.
    3.  **Implement Validation Logic in Resolvers:** Within resolvers, implement validation logic at the start of the function.
    4.  **Validate Input:** Use validation libraries or custom code to check input against defined rules within `gqlgen` resolvers.
    5.  **Handle Validation Errors:** Return GraphQL errors for invalid input, providing informative messages without revealing sensitive details, handled by `gqlgen`'s error mechanisms.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Lack of input validation can lead to SQL/NoSQL injection if input is directly used in queries.
    *   **Business Logic Flaws (Medium Severity):** Invalid input can cause unexpected behavior or data corruption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Impact):** Significantly reduces injection attack risk by ensuring validated and sanitized data processing within `gqlgen` resolvers.
    *   **Business Logic Flaws (Medium Impact):** Prevents business logic flaws by enforcing data integrity in `gqlgen` resolvers.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Potentially Partially Implemented:** Basic type checking might be in place, but deeper validation within resolvers is likely missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Within GraphQL resolvers, adding validation logic at the start of resolvers handling input arguments in `gqlgen`.
