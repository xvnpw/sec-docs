### 4. Deep Analysis of Threat: Information Leakage via Error Handling

#### 4.1. Threat Actor and Motivation

*   **Threat Actor:**  The primary threat actors are external attackers and potentially malicious internal users.
    *   **External Attackers:** Motivated by gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information, disrupting services, or exploiting vulnerabilities for further attacks. Information leakage can aid in reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, and crafting more targeted attacks.
    *   **Malicious Internal Users:**  May exploit information leakage to gain unauthorized access to data or systems beyond their intended permissions.

*   **Motivation:** Attackers are motivated by:
    *   **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about the application's architecture, technologies, database structure, and internal logic.
    *   **Vulnerability Discovery:** Identifying potential weaknesses or misconfigurations based on leaked error details.
    *   **Data Breach:**  Directly or indirectly accessing sensitive data exposed through error messages (e.g., database connection strings, internal file paths).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Using leaked information to understand system internals and potentially escalate privileges.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector and Entry Points

*   **Attack Vector:** The primary attack vector is through crafted GraphQL queries designed to trigger errors within the `gqlgen` application.
    *   **Invalid Queries:** Sending malformed or syntactically incorrect GraphQL queries.
    *   **Queries with Invalid Arguments:** Providing incorrect or unexpected input values to GraphQL fields and resolvers.
    *   **Queries Targeting Error-Prone Logic:**  Crafting queries that specifically target resolvers or application logic known to be susceptible to errors (e.g., accessing non-existent resources, triggering database constraints).
    *   **Intentionally Triggering Business Logic Errors:**  Exploiting business logic flaws that result in errors, potentially revealing internal system states.

*   **Entry Points:** The entry points for this attack are all GraphQL endpoints exposed by the `gqlgen` application. Any publicly accessible GraphQL endpoint is a potential target for triggering error responses.

#### 4.3. Technical Details of Information Leakage in gqlgen

`gqlgen` by default provides a certain level of error handling, but it's crucial to understand how it works and where vulnerabilities can arise:

*   **Default `gqlgen` Error Handling:**
    *   `gqlgen`'s default error handling in development mode often includes detailed error messages, stack traces, and potentially internal system information. This is helpful for debugging during development but is highly insecure for production.
    *   Even in production, without explicit customization, `gqlgen` might still expose more information than desired in error responses, especially if resolvers throw unhandled exceptions.
    *   The default error format in GraphQL includes an `errors` array in the response, which can contain detailed error messages.

*   **Error Handling in Resolvers (Developer Responsibility):**
    *   **Unhandled Exceptions:** If resolvers throw exceptions that are not explicitly caught and handled, `gqlgen`'s default error handling will likely catch them and potentially expose stack traces or error details in the GraphQL response.
    *   **Verbose Error Messages:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information in custom error messages returned from resolvers (e.g., database query errors with table names, file paths in error messages).
    *   **Lack of Centralized Error Handling:** Without a centralized error handling strategy, error handling logic might be inconsistent across resolvers, leading to some resolvers leaking more information than others.

*   **GraphQL Error Response Structure:**
    *   GraphQL error responses are structured and standardized, which is generally beneficial. However, this structure can also be used to consistently deliver leaked information to attackers if error messages are not carefully crafted.
    *   The `extensions` field in the GraphQL error response is often used for debugging information and can be a prime location for accidental information leakage if not properly controlled.

#### 4.4. Example Scenarios of Information Leakage

1.  **Database Connection Error:** A resolver attempts to query the database, but the database connection fails due to incorrect credentials. The error response, if not handled properly, might expose:
    *   Database connection string (potentially including username, hostname, and even password if poorly configured).
    *   Database server type and version.
    *   Internal network information if the connection error reveals network paths.

2.  **File System Access Error:** A resolver attempts to read a file, but the file is not found or access is denied. The error response might expose:
    *   Full file path on the server.
    *   Operating system details if error messages are OS-specific.
    *   Information about the application's directory structure.

3.  **Internal Logic Error with Stack Trace:** A bug in the resolver logic causes an unhandled exception. The error response, especially in development mode or with misconfigured production error handling, might expose:
    *   Full stack trace, revealing code paths, function names, and potentially sensitive internal logic.
    *   Version information of libraries and frameworks used.
    *   Internal variable names and data structures.

4.  **Business Logic Error Revealing Sensitive Data:** A business logic error occurs, and the error message inadvertently includes sensitive data, such as:
    *   User IDs or email addresses.
    *   Internal identifiers or codes.
    *   Partial or complete data from the database that should not be exposed in error messages.

#### 4.5. Risk Severity Assessment

As indicated in the threat description, the **Risk Severity is High**. Information leakage via error handling can have significant consequences:

*   **Increased Attack Surface:** Leaked information provides attackers with valuable insights, expanding the attack surface.
*   **Easier Reconnaissance:** Attackers can quickly gather information about the system without needing to perform complex attacks.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Leaked details can be used to identify and exploit other vulnerabilities more effectively.
*   **Compliance Violations:** Exposure of sensitive data through error messages can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

#### 4.6. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations

To effectively mitigate the threat of information leakage via error handling in `gqlgen` applications, the following strategies should be implemented:

1.  **Configure `gqlgen` for Generic Error Messages in Production:**
    *   **Customize Error Formatting:**  `gqlgen` allows customization of error formatting. In production, configure it to return generic, non-descriptive error messages to clients. Avoid exposing stack traces, internal details, or specific error codes directly to the client.
    *   **Use `ErrorPresenter`:**  Implement a custom `ErrorPresenter` in `gqlgen` to control the format and content of error responses. This allows you to strip out sensitive information and provide a consistent, safe error response structure.

    ```go
    package main

    import (
        "context"
        "errors"
        "log"
        "net/http"
        "os"

        "github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql"
        "github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql/handler"
        "github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql/playground"
        "your-project/graph" // Replace with your actual graph package
        "your-project/graph/generated" // Replace with your actual generated package
    )

    func main() {
        port := os.Getenv("PORT")
        if port == "" {
            port = defaultPort
        }

        srv := handler.NewDefaultServer(generated.NewExecutableSchema(generated.Config{Resolvers: &graph.Resolver{}}))

        // Custom Error Presenter for Production
        srv.SetErrorPresenter(func(ctx context.Context, err error) *graphql.Error {
            // Log the full error for debugging (ensure logs are not publicly accessible)
            log.Printf("GraphQL Error: %v", err)

            // Return a generic error message to the client in production
            return &graphql.Error{
                Message: "An unexpected error occurred. Please contact support.",
                Path:    graphql.GetPathContext(ctx), // Optionally include path
                Extensions: map[string]interface{}{
                    "code": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR", // Generic error code
                },
            }
        })


        http.Handle("/", playground.Handler("GraphQL playground", "/query"))
        http.Handle("/query", srv)

        log.Printf("connect to http://localhost:%s/ for GraphQL playground", port)
        log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, nil))
    }
    ```

2.  **Implement Centralized Error Logging:**
    *   **Comprehensive Logging:** Implement robust centralized logging to capture detailed error information, including stack traces, request details, and timestamps. This logging should be for internal debugging and monitoring purposes only and must not be accessible to clients.
    *   **Secure Logging Infrastructure:** Ensure that the logging infrastructure is secure and access-controlled to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive error logs.
    *   **Structured Logging:** Use structured logging formats (e.g., JSON) to facilitate efficient analysis and monitoring of errors.

3.  **Implement Custom Error Handling Logic in Resolvers:**
    *   **Catch and Handle Exceptions:**  Within resolvers, use `recover()` in Go or similar mechanisms in other languages to catch panics and exceptions. Handle errors gracefully and return user-friendly error messages.
    *   **Error Mapping:** Create a mapping between internal error types and safe, generic error messages for clients.
    *   **Custom Error Types:** Define custom error types within your application to categorize errors and handle them consistently.
    *   **Avoid Verbose Error Messages:**  Carefully craft error messages returned from resolvers. Ensure they are informative enough for the client to understand the general issue but do not expose sensitive internal details.

    ```go
    package graph

    import (
        "context"
        "errors"
        "fmt"
        "your-project/graph/model" // Replace with your actual model package
    )

    type Resolver struct{}

    func (r *queryResolver) User(ctx context.Context, id string) (*model.User, error) {
        // Simulate database error
        if id == "error" {
            // Log detailed error internally
            fmt.Println("Error fetching user:", errors.New("database connection failed"))
            // Return generic error to client
            return nil, errors.New("failed to retrieve user") // Generic error
        }

        // ... normal resolver logic ...
        return &model.User{ID: id, Name: "Test User"}, nil
    }

    // ... other resolvers ...
    ```

4.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Validate Inputs:** Implement thorough input validation for all GraphQL query arguments to prevent unexpected inputs that could trigger errors.
    *   **Sanitize Inputs:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities that could lead to errors and information leakage.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews, specifically focusing on error handling logic in resolvers and server configuration.
    *   **Penetration Testing:** Perform penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify potential information leakage vulnerabilities.
