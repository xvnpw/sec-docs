# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Priority: Provide a robust and efficient library for Go developers to build GraphQL servers.
 - Goal: Simplify GraphQL server development in Go, enabling faster development cycles and easier maintenance.
 - Goal: Promote the adoption of GraphQL by providing a well-documented and easy-to-use library.
 - Goal: Maintain a high-quality, performant, and reliable library that meets the needs of the Go GraphQL community.

- Business Risks:
 - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the `gqlgen` library could lead to data breaches or service disruptions in applications built using it.
 - Risk: Performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies in `gqlgen` could negatively impact the performance of GraphQL servers.
 - Risk: Lack of comprehensive documentation or examples could hinder adoption and increase development time for users.
 - Risk: Incompatibility with future Go versions or other libraries could require significant refactoring and maintenance.
 - Risk: Open-source nature relies on community contributions, which may lead to inconsistent quality or delayed updates if community support wanes.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Standard open-source development practices, including code reviews and community contributions. (Implemented: GitHub repository workflow)
 - security control: Unit and integration tests to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. (Implemented: GitHub repository test suite)
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
 - accepted risk: Security of applications built using `gqlgen` is the responsibility of the application developers. `gqlgen` provides the framework but does not enforce application-level security.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - recommended security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by `gqlgen`.
 - recommended security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential security flaws in the `gqlgen` codebase.
 - recommended security control: Provide clear and comprehensive security guidelines in the documentation for developers using `gqlgen`, especially regarding input validation, authorization, and data protection in GraphQL applications.
 - recommended security control: Establish a process for reporting and responding to security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
 - recommended security control: Consider performing regular security audits or penetration testing of the `gqlgen` library.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: `gqlgen` itself does not handle authentication. Applications built with `gqlgen` are responsible for implementing authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
  - Requirement: Documentation should clearly outline best practices for implementing authentication in GraphQL applications using `gqlgen`, including integration with common authentication providers and strategies (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0).
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: `gqlgen` itself does not handle authorization. Applications built with `gqlgen` are responsible for implementing authorization logic to control access to data and operations based on user roles and permissions.
  - Requirement: Documentation should provide guidance on implementing fine-grained authorization in GraphQL applications using `gqlgen`, including examples of directive-based authorization and integration with authorization frameworks.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Applications built with `gqlgen` must perform thorough input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, GraphQL injection) and other input-related vulnerabilities.
  - Requirement: Documentation should emphasize the importance of input validation in GraphQL applications and provide examples of how to validate GraphQL queries, mutations, and input types effectively using `gqlgen`.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: `gqlgen` itself does not enforce cryptography. Applications built with `gqlgen` should use appropriate cryptographic measures to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest.
  - Requirement: Documentation should recommend best practices for using cryptography in GraphQL applications built with `gqlgen`, such as using HTTPS for transport security and encrypting sensitive data in the database.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Process: Development and deployment of GraphQL APIs using the `gqlgen` library.
 - Process: Providing a reliable and secure GraphQL library to the Go community.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Data: Source code of the `gqlgen` library. Sensitivity: High (Confidentiality and Integrity). Unauthorized access or modification could compromise the library's security and functionality.
 - Data: Build artifacts (Docker images). Sensitivity: Medium (Integrity and Availability). Compromised build artifacts could lead to deployment of vulnerable applications.
 - Data: User data processed by GraphQL applications built with `gqlgen`. Sensitivity: Varies (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Sensitivity depends on the specific application and the type of data handled. `gqlgen` itself does not handle user data directly, but applications built with it do.
