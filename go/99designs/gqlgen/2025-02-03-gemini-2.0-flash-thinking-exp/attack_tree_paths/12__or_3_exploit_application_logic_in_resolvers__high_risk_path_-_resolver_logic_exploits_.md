### 4. Deep Analysis: Exploit Application Logic in Resolvers [HIGH RISK PATH - Resolver Logic Exploits]

**Attack Tree Path:** 12. OR 3: Exploit Application Logic in Resolvers [HIGH RISK PATH - Resolver Logic Exploits]

* **Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities within the application's resolvers, where business logic and data access are implemented.

    **Deep Dive:** Resolvers in `gqlgen` are the functions that bridge the GraphQL schema to your application's backend. They are responsible for fetching data, performing mutations, and applying business logic based on GraphQL queries and mutations.  Because resolvers directly interact with databases, external APIs, and internal services, they become critical security checkpoints. Any vulnerability in a resolver can directly expose sensitive data or application functionality.  Attackers specifically target resolvers because they are often the entry points for data manipulation and retrieval within the application.

* **Description:** Attackers focus on exploiting flaws in the resolver code, such as input validation failures, authorization bypasses, or data leakage issues.

    **Deep Dive & Examples:** This description highlights several key vulnerability categories within resolver logic:

    * **Input Validation Failures:**
        * **Problem:** Resolvers might not properly validate input arguments received from GraphQL queries or mutations. This can lead to various injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection if resolvers interact with external systems), format string vulnerabilities, or simply incorrect data processing.
        * **`gqlgen` Context:** While `gqlgen` helps with schema validation of the GraphQL query structure, it does not automatically validate the *content* of input arguments against business logic rules. Developers must implement this validation within resolvers.
        * **Example:** Imagine a `createUser` mutation with an `email` argument. If the resolver doesn't validate the email format or check for uniqueness before inserting into the database, it could lead to invalid data or even injection if the email is used in a raw SQL query.
        * **Code Example (Vulnerable):**
        ```go
        func (r *mutationResolver) CreateUser(ctx context.Context, input model.NewUser) (*model.User, error) {
            db := r.DB // Assume r.DB is a database connection
            _, err := db.Exec("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('" + input.Name + "', '" + input.Email + "')") // Vulnerable to SQL Injection!
            if err != nil {
                return nil, err
            }
            // ... rest of the logic
        }
        ```

    * **Authorization Bypasses:**
        * **Problem:** Resolvers might fail to properly enforce authorization rules, allowing unauthorized users to access data or perform actions they should not be permitted to. This can occur due to missing authorization checks, flawed authorization logic, or incorrect context handling.
        * **`gqlgen` Context:** `gqlgen` provides a `context.Context` to resolvers, which is the ideal place to pass authentication and authorization information. However, developers must explicitly implement authorization checks within resolvers using this context.
        * **Example:** A resolver for fetching user profile information might not check if the currently authenticated user has the right to view the profile of the requested user ID.
        * **Code Example (Vulnerable):**
        ```go
        func (r *queryResolver) UserProfile(ctx context.Context, id string) (*model.UserProfile, error) {
            userID, err := strconv.Atoi(id)
            if err != nil {
                return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid user ID")
            }
            user, err := r.UserService.GetUserByID(userID) // No authorization check!
            if err != nil {
                return nil, err
            }
            return mapToGraphQLUserProfile(user), nil
        }
        ```

    * **Data Leakage Issues:**
        * **Problem:** Resolvers might unintentionally return sensitive data that should not be exposed to the client. This can happen if resolvers fetch more data than necessary and return it directly, or if error handling mechanisms reveal internal system details.
        * **`gqlgen` Context:**  `gqlgen`'s schema-driven approach helps define the data returned, but resolvers still control *what* data is fetched and returned. Over-fetching and improper data filtering in resolvers can lead to leakage.
        * **Example:** A resolver might fetch a user object from the database containing sensitive fields like password hashes or internal IDs and inadvertently include these in the GraphQL response.
        * **Code Example (Vulnerable):**
        ```go
        type UserDatabaseRecord struct {
            ID             int
            Name           string
            Email          string
            PasswordHash   string // Sensitive!
            InternalSystemID string // Sensitive!
        }

        func (r *queryResolver) User(ctx context.Context, id string) (*model.User, error) {
            userID, err := strconv.Atoi(id)
            if err != nil {
                return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid user ID")
            }
            dbUser, err := r.UserRepository.GetUserFromDB(userID) // Fetches UserDatabaseRecord
            if err != nil {
                return nil, err
            }
            // Directly mapping UserDatabaseRecord to GraphQL model, potentially leaking sensitive fields
            gqlUser := &model.User{
                ID:    strconv.Itoa(dbUser.ID),
                Name:  dbUser.Name,
                Email: dbUser.Email,
                // PasswordHash: dbUser.PasswordHash, // Leaking sensitive data if included in GraphQL model!
                // InternalSystemID: dbUser.InternalSystemID, // Leaking sensitive data if included in GraphQL model!
            }
            return gqlUser, nil
        }
        ```

    * **Business Logic Flaws:**
        * **Problem:** Vulnerabilities can exist within the core business logic implemented in resolvers. These flaws might allow attackers to manipulate application state in unintended ways, bypass business rules, or gain unauthorized access through logical inconsistencies or errors in the resolver's code.
        * **`gqlgen` Context:** `gqlgen` provides the framework for resolvers, but the complexity and security of the business logic within resolvers are entirely the responsibility of the developers.
        * **Example:** A resolver for transferring funds between accounts might have a flaw in its logic that allows transferring negative amounts or bypassing account balance checks.

* **Potential Impact:** High to Critical. Data breach, data manipulation, code execution, unauthorized access, privilege escalation, depending on the vulnerability.

    **Deep Dive & Impact Scenarios:** The potential impact of exploiting resolver logic vulnerabilities is indeed high to critical due to the direct access resolvers have to backend systems and data.

    * **Data Breach (Confidentiality Impact):** Exploiting vulnerabilities like SQL injection, authorization bypasses, or data leakage can lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, financial data, and proprietary business information. This can result in reputational damage, legal liabilities, and financial losses.
    * **Data Manipulation (Integrity Impact):**  Vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized data modification can lead to data corruption, financial fraud, and disruption of business operations. Attackers could alter user profiles, modify financial records, or manipulate application state to their advantage.
    * **Code Execution (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Impact):** In severe cases, vulnerabilities like command injection or certain types of injection flaws in resolvers interacting with external systems could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is the most critical impact, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and more.
    * **Unauthorized Access (Confidentiality, Integrity Impact):** Authorization bypass vulnerabilities directly grant attackers unauthorized access to resources and functionalities they should not have. This can range from accessing restricted data to performing administrative actions.
    * **Privilege Escalation (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Impact):** If an attacker can exploit resolver logic to elevate their privileges within the application, they can gain access to more sensitive data and functionalities, compounding the potential damage.

* **Mitigation Strategies:** Secure resolver logic, implement robust input validation, parameterized queries, proper authorization checks, secure data handling, and regular security reviews of resolver code.

    **Deep Dive & Actionable Mitigation Strategies for `gqlgen`:**

    * **Secure Resolver Logic (General Secure Coding Practices):**
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Resolvers should only access and manipulate the data they absolutely need to perform their function. Avoid over-fetching data.
        * **Secure Coding Principles:** Follow general secure coding guidelines, such as avoiding hardcoded secrets, handling errors gracefully (without revealing sensitive information), and writing clean, well-documented code for easier review.
        * **Dependency Management:** Keep dependencies used in resolvers (libraries, SDKs) up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities. Use dependency scanning tools.

    * **Robust Input Validation:**
        * **Server-Side Validation:** **Crucially, always validate input arguments *within* your resolvers.** Do not rely solely on client-side validation or GraphQL schema type definitions for security.
        * **Schema Validation (Type System):** Leverage `gqlgen`'s schema definition to enforce basic type constraints. Define input types with appropriate data types and constraints (e.g., `String!`, `Int!`, custom scalars with validation).
        * **Data Sanitization/Escaping:** Sanitize or escape user inputs before using them in database queries, external API calls, or any other potentially vulnerable context. Use parameterized queries (see below) as the primary defense against injection, but sanitization can be a secondary defense in specific scenarios.
        * **Input Length Limits and Format Checks:** Enforce limits on input string lengths and validate input formats (e.g., email format, date format, phone number format) within resolvers.

    * **Parameterized Queries:**
        * **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.** This is the most effective way to prevent SQL and NoSQL injection attacks.
        * **`gqlgen` Context:** When using database libraries in Go (like `database/sql`, `sqlx`, or ORMs), ensure you are using their parameterized query mechanisms.
        * **Example (Secure - Parameterized Query):**
        ```go
        func (r *mutationResolver) CreateUser(ctx context.Context, input model.NewUser) (*model.User, error) {
            db := r.DB
            _, err := db.Exec("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)", input.Name, input.Email) // Parameterized query using '?' placeholders
            if err != nil {
                return nil, err
            }
            // ... rest of the logic
        }
        ```

    * **Proper Authorization Checks:**
        * **Implement Authorization Logic in Resolvers:**  Perform authorization checks within each resolver that handles sensitive data or actions. Do not assume authorization is handled elsewhere.
        * **Use `gqlgen` Context:**  Access authentication and authorization information from the `context.Context` passed to resolvers. This context should be populated by authentication middleware.
        * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Implement an authorization model (RBAC or ABAC) that aligns with your application's requirements.
        * **Authorization Libraries/Frameworks:** Consider using Go authorization libraries or frameworks to simplify and standardize authorization logic.
        * **Example (Authorization Check in Resolver):**
        ```go
        func (r *queryResolver) UserProfile(ctx context.Context, id string) (*model.UserProfile, error) {
            userID, err := strconv.Atoi(id)
            if err != nil {
                return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid user ID")
            }

            authenticatedUserID := getAuthenticatedUserIDFromContext(ctx) // Function to extract user ID from context
            if !userHasPermissionToViewProfile(authenticatedUserID, userID) { // Authorization check
                return nil, fmt.Errorf("unauthorized to view this profile")
            }

            user, err := r.UserService.GetUserByID(userID)
            if err != nil {
                return nil, err
            }
            return mapToGraphQLUserProfile(user), nil
        }
        ```

    * **Secure Data Handling:**
        * **Data Minimization:** Only fetch and return the data that is absolutely necessary for the GraphQL query. Avoid over-fetching and returning sensitive fields unnecessarily.
        * **Data Filtering and Transformation:**  Filter and transform data within resolvers before returning it to the client to ensure only authorized and non-sensitive information is exposed. Map database entities to GraphQL models carefully, omitting sensitive fields from the GraphQL schema if they should not be exposed.
        * **Sensitive Data Handling:**  Handle sensitive data (passwords, API keys, etc.) securely. Never store passwords in plain text. Use proper hashing algorithms. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit where appropriate.
        * **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in resolvers. Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages. Log errors appropriately for debugging and security monitoring.

    * **Regular Security Reviews of Resolver Code:**
        * **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular peer code reviews focusing on security aspects of resolver logic.
        * **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Use SAST tools to automatically scan resolver code for potential vulnerabilities.
        * **Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST) and Penetration Testing:** Perform DAST and penetration testing to identify runtime vulnerabilities in resolvers and the overall application.
        * **Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the entire `gqlgen` application, including resolvers, schema, and underlying infrastructure.

**Conclusion and Actionable Steps:**

Exploiting application logic in resolvers represents a significant high-risk attack path in `gqlgen` applications.
