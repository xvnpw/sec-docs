# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for 99designs/gqlgen

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Input Validation (gqlgen Schema & Resolvers)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_input_validation__gqlgen_schema_&_resolvers_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schema Definition with Types and Constraints:** Leverage gqlgen's schema definition language to define precise data types for your GraphQL schema. Utilize features like `nonNull` to enforce required fields and define scalar types with specific formats. While gqlgen doesn't have built-in directives for complex validation rules, the schema serves as the first layer of input type definition.
    2.  **Resolver-Level Validation Logic:** Implement explicit input validation within your gqlgen resolver functions.
        *   Access input arguments passed to resolvers.
        *   Use Go's standard library or external validation libraries *within your resolvers* to perform detailed validation checks based on the schema types and business logic.
        *   Validate data ranges, formats (e.g., email, URLs), and custom business rules directly in the resolver code before processing data.
    3.  **gqlgen Error Handling for Validation Failures:** When validation fails in resolvers, use `fmt.Errorf` or custom error types to return errors. gqlgen's error handling will propagate these errors back to the client. Ensure error messages are user-friendly and avoid exposing sensitive server-side details.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command Injection) - High Severity:** By validating input within resolvers *before* database interactions or system calls, you prevent malicious code injection. gqlgen itself doesn't introduce injection, but resolvers are the bridge to backend systems where injection can occur.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues - Medium Severity:** Ensures data consistency by rejecting invalid data at the resolver level, preventing it from being processed and stored through gqlgen mutations.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Low Severity (Input-based):** Prevents certain input-based DoS by rejecting malformed requests early in the resolver processing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Denial of Service (Input-based):** Low Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in resolvers for user creation and update mutations in `internal/resolvers/user.go`. Basic type checking and presence checks are in place within resolvers.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing detailed validation logic in resolvers for all input fields across all mutations and queries.
    *   Lack of standardized validation library usage *within resolvers*.
    *   No validation for complex data formats (e.g., email, URLs) in resolvers for product creation and order processing mutations in `internal/resolvers/product.go` and `internal/resolvers/order.go`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Complexity Limiting (gqlgen Middleware)](./mitigation_strategies/query_complexity_limiting__gqlgen_middleware_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Complexity Calculation Logic (Custom Go Code):** Implement a Go function that analyzes a GraphQL query (represented as an `ast.Document` from gqlgen's parsing) and calculates a complexity score. This function needs to traverse the query AST and consider:
        *   Number of fields selected.
        *   Depth of nested selections.
        *   Arguments used in fields (especially list arguments).
    2.  **gqlgen Middleware Integration:** Create a gqlgen middleware function in Go. This middleware will:
        *   Receive the `graphql.OperationContext` provided by gqlgen.
        *   Access the parsed query document from the `OperationContext`.
        *   Call the complexity calculation function to get the query's complexity score.
        *   Compare the score to a configured maximum complexity limit.
        *   If the limit is exceeded, return an error using `graphql.Errorf` within the middleware, which gqlgen will handle and return to the client.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High Severity:** Prevents attackers from exploiting GraphQL's flexibility to send excessively complex queries that can overload the server. gqlgen applications are vulnerable to this if not mitigated.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. No query complexity analysis or limiting middleware is currently in place in the gqlgen setup.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Requires implementation of the query complexity calculation function in Go.
    *   Needs creation of a gqlgen middleware function to integrate the complexity calculation and enforce limits.
    *   Configuration for setting the maximum query complexity limit needs to be added to the application and accessed by the middleware.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Fine-grained Authorization (gqlgen Context & Resolvers)](./mitigation_strategies/fine-grained_authorization__gqlgen_context_&_resolvers_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Authentication Middleware (Populating gqlgen Context):** Ensure your authentication middleware (as previously described) correctly extracts user identity and roles/permissions and places this information into the `graphql.Context` using `graphql.WithFieldContext`. This makes authentication data accessible within resolvers.
    2.  **Authorization Checks in Resolvers (Using gqlgen Context):** In each resolver function that requires authorization:
        *   Retrieve the user information from the `graphql.Context` using `graphql.GetFieldContext`.
        *   Implement authorization logic *within the resolver* based on the user's roles, permissions, or attributes obtained from the context.
        *   Check if the user is authorized to access the specific data or perform the operation being resolved.
        *   If unauthorized, return an authorization error using `graphql.Error` within the resolver. gqlgen will handle this error and return it to the client.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access - High Severity:** Prevents authenticated users from accessing data or performing operations they are not specifically permitted to. Resolvers in gqlgen are the enforcement points for authorization.
    *   **Privilege Escalation - High Severity:** Reduces the risk of users gaining access beyond their intended privileges by enforcing authorization at the resolver level in gqlgen.
    *   **Data Breaches - Medium Severity:** Limits the scope of potential data breaches by restricting data access based on authorization rules enforced in gqlgen resolvers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic role-based authorization is implemented in resolvers for administrative mutations (e.g., user management) in `internal/resolvers/user.go`. Resolvers check for the "admin" role retrieved from the gqlgen context.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Authorization checks are not consistently applied across *all* resolvers that handle sensitive data or operations.
    *   Authorization logic is often embedded directly in resolvers, making it less maintainable. Consider abstracting authorization logic into reusable functions or services called from resolvers.
    *   More granular permissions beyond simple roles are not implemented in resolvers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Customized Error Handling (gqlgen Error Presenter)](./mitigation_strategies/customized_error_handling__gqlgen_error_presenter_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement gqlgen Error Presenter:** Configure a custom error presenter function in your gqlgen setup. This function is a hook that gqlgen calls for every GraphQL error before sending the response to the client.
    2.  **Error Masking and Sanitization in Presenter:** Within the error presenter function:
        *   Inspect the `graphql.ErrorResponse` provided by gqlgen.
        *   For each error in the `Errors` slice, modify the `Message` field to replace detailed server-side error messages with generic, user-friendly messages.
        *   Remove or sanitize any sensitive information from the error extensions or other error details that might be exposed to the client.
    3.  **Detailed Logging (Separate from Presenter):** Implement separate logging within your application to capture the *original*, detailed error information *before* it is masked by the error presenter. This logging should include original error messages, stack traces, and request context for debugging.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure - Medium Severity:** Prevents attackers from gaining sensitive information about the server's internal workings, configurations, or vulnerabilities through detailed GraphQL error responses. gqlgen's default error handling might expose too much information.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration - Low Severity:** Reduces the risk of unintentionally exposing sensitive information through default gqlgen error handling.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Security Misconfiguration:** Low Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Custom error formatting is partially implemented in `internal/errors/handler.go`, which is likely used as a custom error presenter in gqlgen configuration. Generic error messages are returned, but the masking might not be comprehensive.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Error masking in the presenter might not be consistently applied to all error types generated by gqlgen or resolvers.
    *   Detailed server-side logging of *original* errors (before masking) needs to be explicitly implemented alongside the error presenter.
    *   Error categorization and specific generic messages for different error types could be improved in the presenter.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Schema Introspection Control (gqlgen Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/schema_introspection_control__gqlgen_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Introspection in Production (gqlgen Configuration):** When configuring your gqlgen GraphQL handler for production environments, explicitly disable schema introspection. This is typically done through a configuration option or by omitting the introspection query handler when setting up the gqlgen HTTP server.
    2.  **Enable Introspection in Development/Staging (gqlgen Configuration):** Ensure introspection remains enabled in development and staging environments for development tools and schema exploration during development. This is usually the default behavior of gqlgen.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure - Low Severity:** Reduces information disclosure about the API structure. While not a primary security vulnerability, hiding the schema makes it slightly harder for attackers to understand the API surface and potentially identify weaknesses. This is a defense-in-depth measure relevant to gqlgen APIs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Low Risk Reduction (Defense in Depth)

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Schema introspection is currently enabled in all environments (development, staging, production) in the gqlgen configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   gqlgen configuration needs to be updated to disable introspection specifically for the production environment. This is usually a simple configuration flag or option when initializing the gqlgen handler.
