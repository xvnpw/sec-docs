## High and Critical gqlgen Threats

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected gqlgen Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Denial of Service via Complex Queries** | An attacker crafts excessively nested or computationally expensive GraphQL queries that consume significant server resources (CPU, memory, database connections). This directly leverages `gqlgen`'s query parsing and execution capabilities without sufficient safeguards. | Server performance degradation, resource exhaustion, and potential service outage, impacting availability for legitimate users. | Request Handling | High | **Implement query complexity analysis and limiting.** Use libraries or custom logic (or potentially `gqlgen` plugins if available) to analyze query depth, field count, and other factors to reject overly complex queries *before* execution. **Set timeouts for query execution within `gqlgen`'s configuration or resolver context.** |
| **Malicious Schema Injection (Indirect)** | If the source of the `.graphqls` files is compromised (e.g., through a vulnerable CI/CD pipeline), an attacker could inject malicious schema definitions. `gqlgen` will then use this compromised schema for code generation. | Could lead to the generation of vulnerable resolver code *by `gqlgen`*, introduction of new attack vectors exposed through the generated GraphQL API, or denial of service by defining excessively complex types that `gqlgen` struggles to process. | Schema Definition, Code Generation | High | **Secure the source of truth for the schema files.** Implement strict access controls and integrity checks on the schema repository. **Automate schema validation as part of the build process before `gqlgen` code generation.** |
| **Malicious Directives** | If the application uses custom directives, vulnerabilities in the directive's implementation can be triggered by crafted queries. This directly exploits `gqlgen`'s directive processing mechanism. | Authorization bypass, data manipulation, or denial of service depending on the directive's functionality. The attacker can leverage the directive's logic to perform unintended actions. | Directives | High | **Thoroughly review and test custom directive implementations.** Ensure proper authorization and input validation *within the directive's logic*. **Treat directive code with the same security scrutiny as core application logic.** |
| **Malicious Plugins** | If the application uses `gqlgen` plugins, vulnerabilities in the plugin code or the plugin's interaction with `gqlgen` can introduce critical security risks. `gqlgen` directly integrates and executes plugin code. |  Potentially leading to remote code execution within the `gqlgen` process, data breaches by manipulating data during request processing, or denial of service by crashing the server or consuming resources. The plugin has direct access to `gqlgen`'s internals. | Plugins | Critical | **Carefully vet and audit any third-party or custom `gqlgen` plugins.** Understand the plugin's code and its impact on the application. **Implement strong security practices for plugin development, including input validation and secure API usage.**  Consider using only well-established and maintained plugins. |
