Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve `gqlgen` and have a high or critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Overly Complex or Deeply Nested Queries
    *   **Description:** Attackers can craft GraphQL queries with excessive nesting or a large number of fields, forcing the server to perform a significant amount of computation and potentially leading to denial-of-service (DoS).
    *   **How gqlgen Contributes:** `gqlgen` parses and executes these complex queries based on the defined schema. The efficiency of the resolvers becomes critical in handling such queries.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a query with multiple nested levels of relationships or requests a large number of connections, overwhelming the server's resources.
    *   **Impact:** Server performance degradation, resource exhaustion, and potential service unavailability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement query complexity analysis and limits within the `gqlgen` setup or using middleware. This can involve assigning costs to different fields and rejecting queries exceeding a threshold.
        *   Set timeouts for query execution within the `gqlgen` configuration or server framework to prevent long-running queries from consuming resources indefinitely.

*   **Attack Surface:** Custom Directives
    *   **Description:** `gqlgen` allows developers to create custom directives to add specific logic to the GraphQL schema. If these directives are not implemented securely, they can introduce new vulnerabilities.
    *   **How gqlgen Contributes:** `gqlgen` provides the framework for defining and executing custom directives. The security of these directives depends entirely on the developer's implementation within the `gqlgen` ecosystem.
    *   **Example:** A custom authorization directive implemented using `gqlgen` has a flaw that allows unauthorized users to bypass access controls.
    *   **Impact:**  Authorization bypass, data manipulation, or other vulnerabilities depending on the directive's functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the directive's purpose)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom directive implementations for potential security flaws. Treat them as critical security components within the `gqlgen` application.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom directives, ensuring proper input validation and authorization checks within the directive's logic.
        *   Consider the security implications of any external dependencies used within custom directives implemented within the `gqlgen` context.
