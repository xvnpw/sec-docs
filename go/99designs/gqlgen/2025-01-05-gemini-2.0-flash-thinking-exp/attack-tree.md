# Attack Tree Analysis for 99designs/gqlgen

Objective: Compromise Application Using gqlgen Weaknesses

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   Exploit Schema Definition Weaknesses
    *   Schema Poisoning (**Critical Node**)
    *   Code Injection via Schema Directives or Extensions (**Critical Node**)
*   Exploit Resolver Implementation Weaknesses (Indirectly related to gqlgen's handling) (**High-Risk Path**)
    *   Insecure Resolver Logic Exposed by gqlgen (**Critical Node**)
*   Exploit Custom Directive Weaknesses (**Critical Node**)
    *   Logic Errors in Custom Directives
*   Information Disclosure via Error Handling (**High-Risk Path**)
    *   Verbose Error Messages
```
