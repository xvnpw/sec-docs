# Attack Surface Analysis for 99designs/gqlgen

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service via Complex Queries](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_via_complex_queries.md)

* **Description:** Attackers send excessively complex or deeply nested GraphQL queries that consume significant server resources, leading to performance degradation or service unavailability.
    * **How gqlgen Contributes:** `gqlgen` processes and executes the queries it receives. The framework itself doesn't inherently prevent the processing of complex queries, making applications built with it susceptible if no additional safeguards are implemented.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a query with numerous nested object selections and aliases, forcing `gqlgen` to resolve a large amount of data, potentially overwhelming server resources.
    * **Impact:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion, increased infrastructure costs.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Query Complexity Analysis Middleware:** Implement middleware or custom logic that intercepts and analyzes incoming queries before execution, rejecting those exceeding predefined complexity thresholds.
        * **Query Depth Limiting:** Implement middleware or configuration to limit the maximum depth of allowed queries processed by `gqlgen`.
        * **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor server resource usage to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks targeting `gqlgen`'s query processing capabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Directives](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_directives.md)

* **Description:** If the application uses custom GraphQL directives, vulnerabilities in their implementation can be exploited, potentially leading to significant security breaches.
    * **How gqlgen Contributes:** `gqlgen` provides the mechanism for defining and executing custom directives. The security of these directives is entirely the responsibility of the developer implementing them within the `gqlgen` framework.
    * **Example:** A custom authorization directive implemented within `gqlgen` has a flaw allowing unauthorized access to certain fields or mutations.
    * **Impact:** Authorization bypass, unintended data access or modification, potential for other vulnerabilities depending on the directive's functionality.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Directive Implementation:** Follow secure coding practices meticulously when developing custom directives for `gqlgen`.
        * **Thorough Testing of Directives:** Rigorously test custom directives for potential vulnerabilities, including edge cases and unexpected inputs.
        * **Code Reviews for Directives:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom directive implementations to identify potential security flaws.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege for Directives:** Ensure custom directives only have the necessary permissions and access to perform their intended actions within the `gqlgen` execution context.
