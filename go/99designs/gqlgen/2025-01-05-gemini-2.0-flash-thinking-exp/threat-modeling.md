# Threat Model Analysis for 99designs/gqlgen

## Threat: [Code Injection via Schema Directives](./threats/code_injection_via_schema_directives.md)

**Description:** If custom schema directives are used that involve code generation based on arguments or other dynamic data, an attacker might inject malicious code through these arguments if they are not properly sanitized. This could lead to arbitrary code execution during the `gqlgen` generate process.

**Impact:**  Potentially complete compromise of the build environment or the generated application.

**Affected gqlgen Component:** Code Generation module, specifically custom directive handlers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate any input used in custom directive logic that influences code generation.
*   Avoid generating code directly based on user-provided input within directives if possible.
*   Implement strict access controls for modifying schema definitions and custom directive implementations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Generated Boilerplate Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_generated_boilerplate_code.md)

**Description:**  Although unlikely, a security vulnerability could exist within the core `gqlgen` code generation logic itself. This would mean that all applications generated with that vulnerable version of `gqlgen` would inherit the flaw.

**Impact:**  Widespread vulnerabilities across applications using the affected `gqlgen` version. The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Affected gqlgen Component:** Code Generation module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `gqlgen` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
*   Monitor `gqlgen`'s release notes and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using static analysis tools on the generated code to identify potential issues.

## Threat: [GraphQL Query Complexity Attacks (Exploiting `gqlgen`'s Execution Engine)](./threats/graphql_query_complexity_attacks__exploiting__gqlgen_'s_execution_engine_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts excessively complex GraphQL queries with deep nesting, numerous aliases, or expensive field resolutions, overwhelming the server's resources during query execution by `gqlgen`.

**Impact:**  Denial of service, impacting the availability of the GraphQL API.

**Affected gqlgen Component:** Query Execution engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement query complexity analysis and limits. This can be done through external libraries or by configuring custom logic within resolvers or middleware.
*   Set timeouts for GraphQL query execution.
*   Monitor resource utilization of the GraphQL server.

## Threat: [Batching Vulnerabilities (If Insecurely Implemented with Data Loaders)](./threats/batching_vulnerabilities__if_insecurely_implemented_with_data_loaders_.md)

**Description:** If using `gqlgen`'s data loader capabilities for batching, improper implementation of authorization or input validation within the batching logic could allow attackers to bypass security checks or manipulate data across batched requests.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized data access or modification.

**Affected gqlgen Component:** Data Loader implementation within resolvers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure proper authorization checks are performed within the batching function, considering all items in the batch.
*   Validate input for each item within a batched request.
*   Avoid relying solely on per-item authorization if the batching logic can bypass these checks.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass in Resolvers](./threats/authorization_bypass_in_resolvers.md)

**Description:**  Authorization logic within resolvers might be flawed or missing, allowing attackers to access data or perform actions they are not authorized to. While the resolver logic is developer-implemented, `gqlgen`'s context and execution flow are involved.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.

**Affected gqlgen Component:** Developer-implemented resolvers and the context mechanism used for authorization within `gqlgen`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authorization checks in resolvers, verifying user permissions before accessing or modifying data.
*   Utilize `gqlgen`'s context to pass authentication and authorization information to resolvers.
*   Adopt an authorization framework or library to manage permissions effectively.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `gqlgen` Plugins](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__gqlgen__plugins.md)

**Description:** If using third-party `gqlgen` plugins, vulnerabilities within those plugins can impact the security of the application.

**Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability within the plugin; could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Affected gqlgen Component:**  Third-party `gqlgen` plugins.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully vet the security of any third-party `gqlgen` plugins before using them.
*   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions.
*   Monitor for security advisories related to the plugins being used.
