## Deep Analysis: Code Injection via Schema Directives in gqlgen Applications

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Code Injection via Schema Directives" threat within the context of applications using the `gqlgen` library for GraphQL schema generation and server implementation in Go.

**1. Threat Breakdown:**

* **Threat Name:** Code Injection via Schema Directives
* **Target:** The `gqlgen` code generation process, specifically the execution of custom directive handlers.
* **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted arguments passed to custom schema directives within the GraphQL schema definition.
* **Mechanism:** Exploiting insufficient input sanitization and validation within the logic of custom directive handlers that perform code generation based on these arguments.
* **Outcome:** Execution of arbitrary code on the machine running the `gqlgen generate` command. This could be a developer's workstation, a build server, or any environment where the code generation process takes place.

**2. Detailed Explanation:**

`gqlgen` allows developers to extend the functionality of their GraphQL schema using directives. Custom directives are defined in the schema and their behavior is implemented in Go code. When `gqlgen generate` is executed, it parses the schema and executes the logic associated with these directives.

The vulnerability arises when a custom directive handler uses arguments provided in the schema definition to dynamically generate code. If these arguments are not properly sanitized, an attacker who can influence the schema definition (e.g., through a compromised repository, a vulnerable CI/CD pipeline, or by convincing a developer to introduce a malicious schema change) can inject malicious code within these arguments.

During the `gqlgen generate` process, the Go code implementing the directive handler will interpret these malicious arguments and potentially execute them as part of the code generation process. This is akin to classic code injection vulnerabilities, but instead of targeting a running application, it targets the build process itself.

**3. Technical Deep Dive:**

Let's consider a simplified example of a vulnerable custom directive:

```graphql
directive @log(message: String!) on FIELD_DEFINITION

type Query {
  hello: String @log(message: "Hello from the server")
}
```

Now, let's imagine a custom directive handler implementation in Go that uses the `message` argument to generate logging code:

```go
package handlers

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/99designs/gqlgen/codegen"
	"github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql"
)

func LogDirective(ctx context.Context, obj interface{}, next graphql.Resolver, message string) (res interface{}, err error) {
	// Vulnerable code: Directly embedding the message in generated code
	codegen.AddGoTemplate("log_directive", fmt.Sprintf(`
		func() {
			fmt.Println("%s")
		}()
	`, message))
	return next(ctx)
}
```

In this vulnerable example, the `message` argument is directly interpolated into a `fmt.Println` statement within a generated Go function.

An attacker could modify the schema to inject malicious code:

```graphql
directive @log(message: String!) on FIELD_DEFINITION

type Query {
  hello: String @log(message: `"; import "os"; func init() { os.RemoveAll("/tmp/malicious_payload"); } //`)
}
```

When `gqlgen generate` is executed, the `LogDirective` handler will receive the malicious string as the `message` argument. The generated code would then look something like this:

```go
func() {
  fmt.Println(`"; import "os"; func init() { os.RemoveAll("/tmp/malicious_payload"); } //`)
}()
```

The injected code `import "os"; func init() { os.RemoveAll("/tmp/malicious_payload"); }` will be executed during the `gqlgen generate` process, potentially deleting files or performing other malicious actions on the build environment.

**4. Attack Scenarios:**

* **Compromised Repository:** An attacker gains access to the project's Git repository and modifies the GraphQL schema, injecting malicious code through directive arguments.
* **Vulnerable CI/CD Pipeline:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the CI/CD pipeline that allows them to modify the schema definition before the `gqlgen generate` step.
* **Malicious Dependency:** A dependency used by a custom directive handler contains a vulnerability that allows for code injection when processing directive arguments.
* **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with access to the schema definition introduces malicious directives or modifies existing ones with malicious arguments.
* **Social Engineering:** An attacker tricks a developer into introducing a malicious schema change containing injected code.

**5. Impact Assessment (Expanded):**

The impact of this vulnerability can be severe, potentially leading to:

* **Build Environment Compromise:** Attackers can gain full control over the build environment, allowing them to:
    * Steal secrets and credentials used in the build process.
    * Modify build artifacts, injecting backdoors or malware into the final application.
    * Disrupt the build process, leading to denial of service.
* **Supply Chain Attack:** By compromising the build process, attackers can inject malicious code into the application that is distributed to end-users, leading to a supply chain attack.
* **Data Breach:** Attackers might be able to access sensitive data present in the build environment or used during the code generation process.
* **Compromised Developer Workstations:** If the `gqlgen generate` command is run on developer workstations, the attacker can compromise these machines.
* **Loss of Trust:** A successful attack can severely damage the reputation and trust of the organization.

**6. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**

* **Thorough Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only allow necessary characters and formats in directive arguments. Use regular expressions or predefined allowlists for validation.
    * **Contextual Escaping:** Escape special characters based on how the argument will be used in the generated code (e.g., escaping for string literals, shell commands, etc.).
    * **Avoid Direct Interpolation:**  Instead of directly embedding arguments in code strings, use safer methods like templating engines with proper escaping mechanisms or parameterized code generation.
* **Avoid Generating Code Directly Based on User-Provided Input:**
    * **Configuration-Driven Approach:**  Favor configuration over code generation based on dynamic input. Define allowed options or configurations and reference them in the schema.
    * **Limited Code Generation:**  Restrict the scope of code generation within directives. Focus on manipulating metadata or generating boilerplate code rather than complex logic based on external input.
* **Strict Access Controls:**
    * **Version Control:** Maintain strict version control over the GraphQL schema and custom directive implementations.
    * **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews for any changes to the schema or directive handlers.
    * **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Restrict who can modify the schema files and the Go code implementing the directives.
* **Secure Coding Practices for Directive Handlers:**
    * **Treat Directive Arguments as Untrusted Input:** Always assume that directive arguments are potentially malicious.
    * **Principle of Least Authority:** Grant the directive handler only the necessary permissions to perform its task.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the schema and directive implementations.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Generated Code (Where Applicable):** While this primarily applies to web applications, consider if CSP-like mechanisms can be used to limit the capabilities of the generated code.
* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools to scan the GraphQL schema and directive handler code for potential vulnerabilities.
* **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies and scan them for known vulnerabilities. Be cautious about introducing new dependencies, especially those used in directive handlers.
* **Secure Development Training:** Educate developers about the risks of code injection and secure coding practices for GraphQL directives.

**7. Detection Strategies:**

* **Monitoring Build Logs:** Look for unusual activity or errors during the `gqlgen generate` process. Unexpected file modifications or command executions could be indicators of an attack.
* **Version Control History Analysis:** Review the commit history of the GraphQL schema and directive implementations for suspicious changes or additions.
* **File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement tools that monitor the integrity of files in the build environment, alerting on unexpected modifications.
* **Security Scanning of Generated Code:** Analyze the generated Go code for potentially malicious code patterns or unexpected behavior.
* **Anomaly Detection in Build Times:** Significant increases in build times could indicate malicious activity.

**8. Response Strategies:**

In the event of a suspected or confirmed code injection attack via schema directives:

* **Isolate the Affected Environment:** Immediately isolate the compromised build environment to prevent further damage.
* **Identify the Scope of the Attack:** Determine which systems and applications might have been affected.
* **Analyze Build Logs and Artifacts:** Examine build logs and generated code to understand the attacker's actions and the extent of the compromise.
* **Restore from a Clean Backup:** If possible, restore the build environment and schema definitions from a known good backup.
* **Review and Harden Security Controls:** Thoroughly review and strengthen access controls, input validation, and other security measures.
* **Notify Stakeholders:** Inform relevant stakeholders about the incident.
* **Conduct a Post-Mortem Analysis:** Analyze the root cause of the vulnerability and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.

**9. gqlgen Specific Considerations:**

* **Understanding Directive Handler Execution:** Developers need a clear understanding of how `gqlgen` executes directive handlers during the code generation process.
* **codegen Package Awareness:** Be mindful of the functionalities offered by the `github.com/99designs/gqlgen/codegen` package, especially functions that allow for code generation.
* **Custom Scalar Types:** If custom scalar types are used in directive arguments, ensure their unmarshalling logic is also secure and does not introduce vulnerabilities.
* **gqlgen Configuration:** Review `gqlgen.yml` for any settings that might influence directive execution or code generation.

**10. Conclusion:**

Code Injection via Schema Directives is a serious threat in `gqlgen` applications. By understanding the attack vector and implementing robust mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability. A defense-in-depth approach, combining secure coding practices, strict access controls, and proactive monitoring, is crucial for protecting the build environment and the integrity of the generated application. Regular security assessments and developer training are essential to maintain a strong security posture against this type of threat.
