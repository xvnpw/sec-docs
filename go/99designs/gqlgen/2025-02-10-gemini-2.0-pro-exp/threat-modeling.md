# Threat Model Analysis for 99designs/gqlgen

## Threat: [Schema Introspection Exposure](./threats/schema_introspection_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses the GraphQL introspection query (`__schema`, `__type`, etc.) to discover the entire schema, including fields, types, queries, mutations, and descriptions, even those intended to be internal or restricted. The attacker can then use this information to craft targeted attacks or understand the system's inner workings.  This is a *direct* threat because `gqlgen` enables introspection by default.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of the application's data model, potential exposure of sensitive fields or operations, aiding further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** `handler.NewDefaultServer` (and related server initialization functions), schema generation process. The core issue is the default enabling of introspection.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical if sensitive data or operations are exposed).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable introspection in production: Set `IntrospectionEnabled: false` in the `handler.Config` when creating the server.
    *   Restrict introspection access: Use middleware to authenticate and authorize access to the introspection endpoint (if needed for development or specific tools).
    *   Use schema directives: Employ `@skip`, `@include`, or custom directives to hide specific fields or types from introspection.

## Threat: [Query Complexity DoS](./threats/query_complexity_dos.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a deeply nested GraphQL query, potentially with recursive fragments, that consumes excessive server resources (CPU, memory) when resolved. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. This is a *direct* threat because `gqlgen` doesn't inherently limit query complexity.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, application unavailability.
*   **Affected Component:** `handler.OperationMiddleware`, resolvers (which execute the query logic). The core issue is the lack of built-in complexity limits.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement query complexity analysis: Use `handler.OperationMiddleware` to intercept queries, calculate their complexity (using a library or custom logic), and reject queries exceeding a threshold.
    *   Set `handler.MaxDepth`: Limit the maximum depth of a query using the built-in `MaxDepth` option in `handler.Config`.
    *   Implement query cost analysis: Assign costs to fields and limit the total cost of a query.
    *   Rate limiting: Implement rate limiting (though this is a general DoS mitigation, it's crucial in the context of GraphQL's flexibility).

## Threat: [Query Batching Amplification](./threats/query_batching_amplification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a single GraphQL request containing a large number of operations (queries or mutations).  This amplifies the impact of other attacks, such as query complexity or resource-intensive mutations. This is a *direct* threat because `gqlgen` allows batching without inherent limits.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, resource exhaustion, potential for amplified data modification.
*   **Affected Component:** `handler.OperationMiddleware` (needed for custom handling), the request parsing logic within `gqlgen`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Limit batch size: Implement custom middleware (using `handler.OperationMiddleware`) to parse the request and count the number of operations. Reject requests exceeding a predefined limit.
    *   Apply complexity/cost limits to the *entire* batch: Ensure that complexity and cost analysis considers the total cost of all operations in the batch, not just individual operations.

## Threat: [Unbounded List Result Exhaustion](./threats/unbounded_list_result_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker requests a list field without specifying any pagination limits (e.g., `first`, `last`, `after`, `before`). If the resolver returns a very large list, this can consume excessive server memory and lead to a denial-of-service. This is a *direct* threat if `gqlgen`'s generated code doesn't enforce pagination by default (which depends on how you structure your schema and use Relay connections).
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, memory exhaustion.
*   **Affected Component:** Resolvers that return lists, `gqlgen`'s code generation for list fields (if not using Relay-style connections).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce pagination:  Make pagination arguments (e.g., `first`, `after`) mandatory for all list fields.  Use Relay-style connections (supported by `gqlgen`) for a standardized approach.
    *   Implement default and maximum page sizes:  Set default values for `first` (if not provided) and enforce a maximum value to prevent excessively large requests.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Mutation Execution](./threats/unauthorized_mutation_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a mutation request that they should not be authorized to perform. If the resolver lacks proper authorization checks, the mutation will be executed, leading to unauthorized data modification or deletion. While authorization *itself* isn't unique to `gqlgen`, the fact that `gqlgen` generates the mutation handling code makes it a *direct* concern to ensure authorization is correctly implemented *within* that generated code.
*   **Impact:** Data tampering, data loss, unauthorized actions.
*   **Affected Component:** Mutation resolvers. The core issue is the developer's responsibility to implement authorization *within* the `gqlgen`-generated resolver.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement authorization checks in *every* mutation resolver: Before performing any data modification, verify that the current user has the necessary permissions.
    *   Use a consistent authorization framework: Employ a library or framework to manage authorization rules and avoid inconsistencies.
    *   Consider schema directives for authorization: Define authorization rules at the schema level using directives, and enforce them with middleware. This leverages `gqlgen`'s directive support.
