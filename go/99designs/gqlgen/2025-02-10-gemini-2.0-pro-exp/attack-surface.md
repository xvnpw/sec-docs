# Attack Surface Analysis for 99designs/gqlgen

## Attack Surface: [Deeply Nested Queries (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/deeply_nested_queries__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can craft queries with excessive nesting, consuming server resources (CPU, memory, database connections).
    *   **gqlgen Contribution:** `gqlgen` doesn't inherently limit query depth, allowing arbitrarily deep queries. This is a *direct* contribution.
    *   **Example:** `query { users { posts { comments { author { friends { ... } } } } } }` (repeated many times).
    *   **Impact:** Server crash or unresponsiveness, denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Maximum Query Depth:** Use `gqlgen`'s `RequestMiddleware` to analyze the query AST and reject queries exceeding a predefined depth limit (e.g., 10 levels). This is the *primary* mitigation.
        *   **Monitor Resource Usage:** Track CPU, memory, and database connection usage. Set alerts for anomalies.

## Attack Surface: [List Multiplier Attacks (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/list_multiplier_attacks__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting fields that return lists within other lists to cause exponential resource consumption.
    *   **gqlgen Contribution:** `gqlgen` allows fields to return lists without inherent limits on the number of items returned *per request*. This lack of built-in limits is a direct contribution.
    *   **Example:** `query { users { posts { comments } } }` where each user has many posts, and each post has many comments.
    *   **Impact:** Server overload, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pagination:** Implement pagination (e.g., Relay-style connections) on *all* list fields to limit the number of items returned per request.  This is *crucial* and directly addresses `gqlgen`'s lack of built-in list limits.
        *   **Cost Analysis (see below):** Use cost analysis to account for the potential size of lists.

## Attack Surface: [Excessive Query Cost (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/excessive_query_cost__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** Queries that, while not deeply nested, are computationally expensive due to the combination of fields selected.
    *   **gqlgen Contribution:** `gqlgen` doesn't inherently limit the overall "cost" of a query, relying entirely on the developer to implement cost controls. This is a direct contribution.
    *   **Example:** `query { allProducts { name, description, price, reviews(limit: 1000) { content, author { ... } } } }` (where `allProducts` and `reviews` are expensive to resolve).
    *   **Impact:** Server slowdown or unresponsiveness, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Query Cost Analysis:** Use `gqlgen`'s extension points (specifically `RequestMiddleware`) to calculate a cost for each field and reject queries exceeding a total cost limit.  Consider both static and dynamic cost analysis. This is the *primary* mitigation and directly addresses `gqlgen`'s lack of built-in cost limiting.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting per user or IP address to prevent abuse (this is a general mitigation, but helpful here).

## Attack Surface: [Resolver Authorization Bypass (Data Breach/Unauthorized Actions)](./attack_surfaces/resolver_authorization_bypass__data_breachunauthorized_actions_.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to properly check user permissions within resolvers, leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
    *   **gqlgen Contribution:** While authorization *itself* isn't `gqlgen`'s responsibility, the *structure* of GraphQL and `gqlgen`'s resolver-based architecture makes this a *critical* area to focus on.  The decentralized nature of resolvers (compared to, say, a traditional REST API with centralized controllers) increases the risk of overlooking authorization checks.  This is an *indirect but significant* contribution.
    *   **Example:** A resolver for `user(id: ID!): User` doesn't check if the requesting user has permission to view the requested user's data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Consistent Authorization:** Implement a robust and consistent authorization framework *within every resolver* that accesses sensitive data or performs actions.  Do not rely solely on client-side checks.  This is *absolutely critical* in a GraphQL context.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure resolvers only have access to the data and resources they absolutely need.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Failures (Various - leading to Critical issues)](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_failures__various_-_leading_to_critical_issues_.md)

*   **Description:** Insufficient validation of input arguments to resolvers. While basic type checking is done, complex validation is left to the developer.
    *   **gqlgen Contribution:** `gqlgen` performs basic type checking based on the schema (e.g., Int, String) but doesn't handle complex validation or sanitization, leaving a significant gap. This is a *direct* contribution.
    *   **Example:** A resolver accepts a `String` argument for a database ID without validating it's a UUID, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the ID format is crucial for security.
    *   **Impact:** Varies; can lead to data corruption, injection vulnerabilities, or other security issues, potentially escalating to *critical* severity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Input Validation:** Validate *all* input arguments to resolvers. Sanitize data before use.
        *   **Custom Scalars:** Define custom scalar types (e.g., `UUID`, `Email`) for stricter validation. This leverages `gqlgen`'s features to improve input safety.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent injection.
