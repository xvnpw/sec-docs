# Deep Analysis of GraphQL (gqlgen) Injection Vulnerabilities

## 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the specific attack path "2.2 Injection Vulnerabilities in Resolvers" within a GraphQL application built using the `gqlgen` library.  This analysis aims to identify potential attack vectors, assess the impact of successful exploitation, and propose concrete mitigation strategies beyond the high-level description provided in the attack tree.  The goal is to provide actionable guidance for developers to secure their `gqlgen` resolvers against injection attacks.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on injection vulnerabilities that can occur within the **resolver functions** of a `gqlgen`-based GraphQL application.  It considers:

*   **Data Sources:**  The analysis encompasses various data sources commonly used with GraphQL, including:
    *   Relational Databases (SQL)
    *   NoSQL Databases
    *   External APIs (REST, etc.)
    *   Internal system commands (though this is generally discouraged)
*   **Input Types:**  The analysis considers all types of user-supplied input that can reach resolvers, including:
    *   Query arguments
    *   Mutation arguments
    *   Input objects
    *   Context values (if user-influenced data is placed in the context)
*   **gqlgen Specifics:**  The analysis considers how `gqlgen`'s code generation and resolver structure might influence vulnerability exposure or mitigation.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other GraphQL vulnerabilities outside of resolver injection (e.g., denial of service, introspection abuse).
*   Vulnerabilities in underlying infrastructure (e.g., database server misconfiguration).
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries *unless* they are directly related to how `gqlgen` handles user input within resolvers.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Breakdown:**  Expand on the general vulnerability description, providing specific examples of how injection attacks might manifest in `gqlgen` resolvers.
2.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Detail the precise mechanisms an attacker would use to exploit these vulnerabilities, considering `gqlgen`'s input handling.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Quantify the potential damage from successful attacks, considering data sensitivity and system access.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive:**  Provide detailed, code-level examples of how to implement the recommended mitigations within a `gqlgen` context.  This will include best practices for:
    *   Parameterized queries/prepared statements.
    *   Input validation and sanitization.
    *   Secure handling of external API calls.
    *   Avoiding command execution based on user input.
5.  **gqlgen-Specific Considerations:**  Discuss any `gqlgen`-specific features or patterns that could either increase or decrease the risk of injection vulnerabilities.
6.  **Testing and Verification:**  Recommend testing strategies to identify and confirm the absence of injection vulnerabilities.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.2 Injection Vulnerabilities in Resolvers

### 4.1 Vulnerability Breakdown

The core vulnerability lies in the potential for user-supplied data to be directly incorporated into operations performed by resolvers without proper sanitization or validation.  This can lead to various injection attacks, including:

*   **SQL Injection:** If a resolver interacts with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), an attacker might inject SQL code into a query argument.

    **Example (Vulnerable):**

    ```go
    func (r *queryResolver) UserByID(ctx context.Context, id string) (*model.User, error) {
        var user model.User
        // VULNERABLE: Direct string concatenation
        err := r.DB.QueryRowContext(ctx, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '"+id+"'").Scan(&user.ID, &user.Name, &user.Email)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
        return &user, nil
    }
    ```

    An attacker could provide `id` as `' OR 1=1 --`, resulting in the query `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '' OR 1=1 --'`, which would return all users.

*   **NoSQL Injection:**  Similar to SQL injection, but targeting NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB).  The specific injection techniques vary depending on the database.

    **Example (Vulnerable - MongoDB):**

    ```go
    func (r *queryResolver) ProductsByCategory(ctx context.Context, category string) ([]*model.Product, error) {
        var products []*model.Product
        // VULNERABLE:  Using user input directly in the query
        filter := bson.M{"category": category}
        cursor, err := r.DB.Collection("products").Find(ctx, filter)
        // ... (rest of the resolver) ...
    }
    ```
    An attacker could provide a category like `{"$ne": null}`. This would bypass the category filter and return all products.

*   **Command Injection:**  If a resolver executes system commands (which is highly discouraged), an attacker could inject malicious commands.

    **Example (Vulnerable - Highly Discouraged):**

    ```go
    func (r *mutationResolver) RunReport(ctx context.Context, filename string) (string, error) {
        // VULNERABLE:  Using user input directly in a command
        cmd := exec.Command("generate_report.sh", filename)
        output, err := cmd.Output()
        // ...
    }
    ```
    An attacker could provide a filename like `"; rm -rf /; echo "`, which would execute a dangerous command.

*   **Other Injections:**  Even interactions with external APIs can be vulnerable if user input is used to construct the API request without proper encoding or escaping.  This could lead to data leakage or manipulation on the external service.

### 4.2 Attack Vector Analysis

An attacker would exploit these vulnerabilities by:

1.  **Identifying Input Fields:**  The attacker would examine the GraphQL schema (if introspection is enabled, or through other means like documentation or network traffic analysis) to identify query and mutation arguments that are likely to be used in database queries or other sensitive operations.
2.  **Crafting Malicious Input:**  The attacker would craft input values containing injection payloads tailored to the specific data source or operation.  This often involves trial and error, probing for error messages or unexpected behavior.
3.  **Submitting Requests:**  The attacker would submit GraphQL requests (queries or mutations) containing the malicious input.
4.  **Observing Results:**  The attacker would analyze the responses to determine if the injection was successful.  This might involve observing:
    *   Unexpected data being returned.
    *   Error messages indicating a successful injection attempt.
    *   Changes in application behavior.

### 4.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of successful injection attacks can be severe:

*   **Data Breaches:**  Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, financial data, etc.
*   **Data Modification:**  Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or loss of integrity.
*   **Code Execution:**  In the case of command injection, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system.
*   **System Compromise:**  Successful injection attacks can be used as a stepping stone to compromise other parts of the system or network.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Data breaches and system compromises can severely damage the reputation of the application and its developers.
* **Legal and financial consequences:** Depending on the data exposed, there can be significant legal and financial consequences.

### 4.4 Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive

Here are detailed mitigation strategies with code examples:

*   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements (SQL):**  This is the *primary* defense against SQL injection.  Use parameterized queries to separate the SQL code from the user-supplied data.

    **Example (Secure - PostgreSQL with `pgx`):**

    ```go
    func (r *queryResolver) UserByID(ctx context.Context, id string) (*model.User, error) {
        var user model.User
        // SECURE: Using a parameterized query
        err := r.DB.QueryRowContext(ctx, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", id).Scan(&user.ID, &user.Name, &user.Email)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
        return &user, nil
    }
    ```

    The `$1` placeholder is replaced by the `id` value by the database driver, preventing SQL injection.  The database driver handles escaping and quoting correctly.

*   **Database Driver/ORM (NoSQL):**  Use the appropriate database driver or ORM features to construct queries safely.  Avoid building queries by concatenating strings.

    **Example (Secure - MongoDB with `mongo-go-driver`):**

    ```go
    func (r *queryResolver) ProductsByCategory(ctx context.Context, category string) ([]*model.Product, error) {
        var products []*model.Product
        // SECURE: Using the driver's filtering capabilities
        filter := bson.M{"category": category} // Still needs input validation!
        cursor, err := r.DB.Collection("products").Find(ctx, filter)
        // ...
    }
    ```
    While this example uses the driver's filter, it's *crucial* to still validate the `category` input to prevent unexpected behavior or potential NoSQL injection vulnerabilities that might exist in the driver itself.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Always validate and sanitize *all* user input, regardless of whether you're using parameterized queries or not.  This provides defense-in-depth.

    *   **Validation:**  Check that the input conforms to the expected type, format, and range.  Use a validation library (e.g., `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10`).

        ```go
        import "github.com/go-playground/validator/v10"

        validate := validator.New()

        func (r *queryResolver) UserByID(ctx context.Context, id string) (*model.User, error) {
            // Validate the ID
            err := validate.Var(id, "required,uuid") // Example: Validate as a UUID
            if err != nil {
                return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid ID: %w", err)
            }
            // ... (rest of the resolver) ...
        }
        ```

    *   **Sanitization:**  Remove or escape any potentially dangerous characters from the input.  The specific sanitization steps depend on the context where the input will be used.  For example, if the input is displayed in HTML, you would need to HTML-encode it.  However, for database queries, parameterized queries are generally preferred over manual sanitization.

*   **Avoid Command Execution:**  Do not execute system commands based on user input.  If you absolutely must execute external commands, use a well-defined, restricted set of commands and sanitize the input *extremely* carefully.  Consider using a dedicated library for secure command execution.

*   **Secure External API Calls:**  When making requests to external APIs, ensure that user input is properly encoded and escaped in the request URL, headers, and body.  Use a well-vetted HTTP client library that handles encoding correctly.

### 4.5 gqlgen-Specific Considerations

*   **Generated Code:** `gqlgen` generates code based on your schema.  This can be beneficial for security because it enforces type safety and reduces the likelihood of manual errors.  However, it's still crucial to secure the resolver functions themselves.
*   **Resolver Structure:** `gqlgen` encourages a clear separation between the GraphQL schema and the resolver logic.  This makes it easier to audit the code for potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Context:** Be cautious about placing user-influenced data in the `context.Context`.  If this data is later used in resolvers without proper validation, it could introduce injection vulnerabilities.
* **Directives:** Custom directives can be implemented. Ensure that any custom directives that handle user input are thoroughly reviewed for injection vulnerabilities.

### 4.6 Testing and Verification

*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., `go vet`, `gosec`) to identify potential security issues in your code.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:** Use dynamic analysis tools (e.g., web application scanners) to test your application for injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Perform manual penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by automated tools.
*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for your resolvers to ensure that they handle invalid input correctly and do not introduce injection vulnerabilities.  Specifically, test with known injection payloads.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the entire GraphQL API to ensure that all components are working together securely.

**Example Unit Test (using `testify`):**

```go
import (
	"context"
	"testing"

	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
	// ... other imports ...
)

func TestUserByIDResolver_Injection(t *testing.T) {
	// Mock database (replace with your actual mock)
	mockDB := &MockDB{}

	r := &queryResolver{DB: mockDB}
	ctx := context.Background()

	// Test with a valid ID
	user, err := r.UserByID(ctx, "123")
	require.NoError(t, err)
	assert.NotNil(t, user)

	// Test with an SQL injection attempt
	_, err = r.UserByID(ctx, "' OR 1=1 --")
	assert.Error(t, err) // Expect an error due to validation

    // Test with another SQL injection attempt
	_, err = r.UserByID(ctx, "1; DROP TABLE users;")
	assert.Error(t, err) // Expect an error due to validation
}
```

This comprehensive analysis provides a strong foundation for understanding and mitigating injection vulnerabilities in `gqlgen`-based GraphQL applications. By following these guidelines, developers can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks and protect their applications and data.
