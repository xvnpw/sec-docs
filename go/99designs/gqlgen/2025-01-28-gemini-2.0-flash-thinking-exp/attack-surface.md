# Attack Surface Analysis for 99designs/gqlgen

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Schema](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_schema.md)

*   **Description:** A GraphQL schema that exposes more data and operations than necessary, granting attackers access to sensitive information or functionalities.
*   **gqlgen Contribution:** `gqlgen` directly translates the schema definition into the API. If the schema is poorly designed and overly permissive, `gqlgen` will generate code that reflects this vulnerability. `gqlgen` itself doesn't enforce schema restrictions beyond syntax correctness.
*   **Example:** A schema exposes a `User` type with fields like `internalUserId`, `passwordHash`, and a mutation `promoteUserToAdmin` intended only for internal use, but accessible through the public GraphQL API.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, data manipulation, and potential system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design the schema to expose only the data and operations absolutely necessary for the intended clients.
    *   **Schema Reviews:** Conduct thorough security reviews of the GraphQL schema to identify and remove overly permissive fields and mutations.
    *   **Field-Level Authorization:** Implement authorization checks at the field level in resolvers to control access based on user roles and permissions, even if the field is present in the schema.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Input Validation in Schema and Resolvers](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_input_validation_in_schema_and_resolvers.md)

*   **Description:** Insufficient validation of input data provided through GraphQL queries and mutations, leading to potential injection vulnerabilities or unexpected application behavior.
*   **gqlgen Contribution:** `gqlgen` generates code based on the schema's input types. If the schema doesn't define validation rules (e.g., through custom scalars with validation), and resolvers don't implement robust input validation, vulnerabilities arise. `gqlgen`'s code generation itself doesn't automatically add input validation.
*   **Example:** A mutation takes a `username` string without length limits or character restrictions. An attacker sends a username containing SQL injection payloads or excessively long strings, potentially causing database errors or data breaches.
*   **Impact:** SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), denial of service, and data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Schema-Level Validation (Custom Scalars):** Define custom scalars in the schema with built-in validation logic for input types (e.g., using regular expressions, length constraints).
    *   **Resolver-Level Validation:** Implement explicit input validation within resolvers before processing data or interacting with backend systems. Use validation libraries to enforce rules.
    *   **Input Sanitization/Encoding:** Sanitize or encode user inputs before using them in database queries, API calls, or rendering output to prevent injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Complex Query Attacks (GraphQL DoS)](./attack_surfaces/complex_query_attacks__graphql_dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft excessively complex GraphQL queries with deep nesting or numerous fields to overwhelm the server's resources, leading to denial of service.
*   **gqlgen Contribution:** `gqlgen` processes queries as defined by the schema. If the schema allows for complex queries and no complexity limits are enforced, `gqlgen` will execute these resource-intensive queries. `gqlgen` itself doesn't inherently prevent complex query attacks without explicit configuration.
*   **Example:** A query with deeply nested relationships (e.g., `users { posts { comments { author { ... } } } }`) or a query selecting a large number of fields across multiple types, causing excessive database queries and CPU usage.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, application unavailability, performance degradation for legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Complexity Analysis and Limits:** Implement query complexity analysis (using libraries or custom logic) to calculate the cost of queries based on nesting depth, field selections, and other factors. Reject queries exceeding predefined complexity limits.
    *   **Query Depth Limiting:** Restrict the maximum depth of GraphQL queries to prevent excessively nested requests.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the GraphQL endpoint to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a given time frame.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Throttling:** Monitor server resource usage and implement throttling mechanisms to limit resource consumption by individual queries or users.

## Attack Surface: [Error Handling Revealing Sensitive Information](./attack_surfaces/error_handling_revealing_sensitive_information.md)

*   **Description:** Detailed error messages in GraphQL responses expose internal application details, potentially aiding attackers in reconnaissance and vulnerability exploitation.
*   **gqlgen Contribution:** `gqlgen`'s default error handling might expose verbose error messages. While useful for development, these messages can be too detailed in production. `gqlgen` provides customization options for error handling, but developers need to configure it securely.
*   **Example:** A GraphQL query triggers a database error, and the error response includes the full database error message, stack trace, and internal file paths, revealing database schema details or code structure.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, aiding attackers in understanding the application's architecture and identifying potential vulnerabilities, potentially leading to further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Custom Error Handling:** Implement custom error handling in `gqlgen` to provide generic, user-friendly error messages to clients in production.
    *   **Error Logging:** Log detailed error information securely on the server-side for debugging and monitoring purposes, but avoid exposing these details in client-facing responses.
    *   **Disable Debug Mode in Production:** Ensure that debug mode or development-specific error reporting is disabled in production environments.

## Attack Surface: [Schema Introspection Enabled in Production](./attack_surfaces/schema_introspection_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Leaving GraphQL schema introspection enabled in production environments allows attackers to easily discover the entire API structure, facilitating targeted attacks.
*   **gqlgen Contribution:** `gqlgen` and GraphQL by default enable schema introspection. While useful for development tools, it's a security risk in production if not explicitly disabled or controlled. `gqlgen` doesn't automatically disable introspection in production.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses introspection queries to retrieve the complete schema definition, including types, fields, arguments, and directives, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the API's capabilities and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, significantly aiding attackers in reconnaissance and planning targeted attacks, increasing the overall attack surface.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Introspection in Production:** Disable schema introspection in production environments to prevent unauthorized schema discovery. This is often a configuration setting in GraphQL server libraries or gateways.
    *   **Access Control for Introspection:** If introspection is needed for specific purposes in production (e.g., monitoring), implement strict access control to restrict introspection queries to authorized users or services only.
