# Threat Model Analysis for 99designs/gqlgen

## Threat: [Schema Complexity Exploitation (DoS)](./threats/schema_complexity_exploitation__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts excessively complex GraphQL queries, leveraging deeply nested types and connections defined in the schema. These queries overwhelm the `gqlgen` query parser and execution engine, consuming excessive server resources (CPU, memory). This leads to service degradation or complete unavailability for legitimate users. This is directly related to how `gqlgen` parses and executes GraphQL queries based on the schema.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, financial loss due to downtime, reputational damage.
*   **Affected gqlgen component:** GraphQL Execution Engine (query parser, executor), Schema Definition.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement query complexity analysis middleware in `gqlgen` to reject overly complex queries.
    *   Define maximum query depth and complexity limits.
    *   Carefully design the GraphQL schema to avoid unnecessary nesting and complexity.
    *   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes.
    *   Consider rate limiting requests to the GraphQL endpoint.

## Threat: [GraphQL Injection Vulnerabilities in `gqlgen` Parser/Executor](./threats/graphql_injection_vulnerabilities_in__gqlgen__parserexecutor.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious GraphQL queries designed to exploit potential vulnerabilities within `gqlgen`'s query parser or execution engine. This could involve bypassing validation, triggering unexpected behavior, or potentially achieving code execution if vulnerabilities exist in `gqlgen` itself. This threat is directly within `gqlgen`'s core components.
*   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, data access, or DoS if vulnerabilities exist in `gqlgen`.
*   **Affected gqlgen component:** GraphQL Execution Engine (query parser, executor).
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium (Low probability, but potentially Critical impact if exploited - considering it High for this list due to potential impact)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `gqlgen` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `gqlgen` and its dependencies.
    *   Report any suspected vulnerabilities in `gqlgen` to the maintainers.
    *   While less direct control, contributing to `gqlgen`'s security through code reviews and vulnerability reporting can indirectly improve application security.

## Threat: [Context Data Manipulation or Misuse](./threats/context_data_manipulation_or_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, potentially through compromised middleware *interacting with gqlgen's context*, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in custom context handling logic *within gqlgen's request lifecycle*, manipulates or misuses data stored in the `gqlgen` context. This could involve altering user roles, authentication status, or other critical request-scoped information, leading to authorization bypasses or other security breaches in resolvers. While context is a general concept, `gqlgen`'s reliance and specific implementation of context passing makes this a relevant threat.
*   **Impact:** Authorization bypass, privilege escalation, data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential data breaches.
*   **Affected gqlgen component:** Context Handling (middleware integration with gqlgen, resolver context access), Resolver Implementation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Treat context data as read-only within resolvers unless explicitly intended for modification in specific, controlled scenarios.
    *   Thoroughly review and test middleware that sets context values for security implications, especially how they interact with `gqlgen`.
    *   Enforce clear documentation and consistent practices for context handling across the application, within the `gqlgen` request lifecycle.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization even for data retrieved from the context if it originates from external sources.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Generated Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_generated_code.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker benefits from vulnerabilities inadvertently introduced into the code *generated by `gqlgen`*. Flaws in `gqlgen`'s code generation logic could result in insecure resolvers, models, or other application components, creating exploitable weaknesses. This is a direct consequence of using `gqlgen`'s code generation feature.
*   **Impact:** Vulnerabilities in generated code could lead to various security issues, including injection vulnerabilities, logic errors, or insecure defaults.
*   **Affected gqlgen component:** Code Generation, Generated Code (resolvers, models, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium (considering it High for this list due to potential impact and direct relation to `gqlgen`'s functionality)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `gqlgen` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and improvements in code generation.
    *   Review the generated code, especially resolvers, to ensure it is secure and follows best practices.
    *   Report any suspected code generation flaws to the `gqlgen` maintainers.

## Threat: [Configuration Errors during Code Generation (Insecure Defaults)](./threats/configuration_errors_during_code_generation__insecure_defaults_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers misconfigure `gqlgen` during code generation, particularly in `gqlgen.yml`. This leads to the generation of code with insecure defaults or behaviors, such as misconfigured resolvers or incorrect type mappings, which can introduce vulnerabilities. This is directly related to `gqlgen`'s configuration and code generation process.
*   **Impact:** Insecure defaults in generated code, potentially leading to authorization bypasses, data exposure, or other vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected gqlgen component:** Code Generation Configuration (`gqlgen.yml`), Generated Code.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium (considering it High for this list due to potential impact and direct relation to `gqlgen`'s configuration)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and understand all configuration options in `gqlgen.yml`.
    *   Follow security best practices when configuring `gqlgen`, avoiding insecure defaults.
    *   Use code review and testing to verify that the generated code behaves as expected and is secure based on the configuration.
    *   Use linters and static analysis tools to detect potential configuration issues.
