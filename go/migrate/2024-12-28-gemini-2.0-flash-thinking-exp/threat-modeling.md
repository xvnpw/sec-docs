## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving golang-migrate/migrate

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Migration File Substitution** | An attacker replaces legitimate migration files with malicious ones. This could happen by compromising a developer's machine, a CI/CD pipeline, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the storage of migration files. The attacker could inject arbitrary SQL or Go code that `migrate` will execute. | Execution of arbitrary SQL or Go code on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, or denial of service. | `migrate` binary, Migration Files | **Critical** | - Implement code reviews for all migration files before committing. <br> - Use checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of migration files. <br> - Store migration files in a secure location with strict access controls. <br> - Integrate security scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to detect malicious content. <br> - Consider using immutable infrastructure for deployment artifacts including migrations. |
| **Tampering with Go-based Migration Logic** | If using Go-based migrations, an attacker modifies the Go code of a migration to perform malicious actions that `migrate` will execute. | Execution of arbitrary Go code with database privileges, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, or denial of service. | `migrate` binary, Go-based Migration Files | **Critical** | - Apply the same mitigation strategies as for "Malicious Migration File Substitution". <br> - Follow secure coding practices for Go migrations, including input validation and avoiding unsafe operations. <br> - Implement static analysis tools to scan Go migration code for vulnerabilities. |
| **Exposure of Database Credentials in Configuration** | Database connection strings, including usernames and passwords, are stored insecurely in configuration files used by `migrate`. | Unauthorized access to the database via the credentials used by `migrate`. | `migrate` binary, Configuration Files | **High** | - Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files. <br> - Use environment variables or secure secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to manage database credentials. <br> - Ensure proper file permissions on configuration files to restrict access. |
| **Long-Running or Resource-Intensive Migrations (Accidental or Malicious)** | A poorly written or malicious migration, executed by `migrate`, consumes excessive database resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) or takes an extremely long time to execute. | Database performance degradation or outage, impacting the application's availability due to actions initiated by `migrate`. | `migrate` binary, Database | **High** | - Implement performance testing for migrations in a staging environment. <br> - Set timeouts for migration execution within `migrate`'s configuration or execution environment. <br> - Monitor database resource usage during migration execution. <br> - Review complex or potentially resource-intensive migrations carefully. |
| **Locking Issues During Migrations** | Migrations executed by `migrate` that involve schema changes acquire locks on database tables. If these locks are held for too long or if there are conflicts, it can lead to deadlocks and prevent other database operations. | Application downtime or performance issues due to database lock contention caused by `migrate`'s operations. | `migrate` binary, Database | **High** | - Design migrations to minimize lock contention. <br> - Consider using techniques for online schema changes where possible. <br> - Test migrations in a staging environment that mirrors production to identify potential locking issues. |
| **Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attack on `migrate` itself** | An attacker compromises the `golang-migrate/migrate` repository or its dependencies, injecting malicious code into the library itself. | Any application using the compromised version of `migrate` could be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application when `migrate` is used. | `golang-migrate/migrate` library | **Critical** | - Regularly update the `golang-migrate/migrate` library to the latest stable version to benefit from security fixes. <br> - Use dependency management tools with vulnerability scanning capabilities. <br> - Consider using a private Go module proxy to control the source of dependencies. |
