        * **Implement proper error handling to avoid revealing sensitive information.**

* **Attack Vector: Exploit Session Management Vulnerabilities (e.g., session hijacking)**
    * **Description:** Attackers attempt to steal or manipulate valid session tokens to impersonate an authenticated user. This can be done through various methods like cross-site scripting (XSS), man-in-the-middle attacks, or predicting session IDs if they are generated insecurely.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Allows the attacker to perform actions as the legitimate user, potentially accessing sensitive data, modifying configurations, or performing malicious operations.
    * **Likelihood:** Moderate, depending on the security of session management implementation.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use secure session token generation:**  Employ cryptographically secure random number generators.
        * **Set the `HttpOnly` flag on session cookies:**  Prevent client-side scripts from accessing session cookies, mitigating XSS-based hijacking.
        * **Set the `Secure` flag on session cookies:**  Ensure session cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
        * **Implement session timeouts:**  Automatically invalidate sessions after a period of inactivity.
        * **Regenerate session IDs after successful login:**  Prevent session fixation attacks.
        * **Validate session tokens on every request.**

#### 4.2. Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities

This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the web interface not properly validating user-supplied data.

* **Attack Vector: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into the web interface that are then executed in the browser of other users. This can be done through various input fields or even stored data.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the web interface, and execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser.
    * **Likelihood:** Moderate to High if input is not properly sanitized and escaped.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement robust input validation and sanitization:**  Cleanse user input before displaying it on the page.
        * **Use output encoding/escaping:**  Encode data before rendering it in the browser to prevent malicious scripts from being interpreted as code.
        * **Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Define a whitelist of trusted sources for content, reducing the risk of malicious script execution.
        * **Regularly scan for XSS vulnerabilities.**

* **Attack Vector: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
    * **Description:** An attacker tricks an authenticated user into performing unintended actions on the CasaOS web application without their knowledge. This typically involves embedding malicious requests in emails or websites.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Allows the attacker to perform actions with the privileges of the logged-in user, such as changing passwords, modifying settings, or initiating actions within the application.
    * **Likelihood:** Moderate, especially if proper CSRF protection mechanisms are not in place.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement anti-CSRF tokens (synchronizer tokens):**  Include a unique, unpredictable token in each sensitive request that the server verifies.
        * **Use the SameSite cookie attribute:**  Control when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
        * **Implement user interaction for sensitive actions (e.g., password confirmation).**

* **Attack Vector: Command Injection**
    * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands into input fields that are then executed by the server's operating system. This typically occurs when the application uses user-provided data to construct system commands without proper sanitization.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, and potentially pivot to other systems.
    * **Likelihood:** Low if secure coding practices are followed, but can be critical if present.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid using system calls with user-provided data whenever possible.**
        * **If system calls are necessary, use parameterized commands or safe APIs that prevent command injection.**
        * **Implement strict input validation and sanitization to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters.**
        * **Run the web application with the least privileges necessary.**

#### 4.3. Exploit API Vulnerabilities (if CasaOS exposes an API)
