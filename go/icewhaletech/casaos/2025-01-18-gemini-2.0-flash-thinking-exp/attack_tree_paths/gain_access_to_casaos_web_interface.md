    * **Vulnerabilities:**  Insufficient input sanitization and output encoding in the web application.
    * **Impact:**  Indirectly gaining access by stealing credentials or tricking users into providing them.

* **4.1.6 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    * **Description:**  An attacker tricks an authenticated user into performing unintended actions on the CasaOS web interface. While not directly granting initial access, it could be used to change user credentials if the user is already logged in.
    * **Vulnerabilities:**  Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms (e.g., anti-CSRF tokens).
    * **Impact:**  Potentially changing user credentials, leading to account takeover.

* **4.1.7 Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**
    * **Description:**  An attacker manipulates object identifiers (e.g., user IDs) in requests to access resources belonging to other users. While not directly granting initial access, it could be used to access or modify user settings, potentially leading to account compromise.
    * **Vulnerabilities:**  Lack of proper authorization checks based on user identity.
    * **Impact:**  Potentially gaining access to sensitive information or modifying user settings.

* **4.1.8 Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Web Server or Framework:**
