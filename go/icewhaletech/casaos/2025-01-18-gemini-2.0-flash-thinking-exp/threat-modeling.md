# Threat Model Analysis for icewhaletech/casaos

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via CasaOS API Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_casaos_api_vulnerability.md)

: **Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the CasaOS API (e.g., a missing authorization check or a vulnerability in an API endpoint) to perform actions they are not authorized to do. This could involve gaining administrative privileges within CasaOS, allowing them to manage other containers, access sensitive configurations, or even execute commands on the host *through CasaOS*.
: **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to CasaOS functionalities, potentially leading to the compromise of other containers, data breaches, or denial of service *managed by CasaOS*.
: **Affected Component:** CasaOS API (specifically the vulnerable endpoint or authorization module)
: **Risk Severity:** High
: **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (CasaOS):** Implement robust authorization and authentication mechanisms for all CasaOS API endpoints.
    *   **Developers (CasaOS):** Regularly audit and pen-test the CasaOS API for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Developers (CasaOS):** Follow secure coding practices when developing CasaOS API functionalities.
    *   **Users:**  Limit access to the CasaOS API to trusted users and applications.

## Threat: [Malicious App Installation from the CasaOS App Store](./threats/malicious_app_installation_from_the_casaos_app_store.md)

: **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious application to the CasaOS app store (if such a feature exists and lacks proper vetting) or tricks a user into installing a compromised container image *through CasaOS's interface*. This malicious app could contain backdoors, malware, or vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise the CasaOS environment or other applications *managed by CasaOS*.
: **Impact:**  Installation of malware, data theft, compromise of other containers, or denial of service depending on the capabilities of the malicious application *installed via CasaOS*.
: **Affected Component:** CasaOS App Store API (if applicable), Container Management Module
: **Risk Severity:** High
: **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (CasaOS):** Implement rigorous app vetting processes for the CasaOS app store, including static and dynamic analysis.
    *   **Developers (CasaOS):** Implement mechanisms for users to report suspicious apps.
    *   **Developers (CasaOS):** Provide clear warnings and information about app permissions and potential risks.
    *   **Users:** Exercise caution when installing apps from the CasaOS app store and only install from trusted sources.
    *   **Users:** Review the permissions requested by apps before installing them.

## Threat: [Data Exposure via Insecure CasaOS File Management](./threats/data_exposure_via_insecure_casaos_file_management.md)

: **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in CasaOS's file management features to gain unauthorized access to files stored within containers or on the host system *through CasaOS's interface*. This could involve accessing sensitive application data, configuration files, or user information.
: **Impact:**  Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data, potential for data manipulation or deletion *accessible via CasaOS*.
: **Affected Component:** CasaOS File Manager Module, File Access Control Mechanisms
: **Risk Severity:** High
: **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (CasaOS):** Implement strict access controls and permissions for file management functionalities.
    *   **Developers (CasaOS):** Sanitize file paths and inputs to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:** Be cautious about granting file access permissions to containers and applications *through CasaOS*.
    *   **Users:** Regularly review and manage file sharing configurations within CasaOS.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Container Configurations via CasaOS](./threats/manipulation_of_container_configurations_via_casaos.md)

: **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in CasaOS's container management features to modify the configuration of running containers *through CasaOS*. This could involve changing environment variables, exposed ports, resource limits, or even injecting malicious commands into container startup scripts.
: **Impact:**  Compromise of individual containers, potential for privilege escalation within containers *managed by CasaOS*, disruption of application functionality.
: **Affected Component:** CasaOS Container Management Module, Container Configuration API
: **Risk Severity:** High
: **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (CasaOS):** Implement strict validation and sanitization of container configuration inputs.
    *   **Developers (CasaOS):** Enforce least privilege principles for container configurations *managed by CasaOS*.
    *   **Users:** Regularly review and monitor container configurations managed by CasaOS.
