## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Web Interface Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_web_interface_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws:
        * Brute-force/Dictionary Attack on CasaOS Login: Attempting numerous username/password combinations to gain access.
        * Exploit Default Credentials (if any): Using known default credentials to bypass authentication.
        * Bypass Authentication Mechanisms: Exploiting flaws in the authentication logic to gain access without valid credentials.
        * Exploit Session Management Vulnerabilities (e.g., session hijacking): Stealing or manipulating valid session tokens to impersonate an authenticated user.
    * Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities:
        * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts into the web interface to execute in the victim's browser.
        * Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Forcing an authenticated user to perform unintended actions on the web application.
        * Command Injection: Injecting malicious commands through the web interface to be executed on the server.
    * Exploit API Vulnerabilities (if CasaOS exposes an API):
        * Authentication/Authorization Bypass in API: Bypassing security checks to directly access API functionalities.
        * Input Validation Issues in API Endpoints: Injecting malicious data or commands through API calls.
    * Exploit Third-Party Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities: Leveraging known security flaws in libraries used by the CasaOS web interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to CasaOS Web Interface](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_casaos_web_interface.md)

* Impact: Provides the attacker with access to the CasaOS management interface, allowing them to perform various actions, including managing applications, accessing settings, and potentially executing commands. This node is critical as it serves as a gateway to many other attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities leading to Malicious Application Installation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities_leading_to_malicious_application_installation.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) leading to Install Malicious Application via CasaOS: Forcing an authenticated user to initiate the installation of a malicious application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities leading to Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities_leading_to_command_injection.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Command Injection: Injecting malicious commands through input fields in the CasaOS web interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_server.md)

* Impact: Grants the attacker the ability to execute any command on the underlying server, leading to a complete compromise of the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities (if CasaOS exposes an API)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities__if_casaos_exposes_an_api_.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Authentication/Authorization Bypass in API: Bypassing security checks to directly access API functionalities.
    * Input Validation Issues in API Endpoints: Injecting malicious data or commands through API calls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Third-Party Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_third-party_dependencies_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Leveraging known vulnerabilities in libraries used by CasaOS: Exploiting publicly known security flaws in third-party components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access or Execute Code (via Third-Party Dependencies)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_or_execute_code__via_third-party_dependencies_.md)

* Impact: Successfully exploiting a third-party dependency can allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code, similar to exploiting vulnerabilities in CasaOS itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Management Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_management_weaknesses.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploit Lack of Verification/Sandboxing during Installation: Installing malicious applications due to insufficient security checks.
    * Social Engineering to Trick User into Installing Malicious App: Deceiving users into installing harmful applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Install Malicious Application](./attack_tree_paths/install_malicious_application.md)

* Impact: Allows the attacker to introduce backdoors, malware, or other malicious components into the system, potentially leading to persistent compromise and further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application Update Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_application_update_mechanism.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Update Process: Intercepting and modifying application updates to inject malicious code.
    * Exploit Lack of Integrity Checks on Updates: Installing modified applications due to the absence of proper verification.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Underlying System Access Provided by CasaOS](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_underlying_system_access_provided_by_casaos.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploit Containerization/Virtualization Weaknesses:
        * Container Escape Vulnerabilities: Exploiting flaws in the container runtime to gain access to the host system.
        * Shared Resource Exploitation (e.g., shared kernel vulnerabilities): Leveraging vulnerabilities in shared resources to impact other containers or the host.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Containerization/Virtualization Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_containerizationvirtualization_weaknesses.md)

* Impact: Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to break out of the container or virtual environment and gain access to the underlying host system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to the Host System](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_the_host_system.md)

* Impact: Provides the attacker with complete control over the server's operating system, allowing them to access any data, install any software, and perform any action.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Storage and Management Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_storage_and_management_issues.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploit Insecure File Permissions: Accessing sensitive data due to overly permissive file access controls.
    * Exploit Lack of Encryption for Sensitive Data at Rest: Accessing sensitive information that is not properly encrypted.
    * Exploit Insecure Data Backup/Restore Mechanisms: Injecting malicious data into backups or accessing sensitive information within backups.
    * Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Data Handled by CasaOS: Introducing malicious data that can impact the application or other parts of the system.
