## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CasaOS Authentication Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_casaos_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Weak Default Credentials** `-> HIGH RISK -> [CRITICAL]`
    *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to log in using default credentials (e.g., admin/admin) that have not been changed by the user.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (assuming forced password change on first login; otherwise, High).
    *   **Impact:** Very High (full administrative access).
    *   **Effort:** Very Low.
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise CasaOS User Accounts](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_casaos_user_accounts.md)

*   **Credential Stuffing** `-> HIGH RISK ->`
    *   **Description:** The attacker uses credentials leaked from other data breaches to try and gain access to CasaOS accounts. This relies on users reusing passwords across multiple services.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium.
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (depending on the compromised user's privileges).
    *   **Effort:** Low (automated tools are readily available).
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse CasaOS Features](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_casaos_features.md)

*   **Misconfigured App Store** `-> HIGH RISK -> [CRITICAL]`
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a misconfiguration in the CasaOS App Store that allows them to install a malicious or vulnerable application. This could lead to remote code execution (RCE) and full system compromise.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on the App Store's vetting process).
    *   **Impact:** Very High (potential for RCE and full system compromise).
    *   **Effort:** Medium (finding or creating a malicious app).
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.

*   **Abuse of System Commands (If Exposed)** `-> HIGH RISK -> [CRITICAL]`
    *   **Description:** If CasaOS exposes system commands through its interface or API without proper sanitization, the attacker injects malicious commands to gain control of the system.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (assuming proper input sanitization and a whitelist approach).
    *   **Impact:** Very High (full system compromise).
    *   **Effort:** Low (if commands are exposed and not sanitized).
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (basic command injection techniques).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CasaOS Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_casaos_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Zero-Day in CasaOS Core** `[CRITICAL]`
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in the core CasaOS code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low.
    *   **Impact:** Very High (potential for full system compromise).
    *   **Effort:** Very High (requires significant research and exploit development).
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (by definition, a zero-day is unknown).

*   **Known Vulnerability in a Dependency** `-> HIGH RISK ->`
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a third-party library or component used by CasaOS.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium.
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (depends on the vulnerability).
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (exploits for known vulnerabilities are often publicly available).
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (vulnerability scanners can detect known vulnerabilities).

*   **RCE via Vulnerable App Store App** `-> HIGH RISK -> [CRITICAL]`
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an application available in the CasaOS App Store that allows remote code execution.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium.
    *   **Impact:** Very High (full system compromise).
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (exploits might be publicly available).
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.
