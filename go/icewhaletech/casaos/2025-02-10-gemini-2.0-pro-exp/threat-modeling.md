# Threat Model Analysis for icewhaletech/casaos

## Threat: [Malicious CasaOS App Store Entry](./threats/malicious_casaos_app_store_entry.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious CasaOS App Store Entry

    *   **Description:** An attacker creates and publishes a malicious application to a third-party or compromised CasaOS app store. The application might masquerade as a legitimate tool or update. The attacker could design the app to exploit vulnerabilities in *CasaOS itself* or gain control of the CasaOS system upon installation.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft, unauthorized access to the CasaOS system and potentially other connected devices.
    *   **Affected CasaOS Component:** App Store integration (specifically, the mechanism for fetching and installing applications from external sources), potentially the `app-management` service or related functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement a robust app vetting process for the official CasaOS app store. Provide code signing and verification mechanisms. Consider sandboxing applications (even at the CasaOS level) to limit their access to core system components.
        *   **Users:** Only install applications from trusted sources (preferably the official CasaOS app store). Verify application checksums or signatures if available. Review application permissions before installation (if CasaOS provides such a mechanism).

## Threat: [Spoofed CasaOS Updates](./threats/spoofed_casaos_updates.md)

*   **Threat:** Spoofed CasaOS Updates

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the CasaOS update process (e.g., via a man-in-the-middle attack) or compromises the update server. They then deliver a malicious update package that contains backdoors or exploits targeting CasaOS itself, granting them control over the system.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, persistent backdoor access, potential for data exfiltration and further network compromise.
    *   **Affected CasaOS Component:** Update mechanism (`casaos-updater` service or similar), network communication functions related to update checks and downloads.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use HTTPS for all update communications. Implement cryptographic signing of update packages. Use a robust and secure update server infrastructure. Implement robust integrity checks.
        *   **Users:** Ensure CasaOS is configured to use HTTPS for updates. Monitor for unexpected update behavior. Verify update integrity before application (if manual verification is possible).

## Threat: [Unauthorized Modification of Docker Compose Files](./threats/unauthorized_modification_of_docker_compose_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Modification of Docker Compose Files

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the CasaOS filesystem (e.g., through a vulnerability *in CasaOS itself* or weak file permissions *set by CasaOS*). They modify existing Docker Compose files managed *by CasaOS* to add malicious containers, change container configurations (e.g., expose ports, mount sensitive directories), or inject malicious code. This focuses on the scenario where CasaOS's own management of these files is the weak point.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of applications managed by CasaOS, potential for privilege escalation to the host system (if CasaOS's permissions are insufficient), data breaches.
    *   **Affected CasaOS Component:** Docker integration (`casaos-app-management` or similar), file system access control mechanisms *as implemented by CasaOS*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict file system permissions for Compose files and related directories, *ensuring CasaOS itself enforces these*. Use a read-only filesystem for critical configuration files where possible. Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, hashes) for Compose files *managed by CasaOS*.
        *   **Users:** Regularly audit Compose files for unauthorized changes *if they have access to the underlying filesystem*. Back up Compose files. Use strong passwords and secure access to the CasaOS system.

## Threat: [Tampering with CasaOS Configuration](./threats/tampering_with_casaos_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Tampering with CasaOS Configuration

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the CasaOS configuration files (e.g., network settings, user accounts, storage configurations) and modifies them. This could involve changing network settings to expose services, adding malicious user accounts, or altering storage configurations to gain access to sensitive data. This focuses on the security of CasaOS's *own* configuration.
    *   **Impact:** System instability, unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service, potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected CasaOS Component:** Core configuration management (`casaos-config` or similar), file system access control mechanisms *as implemented by CasaOS*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Secure the CasaOS configuration directory with strict permissions *enforced by CasaOS*. Implement integrity checks for configuration files. Consider encrypting sensitive configuration data.
        *   **Users:** Regularly back up the CasaOS configuration. Monitor for unauthorized configuration changes. Use strong passwords and secure access to the CasaOS system.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data through CasaOS UI or API](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_through_casaos_ui_or_api.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data through CasaOS UI or API

    *   **Description:** A vulnerability in the CasaOS web interface or API (e.g., improper access control, information disclosure vulnerability) allows an attacker to access sensitive information *managed by CasaOS*. This could include API keys, database credentials used *by CasaOS*, user data *for CasaOS accounts*, or internal system information *about CasaOS*.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to CasaOS and potentially its managed applications, potential for privilege escalation *within CasaOS*.
    *   **Affected CasaOS Component:** Web server (`casaos-gateway` or similar), API endpoints, authentication and authorization mechanisms *of CasaOS itself*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Follow secure coding practices to prevent information disclosure vulnerabilities. Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms *for CasaOS*. Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing of the CasaOS UI and API. Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files; use environment variables or a secure secrets management solution.
        *   **Users:** Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication for CasaOS if available. Regularly update CasaOS to the latest version.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within a CasaOS-Managed Container (due to CasaOS misconfiguration)](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_a_casaos-managed_container__due_to_casaos_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation within a CasaOS-Managed Container (due to CasaOS misconfiguration)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in an application running within a CasaOS-managed Docker container. *Due to misconfiguration of the container by CasaOS itself* (e.g., running as root, excessive capabilities, insecure mounts), they escape the container's isolation and gain access to the host system (CasaOS) with elevated privileges. This threat focuses on CasaOS's role in *creating* the insecure container environment.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, access to all data and applications, potential for lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected CasaOS Component:** Docker integration (`casaos-app-management`), container runtime security *configuration as set by CasaOS*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** *Ensure CasaOS configures containers with the least necessary privileges by default*. Avoid running containers as root unless absolutely necessary. Use security-enhanced Linux features (e.g., SELinux, AppArmor) if available and supported by CasaOS. Provide clear documentation and secure defaults for container configuration.
        *   **Users:** Regularly update container images to patch vulnerabilities. Avoid running untrusted applications. If possible, review the container configurations generated by CasaOS to ensure they adhere to security best practices (though this requires advanced knowledge).

## Threat: [Weak CasaOS Default Credentials](./threats/weak_casaos_default_credentials.md)

* **Threat:** Weak CasaOS Default Credentials

    *   **Description:** CasaOS is installed with default credentials (username and password) that are publicly known or easily guessable. An attacker uses these credentials to gain administrative access to the CasaOS system.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, unauthorized access to all data and applications managed by CasaOS.
    *   **Affected CasaOS Component:** Authentication system (`casaos-auth` or similar), initial setup process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Enforce strong password policies. Force users to change default credentials during the initial setup process. Do not ship with default credentials that are publicly documented.
        *   **Users:** Immediately change the default CasaOS credentials after installation. Use a strong, unique password.

## Threat: [Spoofed CasaOS UI](./threats/spoofed_casaos_ui.md)

* **Threat:** Spoofed CasaOS UI

    * **Description:** An attacker creates a phishing website that mimics the CasaOS login page. They then trick users into entering their CasaOS credentials on the fake page, potentially by sending phishing emails or using DNS spoofing techniques. This targets the CasaOS login itself.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of CasaOS user accounts, unauthorized access to CasaOS and its managed applications.
    * **Affected CasaOS Component:** Web server (`casaos-gateway` or similar), user authentication *for CasaOS*.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for CasaOS. Educate users about phishing attacks and how to identify fake websites. Use HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate.
        * **Users:** Always check the URL in the browser's address bar to ensure it's the correct CasaOS address before entering credentials. Use a password manager to avoid reusing passwords. Be cautious about clicking links in emails or messages, especially if they ask for login credentials. Enable 2FA if available.
