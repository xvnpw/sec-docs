# Attack Surface Analysis for icewhaletech/casaos

## Attack Surface: [1. Web Interface Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/1__web_interface_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:**  Attacks targeting the login process, session management, and access control mechanisms *specifically implemented within CasaOS's web interface code*.
*   **How CasaOS Contributes:** CasaOS's custom authentication and authorization logic is a primary attack vector. Flaws here are directly attributable to CasaOS.
*   **Example:**
    *   *Authentication Bypass:* A bug in CasaOS's session validation code allows an attacker to forge a valid session ID and bypass the login.
    *   *Privilege Escalation:* A flaw in CasaOS's role-based access control implementation allows a low-privileged user to access administrator-only functions.
*   **Impact:**  Complete control of the CasaOS instance, including all managed applications and data. Potential access to the underlying host system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developers):**
        *   Implement robust, multi-factor authentication (MFA/2FA) with secure secret storage, using well-vetted cryptographic libraries.
        *   Use secure, HTTP-only, and same-site cookies for session management. Ensure proper session expiration and invalidation *within CasaOS's code*.
        *   Enforce strict, granular, role-based access control (RBAC) with the principle of least privilege. Every CasaOS API endpoint and UI element should have explicit authorization checks *implemented in CasaOS*.
        *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts *within CasaOS's logic*.
        *   Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the authentication and authorization flows *of CasaOS*.

## Attack Surface: [2. Remote Code Execution (RCE) via App Management](./attack_surfaces/2__remote_code_execution__rce__via_app_management.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in CasaOS's code that handles application installation, configuration, or interaction with the Docker API to run arbitrary code on the server.
*   **How CasaOS Contributes:** This is a *core function* of CasaOS. Any flaws in how CasaOS interacts with Docker or processes application-related data are directly attributable to CasaOS.
*   **Example:**
    *   A vulnerability in CasaOS's code that parses application metadata allows an attacker to inject malicious commands that are executed when the application is installed.
    *   CasaOS incorrectly handles user input when constructing Docker API calls, leading to command injection.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to control the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developers):**
        *   Implement strict validation of all application sources and metadata *within CasaOS*.
        *   *Never* trust user-supplied input when constructing commands or interacting with the Docker API. Use parameterized APIs and avoid string concatenation *in CasaOS's code*.
        *   Run CasaOS itself with the *least* possible privileges. Avoid running it as root.
        *   Regularly audit the CasaOS code that interacts with the Docker API and system shell.  This is a *critical* area for security reviews.

## Attack Surface: [3. API Endpoint Vulnerabilities (CasaOS-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/3__api_endpoint_vulnerabilities__casaos-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the *custom* REST API endpoints that CasaOS itself exposes. This excludes general API security best practices, and focuses on flaws in CasaOS's API implementation.
*   **How CasaOS Contributes:** CasaOS's API is its own code. Any vulnerabilities in how it handles requests, authenticates users, or authorizes access are directly attributable to CasaOS.
*   **Example:**
    *   An undocumented CasaOS API endpoint allows unauthenticated access to sensitive system information.
    *   A CasaOS API endpoint for managing user accounts does not properly validate input, allowing privilege escalation.
*   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the specific API endpoint, but can range from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the endpoint)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developers):**
        *   Apply *all* the same security principles to CasaOS API endpoints as to the web interface (authentication, authorization, input validation).  These checks must be *within CasaOS's code*.
        *   Thoroughly document all CasaOS API endpoints, including security considerations.
        *   Implement rate limiting on CasaOS API requests.
        *   Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the CasaOS API.

## Attack Surface: [4. Insecure Update Mechanism (CasaOS-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/4__insecure_update_mechanism__casaos-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks targeting the *specific implementation* of the update process within CasaOS's code.
*   **How CasaOS Contributes:** The update mechanism is code written and maintained by the CasaOS project. Any flaws in how it downloads, verifies, or applies updates are directly attributable to CasaOS.
*   **Example:**
    *   CasaOS's update mechanism fails to properly verify the digital signature of an update, allowing a malicious update to be installed.
    *   A flaw in CasaOS's update code allows an attacker to trigger a rollback to a known vulnerable version.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise through the installation of malicious updates.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *    **(Developers):**
        *   Use HTTPS for *all* update downloads and communications (enforced by CasaOS).
        *   Verify the digital signatures of *all* updates before applying them, using robust cryptographic libraries *within CasaOS*.
        *   Implement a secure rollback mechanism *within CasaOS* to revert to a previous version.
        *   Regularly audit the CasaOS update mechanism for security vulnerabilities.
