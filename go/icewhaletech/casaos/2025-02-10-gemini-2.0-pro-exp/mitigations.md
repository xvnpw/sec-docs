## Mitigation Strategy: [CasaOS Configuration Hardening and Feature Minimization](./mitigation_strategies/casaos_configuration_hardening_and_feature_minimization.md)

*   **Description:** This strategy involves directly modifying the CasaOS configuration to reduce its attack surface and ensure secure settings.
    1.  **Review Configuration Files:** Access the CasaOS configuration files (typically YAML or a similar format, location depends on installation).
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Identify and disable any built-in CasaOS services or features that are not actively used.  This might include:
        *   The built-in app store, if you are managing Docker images manually.
        *   Any optional file sharing or media server components that are not required.
        *   Unused network services or protocols.
    3.  **Change Default Credentials:**  Ensure that *all* default usernames and passwords associated with CasaOS itself are changed to strong, unique values.  This is *critical*.
    4.  **Configure Secure Logging:** Enable and configure CasaOS's logging features.  Ensure logs are:
        *   Stored securely (consider a separate, dedicated log server).
        *   Rotated regularly to prevent them from consuming excessive disk space.
        *   Monitored for suspicious activity.
    5.  **TLS/SSL Configuration (if applicable):** If CasaOS has built-in TLS/SSL settings (for its web interface), ensure they are configured securely:
        *   Use strong ciphers and protocols.
        *   Disable weak or outdated ciphers.
        *   Use a valid, trusted certificate (not a self-signed certificate, if exposed externally, even behind a reverse proxy).
    6. **CasaOS User Permissions:** If CasaOS runs under a specific system user, ensure that user has the *absolute minimum* necessary permissions on the host system.  Avoid running CasaOS as root.  This limits the damage if CasaOS itself is compromised.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of CasaOS Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Disabling unnecessary features reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to CasaOS (High Severity):** Changing default credentials prevents unauthorized login.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Limiting CasaOS user permissions prevents attackers from gaining full control of the host.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Secure logging helps detect and investigate security incidents.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk by minimizing the attack surface.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Eliminates the risk from default credentials.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Significantly reduces the risk by enforcing least privilege.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Improves the ability to detect and respond to incidents.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Describe where these steps are currently implemented within the CasaOS configuration (e.g., "App store disabled in `config.yaml`," "Default password changed," "Logging configured to send to remote syslog server"). Be specific.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Describe where these steps are *not* implemented (e.g., "Default credentials still in use," "Unnecessary services still enabled," "Logging not configured"). Be specific.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Application Deployment via CasaOS (Image Management)](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_application_deployment_via_casaos__image_management_.md)

*   **Description:** This strategy leverages CasaOS's application management features (primarily its handling of Docker containers) to enforce security policies.  It's about *how* you use CasaOS's features, not just configuring CasaOS itself.
    1.  **Avoid "Latest" Tags:** When deploying applications through CasaOS, *never* use the "latest" tag for Docker images.  Always specify a specific, known-good version.
    2.  **Manual Image Selection (Preferred):** Instead of relying solely on the CasaOS app store (if used), manually select and specify the Docker images you want to deploy.  This gives you more control over the image source and version.
    3.  **Review CasaOS-Provided Configurations:** Even if using the app store, *carefully review* the default configurations provided by CasaOS for each application.  Don't blindly accept the defaults.  Look for:
        *   Exposed ports:  Ensure only necessary ports are exposed.
        *   Volume mounts:  Ensure volumes are mounted with appropriate permissions (read-only where possible).
        *   Environment variables:  Check for hardcoded secrets or sensitive information.
    4.  **Leverage CasaOS's Update Mechanisms (with Caution):** If CasaOS provides mechanisms for updating deployed applications, use them *carefully*.
        *   Test updates in a staging environment *before* deploying to production.
        *   Have a rollback plan in case an update causes problems.
    5. **Restrict CasaOS App Store Access (If Possible):** If CasaOS allows restricting access to its app store (e.g., to specific users or groups), do so. This prevents unauthorized users from deploying unapproved applications.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deployment of Vulnerable Applications (High Severity):** Manual image selection and careful review of configurations reduce the risk.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity):** Avoiding "latest" tags and preferring manually selected images reduces reliance on potentially compromised upstream sources.
    *   **Misconfiguration of Applications (High Severity):** Reviewing CasaOS-provided configurations helps prevent misconfigurations.
    *   **Unauthorized Application Deployment (Medium Severity):** Restricting app store access limits the ability of unauthorized users to deploy applications.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deployment of Vulnerable Applications:** Significantly reduces the risk, especially with manual image selection and configuration review.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Reduces the risk, but other measures (like DCT) are still important.
    *   **Misconfiguration of Applications:** Reduces the risk considerably.
    *   **Unauthorized Application Deployment:** Reduces the risk if app store access controls are available.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Describe where these steps are currently implemented in your use of CasaOS (e.g., "Always specify image versions," "Review default configurations before deployment," "App store access restricted to administrators"). Be specific.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Describe where these steps are *not* implemented (e.g., "Using 'latest' tags," "Blindly accepting default configurations," "No restrictions on app store access"). Be specific.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CasaOS API Security and Access Control (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/casaos_api_security_and_access_control__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:** If CasaOS exposes an API for management, this strategy focuses on securing that API.
    1.  **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure the CasaOS API requires strong authentication (e.g., API keys, tokens, or integration with an existing authentication system). Implement authorization rules to restrict access to specific API endpoints based on user roles or permissions.
    2.  **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on all API endpoints to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    3.  **TLS/SSL Encryption:** Enforce the use of TLS/SSL for all API communication to protect data in transit. Use strong ciphers and protocols.
    4. **Disable API if not needed:** If API is not used, disable it completely.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access (High Severity):** Authentication and authorization prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **API Exploitation (High Severity):** Input validation and TLS/SSL encryption reduce the risk of API vulnerabilities being exploited.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** TLS/SSL encryption protects sensitive data transmitted via the API.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access:** Significantly reduces the risk with strong authentication and authorization.
    *   **API Exploitation:** Reduces the risk considerably with input validation and TLS/SSL.
    *   **Data Breaches:** Reduces the risk of data being intercepted during API communication.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Describe where these steps are currently implemented (e.g., "API requires API keys for authentication," "Input validation implemented on all endpoints," "TLS/SSL enforced for all API traffic"). Be specific.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Describe where these steps are *not* implemented (e.g., "No authentication required for API access," "No input validation," "API uses plain HTTP"). Be specific.
    * If CasaOS doesn't have API, write "Not Applicable".
