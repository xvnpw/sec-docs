    *   Implementing appropriate file system permissions to restrict unauthorized access.
    *   Considering encryption for sensitive data.
*   **Network Security:**
    *   Securing communication between the web interface and backend components (e.g., using HTTPS).
    *   Protecting against network-based attacks.
    *   Properly configuring firewall rules to restrict access to necessary ports and services.
*   **Application Security:**
    *   Mitigating risks associated with running third-party applications in Docker containers.
    *   Implementing resource limits for containers to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    *   Considering container security scanning and vulnerability management.
*   **Supply Chain Security:**
    *   Verifying the integrity and authenticity of application images pulled from repositories.
    *   Trusting application marketplaces and repositories.
*   **Web Interface Security:**
    *   Protecting against common web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and SQL Injection (if databases are directly accessed by the web interface).
    *   Implementing proper input validation and output encoding.
*   **API Security:**
    *   Securing internal APIs between components using authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Protecting against API abuse and unauthorized access.
*   **Docker Daemon Security:**
    *   Securing the Docker daemon itself to prevent unauthorized container management.
    *   Following Docker security best practices.

## 5. Assumptions and Constraints

*   CasaOS relies on a properly installed and configured Docker daemon on the underlying operating system.
*   User authentication is primarily handled by the CasaOS web interface or a dedicated authentication service integrated with it.
*   Application installations primarily involve pulling and running pre-built Docker container images.
*   The underlying operating system provides basic security features, and CasaOS builds upon these.
*   Communication between internal components is assumed to occur over a trusted network (e.g., localhost or an internal network).

## 6. Future Considerations

*   Integration with external authentication providers (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
*   More granular role-based access control.
*   Advanced monitoring and alerting capabilities for security events.
*   Support for different container runtimes beyond Docker.
*   Implementation of backup and recovery mechanisms.
*   Features for managing and securing network access to applications.
