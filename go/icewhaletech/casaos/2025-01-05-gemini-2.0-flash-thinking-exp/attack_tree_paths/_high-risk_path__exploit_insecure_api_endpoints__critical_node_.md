        * **Path Traversal:**  Crafting API requests with manipulated file paths to access sensitive files or directories.
        * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Sending API requests that force the CasaOS server to make requests to internal services or external resources, potentially exposing internal network information or exploiting vulnerabilities in other systems.
    * **Exploiting Exposed Internal Functionality:**
        * **Accessing Administrative Endpoints:** Sending requests to unprotected administrative endpoints to create new users, modify configurations, or install malicious software.
        * **Utilizing Debug Endpoints:**  Leveraging debug endpoints to gain insights into the system's state, potentially revealing sensitive information or enabling privileged actions.
        * **Direct Data Access:**  Accessing sensitive data through unprotected endpoints, leading to data breaches.
    * **Exploiting Authentication and Authorization Flaws:**
        * **Bypassing Authentication:**  Sending requests to authenticated endpoints without providing valid credentials or using known authentication bypass techniques.
        * **Privilege Escalation:**  Sending requests with manipulated user IDs or roles to gain access to resources or functionalities intended for higher-privileged users.
        * **Exploiting IDOR:**  Guessing or manipulating resource IDs in API requests to access data belonging to other users.
