## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable HTTPS for CasaOS Web Interface](./mitigation_strategies/enable_https_for_casaos_web_interface.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable HTTPS for CasaOS Web Interface
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access CasaOS Settings:** Log in to the CasaOS web interface as an administrator.
    2.  **Navigate to Security/Network Settings:** Locate the security or network settings section within the CasaOS administration panel.
    3.  **Enable HTTPS:** Look for an option to enable HTTPS or SSL/TLS.
    4.  **Certificate Configuration (if available):**
        *   **Automatic (Let's Encrypt):** If CasaOS offers Let's Encrypt integration, use it. Provide your domain name and CasaOS will attempt to automatically obtain and configure a free SSL certificate. Follow the CasaOS instructions for domain verification if required.
        *   **Manual Certificate:** If automatic configuration is not available or desired, you may need to manually configure a reverse proxy *outside* of CasaOS to handle SSL termination and then access CasaOS via HTTPS through that proxy. (Note: Direct manual certificate upload *within* CasaOS might be limited or not directly supported in all versions).
    5.  **Force HTTPS Redirection (if available):** If CasaOS offers an option to force HTTPS redirection, enable it to ensure all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS.
    6.  **Test Configuration:** After enabling HTTPS (or configuring an external reverse proxy), access the CasaOS web interface using `https://your_casaos_domain_or_ip`. Verify the connection is secure (padlock icon in the browser address bar).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Without HTTPS, communication is in plain text, allowing attackers to intercept credentials and sensitive data transmitted between the user's browser and CasaOS.
    *   **Credential Theft (High Severity):** Intercepted login credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to CasaOS and potentially the entire system.
    *   **Session Hijacking (Medium Severity):** Attackers can steal session tokens to impersonate legitimate users and gain access to CasaOS functionalities.
    *   **Data Tampering (Medium Severity):**  Insecure communication allows attackers to modify data in transit, potentially leading to application malfunction or security breaches.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **MITM Attacks:** High Reduction - HTTPS encrypts communication, making it extremely difficult for attackers to intercept and decrypt data.
    *   **Credential Theft:** High Reduction - Encrypted transmission significantly reduces the risk of credential theft during login.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** High Reduction - Encrypted session tokens are much harder to steal and use for hijacking.
    *   **Data Tampering:** High Reduction - HTTPS ensures data integrity during transmission, preventing unauthorized modifications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** CasaOS *offers* HTTPS configuration, often with Let's Encrypt integration, making it readily available for users to implement *within CasaOS settings*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  While CasaOS provides HTTPS configuration, it might not be *enabled by default*. Users need to actively configure it.  More robust built-in certificate management beyond Let's Encrypt might be desired for advanced users.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strong Password Policies](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strong_password_policies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strong Password Policies
*   **Description:**
    1.  **CasaOS User Management:** Access the user management section within the CasaOS administration panel.
    2.  **Change User Passwords:** For each user account, including the administrator account, change the default or existing password to a strong, unique password.
    3.  **Password Complexity (User Responsibility):** While CasaOS might not enforce strict password complexity rules, users should be educated and encouraged to create strong passwords that include:
        *   **Minimum Password Length:** Aim for at least 12-16 characters.
        *   **Character Variety:** Use a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
        *   **Avoid Personal Information:**  Do not use names, birthdays, or easily guessable words.
    4.  **Password Managers (User Responsibility):** Encourage users to utilize password managers to generate and securely store strong, unique passwords for their CasaOS accounts and other services.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Weak passwords are easily cracked through brute-force attacks, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Password Guessing (High Severity):**  Predictable or simple passwords can be easily guessed by attackers.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (Medium Severity):** If users reuse weak passwords across multiple services, a breach on another service can compromise their CasaOS account through credential stuffing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** High Reduction - Strong passwords significantly increase the time and resources required for brute-force attacks, making them less likely to succeed.
    *   **Password Guessing:** High Reduction - Complex and unpredictable passwords are much harder to guess.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Medium Reduction - Unique passwords prevent cascading breaches from other compromised accounts.
*   **Currently Implemented:** CasaOS *has user management features* allowing password changes.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  CasaOS *lacks built-in enforcement of strong password policies*.  There are likely no configurable settings for password complexity, minimum length, or password history within CasaOS itself.  This relies heavily on user awareness and responsible password management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update CasaOS](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_casaos.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update CasaOS
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor CasaOS Updates within UI:** Regularly check the CasaOS web interface for update notifications.
    2.  **Access CasaOS Update Interface:** Log in to the CasaOS web interface as an administrator and navigate to the system settings or update section.
    3.  **Check for Updates:** Use the built-in update checker to see if newer versions are available.
    4.  **Apply Updates:** If updates are available, initiate the update process through the CasaOS interface. Follow any on-screen instructions.
    5.  **Review Release Notes (If Available):** Before updating, check for release notes (usually linked within the update interface or on the CasaOS GitHub/website) to understand what changes are included, especially security patches.
    6.  **Test After Update:** After the update completes, verify that CasaOS is functioning correctly and that your applications are still working as expected.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Software vulnerabilities are constantly discovered. Updates often contain patches that fix these vulnerabilities, preventing attackers from exploiting them.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Medium Severity):** While updates primarily address known vulnerabilities, staying up-to-date reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered "zero-day" vulnerabilities before patches are available.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** High Reduction - Updates directly address and eliminate known vulnerabilities, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Medium Reduction - Reduces the exposure window to zero-day exploits by ensuring systems are running the latest, most secure version of the software.
*   **Currently Implemented:** CasaOS *provides a built-in update mechanism* accessible through its web interface. Users are typically *notified of available updates within the UI*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  *Automatic updates are likely not enabled by default* and might require manual initiation by the user. More prominent update notifications and clearer communication about the security benefits of updates within the CasaOS UI could be improved.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Vet Applications Before Installation (via CasaOS App Store/Interface)](./mitigation_strategies/vet_applications_before_installation__via_casaos_app_storeinterface_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Vet Applications Before Installation (via CasaOS App Store/Interface)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use CasaOS App Store/Application Installation Interface:** Primarily install applications through the CasaOS App Store or the application installation interface provided within CasaOS.
    2.  **Review App Information in CasaOS:** Before installing an application through CasaOS, review the information presented within the CasaOS interface:
        *   **Application Description:** Read the description to understand the application's purpose and functionality.
        *   **Developer/Source (If Available):** Check if the CasaOS interface provides information about the application developer or source repository.
        *   **Permissions (If Displayed):** If CasaOS displays requested permissions, review them and be cautious of applications requesting excessive permissions.
    3.  **Exercise Caution with "Custom App" Installations:** If CasaOS allows installing "custom apps" or applications from external sources (e.g., Docker Compose files, direct Docker image pulls), exercise extra caution. These apps might bypass any vetting that the CasaOS App Store might perform.
    4.  **Minimize Installed Applications:** Only install applications that are truly necessary and actively used within CasaOS. Reduce the attack surface by limiting the number of installed applications.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Applications (High Severity):** Installing malicious applications can lead to data theft, system compromise, malware infections, and other severe security breaches.
    *   **Vulnerable Applications (High Severity):** Applications with vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or control of the CasaOS system.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):** Compromised application repositories or development pipelines can lead to the distribution of malicious or vulnerable applications, even through app stores.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Applications:** Medium Reduction - CasaOS App Store *might offer some level of basic curation*, but it's unlikely to be a comprehensive security audit. User vigilance is still crucial.
    *   **Vulnerable Applications:** Low to Medium Reduction - CasaOS App Store *might not actively scan for vulnerabilities* in applications. User research and community feedback (outside of CasaOS) are important.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Low Reduction - CasaOS App Store's vetting process (if any) might not fully protect against sophisticated supply chain attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** CasaOS *provides an App Store interface* for application discovery and installation. It *likely performs some basic level of curation* for apps listed in the store.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  More transparent and robust security vetting processes for the CasaOS App Store. Clearer indicators of application trustworthiness and security ratings *within the CasaOS interface itself*.  Potentially, integration of automated security scanning for applications listed in the App Store.  Better warnings and guidance for users installing "custom apps" from external sources.
