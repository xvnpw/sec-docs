**Description of Components:**

*   **User Browser ("User Browser"):** The web browser used by the end-user (administrator or authorized user) to interact with the CasaOS web interface. This is the primary access point for managing the CasaOS system.
*   **Web UI (Frontend) ("Web UI (Frontend)"):**  The frontend application, likely built using a modern JavaScript framework such as React or Vue.js. It is responsible for:
    *   Rendering the user interface and providing a user-friendly experience.
    *   Handling user interactions (clicks, form submissions, etc.).
    *   Communicating with the backend API Gateway via HTTP requests (typically RESTful API calls).
    *   Managing user sessions and potentially some client-side state.
    *   Displaying real-time updates and notifications from the backend.
*   **API Gateway (Backend) ("API Gateway (Backend)"):** The backend API server, likely implemented using Go (potentially with frameworks like Gin or Echo) or Node.js (with Express.js). It acts as the central entry point for all requests from the Web UI and potentially other clients. Its responsibilities include:
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Verifying user credentials and ensuring users have the necessary permissions to access specific resources and functionalities.
    *   **Request Routing:** Directing incoming requests to the appropriate Core Services based on the requested endpoint.
    *   **API Logic:** Implementing some API-specific business logic, request validation, and data transformation.
    *   **Communication with Core Services:** Interacting with the Core Services component to fulfill requests.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Security:** Implementing measures to protect against abuse and common web attacks.
*   **Core Services ("Core Services"):**  The central component containing the core business logic and orchestration capabilities of CasaOS. It is responsible for:
    *   **Application Management:** Handling the installation, uninstallation, starting, stopping, and management of applications (Docker containers).
    *   **System Settings Management:** Managing system-level configurations, such as network settings, user accounts, storage configurations, and update mechanisms.
    *   **User Account Management:** Handling user creation, deletion, and permission management.
    *   **File Operations:** Providing file management functionalities, potentially including file browsing, uploading, downloading, and editing.
    *   **System Monitoring:** Collecting and exposing system metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network activity) for monitoring and display in the Web UI.
    *   **Interaction with Docker Engine:** Communicating with the Docker Engine to manage containers.
    *   **Interaction with Storage Layer:** Accessing and managing data within the Storage Layer.
*   **Docker Engine ("Docker Engine"):** The containerization platform used by CasaOS to run and manage applications in isolated environments. It is responsible for:
    *   Pulling Docker images from registries.
    *   Creating and managing Docker containers.
    *   Providing resource isolation and management for containers.
    *   Exposing container logs and status information.
*   **Storage Layer ("Storage Layer"):**  Represents the underlying file system and storage mechanisms used by CasaOS. It is responsible for:
    *   Storing system configurations and application metadata.
    *   Storing user data and files.
    *   Providing persistent storage for Docker containers (volumes).
    *   Interacting with the host operating system's file system. This could be local storage, network-attached storage (NAS), or other storage solutions mounted to the host system.
*   **Applications (Docker Containers) ("Applications (Docker Containers)"):** User-installed applications packaged as Docker containers. These are isolated and run within the Docker Engine, managed and orchestrated by CasaOS through the Core Services.  These applications provide the actual functionalities and services offered by the CasaOS system (e.g., media servers, file sharing, home automation tools).

**Data Flow Description (App Installation):**

1.  **Request App Store:** The user initiates the process by requesting to view the App Store through the Web UI, typically by clicking on an "App Store" icon or menu item.
2.  **Get App List API Request:** The Web UI, upon user interaction, sends an asynchronous API request (e.g., HTTP GET) to the API Gateway. This request is for retrieving the list of available applications and their basic metadata.
3.  **Get App List Command:** The API Gateway receives the request and routes it to the Core Services component. It translates the API request into an internal command or function call within the Core Services.
4.  **Fetch App Metadata:** The Core Services component, upon receiving the command, interacts with the App Store component. The App Store is responsible for maintaining the catalog of available applications and their metadata. This metadata might be stored in a local file (e.g., JSON, YAML), a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite), or even fetched from a remote service.
5.  **App Metadata List:** The App Store retrieves the requested metadata for all available applications and returns it to the Core Services as a list or structured data format.
6.  **App Metadata Response:** The Core Services packages the received app metadata into a response format suitable for the API Gateway (e.g., JSON) and sends it back.
7.  **App List Data:** The API Gateway receives the response from the Core Services and forwards it to the Web UI, potentially performing some data transformation or formatting if needed.
8.  **Display App Store:** The Web UI receives the app list data and dynamically renders the App Store interface, displaying the available applications with their names, descriptions, icons, and "Install" buttons.
9.  **Select 'Install' App:** The user browses the App Store and selects a specific application they wish to install. They then click the "Install" button associated with that application.
10. **Install App API Request:** Upon clicking "Install," the Web UI sends another API request (e.g., HTTP POST) to the API Gateway. This request includes information about the selected application to be installed.
11. **Install App Command:** The API Gateway routes the installation request to the Core Services component.
12. **Fetch App Details:** The Core Services may need to fetch more detailed information about the selected application before proceeding with the installation. This might involve querying the App Store again for specific details related to the chosen application, such as Docker image name, required configurations, etc.
13. **App Details:** The App Store returns the detailed application information to the Core Services.
14. **Pull Docker Image:** The Core Services instructs the Docker Engine to pull the Docker image associated with the selected application. This involves communicating with a Docker Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, a private registry) to download the necessary image layers.
15. **Docker Image:** The Docker Registry provides the Docker image to the Docker Engine.
16. **Store Container Data:** The Docker Engine stores the downloaded Docker image and related container configuration data in the Storage Layer. This includes setting up Docker volumes for persistent data storage if defined for the application.
17. **Run Container:** The Docker Engine creates and starts a new Docker container based on the pulled image and configuration. This effectively installs and runs the application within the CasaOS environment.
18. **Installation Status Updates:** The Core Services monitors the installation process and receives status updates from the Docker Engine. It then sends these updates to the Web UI via the API Gateway, allowing the user to track the installation progress.
19. **Installation Progress:** The Web UI displays the installation progress to the user, providing feedback on the status of the application installation.

## 4. Technology Stack

Based on the project repository analysis and common practices for similar systems, the likely technology stack for CasaOS includes:

*   **Backend Programming Language:** **Go** (Likely, based on project structure, performance characteristics, and common use for backend services and container orchestration). Frameworks like **Gin** or **Echo** could be used for API development. *[To be confirmed by examining the repository]*
*   **Frontend Framework:**  **React** or **Vue.js** (Popular choices for building modern, interactive user interfaces). *[To be confirmed by examining the repository]*
*   **Containerization Platform:** **Docker** (Standard for container management and orchestration).
*   **Operating System:** **Linux-based distributions** (Target platform for CasaOS, offering flexibility and Docker compatibility). Distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, or CentOS are likely candidates.
*   **Database:**  Likely a lightweight database for storing system configuration, application metadata, and potentially user preferences. Options include:
    *   **SQLite:** File-based, simple to embed, suitable for smaller datasets and configurations.
    *   **BoltDB:**  A key-value store written in Go, performant and suitable if the backend is Go-based.
    *   Alternatively, configuration might be stored in flat files (JSON, YAML) for simplicity, especially for initial configurations. *[To be confirmed by examining the repository]*
*   **Web Server:**  Likely embedded within the API Gateway application. For Go-based backends, the standard `net/http` package or frameworks like Gin/Echo include web server capabilities. For Node.js, Express.js handles web server functionalities.

**Note:** This technology stack is based on common assumptions and project characteristics. A definitive technology stack should be confirmed by a detailed examination of the CasaOS project repository and codebase.
