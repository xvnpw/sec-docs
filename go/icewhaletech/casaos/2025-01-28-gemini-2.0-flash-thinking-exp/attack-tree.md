## Attack Tree Path: [1. [HR] Exploit CasaOS Web UI Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1___hr__exploit_casaos_web_ui_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HR] Authentication Bypass:**
        *   **[CR] Default Credentials (CasaOS or Managed Apps):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** CasaOS or pre-packaged applications might use default usernames and passwords that are publicly known or easily guessable.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attacker attempts to log in to the CasaOS web UI or managed applications using common default credentials.
            *   **Impact:** Successful login grants full access to CasaOS management features and potentially the managed applications, allowing for system compromise.
        *   **[HR] Vulnerability in Authentication Mechanism (e.g., flawed session management, weak password policy):**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Weaknesses in how CasaOS handles user authentication, such as insecure session cookies, predictable session IDs, or lack of strong password policies.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the authentication process to bypass login requirements or hijack user sessions.
            *   **Impact:** Successful bypass grants unauthorized access to CasaOS and managed applications.
    *   **[HR] Vulnerable Dependencies:**
        *   **[CR] Exploit known vulnerabilities in frontend or backend libraries used by CasaOS UI:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** CasaOS web UI relies on third-party libraries (e.g., JavaScript frameworks, backend libraries) that may contain publicly known security vulnerabilities.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attacker identifies and exploits known vulnerabilities in outdated or vulnerable libraries used by CasaOS. This could be through direct exploitation or by crafting specific requests that trigger the vulnerability.
            *   **Impact:** Impact depends on the specific vulnerability, ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the CasaOS server or client-side execution in user browsers.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HR] Exploit CasaOS API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2___hr__exploit_casaos_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HR] API Authentication/Authorization Bypass:**
        *   **[HR] Weak API Keys/Tokens:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** CasaOS API might use weak or easily guessable API keys or tokens for authentication.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attacker attempts to guess or brute-force API keys or tokens to gain unauthorized access to the API.
            *   **Impact:** Successful bypass grants unauthorized access to CasaOS API functionality, potentially allowing for system manipulation and data access.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HR] Exploit CasaOS App Management System](./attack_tree_paths/3___hr__exploit_casaos_app_management_system.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HR] Malicious App Installation:**
        *   **[CR] Install compromised app from untrusted source (if allowed):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** CasaOS might allow users to install applications from untrusted or unverified sources.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attacker creates or modifies an application package to include malicious code and distributes it through untrusted channels. Users are tricked or persuaded into installing this malicious application through CasaOS.
            *   **Impact:** Installation of a malicious application can lead to full compromise of CasaOS, the managed applications, and potentially the host system, depending on the permissions granted to the application.
    *   **[HR] Container Escape (if apps are containerized):**
        *   **[CR] Exploit vulnerabilities in container runtime or CasaOS container management to escape container and access host system:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If CasaOS uses containerization (e.g., Docker) for applications, vulnerabilities in the container runtime (e.g., Docker engine) or CasaOS's container management implementation could allow for container escape.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attacker exploits a container escape vulnerability from within a compromised application container. This allows them to break out of the container's isolation and gain access to the underlying host operating system.
            *   **Impact:** Successful container escape grants the attacker access to the host system, potentially leading to full system compromise and control over all CasaOS managed applications and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [HR] Exploit CasaOS System-Level Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/4___hr__exploit_casaos_system-level_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HR] Default System Credentials:**
        *   **[CR] Access CasaOS host system using default SSH or other service credentials:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The underlying operating system hosting CasaOS might use default credentials for system services like SSH.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attacker attempts to connect to the CasaOS host system via SSH or other services using common default usernames and passwords for the operating system.
            *   **Impact:** Successful login grants full administrative access to the CasaOS host system, allowing for complete control and compromise.
    *   **[HR] Insecure System Configuration:**
        *   **[HR] Weak SSH configuration (e.g., password authentication enabled, weak ciphers):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Insecure SSH configuration on the CasaOS host system, such as allowing password authentication instead of key-based authentication, or using weak cryptographic ciphers.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attacker exploits weak SSH configuration to perform brute-force password attacks or exploit known vulnerabilities in older SSH protocols or ciphers.
            *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized SSH access to the CasaOS host system, granting administrative control.
    *   **[HR] Privilege Escalation on Host System:**
        *   **[CR] Exploit vulnerabilities in CasaOS scripts or system services to gain root privileges on the host OS:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** CasaOS might include scripts or system services that run with elevated privileges (e.g., root). Vulnerabilities in these components could be exploited for privilege escalation.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attacker identifies and exploits vulnerabilities in CasaOS scripts or services running with elevated privileges to gain root access on the host operating system.
            *   **Impact:** Successful privilege escalation grants the attacker full administrative control over the CasaOS host system.
    *   **[HR] Outdated System Components:**
        *   **[CR] Exploit known vulnerabilities in underlying OS, kernel, or system libraries used by CasaOS:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The underlying operating system, kernel, or system libraries used by CasaOS might be outdated and contain publicly known security vulnerabilities.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attacker identifies known vulnerabilities in outdated system components and exploits them to gain access or control over the CasaOS host system. This could be through local or remote exploitation depending on the vulnerability.
            *   **Impact:** Impact depends on the specific vulnerability, ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the CasaOS host system.
