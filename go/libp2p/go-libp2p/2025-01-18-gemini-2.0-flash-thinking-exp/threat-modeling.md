# Threat Model Analysis for libp2p/go-libp2p

## Threat: [Unencrypted Communication (Eavesdropping)](./threats/unencrypted_communication__eavesdropping_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could passively eavesdrop on network traffic between peers, capturing sensitive data being exchanged. This is possible if encryption is not enabled or is improperly configured within `go-libp2p`.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Affected Component:** `go-libp2p-transport/tcp`, `go-libp2p-transport/quic`, `go-libp2p/p2p/security/plaintext` (if used).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that secure transport protocols like TLS (using `libp2p/go-libp2p/p2p/security/tls`) or QUIC are enabled and properly configured for all communication.
    *   Avoid using the plaintext transport in production environments.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intercept communication between two peers, potentially eavesdropping, modifying, or injecting data. This could happen due to vulnerabilities in `go-libp2p`'s TLS implementation or if certificate validation is weak within `go-libp2p`.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data manipulation, integrity compromise, potential for impersonation.
*   **Affected Component:** `go-libp2p-transport/tcp`, `go-libp2p-transport/quic`, `go-libp2p/p2p/security/tls`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust certificate validation and pinning mechanisms when using `go-libp2p`'s security features.
    *   Ensure that peers verify the identity of the remote peer before establishing secure channels using `go-libp2p`'s provided functionalities.

## Threat: [Transport Layer Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/transport_layer_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood a node with connection requests or malformed packets, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and preventing it from communicating with legitimate peers. This could exploit vulnerabilities in `go-libp2p`'s connection handling.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, unavailability of the node.
*   **Affected Component:** `go-libp2p-transport/tcp`, `go-libp2p-transport/quic`, `go-libp2p/p2p/host/basic_host`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure appropriate resource limits for connections within `go-libp2p`.
    *   Stay updated with `go-libp2p` versions that include DoS protection improvements.

## Threat: [Peer ID Spoofing](./threats/peer_id_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to impersonate a legitimate peer by forging their peer ID. This could be facilitated by vulnerabilities in how `go-libp2p` handles peer identity verification.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation, service disruption, potential for impersonation.
*   **Affected Component:** `go-libp2p-core/peer`, `go-libp2p/p2p/host/basic_host`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize cryptographic signatures provided by `go-libp2p` to verify the authenticity of peer IDs.
    *   Implement strong key management practices as recommended by `go-libp2p`.

## Threat: [Weak Key Generation/Management](./threats/weak_key_generationmanagement.md)

*   **Description:** If the private keys used for peer identification are generated using weak methods or are not stored securely, this could be due to improper usage of `go-libp2p`'s key generation functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation, service disruption, complete compromise of the affected peer's identity.
*   **Affected Component:** `go-libp2p-crypto`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use cryptographically secure random number generators provided by `go-libp2p` for key generation.
    *   Store private keys securely, following best practices for key management within `go-libp2p` applications.

## Threat: [Routing Table Poisoning](./threats/routing_table_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject false routing information into the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) or other routing mechanisms used by `go-libp2p`, directing traffic to malicious nodes or disrupting network connectivity. This could exploit vulnerabilities in `go-libp2p`'s DHT implementation.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, data interception, network partitioning, potential for targeted attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** `go-libp2p-kad-dht`, `go-libp2p/p2p/discovery`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize secure DHT implementations within `go-libp2p` with node reputation and validation if available.
    *   Limit the ability of untrusted peers to update routing information within the `go-libp2p` configuration.

## Threat: [Eclipse Attack](./threats/eclipse_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could strategically position themselves to control all or most of the connections to a target node, isolating it from the rest of the network and potentially manipulating its view of the network. This could exploit how `go-libp2p` manages peer connections.
*   **Impact:** Network isolation, data manipulation, censorship, potential for targeted attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** `go-libp2p/p2p/host/basic_host`, `go-libp2p/p2p/discovery`.
