# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for libp2p/go-libp2p

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Peer Identity Verification (using `libp2p-pnet` and `libp2p-tls`)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_peer_identity_verification__using__libp2p-pnet__and__libp2p-tls__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Implement a combination of Private Network Protector (`libp2p-pnet`) and TLS-based PeerID verification (`libp2p-tls`).

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`libp2p-pnet` (Private Network):**
        *   Generate a pre-shared key (PSK).
        *   Configure the `go-libp2p` host using `libp2p.PrivateNetwork(psk)` during host creation, providing the PSK.
        *   Ensure all nodes in your private network use the *same* PSK.
    2.  **`libp2p-tls` (TLS with PeerID Verification):**
        *   Configure `go-libp2p` to use `libp2p-tls` for transport security: `libp2p.Security(libp2ptls.ID, libp2ptls.New)`.  
        *   Within your connection upgrade logic (e.g., a custom security upgrader), use `libp2ptls.ExtractPeerID` to get the `PeerID` from the presented TLS certificate.
        *   Verify that the extracted `PeerID` matches the expected `PeerID`.
        *   Reject connections if the certificate is invalid or the `PeerID` doesn't match.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Impersonation:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Sybil Attacks:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impersonation:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Sybil Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (within the private network).
    *   **MITM Attacks:** Risk reduced (further mitigation with certificate pinning is recommended, but that's less *directly* `go-libp2p`).

*   **Currently Implemented (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   `libp2p-pnet` is implemented in `host.go`.
    *   `libp2p-tls` is enabled by default. Basic certificate validation is performed.

*   **Missing Implementation (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   Strict `PeerID` verification is not consistently implemented.
    *   Strong cipher suite enforcement is not explicitly configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Gating and Resource Management](./mitigation_strategies/connection_gating_and_resource_management.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Use a `ConnectionGater` and the `go-libp2p-resource-manager` to control connections and limit resource consumption.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`ConnectionGater`:**
        *   Implement the `network.ConnectionGater` interface.
        *   Implement logic within the interface methods (`InterceptPeerDial`, `InterceptAccept`, `InterceptSecured`, `InterceptUpgraded`) to control connection establishment.
        *   Use this logic to limit connections, block malicious peers, and prioritize connections.
        *   Register the `ConnectionGater` with the host using `libp2p.ConnectionGater(yourGater)`.  
    2.  **`go-libp2p-resource-manager`:**
        *   Create a `resource.Manager` instance: `rm, err := rcmgr.NewResourceManager(rcmgr.NewFixedLimiter(rcmgr.InfiniteLimits))` or use a `rcmgr.NewDefaultResourceManager`.
        *   Configure limits using the `resource.Manager` API (e.g., `rm.SetLimit(...)`).
        *   Register the `resource.Manager` with the host using `libp2p.ResourceManager(rm)`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eclipse Attacks:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Sybil Attacks:** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eclipse Attacks:** Risk reduced.
    *   **DoS Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Sybil Attacks:** Risk partially reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   A basic `resource.Manager` is configured.
    *   No `ConnectionGater` is implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   `ConnectionGater` is entirely missing.
    *   `resource.Manager` limits are not fine-tuned.

## Mitigation Strategy: [GossipSub Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/gossipsub_hardening.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure GossipSub parameters to improve resilience.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review GossipSub Parameters:** Understand options like `WithPeerOutboundQueueSize`, `WithValidateQueueSize`, `WithMaxPendingConnections`, `WithPeerExchange`, `WithFloodPublish`, `WithHeartbeatInterval`.
    2.  **Adjust Parameters:** Use the `pubsub.Options` when creating the GossipSub instance (e.g., `pubsub.NewGossipSub(ctx, host, pubsub.WithPeerExchange(true))`). Adjust parameters based on your needs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eclipse Attacks:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Message Suppression/Modification:** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eclipse Attacks:** Risk reduced.
    *   **DoS Attacks:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Message Suppression/Modification:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   GossipSub is used with default parameters.

*   **Missing Implementation (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   No specific GossipSub hardening.

## Mitigation Strategy: [DHT Routing Table Protection (for `libp2p-kad-dht`)](./mitigation_strategies/dht_routing_table_protection__for__libp2p-kad-dht__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Use `libp2p-kad-dht` securely and implement custom validators.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Mode Selection:**
        *   Use `dht.ModeServer` *only* on trusted nodes.
        *   Use `dht.ModeClient` on all other nodes.  Set this using `dhtopts.Mode(dht.ModeClient)`.  
    2.  **Custom Validators (`WithValidators`):**
        *   Implement custom validation logic conforming to the `record.Validator` interface.
        *   Use `dhtopts.Validator(yourValidator)` when creating the DHT instance.
    3.  **Redundancy:** Query multiple peers for the same record.
    4.  **Refresh Routing Table:**  This happens automatically, but ensure reasonable refresh intervals.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Routing Table Poisoning:** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Routing Table Poisoning:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   Mixed `ModeServer`/`ModeClient` configuration.
    *   No custom validators.

*   **Missing Implementation (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   `ModeServer` on untrusted nodes.
    *   No custom validators.
