# Attack Surface Analysis for libp2p/go-libp2p

## Attack Surface: [1. Unnecessary/Misconfigured Transports](./attack_surfaces/1__unnecessarymisconfigured_transports.md)

*   **1. Unnecessary/Misconfigured Transports**

    *   **Description:** Enabling network transports (TCP, QUIC, WebSockets, etc.) that are not required or configuring them insecurely.
    *   **go-libp2p Contribution:** Provides a wide range of transport options, increasing the potential attack surface if not carefully managed.
    *   **Example:** An application only needs TCP but leaves QUIC enabled. A vulnerability in the QUIC implementation is exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), remote code execution (RCE) if a transport has a severe vulnerability, potential bypass of network security policies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability in the enabled transport).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Disable all unnecessary transports. Explicitly configure only the required transports. Enforce strong TLS configurations (TLS 1.3, modern cipher suites) for all enabled transports. Regularly audit transport configurations.

## Attack Surface: [2. DHT Poisoning/Eclipse Attacks](./attack_surfaces/2__dht_poisoningeclipse_attacks.md)

*   **2. DHT Poisoning/Eclipse Attacks**

    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) used for peer discovery, causing the application to connect to malicious peers.
    *   **go-libp2p Contribution:** Provides a Kademlia DHT implementation as a default peer discovery mechanism.
    *   **Example:** An attacker floods the DHT with entries pointing to their malicious nodes, causing a significant portion of legitimate nodes to connect to them.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service (by preventing connection to legitimate peers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust validation of DHT entries (e.g., checking peer IDs against known good values, using cryptographic signatures). Use multiple, diverse discovery mechanisms (static peers, bootstrap nodes, rendezvous points) in addition to the DHT. Consider using a private DHT or alternative discovery mechanisms if high security is required. Implement monitoring to detect suspicious DHT activity.

## Attack Surface: [3. Protocol Downgrade/Negotiation Attacks](./attack_surfaces/3__protocol_downgradenegotiation_attacks.md)

*   **3. Protocol Downgrade/Negotiation Attacks**

    *   **Description:** Attackers force the application to use a weaker or vulnerable protocol during the multistream-select negotiation process.
    *   **go-libp2p Contribution:** Uses multistream-select for protocol negotiation, which can be vulnerable to downgrade attacks if not properly configured.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the protocol negotiation and modifies it to force the use of an older, insecure protocol with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of communication confidentiality and integrity, potentially leading to data breaches or other attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Explicitly define the allowed protocols and their priorities. Enforce a minimum security level for negotiated protocols. Validate the integrity of the negotiation process (e.g., using cryptographic signatures). Thoroughly test the protocol negotiation logic for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [4. Unpatched `go-libp2p` Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/4__unpatched__go-libp2p__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **4. Unpatched `go-libp2p` Vulnerabilities**

    *   **Description:** Exploitation of known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the `go-libp2p` library itself.
    *   **go-libp2p Contribution:** The library itself is a complex piece of software and may contain vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A newly discovered vulnerability in `go-libp2p`'s connection handling is exploited to gain remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the vulnerability, potentially ranging from DoS to RCE.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).  We keep this as it can easily be *Critical*.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep the `go-libp2p` library and its dependencies up to date. Monitor security advisories and mailing lists for the library. Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies. Perform regular security audits and penetration testing.
