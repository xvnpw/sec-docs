## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Availability, Integrity, or Confidentiality of the Application's P2P Network/Peers](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_availability__integrity__or_confidentiality_of_the_application's_p2p_networkpeers.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching goal of the attacker. It encompasses any action that negatively impacts the application's p2p functionality.
*   **Criticality:** This is the root node and, by definition, critical.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks aimed at making the application or its p2p network unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Criticality:** Critical due to the high impact and relative ease of some DoS attacks.
*   **Sub-Goals:**
    *   **[[Resource Exhaustion]]**: Consume resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, connections) to make the system unresponsive.
        *   **Criticality:** A common and effective attack vector.
        *   **Sub-Goal:**
            *   **[[Flood]]**: Send a large volume of requests or data to overwhelm the target.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
                *   **Impact:** High to Very High
                *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
                *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
                *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust rate limiting, connection limits, and resource management. Monitor resource usage. Use circuit breakers.
    *   **[Network Disruption]**: Prevent nodes from communicating with each other.
        *   **Sub-Goal:**
            *   **[Block/Isolate]**: Exploit routing or discovery to prevent nodes from connecting.
                *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
                *   **Impact:** High to Very High
                *   **Effort:** Medium to High
                *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
                *   **Mitigation:** Use trusted bootstrap nodes, static peer lists, or secure discovery protocols. Validate peer IDs and addresses. Monitor network topology.
    * **[Exploit Vulnerabilities]:** Leverage bugs in go-libp2p or its dependencies.
        *   **Sub-Goal:**
            *   **[Crash]**: Send crafted messages to trigger a crash.
                *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
                *   **Impact:** High
                *   **Effort:** Medium to High
                *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                *   **Mitigation:** Fuzz testing, robust error handling, keep software up-to-date.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Confidentiality](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_confidentiality.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to data exchanged between peers.
*   **Criticality:** Critical due to the potential for sensitive data exposure.
*   **Sub-Goals:**
    *   **[[Eavesdropping]]**: Passively listen to network traffic.
        *   **Criticality:** A fundamental threat to confidentiality.
        *   **Sub-Goal:**
            *   **[[Sniff]]**: Capture network traffic without authorization.
                *   **Likelihood:** High (if unencrypted)
                *   **Impact:** Medium to High
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Novice
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
                *   **Mitigation:** *Enforce authenticated encryption for all communication.* This is the primary and most crucial defense.

## Attack Tree Path: [Protocol Misuse](./attack_tree_paths/protocol_misuse.md)

* **Sub-Goal:**
    *   **[Abuse]**: Use a protocol in unintended ways to cause issues.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
        *   **Mitigation:** Clearly define and enforce intended protocol behavior. Implement input validation and sanitization. Conduct thorough security reviews of custom protocols.
