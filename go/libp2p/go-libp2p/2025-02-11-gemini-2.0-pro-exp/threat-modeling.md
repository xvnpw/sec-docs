# Threat Model Analysis for libp2p/go-libp2p

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Connection Flooding](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_connection_flooding.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Connection Flooding
    *   **Description:** An attacker opens a large number of connections to a target node, exhausting its resources (file descriptors, memory, CPU) and preventing legitimate peers from connecting. The attacker doesn't necessarily complete the handshake; they just initiate many connections. This directly exploits the connection handling mechanisms of `go-libp2p`.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for legitimate peers; the target node becomes unresponsive or crashes.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-libp2p-swarm` (specifically, the connection manager and listener components). Also potentially affects the underlying transport (e.g., TCP listener if not properly configured in conjunction with `go-libp2p`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `Swarm.ConnMgr` with appropriate limits: `HighWater`, `LowWater`, and `GracePeriod`. Tune these values based on expected load and available resources.
        *   Use `go-libp2p-resource-manager` to set limits on the number of inbound connections, streams, and memory usage per peer and globally. This is a *crucial* component for mitigating this threat.
        *   Implement connection gating to reject connections from known malicious IPs or Peer IDs.
        *   Monitor connection attempts and rates; implement rate limiting to block IPs exceeding a threshold.

## Threat: [Sybil Attack on DHT](./threats/sybil_attack_on_dht.md)

*   **Threat:** Sybil Attack on DHT
    *   **Description:** An attacker creates a large number of fake Peer IDs and uses them to populate the DHT routing table with incorrect entries, directing queries to malicious nodes or preventing legitimate data from being found. This directly targets the `go-libp2p-kad-dht` implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Disruption of data discovery and retrieval; potential for data censorship or manipulation; compromise of application-level consensus mechanisms relying on the DHT.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-libp2p-kad-dht` (Kademlia DHT implementation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use signed records in the DHT (e.g., `libp2p.RecordValidator`). This requires peers to sign their records, making it harder to forge entries. This is a *key* mitigation for DHT security.
        *   Implement a robust peer discovery mechanism *in addition to* the DHT, such as a list of trusted bootstrap nodes.
        *   Increase the `k` value (bucket size) in the Kademlia configuration to make it harder for an attacker to control a significant portion of a bucket.
        *   Implement application-level logic to validate data retrieved from the DHT, even if the DHT itself is compromised (defense in depth).

## Threat: [Eclipse Attack via Connection Hijacking](./threats/eclipse_attack_via_connection_hijacking.md)

*   **Threat:** Eclipse Attack via Connection Hijacking
    *   **Description:** An attacker gradually replaces a target node's legitimate connections with connections controlled by the attacker. This can be done by exploiting connection churn or by actively disconnecting the target from legitimate peers. Once isolated, the attacker can feed the target false information. This directly manipulates `go-libp2p`'s connection management.
    *   **Impact:** Isolation of the target node from the rest of the network; the target receives manipulated data and cannot communicate with legitimate peers.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-libp2p-swarm` (connection management), peer discovery mechanisms (e.g., `go-libp2p-kad-dht`, mDNS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain connections to a diverse set of peers, including well-known and trusted bootstrap nodes.
        *   Use multiple peer discovery mechanisms (e.g., DHT + mDNS + static peer list).
        *   Implement connection gating to prioritize connections from known good peers.
        *   Monitor the node's connection list and detect if it's only connected to a small, suspicious set of peers. Alert if the number of connections to known good peers drops below a threshold.
        *   Periodically attempt to reconnect to known good peers, even if existing connections are active.

## Threat: [Confidentiality Breach via Unencrypted Transport](./threats/confidentiality_breach_via_unencrypted_transport.md)

*   **Threat:** Confidentiality Breach via Unencrypted Transport
    *   **Description:** The application uses an unencrypted transport, allowing an attacker to eavesdrop on communication between peers and read sensitive data. This is a *critical* misconfiguration of `go-libp2p`.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data; loss of confidentiality.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-libp2p-core/transport`. This is a direct misuse of the transport interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always** use a secure transport: `go-libp2p-tls`, `go-libp2p-noise`, or `go-libp2p-quic-transport`. Do *not* use `go-libp2p-tcp` without TLS or another secure transport wrapper.
        *   Ensure proper configuration of the chosen transport, including certificate verification (for TLS) and key exchange (for Noise).

## Threat: [Data Tampering via Unsigned Messages (When Using libp2p PubSub)](./threats/data_tampering_via_unsigned_messages__when_using_libp2p_pubsub_.md)

* **Threat:** Data Tampering via Unsigned Messages (When Using libp2p PubSub)
    *   **Description:** When using `go-libp2p-pubsub`, if messages are not signed, an attacker can inject or modify messages within a topic, leading to data corruption or incorrect application behavior. This is a direct misuse of the PubSub component.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption; the application receives and processes incorrect data, leading to incorrect behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-libp2p-pubsub`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize the `pubsub.WithSignaturePolicy(pubsub.StrictSign)` option when creating the PubSub instance. This enforces signature verification on all received messages.
        *   Ensure that all publishers sign their messages using a consistent and secure key management strategy.
        *   Implement application-level validation of message content *in addition to* signature verification (defense in depth).

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation (Critical Vulnerability)](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation__critical_vulnerability_.md)

* **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation (Critical Vulnerability)
    *   **Description:** A *critical* vulnerability is discovered in `go-libp2p` itself or one of its *core* dependencies (e.g., a crypto library). An attacker exploits this vulnerability to compromise nodes running the application, potentially leading to RCE.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but could lead to complete compromise of the target node (RCE) or severe denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any `go-libp2p` component or its *core* dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediately** update `go-libp2p` and all its dependencies upon the release of a security patch.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, GitHub Security Advisories) for `go-libp2p` and its dependencies *proactively*.
        *   Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Consider using a vulnerability scanner to automatically detect and report vulnerabilities.
