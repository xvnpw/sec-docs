## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Istio Exploitation:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_istio_exploitation.md)

*   This is the root goal. Success in any of the sub-paths leads to achieving this goal. It is critical because it represents the ultimate objective of the attacker and signifies a complete security breach from Istio perspective.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] 1. Compromise Control Plane (istiod):](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__1__compromise_control_plane__istiod_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1. Exploit istiod Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1.1. Exploit Known CVEs in istiod:** Attackers scan for and exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in `istiod` if it's not patched.
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2. Exploit istiod API Server Access:**
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2.1. Unauthorized Access to istiod APIs:**
                *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2.1.1. Credential Compromise (Service Account, API Tokens):** Stealing credentials to access `istiod` APIs.
                *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2.1.2. Exploiting RBAC Misconfiguration:** Leveraging overly permissive RBAC roles to gain API access.
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2.2. API Abuse for Malicious Configuration:** Using compromised API access to inject malicious configurations into Istio.

*   **Why Critical:** Compromising `istiod` grants the attacker control over the entire service mesh. This allows for manipulation of routing, security policies, and potentially complete application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] 2. Compromise Data Plane (Envoy Proxies):](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__2__compromise_data_plane__envoy_proxies_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1. Exploit Envoy Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.1. Exploit Known CVEs in Envoy:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in Envoy proxies if they are not patched.
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.2. Envoy Misconfiguration Exploitation:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.2.1. Permissive CORS Policies:** Exploiting overly permissive CORS settings in Envoy to perform cross-site attacks.
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.2.4. Insecure Routing Rules:** Exploiting misconfigured routing rules in Envoy to redirect traffic.

*   **Why Critical:** Envoy proxies handle all application traffic. Compromising them allows for direct traffic interception, modification, and redirection, leading to data breaches and application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] 3. Exploit Istio Configuration/Misconfiguration:](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__3__exploit_istio_configurationmisconfiguration.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 3.1. Misconfigured Authorization Policies:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 3.1.1. Overly Permissive Policies:** Exploiting authorization policies that are too broad, granting unintended access.
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 3.2. Misconfigured Routing (Virtual Services, Gateways):**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 3.2.1. Unintended Route Exposure:** Exploiting routing rules that expose internal services to external networks.
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 3.2.2. Route Hijacking via Configuration Manipulation:** Manipulating routing rules (if configuration access is gained) to redirect traffic.
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 3.2.3. Gateway Misconfiguration (e.g., Open Ports, Weak TLS):** Exploiting misconfigurations in Istio Gateways that weaken security.

*   **Why High Risk:** Misconfigurations are common and can directly lead to security bypasses, unauthorized access, and exposure of sensitive services and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] 5. Exploit Istio Security Features Weaknesses:](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__5__exploit_istio_security_features_weaknesses.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 5.1. Bypass mTLS (Mutual TLS):**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 5.1.3. mTLS Policy Bypass due to Misconfiguration:** Exploiting misconfigurations in mTLS policies to bypass mutual authentication.
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 5.2. Exploit Request Authentication Weaknesses:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 5.2.1. JWT Validation Bypass:** Finding vulnerabilities in JWT validation logic to bypass authentication.
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 5.2.3. Insecure JWT Handling in Applications:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how applications handle JWT tokens issued by Istio.

*   **Why High Risk:** Weaknesses in Istio's security features directly undermine the intended security posture, potentially leading to authentication bypass and traffic interception.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] 6. Exploit External Dependencies of Istio:](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__6__exploit_external_dependencies_of_istio.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 6.1. Kubernetes Infrastructure Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 6.1.1. Kubernetes API Server Exploitation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes API server to gain cluster-wide access.
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 6.1.3. Kubernetes RBAC Exploitation:** Exploiting weaknesses in Kubernetes RBAC to gain unauthorized access to Istio resources.

*   **Why High Risk:** Istio relies heavily on Kubernetes. Compromising the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure directly impacts Istio's security and can lead to widespread compromise.
