## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Control Plane Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_control_plane_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This high-risk path targets the core management components of Istio.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Pilot Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pilot_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

Pilot manages traffic routing. Exploiting vulnerabilities here allows attackers to:
        *   **Gain Code Execution on Pilot [CRITICAL]:** Achieving this grants full control over traffic management, enabling widespread disruption and data interception.
        *   **Manipulate Routing Rules to Redirect Traffic [CRITICAL]:** This allows attackers to intercept sensitive data or disrupt service availability.
            *   **Intercept Sensitive Data [CRITICAL]:**  Redirecting traffic through attacker-controlled services allows for eavesdropping.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Citadel Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_citadel_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

Citadel manages security and identity. Exploiting vulnerabilities here allows attackers to:
        *   **Obtain Private Keys for Service Identities [CRITICAL]:** This allows for the complete impersonation of legitimate services.
        *   **Forge Service Certificates [CRITICAL]:**  Creating fake certificates allows attackers to impersonate services without stealing existing keys.
            *   **Impersonate Services [CRITICAL]:**  Using forged or stolen credentials to act as a legitimate service.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Galley Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_galley_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

Galley handles configuration. Exploiting vulnerabilities here allows attackers to:
        *   **Modify Istio Configuration [CRITICAL]:** This can disrupt the entire service mesh, bypass security policies, or redirect traffic.
        *   **Inject Malicious Configuration [CRITICAL]:**  Introducing harmful configurations can lead to widespread disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sidecar Injector Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sidecar_injector_vulnerabilities.md)

While the top node isn't marked as high-risk, the potential impact of compromising it leads to critical nodes:
        *   **Inject Malicious Sidecar Proxies [CRITICAL]:** Replacing legitimate proxies with malicious ones allows for traffic manipulation and data interception on a large scale.
        *   **Inject Malicious Code into Sidecar Containers [CRITICAL]:**  Directly injecting code into the sidecar allows for control over the application container.
            *   **Gain Control of Application Container [CRITICAL]:**  Achieving this grants full access to the application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Data Plane (Envoy Proxy) Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_plane__envoy_proxy__vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This high-risk path targets the proxies that handle all service-to-service communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Known CVEs in Envoy [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_cves_in_envoy__critical_.md)

Exploiting known vulnerabilities in Envoy can lead to:
        *   **Gain Code Execution within Envoy [CRITICAL]:** This allows access to data in transit and the potential for further compromise.
            *   **Access Sensitive Data in Transit [CRITICAL]:**  Reading the decrypted traffic passing through the compromised proxy.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Misconfigurations in Envoy Filters [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_in_envoy_filters__critical_.md)

Incorrectly configured filters can bypass security controls.
        *   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization Checks [CRITICAL]:**  Allowing unauthorized access to protected resources.
            *   **Access Protected Resources [CRITICAL]:** Gaining access to data or functionality that should be restricted.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Insecure Istio Configuration [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_istio_configuration__critical_.md)

This high-risk path focuses on weaknesses introduced by improper configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Weak Authentication Policies [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/weak_authentication_policies__critical_.md)

Not enforcing or properly configuring mTLS allows for:
        *   **Bypass Mutual TLS (mTLS) [CRITICAL]:**  Circumventing the secure authentication mechanism.
            *   **Impersonate Services [CRITICAL]:**  Acting as a legitimate service without proper authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Permissive Authorization Policies [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/permissive_authorization_policies__critical_.md)

Granting excessive permissions allows for:
        *   **Access Resources Without Proper Authorization [CRITICAL]:**  Accessing data or functionality that should be restricted based on identity.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Insecure Service-to-Service Communication Settings [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_service-to-service_communication_settings__critical_.md)

Allowing unencrypted communication enables:
        *   **Downgrade to Unencrypted Communication [CRITICAL]:** Forcing communication to occur without encryption.
            *   **Intercept Sensitive Data in Transit [CRITICAL]:**  Eavesdropping on unencrypted communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Misconfigured Ingress Gateway [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_ingress_gateway__critical_.md)

Incorrectly configured gateways can lead to:
        *   **Bypass Authentication at the Gateway [CRITICAL]:**  Allowing unauthorized access to internal services from outside the mesh.
        *   **Expose Internal Services Directly [CRITICAL]:**  Making internal services accessible without going through proper security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Leaked Secrets or Credentials [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/leaked_secrets_or_credentials__critical_.md)

Exposed API keys or certificates allow attackers to:
        *   **Obtain API Keys or Certificates Used by Istio Components [CRITICAL]:** Gaining access to sensitive credentials.
            *   **Impersonate Istio Components [CRITICAL]:**  Using leaked credentials to act as a legitimate Istio component, granting significant control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sidecar Takeover:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sidecar_takeover.md)

This path becomes high-risk once the application container is compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Container [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_container__critical_.md)

While not directly an Istio vulnerability, this is a prerequisite for sidecar takeover.
        *   **Gain Shell Access to Application Container [CRITICAL]:**  Achieving shell access allows for interaction with the local sidecar.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Leverage Access to Sidecar Proxy [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_access_to_sidecar_proxy__critical_.md)

Once inside the container, attackers can:
        *   **Intercept and Modify Traffic [CRITICAL]:**  Manipulating traffic passing through the local Envoy proxy.
        *   **Impersonate the Application [CRITICAL]:**  Using the sidecar to act as the compromised application.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Supply Chain Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_supply_chain_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This high-risk path targets the integrity of the Istio installation itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Compromise Istio Installation Packages [CRITICAL]:**](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_istio_installation_packages__critical_.md)

Tampering with the installation process can lead to:
        *   **Inject Malicious Code into Istio Components [CRITICAL]:**  Introducing backdoors or malicious functionality directly into Istio.
        *   **Deploy Backdoored Istio Environment [CRITICAL]:**  Deploying a compromised version of Istio from the outset.
