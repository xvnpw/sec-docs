## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known CVEs in Control Plane Services](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_cves_in_control_plane_services.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in Istio's control plane components like Pilot, Citadel, or Galley. These vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution, privilege escalation, or denial of service.

**Mechanism:**  Attackers often use readily available exploit code or tools to target these known weaknesses.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to full compromise of the control plane, allowing attackers to manipulate the entire service mesh, intercept traffic, or disrupt services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authorization Policy Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authorization_policy_flaws.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the way Istio's authorization policies are defined or implemented. This could involve finding logical errors in the policies, identifying overly permissive rules, or discovering ways to bypass the intended authorization checks.

**Mechanism:** Attackers analyze the defined policies and attempt to craft requests or manipulate contexts to circumvent the intended access controls.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can grant unauthorized access to control plane functionalities, allowing attackers to modify mesh configurations, deploy malicious services, or gain insights into sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known CVEs in Envoy](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_cves_in_envoy.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target publicly known vulnerabilities in the Envoy proxy, which handles all traffic within the mesh. These vulnerabilities could include buffer overflows, memory corruption issues, or flaws in specific filters.

**Mechanism:** Attackers send specially crafted requests or data that trigger the vulnerability in the Envoy proxy.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to service crashes, denial of service, or in some cases, remote code execution on the proxy itself, potentially allowing for further compromise of the application container.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Envoy Proxy Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_envoy_proxy_misconfigurations.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers take advantage of incorrect or insecure configurations of the Envoy proxy. This could involve misconfigured routing rules, overly permissive access controls, or disabled security features.

**Mechanism:** Attackers analyze the Envoy configuration (often through Istio's configuration mechanisms) and craft requests or manipulate traffic to exploit these misconfigurations.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to services, data interception, or redirection of traffic to malicious endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization Policies in Envoy](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization_policies_in_envoy.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers find ways to circumvent the authentication and authorization checks enforced by Envoy filters. This could involve exploiting flaws in the filter logic, manipulating headers, or exploiting inconsistencies in how authentication is enforced.

**Mechanism:** Attackers craft requests that bypass the intended authentication or authorization checks, gaining unauthorized access to protected services.

**Impact:** Successful bypass allows attackers to access services they should not be able to, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Mutual TLS (mTLS)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_mutual_tls__mtls_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to undermine the mutual TLS mechanism that provides secure, authenticated communication between services. This could involve downgrade attacks, exploiting weaknesses in certificate validation, or compromising certificate authorities.

**Mechanism:** Attackers might try to force connections to use less secure protocols, present invalid certificates, or impersonate legitimate services.

**Impact:** Successful bypass removes the strong authentication and encryption provided by mTLS, allowing for eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and impersonation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulating Request Headers to Bypass Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/manipulating_request_headers_to_bypass_authorization.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject or manipulate HTTP headers that are used by Istio's authorization policies to make unauthorized access decisions.

**Mechanism:** Attackers add, modify, or remove headers to trick the authorization system into granting access.

**Impact:** Gain unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Logic Errors in Authorization Policies](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_logic_errors_in_authorization_policies.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit flaws in the logical construction of Istio's authorization policies.

**Mechanism:**  Attackers craft requests that satisfy the policy conditions in unintended ways, bypassing the intended access controls.

**Impact:** Gain unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_default_configurations.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit default settings in Istio that are insecure or have known vulnerabilities. This could include default ports, weak authentication settings, or enabled but unnecessary features.

**Mechanism:** Attackers leverage knowledge of these default configurations to gain unauthorized access or exploit known weaknesses.

**Impact:**  Can lead to various security vulnerabilities depending on the specific insecure default.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_configurations.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain the ability to modify Istio's configuration to introduce malicious settings. This could involve injecting routing rules that redirect traffic, modifying authorization policies to grant unauthorized access, or disabling security features.

**Mechanism:** Attackers might compromise the configuration management system or exploit vulnerabilities in Istio's configuration update mechanisms.

**Impact:** Allows for widespread manipulation of the service mesh, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or the deployment of malicious services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Injection Templates](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_injection_templates.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise the templates used by Istio to inject the sidecar proxy into application pods. By modifying these templates, they can inject malicious code or configurations into every new pod deployed in the mesh.

**Mechanism:** Attackers gain access to the Kubernetes resources (like `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`) that manage sidecar injection and modify the templates.

**Impact:**  Allows for widespread compromise of application containers within the mesh, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or control over application processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Application Secrets or Data from the Sidecar](./attack_tree_paths/access_application_secrets_or_data_from_the_sidecar.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage the shared resources (like network namespace or filesystem) between the sidecar proxy and the application container to access sensitive information intended only for the application.

**Mechanism:** Attackers might use tools within the sidecar container or exploit vulnerabilities in the shared environment to access application secrets, environment variables, or data files.

**Impact:**  Exposes sensitive application data or credentials, which can be used for further attacks or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Control Plane Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_control_plane_vulnerabilities.md)

Compromising the control plane grants the attacker significant control over the entire service mesh. They can manipulate routing, authorization, and other critical aspects, leading to widespread impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Control Plane Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_control_plane_authenticationauthorization.md)

Gaining unauthorized access to the control plane allows attackers to manage and manipulate the entire mesh as if they were legitimate administrators.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Plane (Envoy Proxy) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_plane__envoy_proxy__vulnerabilities.md)

The Envoy proxy handles all traffic within the mesh. Exploiting vulnerabilities here can directly impact the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of application services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Configuration Management System](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_configuration_management_system.md)

Controlling the configuration system allows attackers to inject malicious settings that affect the entire service mesh, providing a powerful attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Sidecar Injector](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_sidecar_injector.md)

This allows attackers to inject malicious sidecars into application pods, potentially compromising every application within the mesh.
