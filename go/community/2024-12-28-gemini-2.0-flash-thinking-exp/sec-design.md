## Project Design Document: Knative Community (Improved)

**1. Introduction**

This document provides a detailed architectural overview of the Knative Community project, primarily hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/knative/community](https://github.com/knative/community). This document is designed to serve as a foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities by clearly outlining the project's components, data flows, and interactions, with a focus on identifying potential attack surfaces.

**2. Goals and Objectives**

The primary goals of the Knative Community project are to:

*   Cultivate a thriving and collaborative community around the Knative project.
*   Serve as the central, authoritative source for community-related information, guidelines, and processes.
*   Facilitate effective communication and engagement among diverse community members.
*   Document and make transparent community governance and decision-making processes.
*   Provide resources and guidance to onboard new contributors and users to the Knative ecosystem.

**3. Scope**

This design document focuses on the publicly accessible and directly managed aspects of the Knative Community project, primarily encompassing:

*   The core GitHub repository (`github.com/knative/community`) and its contents.
*   The official community website and documentation, whether hosted within the repository (e.g., using GitHub Pages) or linked directly from it.
*   Publicly accessible and officially managed communication channels, such as designated mailing lists and the official Knative Slack workspace (to the extent their management is linked to the community repository).
*   Publicly accessible meeting minutes, recordings, and associated documents officially linked within the community repository.

This document explicitly excludes:

*   The internal infrastructure and codebase of the core Knative project components (e.g., Serving, Eventing).
*   Individual contributors' personal development environments and tools.
*   Private or unofficial communication channels not directly managed or officially linked within the community repository.
*   The security posture of third-party services integrated with the community infrastructure (these are noted but not analyzed in detail).

This section outlines potential security threats and vulnerabilities associated with each component, categorized by potential impact and likelihood.

*   **GitHub Repository ('knative/community'):**
    *   **Threat:** Malicious Contribution Injection
        *   **Threat Agent:** Malicious Contributor
        *   **Goal:** Introduce malicious code or content (e.g., scripts in documents) that could be executed by other users or compromise the integrity of the repository.
        *   **Mitigation:** Code review processes, input sanitization for web-based editing, access controls.
    *   **Threat:** Account Compromise (Maintainer/Committer)

        *   **Goal:** Post links to phishing sites disguised as legitimate community resources.
        *   **Mitigation:** Link shortening services with security checks, monitoring for suspicious links.

**8. Assumptions and Constraints**

*   The security of third-party platforms (e.g., GitHub, Slack, Zoom, Google Groups) is primarily the responsibility of those providers. The community relies on their security measures.
*   Public communication channels are inherently less secure than private channels. Information shared on these platforms should be considered public.
*   Community members are expected to adhere to the project's Code of Conduct, which includes guidelines for respectful and responsible behavior.
*   Maintainers and committers have elevated privileges within the GitHub repository and are trusted to act responsibly.
*   This document focuses on the security of the community's online presence and does not cover the security of the core Knative project's codebase or infrastructure.

**9. Future Considerations**

*   Regular security audits of the community infrastructure and processes should be conducted.
*   Formal security policies and incident response plans should be developed and documented.
*   As the community grows and evolves, the security landscape may change, requiring updates to this design document and security measures.
*   Consider implementing security awareness training for community members, especially those with elevated privileges.

This improved design document provides a more detailed and threat-modeling-focused overview of the Knative Community project's architecture. It highlights potential attack surfaces and vulnerabilities, enabling the community to proactively address security risks and maintain a secure and collaborative environment.
