## Combined Vulnerability List for MongoDB Go Driver Project

This document combines two discovered vulnerabilities in the MongoDB Go Driver project into a single list, removing any potential duplicates and maintaining the detailed description for each.

* Vulnerability Name: **RawValue Type Confusion Vulnerability in BSON Decoding**
    * Description:
        1. An attacker crafts a BSON document where a `RawValue` element has an invalid `Type` field (e.g., `0x00` - invalid type).
        2. The attacker sends this crafted BSON document to an application that uses the MongoDB Go Driver and decodes BSON data into Go structs or interfaces that include `bson.RawValue` fields.
        3. During decoding, the `rawValueEncodeValue` function in `primitive_codecs.go` checks if the `RawValue.Type` is valid using `rawvalue.Type.IsValid()`.
        4. However, if `RawValue.Type` is invalid (e.g., `0x00`), the condition `!rawvalue.Type.IsValid()` becomes true.
        5. The function incorrectly returns an error:  `fmt.Errorf("the RawValue Type specifies an invalid BSON type: %#x", byte(rawvalue.Type))`.
        6. **Crucially, this error is returned during encoding (`rawValueEncodeValue`), not during decoding (`rawValueDecodeValue`). The `rawValueDecodeValue` function, responsible for *decoding*, does not validate the `RawValue.Type` after reading it from the BSON stream.**
        7. When decoding a BSON document containing this invalid `RawValue`, the `rawValueDecodeValue` function in `primitive_codecs.go` will successfully decode the raw bytes without validating the type.
        8. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary bytes into a `RawValue` field, potentially leading to type confusion or unexpected behavior in application code that processes the decoded `RawValue`.
        9. The vulnerability lies in the inconsistent validation of `RawValue.Type` - it is validated during encoding but not during decoding, allowing invalid types to be deserialized.
    * Impact:
        - **High**: Type confusion vulnerability. An attacker can inject arbitrary BSON data, including potentially malicious payloads, into `bson.RawValue` fields. This could lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or potentially escalate to more severe vulnerabilities depending on how the application processes `bson.RawValue` data.
        - If the application directly uses the `RawValue.Value` without proper type checking after decoding, it might misinterpret the data, leading to logical errors or security bypasses.
    * Vulnerability Rank: high
    * Currently Implemented Mitigations:
        - None in the `rawValueDecodeValue` function itself.
        - The `rawValueEncodeValue` function performs validation, but this is irrelevant for decoding vulnerabilities.
    * Missing Mitigations:
        - **Input Validation in `rawValueDecodeValue`:**  The `rawValueDecodeValue` function should validate the `RawValue.Type` after reading it from the BSON stream, similar to how `rawValueEncodeValue` does during encoding. If an invalid type is encountered, `rawValueDecodeValue` should return an error, preventing deserialization of malformed `RawValue` elements.
    * Preconditions:
        - Application must be using `bson.RawValue` type in Go structs to represent raw BSON values.
        - Application must be decoding BSON data from untrusted sources (e.g., external input, network requests).
    * Source Code Analysis:

        ```go
        // code/bson/primitive_codecs.go

        // rawValueEncodeValue is the ValueEncoderFunc for RawValue.
        //
        // If the RawValue's Type is "invalid" and the RawValue's Value is not empty or
        // nil, then this method will return an error.
        func rawValueEncodeValue(_ EncodeContext, vw ValueWriter, val reflect.Value) error {
            // ... (validation and encoding logic)

            if !rawvalue.Type.IsValid() { // VALIDATION DURING ENCODING
                return fmt.Errorf("the RawValue Type specifies an invalid BSON type: %#x", byte(rawvalue.Type))
            }

            return copyValueFromBytes(vw, rawvalue.Type, rawvalue.Value)
        }

        // rawValueDecodeValue is the ValueDecoderFunc for RawValue.
        func rawValueDecodeValue(_ DecodeContext, vr ValueReader, val reflect.Value) error {
            // ... (decoding logic)

            t, value, err := copyValueToBytes(vr) // READS TYPE FROM BSON STREAM
            if err != nil {
                return err
            }

            val.Set(reflect.ValueOf(RawValue{Type: t, Value: value})) // NO VALIDATION OF 't' AFTER DECODING
            return nil
        }
        ```

        **Visualization:**

        ```mermaid
        graph LR
            A[Crafted BSON with invalid RawValue Type] --> B(Application decodes BSON);
            B --> C{rawValueDecodeValue (primitive_codecs.go)};
            C --> D{Reads Type 't' and Value from BSON stream};
            D --> E{Sets RawValue{Type: t, Value: value}};
            E -- No validation of 't' --> F[RawValue with invalid Type in Go struct];
            F --> G(Application processes RawValue.Value);
            G -- Type confusion/Unexpected behavior --> H[Potential Vulnerability Exploitation];
        ```

    * Security Test Case:

        1. **Setup:** Create a simple Go application that:
            - Defines a struct containing a `bson.RawValue` field.
            - Accepts BSON data as input (e.g., from standard input or HTTP request).
            - Unmarshals the BSON data into the struct.
            - Prints the `RawValue.Type` and `RawValue.Value` to standard output.

        2. **Craft Malicious BSON:** Create a hex-encoded BSON document with a `RawValue` element that has an invalid type byte (`0x00`) and arbitrary value bytes. For example, a minimal document structure could be:

            ```
            \x13\x00\x00\x00  // Document length: 19 bytes
            \xFF            // Invalid Type (0xFF is just an example, 0x00 also works)
            \x00            // ElementName: "" (empty string)
            \x04\x00\x00\x00\x01\x02\x03\x00 // String value: "0x04 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x00" (just example bytes)
            \x00            // Document end
            ```
            Hex representation of the above BSON: `13000000ff00040000000102030000`

        3. **Execute Test:**
            - Run the Go application.
            - Provide the crafted hex-encoded BSON document as input to the application (e.g., using `echo -ne '\x13\x00\x00\x00\xff\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00\x01\x02\x03\x00\x00' | go run your_app.go`).

        4. **Verification:**
            - Observe the output of the Go application.
            - **Vulnerability Confirmation:** If the application successfully decodes the BSON document *without errors* and prints the `RawValue.Type` as `invalid` (or a similar unexpected type) and the `RawValue.Value` contains the arbitrary bytes (`\x01\x02\x03` in this example), then the vulnerability is confirmed. This indicates that the invalid `RawValue.Type` was not rejected during decoding.
            - **Expected Behavior (Mitigation):** If the application throws an error during unmarshaling indicating an invalid BSON type or if the `RawValue` field is not populated due to a decoding error, then the vulnerability is likely mitigated.

* Vulnerability Name: **Truncated Multi-byte UTF-8 Characters in StringN**
    * Description:
        The `StringN` function in `bsoncore/value.go` truncates strings to a specified byte length (`n`). When truncating multi-byte UTF-8 strings, the truncation might occur in the middle of a multi-byte character, leading to an invalid UTF-8 sequence. This can cause issues when the truncated string is used in contexts where valid UTF-8 is expected, such as display in user interfaces, logging systems, or other downstream systems that rely on valid UTF-8.

        Steps to trigger vulnerability:
        1. Create a BSON string value containing multi-byte UTF-8 characters (e.g., "你好世界").
        2. Call the `StringN` function on this value with a byte length that truncates a multi-byte character (e.g., length of 4 for "你好世界").
        3. Observe the output string, which will contain an invalid UTF-8 sequence.

    * Impact:
        The impact of this vulnerability is categorized as high because it can lead to data corruption or misrepresentation when handling UTF-8 strings. Specifically:
        - Data corruption: Truncating a string in the middle of a multi-byte character can result in invalid UTF-8 data. If this corrupted data is persisted or transmitted, it can lead to data corruption issues in downstream systems that expect valid UTF-8.
        - Misrepresentation of data: When displaying or logging the truncated string, the invalid UTF-8 sequence might be rendered incorrectly, leading to misrepresentation of the intended data. This could have security implications if the misrepresented data is used for security decisions or auditing.

    * Vulnerability Rank: high

    * Currently implemented mitigations:
        There are no mitigations implemented in the `StringN` function to handle multi-byte character truncation. The function directly truncates the byte slice without considering UTF-8 encoding.

    * Missing mitigations:
        The `StringN` function should be updated to truncate strings correctly at UTF-8 character boundaries instead of byte boundaries. This can be achieved by iterating over the string's runes and truncating after a complete rune, ensuring that the resulting string is always valid UTF-8.

    * Preconditions:
        The following preconditions are necessary to trigger this vulnerability:
        - The application must use the `bsoncore` library to handle BSON data.
        - The application must use the `StringN` function to truncate BSON string values.
        - The BSON string values being truncated must contain multi-byte UTF-8 characters.
        - The truncation length must be such that it cuts a multi-byte UTF-8 character in the middle.

    * Source code analysis:
        The vulnerability exists in the `StringN` function in `/code/x/bsonx/bsoncore/value.go`.
        ```go
        func (v Value) StringN(n int) string {
            if n <= 0 {
                return ""
            }

            switch v.Type {
            case TypeString:
                str, ok := v.StringValueOK()
                if !ok {
                    return ""
                }
                str = escapeString(str)
                if len(str) > n {
                    truncatedStr := bsoncoreutil.Truncate(str, n) // Vulnerability is here, byte-based truncation
                    return truncatedStr
                }
                return str
            ...
        }
        ```
        The `bsoncoreutil.Truncate(str, n)` function performs byte-based truncation, which is problematic for UTF-8 strings.
        ```go
        // Truncate truncates a given string for a certain width
        func Truncate(str string, width int) string {
            if width == 0 {
                return ""
            }

            if len(str) <= width {
                return str
            }

            // Truncate the byte slice of the string to the given width.
            newStr := str[:width] // Byte-based truncation

            ...
        }
        ```
        The file `/code/internal/integration/clam_prose_test.go` includes tests for command logging and monitoring, and it uses a similar truncation function `logger.Truncate` for logging messages. While this file contains tests to check for multi-byte character handling in logging, the underlying `logger.Truncate` function, like `bsoncoreutil.Truncate`, is also byte-based and could potentially lead to invalid UTF-8 sequences in logs if not carefully handled. Although the test `clamMultiByteTruncLogs` attempts to mitigate this by ensuring the last bytes are part of a multi-byte character, this is not a general solution and might not cover all cases where logging truncation could occur.

    * Security test case:
        1. Create a Go test file (e.g., `stringn_vulnerability_test.go`) in the same directory as `/code/x/bsonx/bsoncore/value.go`.
        2. Add a test function `TestStringNTruncationVulnerability` to this file.
        3. Inside the test function, construct a BSON Value of type string containing multi-byte UTF-8 characters, for example "你好世界".
        4. Call `StringN` with a truncation length that will split a multi-byte character, e.g., length 4.
        5. Assert that the resulting string is not a valid UTF-8 string, indicating the vulnerability. You can use `utf8.ValidString` to check for UTF-8 validity.

        ```go
        package bsoncore

        import (
            "testing"
            "unicode/utf8"
        )

        func TestStringNTruncationVulnerability(t *testing.T) {
            testString := "你好世界" // Multi-byte UTF-8 string
            val := Value{Type: TypeString, Data: AppendString(nil, testString)}
            truncatedString := val.StringN(4) // Truncate in the middle of multi-byte character

            if utf8.ValidString(truncatedString) {
                t.Errorf("Expected invalid UTF-8 string, but got valid UTF-8: %q", truncatedString)
            }
        }
        ```
        Run this test case to confirm the vulnerability.
