Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving k6, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Execution of Arbitrary JavaScript Code
    *   **Description:** The ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the k6 environment.
    *   **How k6 Contributes to the Attack Surface:** k6's core functionality involves running JavaScript test scripts. If the source of these scripts is untrusted or can be manipulated by an attacker, it allows for the execution of malicious code *by k6*.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a k6 script containing code that reads sensitive environment variables and sends them to an external server *when executed by k6*.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the k6 execution environment, potential access to sensitive data accessible by the k6 process, ability to interact with internal systems from the k6 context, denial of service initiated *by k6*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Script Sources:** Only allow k6 scripts from trusted and verified sources. Implement strict access controls for script repositories.
        *   **Code Review:** Implement mandatory code reviews for all k6 scripts before execution.
        *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Run k6 in a sandboxed or isolated environment with limited access to system resources and network.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Utilize static analysis tools to scan k6 scripts for potential security vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Internal Application Details through Test Scripts
    *   **Description:** Test scripts may contain sensitive information about the application's internal workings, such as API endpoints, authentication details, or data structures.
    *   **How k6 Contributes to the Attack Surface:** k6 scripts are written to interact with specific application endpoints and may include details necessary for these interactions. The *creation and execution of these scripts within k6* introduces this exposure risk.
    *   **Example:** A k6 script includes API keys or bearer tokens directly within the script for authentication purposes, and this script is stored in a location accessible to unauthorized individuals.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, enabling attackers to understand the application's architecture and potentially exploit vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store k6 scripts in secure repositories with appropriate access controls.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in scripts. Utilize secure secrets management solutions to inject credentials at runtime.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to individuals accessing and managing k6 scripts.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the content of k6 scripts for sensitive information.

*   **Attack Surface:** Resource Consumption and Denial of Service via k6
    *   **Description:** k6, designed for load testing, can be misused to generate excessive load, leading to denial of service.
    *   **How k6 Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If an attacker gains control over the k6 execution environment or can influence its configuration, they can *use k6 to launch* DoS attacks against the target application or its infrastructure.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the k6 configuration to drastically increase the number of virtual users and requests per second, overwhelming the target application *through k6's load generation capabilities*.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, infrastructure overload.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Access to k6 Configuration:** Implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized modification of k6 configurations.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, network) for the k6 execution environment.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the application side to mitigate excessive requests.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor k6 execution and application performance for unusual activity and set up alerts for potential DoS attacks.
