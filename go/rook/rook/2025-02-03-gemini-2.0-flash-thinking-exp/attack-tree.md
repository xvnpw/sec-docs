## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Rook Operator Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_rook_operator_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Known CVEs in Rook Operator (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the Rook Operator code. Attackers can find exploit code or develop their own to target unpatched Rook Operator instances.
    *   **Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability in the Operator's API handling could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Operator pod, gaining control over the Rook cluster.
*   **Insider Threat (Malicious Operator Admin) (Critical Node):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** A malicious or compromised administrator with legitimate access to the Rook Operator and Kubernetes cluster can intentionally misuse their privileges to compromise the system.
    *   **Example:** An admin could reconfigure Rook to expose storage services, modify access controls to grant unauthorized access, or directly exfiltrate data from the storage backend.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Operator Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_operator_misconfigurations.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Weak RBAC Permissions for Operator (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Overly permissive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles granted to the Rook Operator's service account. This allows the Operator to perform actions beyond its necessary scope, which can be abused if the Operator itself is compromised or if RBAC is further exploited.
    *   **Example:** If the Operator service account has cluster-admin privileges instead of narrowly scoped permissions, a vulnerability in the Operator could escalate to full cluster compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Rook Agent (Ceph OSD/Monitor/MDS etc.) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_rook_agent__ceph_osdmonitormds_etc___vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Known CVEs in Ceph/EdgeFS components used by Rook (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in the Ceph or EdgeFS components that Rook deploys and manages. Rook relies on these complex storage systems, and vulnerabilities in them directly impact Rook's security.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow in a Ceph OSD daemon could be exploited to gain code execution on the OSD node, potentially leading to data access or denial of service.
*   **Weakened Security Settings in Ceph/EdgeFS configuration via Rook (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Rook configurations that inadvertently weaken the security settings of the underlying Ceph or EdgeFS cluster. This could be due to misconfigurations in Rook's manifests, Helm charts, or custom resource definitions.
    *   **Example:** Disabling authentication between Ceph components, using weak encryption settings, or failing to properly configure access controls in Ceph through Rook's configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Kubernetes Integration Weaknesses related to Rook](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_kubernetes_integration_weaknesses_related_to_rook.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **RBAC Misconfigurations allowing unauthorized Rook access (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Incorrectly configured Kubernetes RBAC roles that grant users or applications excessive permissions to interact with Rook resources (Custom Resource Definitions, services, secrets, etc.).
    *   **Example:** Granting `get`, `list`, `watch`, `create`, `update`, `delete` permissions on all resources in the `rook-ceph-system` namespace to a user or service account that should only have read-only access to specific resources.
    *   **Overly permissive RBAC roles granted to users/applications (High-Risk Path):**  A specific instance of the above, highlighting the risk of overly broad roles.
*   **Kubernetes Secrets Management Issues for Rook Credentials (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Insecure handling of Kubernetes Secrets that store sensitive Rook credentials (e.g., Ceph admin keys, connection details).
    *   **Unencrypted Secrets storing Rook credentials (High-Risk Path):**  Storing Secrets unencrypted in etcd makes them easily accessible if etcd is compromised or if unauthorized access to the Kubernetes API is gained.
    *   **Overly permissive access to Secrets containing Rook credentials (High-Risk Path):**  Granting excessive RBAC permissions to access Secrets in Rook namespaces allows unauthorized users or applications to retrieve Rook credentials.
*   **Kubernetes Network Policies Misconfigurations related to Rook (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Insufficient or misconfigured Kubernetes Network Policies that fail to properly isolate Rook components and restrict network access.
    *   **Insufficient Network Policies allowing unauthorized access to Rook components (High-Risk Path):** Lack of Network Policies or overly permissive policies allow lateral movement and unauthorized access to Rook services from other namespaces or external networks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Underlying Storage Provider (Ceph/EdgeFS) weaknesses exposed by Rook](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_underlying_storage_provider__cephedgefs__weaknesses_exposed_by_rook.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Known CVEs in Ceph/EdgeFS that Rook deployment is vulnerable to (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Using outdated versions of Ceph or EdgeFS components within Rook deployments that are vulnerable to known CVEs. Rook's version compatibility with underlying storage providers is critical.
    *   **Example:** Running a Rook version that deploys an older Ceph version with a known remote code execution vulnerability.
*   **Weak encryption or lack of encryption for data at rest/in transit (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Failure to enable or properly configure encryption for data at rest (stored on disks) or in transit (network communication) within the Rook-managed Ceph or EdgeFS cluster.
    *   **Example:** Disabling Ceph's encryption features or using weak encryption algorithms, leaving data vulnerable to exposure if storage media is physically compromised or network traffic is intercepted.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Storage Class Misconfigurations leading to insecure access](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_storage_class_misconfigurations_leading_to_insecure_access.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Overly permissive Storage Classes granting excessive access rights (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Defining Storage Classes that grant overly broad access rights or features to applications requesting persistent volumes.
    *   **Example:** Creating a Storage Class that allows any application to request volumes with `ReadWriteMany` access mode when `ReadWriteOnce` would be sufficient, potentially allowing unauthorized access from multiple pods.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Volume Permission Issues](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_volume_permission_issues.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Incorrectly configured Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Misconfigurations in Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) that lead to incorrect volume permissions or access control settings.
    *   **Example:**  Creating a PVC that unintentionally grants world-readable permissions on the mounted volume, allowing any process within the container to access the data.
*   **Weak default permissions on provisioned volumes (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Rook or the underlying storage provider provisioning volumes with weak default permissions, making them accessible to unauthorized processes or users within the Kubernetes node or container.
    *   **Example:**  Volumes being provisioned with default permissions of `777` (read, write, execute for all users), allowing any pod on the same node to potentially access the data.
