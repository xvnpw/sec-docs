# Attack Surface Analysis for rook/rook

## Attack Surface: [1. Rook Operator Component Vulnerabilities (Critical)](./attack_surfaces/1__rook_operator_component_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities within the Rook Operator's code (e.g., remote code execution, privilege escalation bugs) can be exploited to completely compromise the storage cluster and potentially the Kubernetes cluster itself.
*   **Rook Contribution:** Rook introduces the Operator as the central control plane.  The Operator's code and dependencies are a direct attack surface introduced by deploying Rook.  A compromised Operator can lead to widespread damage within the Rook-managed storage and beyond.
*   **Example:** A zero-day vulnerability in the Rook Operator's reconciliation logic allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the Operator container, granting them control over the storage cluster and Kubernetes API access via the Operator's service account.
*   **Impact:** Full storage cluster compromise, complete data exfiltration or destruction, denial of service to all Rook-managed storage, privilege escalation to Kubernetes cluster administrator level via Operator's service account.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Rook Operator Updates:** Apply security patches and update Rook Operator to the latest version as soon as vulnerabilities are disclosed and fixes are available.
    *   **Proactive Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning of the Rook Operator container image in CI/CD pipelines and during runtime to detect and remediate vulnerabilities before exploitation.
    *   **Rigorous Code Reviews and Security Audits:** Rook development team should prioritize rigorous code reviews and independent security audits of the Operator codebase to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities proactively.
    *   **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain a robust incident response plan specifically for Rook Operator compromise scenarios, including steps for isolation, containment, and remediation.

## Attack Surface: [2. Rook Operator API Exposure Exploitation (High)](./attack_surfaces/2__rook_operator_api_exposure_exploitation__high_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in how the Rook Operator interacts with the Kubernetes API server, leveraging the Operator's necessary elevated privileges.
*   **Rook Contribution:** Rook's architecture mandates the Operator to interact extensively with the Kubernetes API with significant permissions to manage storage resources. This interaction path becomes a high-value target if not secured properly.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits an overly permissive RBAC role assigned to the Rook Operator, allowing them to use the Operator's credentials to access and manipulate Kubernetes Secrets outside of Rook's intended scope, potentially gaining access to other application credentials.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation within Kubernetes, unauthorized access to sensitive Kubernetes resources (Secrets, ConfigMaps, etc.), manipulation of Rook and potentially other application configurations, leading to data breaches or service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Least Privilege RBAC for Operator:**  Meticulously define and enforce the principle of least privilege for RBAC roles assigned to the Rook Operator. Grant only the absolute minimum permissions required for its intended storage management functions.
    *   **Kubernetes API Audit Logging and Monitoring:** Enable comprehensive Kubernetes API audit logging and implement real-time monitoring of Operator API interactions for any anomalous or suspicious activity.
    *   **Network Segmentation and Policies:** Implement strict network policies to isolate the Rook Operator pod and limit its network access to only essential Kubernetes API server endpoints, preventing lateral movement if compromised.
    *   **Regular RBAC Audits and Reviews:** Conduct frequent and thorough audits of RBAC configurations related to the Rook Operator and all Rook components to identify and rectify any over-permissive or misconfigured roles.

## Attack Surface: [3. Rook Managed Storage Data Access Control Bypass (High)](./attack_surfaces/3__rook_managed_storage_data_access_control_bypass__high_.md)

*   **Description:** Bypassing or exploiting weaknesses in Rook's access control mechanisms for managed storage (like Ceph RBD or CephFS), leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within Rook.
*   **Rook Contribution:** Rook is responsible for configuring and enforcing access control policies for the storage it provisions. Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Rook's access control implementation directly expose the managed data.
*   **Example:** A flaw in Rook's Ceph RBD pool creation logic results in pools being created without proper authentication enabled, allowing any pod within the Kubernetes cluster (or even potentially external entities if network policies are weak) to directly access RBD volumes without authorization.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to highly sensitive data stored in Rook, data exfiltration, unauthorized data modification or deletion, compliance violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Strong Authentication and Authorization:**  Thoroughly configure and enforce strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all Rook-managed storage access. Utilize Rook's security features and the underlying storage provider's security capabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Storage Access:** Implement the principle of least privilege rigorously when granting storage access. Grant access only to specific applications and users that have a legitimate and validated need to access the data.
    *   **Regular Security Testing of Access Controls:** Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits specifically focused on validating the effectiveness of Rook's storage access control mechanisms and identifying potential bypasses.
    *   **Data Encryption at Rest and in Transit:** Implement data encryption at rest for Rook-managed storage and enforce encryption in transit for all storage access communication to protect data confidentiality even if access controls are partially compromised.

## Attack Surface: [4. Rook Secret Exposure via Mismanagement (High)](./attack_surfaces/4__rook_secret_exposure_via_mismanagement__high_.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of sensitive secrets (storage credentials, encryption keys, authentication tokens) managed by Rook due to insecure handling, storage, or access control of Kubernetes Secrets.
*   **Rook Contribution:** Rook's operation relies on managing sensitive secrets within Kubernetes Secrets.  Vulnerabilities in Rook's secret management practices directly increase the risk of these secrets being exposed.
*   **Example:** Rook inadvertently logs Ceph administrator credentials in plain text during error conditions, or a vulnerability in Rook allows unauthorized access to Kubernetes Secrets containing storage encryption keys, enabling decryption of stored data.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of critical storage credentials granting administrative access, compromise of encryption keys leading to widespread data breaches, unauthorized access to all Rook-managed storage, potential for complete data compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Kubernetes Secrets Encryption at Rest (Mandatory):**  Ensure Kubernetes Secrets encryption at rest is enabled at the Kubernetes cluster level to protect secrets stored in etcd from unauthorized access.
    *   **Secure Secret Handling in Rook Code:** Rook development team must adhere to secure coding practices for secret handling, ensuring secrets are never logged in plain text, are accessed only when necessary, and are protected in memory.
    *   **Strict RBAC for Secret Access:** Implement very restrictive RBAC policies to control access to Kubernetes Secrets containing Rook credentials, limiting access to only essential Rook components and authorized personnel.
    *   **Secret Rotation and Auditing:** Implement automated secret rotation for storage credentials managed by Rook and enable comprehensive auditing of secret access and modifications to detect and respond to potential breaches.

## Attack Surface: [5. Rook Agent Component Exploitation (High)](./attack_surfaces/5__rook_agent_component_exploitation__high_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within Rook Agents running on each Kubernetes node, potentially leading to node compromise, data corruption, or denial of service.
*   **Rook Contribution:** Rook deploys Agents to each node to interact with the underlying storage. These Agents become a distributed attack surface across the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Rook Agent's data processing logic is exploited by sending specially crafted storage requests, allowing an attacker to gain remote code execution on the Kubernetes node where the Agent is running.
*   **Impact:** Kubernetes node compromise, potential for lateral movement within the cluster from compromised nodes, data corruption on individual storage nodes, denial of service to storage services running on compromised nodes, potential for cluster-wide instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proactive Rook Agent Updates and Patching:**  Maintain a rigorous process for promptly updating Rook Agents to the latest versions and applying security patches as soon as they are released.
    *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning of Agent Images:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning of Rook Agent container images in CI/CD pipelines and during runtime to identify and remediate vulnerabilities before deployment.
    *   **Host-Level Security Hardening:**  Implement robust host-level security hardening measures on all Kubernetes nodes where Rook Agents are deployed, including OS patching, intrusion detection systems, and security monitoring.
    *   **Network Segmentation and Policies for Agents:** Implement network policies to segment Rook Agent pods and restrict their network access to only essential storage backend components and necessary Kubernetes services, limiting the impact of a potential Agent compromise.

## Attack Surface: [6. Insecure Rook Default Configurations Leading to Exposure (High)](./attack_surfaces/6__insecure_rook_default_configurations_leading_to_exposure__high_.md)

*   **Description:** Rook's default configurations, if not carefully reviewed and hardened, can introduce significant security vulnerabilities that are easily overlooked by administrators, leading to exploitable weaknesses.
*   **Rook Contribution:** Rook's out-of-the-box defaults directly influence the initial security posture of the deployed storage cluster. Insecure defaults create immediate and readily exploitable attack vectors.
*   **Example:** Rook defaults to deploying Ceph monitors with weak or default authentication settings, or enables insecure protocols like unencrypted Ceph Messenger v1 by default, allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized access to Ceph management interfaces.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of high-impact vulnerabilities depending on the specific insecure default, including unauthorized administrative access to storage, data breaches due to unencrypted communication, denial of service through exploitation of insecure protocols, and potential for complete storage cluster compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Security Hardening Configuration Review:**  Treat Rook's default configurations as inherently insecure and mandate a thorough security hardening configuration review before deploying Rook in any production environment.
    *   **Follow Official Rook Security Hardening Guides:**  Strictly adhere to official Rook security hardening guides and best practices documentation to identify and remediate insecure default settings.
    *   **Configuration as Code and Security Templates:** Manage Rook configurations as code using Infrastructure-as-Code tools and develop secure configuration templates that enforce security best practices and eliminate insecure defaults.
    *   **Automated Configuration Validation and Auditing:** Implement automated configuration validation and auditing tools to continuously monitor Rook deployments for deviations from secure configuration baselines and detect any instances of insecure default settings being used.
