# Threat Model Analysis for rook/rook

## Threat: [Operator Container Compromise](./threats/operator_container_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Rook Operator container, potentially by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Rook Operator image or Kubernetes misconfigurations specific to Rook deployment. Once inside, they can manipulate the Rook cluster through the Operator's API and Kubernetes custom resources, which are Rook-specific.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the Rook cluster, leading to data deletion, modification, exfiltration, denial of service, and cluster disruption.
*   **Affected Rook Component:** Rook Operator (Container, Deployment, Service Account, API)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Rook Operator image to the latest version with security patches provided by the Rook project.
    *   Implement strong Kubernetes RBAC specifically for the Rook Operator service account, following Rook's recommended practices.
    *   Harden Kubernetes nodes and infrastructure to prevent container escapes, focusing on configurations relevant to Rook's deployment requirements.
    *   Use image scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities in the Rook Operator image *before* deployment, specifically checking for Rook-related vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement network policies to restrict network access to and from the Operator container, tailored to Rook's network communication needs.

## Threat: [Agent Container Compromise (Monitor)](./threats/agent_container_compromise__monitor_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a Rook Agent container, specifically a Monitor. This could be through container vulnerabilities in the Rook Monitor image or Kubernetes node compromise affecting Rook's Monitor pods. Compromised Monitors, being core to Rook/Ceph cluster management, allow deep access and control.
*   **Impact:** Access to sensitive cluster metadata and configuration managed by Rook/Ceph, potential manipulation of cluster state orchestrated by Rook, disruption of cluster quorum critical for Rook's operation, and denial of service by disrupting the Monitor function within Rook.
*   **Affected Rook Component:** Ceph Monitor (Container, Pod, DaemonSet as deployed by Rook), Rook orchestration of Monitor deployment.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Rook Agent images (including Ceph components within) to the latest versions with security patches provided by Rook and Ceph projects.
    *   Harden Kubernetes nodes and infrastructure where Rook Agents (Monitors) are running, focusing on security best practices for Rook deployments.
    *   Implement strong network policies to isolate Monitor containers and restrict access, based on Rook's recommended network configurations.
    *   Use security contexts to limit the capabilities of Monitor containers, aligning with Rook's security recommendations.
    *   Monitor Monitor container activity and cluster health for anomalies, using Rook's monitoring integrations if available.
    *   Ensure sufficient number of Monitors for quorum and fault tolerance as recommended by Rook documentation.

## Threat: [Insecure Inter-Agent Communication](./threats/insecure_inter-agent_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between Rook Agents (OSDs, Monitors, etc.) within the Rook cluster is not properly secured, specifically lacking encryption or strong authentication *as configured by Rook*. An attacker positioned on the network or within the Kubernetes cluster, targeting Rook's internal network, could eavesdrop or manipulate this communication.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks targeting Rook's internal communication, data interception within the Rook cluster, data modification in transit affecting Rook's storage operations, spoofing of agents within the Rook cluster, and potential cluster instability due to compromised Rook communication.
*   **Affected Rook Component:** Ceph Communication Protocols (Messenger v2, etc.) *as configured and managed by Rook*, Rook network configuration management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and enforce encryption for inter-agent communication (e.g., Ceph Messenger v2 with encryption) *through Rook's configuration options*.
    *   Ensure strong authentication mechanisms are in place for inter-agent communication, as configured and enforced by Rook.
    *   Use network segmentation and policies to isolate Rook cluster network traffic, following Rook's network recommendations.
    *   Regularly review and audit network configurations *managed by Rook*.

## Threat: [Data at Rest Encryption Weakness or Absence](./threats/data_at_rest_encryption_weakness_or_absence.md)

*   **Description:** Data stored by Rook (in Ceph) is not encrypted at rest, or encryption is implemented using weak algorithms or insecure key management practices *within Rook's encryption configuration*. An attacker gaining physical access to storage media or unauthorized access to the underlying storage infrastructure managed by Rook could access unencrypted data.
*   **Impact:** Data exposure and confidentiality breach if storage media managed by Rook is compromised or accessed without authorization. Compliance violations if data at rest encryption is required for data stored by Rook.
*   **Affected Rook Component:** Ceph OSD Encryption *as configured by Rook*, Rook Configuration (Encryption Settings, Secret management for encryption keys).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable data at rest encryption for Rook-managed storage (e.g., Ceph OSD encryption) *using Rook's configuration mechanisms*.
    *   Use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) *as supported and configured by Rook*.
    *   Implement secure key management practices, using Kubernetes Secrets *as integrated with Rook* or dedicated secrets management solutions compatible with Rook.
    *   Regularly audit encryption configuration and key management practices *within the context of Rook's management*.

## Threat: [Insecure Access Control to Storage Resources](./threats/insecure_access_control_to_storage_resources.md)

*   **Description:** Access control mechanisms for storage resources provisioned by Rook (S3 buckets, NFS shares, block volumes) are not properly configured or are inherently weak *within Rook's provisioning and management framework*. Unauthorized users or applications can gain access to sensitive data stored via Rook.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Rook, data breaches originating from access control weaknesses in Rook-provisioned storage, data modification or deletion by unauthorized users accessing Rook storage, and potential compliance violations related to data access control for Rook-managed data.
*   **Affected Rook Component:** Rook Object Store (S3 - RGW configuration by Rook), Rook File System (NFS - CephFS and NFS-Ganesha configuration by Rook), Rook Block Storage (RBD - volume access control as managed by Rook), Ceph RADOS Gateway (RGW), CephFS, RBD *as provisioned and managed by Rook*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access control policies for Rook-provisioned storage resources (e.g., S3 bucket policies managed through Rook, NFS export options configured via Rook, block volume permissions managed by Rook).
    *   Use authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by Rook and Ceph (e.g., Ceph RADOS Gateway user management through Rook, CephFS ACLs managed in Rook context).
    *   Regularly review and audit access control configurations for storage resources provisioned by Rook.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when granting access to storage resources managed by Rook.

## Threat: [Secrets Management Issues](./threats/secrets_management_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information like storage backend credentials, encryption keys, and access tokens *required by Rook for managing Ceph* are not securely managed within Rook and Kubernetes. Secrets might be stored insecurely within Rook's configuration or Kubernetes Secrets might be mismanaged in the context of Rook.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials used by Rook, leading to unauthorized access to storage backends or Rook components, compromise of encryption keys used by Rook leading to data decryption, and accidental disclosure of secrets managed by Rook.
*   **Affected Rook Component:** Kubernetes Secrets *used by Rook*, Rook Configuration (Secret Handling), Ceph Configuration (Key Management) *as managed by Rook*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Kubernetes Secrets to store sensitive information *required by Rook* and configure Rook to correctly utilize them.
    *   Avoid storing secrets in plain text in configuration files or code *related to Rook deployment and configuration*.
    *   Implement RBAC to restrict access to Kubernetes Secrets *used by Rook*.
    *   Consider using dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for more robust secret management *integrated with Rook if possible*.
    *   Regularly rotate secrets and encryption keys *managed by or for Rook*.

## Threat: [Compromised Rook Container Images](./threats/compromised_rook_container_images.md)

*   **Description:** Rook container images used for Operator and Agents are compromised at the source (official registry or build pipeline). These images, specifically Rook's components, might contain malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities injected during the build or distribution process of Rook images.
*   **Impact:** Deployment of malicious code *within Rook components*, backdoors and remote access capabilities *affecting Rook infrastructure*, data exfiltration *via compromised Rook processes*, and system compromise originating from compromised Rook images.
*   **Affected Rook Component:** Rook Container Images (Operator, OSD, Monitor, etc.), Image Registry *used for Rook images*, Build Pipeline *for Rook images*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Verify the integrity and authenticity of Rook container images using image signatures and checksums provided by the Rook project.
    *   Use trusted and reputable image registries *specifically for Rook images*.
    *   Scan Rook container images for vulnerabilities *before deployment*, focusing on vulnerabilities within Rook components.
    *   Implement supply chain security practices for building and distributing Rook images if building custom images or extending Rook, ensuring secure Rook image pipelines.
