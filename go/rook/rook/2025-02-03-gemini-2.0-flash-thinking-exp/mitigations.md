# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rook/rook

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Rook Operators and Ceph Daemons.](./mitigation_strategies/implement_kubernetes_role-based_access_control__rbac__for_rook_operators_and_ceph_daemons.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Rook-Specific Roles:** Create Kubernetes RBAC `Roles` and `ClusterRoles` tailored to Rook components. Focus on permissions needed by the Rook Operator to manage Ceph, and by Ceph daemons (like `ceph-mon`, `ceph-osd`, `ceph-mgr`) to operate.  Avoid granting excessive Kubernetes permissions.
    2.  **Bind Roles to Rook Service Accounts:** Ensure Rook Operator and Ceph daemons are deployed using dedicated Kubernetes `ServiceAccounts`. Bind the Rook-specific RBAC `Roles` to these `ServiceAccounts` using `RoleBindings` and `ClusterRoleBindings`.
    3.  **Namespace Scope:** Apply `Roles` within the Rook deployment namespace for namespace-scoped components. Use `ClusterRoles` for cluster-wide Rook operations, but minimize cluster-wide permissions.
    4.  **Regularly Audit Rook RBAC:** Periodically review and audit the RBAC configurations specifically for Rook components to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege and are up-to-date with Rook's operational needs.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access to Rook Components: Attackers gaining unauthorized access to Rook Operator or Ceph daemons could compromise the storage infrastructure. - Severity: High
        *   Privilege Escalation via Rook: Compromised Rook components with overly broad permissions could be used to escalate privileges within the Kubernetes cluster. - Severity: High
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access to Rook Components: High risk reduction by limiting access to authorized Rook components only.
        *   Privilege Escalation via Rook: Medium to High risk reduction by restricting the permissions of Rook components.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - General Kubernetes RBAC might be enabled, but Rook-specific roles and bindings might require refinement.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Detailed definition and implementation of least-privilege RBAC roles specifically for Rook Operator and Ceph daemons. Regular audits of Rook RBAC configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Access to Rook Toolbox and Ceph CLI.](./mitigation_strategies/secure_access_to_rook_toolbox_and_ceph_cli.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **RBAC for Rook Toolbox Access:** Control access to the Rook toolbox pod using Kubernetes RBAC. Create `Roles` granting permissions to access the toolbox pod (e.g., `pods/exec`) and bind them only to authorized users or service accounts needing `ceph` CLI access for Rook administration.
    2.  **Network Policies for Toolbox Isolation (Rook Namespace):** Implement Kubernetes Network Policies within the Rook deployment namespace to restrict network access to and from the toolbox pod. Limit access to authorized networks or namespaces.
    3.  **Just-in-Time Toolbox Access (Rook Focused):** Implement a Just-in-Time (JIT) access mechanism specifically for the Rook toolbox. Grant temporary RBAC permissions only when `ceph` CLI access is required, automating role binding and revocation.
    4.  **Audit Rook Toolbox Usage (Ceph CLI Commands):** Log and audit all commands executed within the Rook toolbox, specifically focusing on `ceph` CLI commands. This provides an audit trail of administrative actions performed on the Ceph cluster via Rook.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Ceph CLI Access via Rook Toolbox: Unrestricted toolbox access allows unauthorized users to manage the Ceph cluster through the `ceph` CLI. - Severity: High
        *   Abuse of Rook Administrative Privileges: Authorized users with toolbox access could misuse their `ceph` CLI privileges if not controlled and audited. - Severity: Medium
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Ceph CLI Access via Rook Toolbox: High risk reduction by controlling access to the Rook toolbox.
        *   Abuse of Rook Administrative Privileges: Medium risk reduction through auditing and JIT access for the Rook toolbox.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Basic RBAC for pods might exist, but specific Rook toolbox roles and network policies might be missing. Toolbox command auditing might not be in place.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Specific RBAC roles and network policies for the Rook toolbox. Implementation of auditing for `ceph` CLI commands executed in the toolbox. Consideration of JIT access for the Rook toolbox.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Encryption at Rest for Ceph Pools via Rook Configuration.](./mitigation_strategies/enable_encryption_at_rest_for_ceph_pools_via_rook_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Rook CRD for Encryption:** When creating Ceph pools using Rook's `CephBlockPool` or `CephObjectStore` CRDs, explicitly set `encrypted: true` in the specification. This instructs Rook to enable encryption at rest for the pool.
    2.  **Kubernetes Secrets for Rook Encryption Keys:** Rook utilizes Kubernetes Secrets for managing Ceph encryption keys. Ensure the Kubernetes Secrets backend is itself configured for encryption at rest (e.g., using KMS). Rook handles the creation and management of these secrets when `encrypted: true` is set.
    3.  **Rook Key Rotation (If Supported):** If Rook provides mechanisms for key rotation, implement a regular key rotation policy for Ceph encryption keys managed by Rook. Follow Rook documentation for key rotation procedures.
    4.  **Verify Rook-Managed Encryption:** After pool creation, verify through Rook and Ceph tools that encryption at rest is indeed enabled for the Ceph pool. Use `ceph status` or `ceph osd pool get <pool_name> encrypted` within the Rook toolbox to confirm.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Data Breach from Physical Ceph Storage Compromise: If physical disks hosting Ceph OSDs are compromised, encryption at rest prevents unauthorized data access. - Severity: High
        *   Insider Threats with Physical Access to Ceph Storage: Encryption at rest adds a layer of protection against malicious insiders with physical access to storage hardware. - Severity: Medium
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data Breach from Physical Ceph Storage Compromise: High risk reduction by rendering data unreadable without Rook-managed keys.
        *   Insider Threats with Physical Access to Ceph Storage: Medium risk reduction, adding a significant barrier to data access.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially Implemented - Encryption at rest might be enabled for some Ceph pools via Rook configuration, but verification and key management policies might be lacking.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Verification of encryption at rest for all relevant Ceph pools using Rook configuration. Documentation and implementation of a key management and rotation policy for Rook-managed Ceph encryption keys.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Encryption in Transit for Ceph Communication Managed by Rook.](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_encryption_in_transit_for_ceph_communication_managed_by_rook.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify Rook TLS Configuration for Ceph:** Rook typically configures TLS for internal Ceph communication. Verify the Rook Operator configuration and Ceph Monitor settings to ensure TLS is enabled for all relevant Ceph services managed by Rook. Check Rook Operator logs for TLS setup confirmations.
    2.  **Rook TLS Certificate Management:** Rook handles TLS certificate generation and management for Ceph. Verify the certificate lifecycle management process within Rook and ensure certificates are valid and rotated as needed by Rook's mechanisms.
    3.  **HTTPS for Rook-Managed Ceph Object Gateway (RGW):** If using Rook to deploy Ceph Object Gateway (RGW), ensure Rook configuration enforces HTTPS for external RGW access. Verify that Rook-deployed RGW ingress or load balancer is configured for TLS termination and uses valid certificates.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Ceph Communication: Without encryption, attackers could intercept communication between Rook-managed Ceph components or clients. - Severity: High
        *   Data Eavesdropping on Ceph Network Traffic: Unencrypted communication allows eavesdropping on data transferred within the Rook-managed Ceph cluster. - Severity: Medium
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Ceph Communication: High risk reduction by making communication interception and decryption extremely difficult.
        *   Data Eavesdropping on Ceph Network Traffic: Medium risk reduction by preventing network traffic eavesdropping.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Likely Partially Implemented - Rook generally configures TLS for internal Ceph communication. However, verification of Rook's TLS configuration, certificate management, and HTTPS for RGW might be needed.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Verification of Rook's TLS configuration for all Ceph services. Review and potentially improve Rook's TLS certificate management. Strict HTTPS enforcement for Rook-deployed Ceph RGW.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Rook Operator and Ceph Health using Rook Integrations.](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_rook_operator_and_ceph_health_using_rook_integrations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Deploy Rook Monitoring Stack (Prometheus/Grafana):** Leverage Rook's integration with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring. Deploy these tools as recommended by Rook documentation to collect metrics from Rook Operator and Ceph daemons.
    2.  **Monitor Rook-Specific Ceph Metrics:** Focus on monitoring key metrics exposed by Rook and Ceph exporters. Monitor Ceph cluster health, OSD status, monitor quorum, storage capacity reported by Rook, and Rook Operator health.
    3.  **Set Up Rook-Aware Alerts:** Configure alerts in Prometheus Alertmanager based on Rook-specific metrics. Alert on Ceph cluster health changes reported by Rook, OSD failures detected by Rook, capacity thresholds managed by Rook, and Rook Operator errors.
    4.  **Rook Dashboard in Grafana:** Utilize or create Grafana dashboards specifically designed for Rook and Ceph monitoring. Visualize Rook-reported Ceph health, performance, and capacity metrics in a centralized dashboard.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service due to Rook/Ceph Failures: Proactive monitoring of Rook and Ceph health helps detect and address storage issues managed by Rook before service disruptions. - Severity: High
        *   Data Loss due to Unnoticed Rook/Ceph Failures: Monitoring helps identify failures within the Rook-managed storage infrastructure that could lead to data loss if ignored. - Severity: High
        *   Performance Degradation of Rook Storage: Monitoring performance metrics reported by Rook helps detect and diagnose performance issues in the Rook-managed storage. - Severity: Medium
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service due to Rook/Ceph Failures: High risk reduction by enabling early detection and mitigation of Rook-managed storage failures.
        *   Data Loss due to Unnoticed Rook/Ceph Failures: High risk reduction by facilitating timely responses to failures within Rook storage.
        *   Performance Degradation of Rook Storage: Medium risk reduction by enabling performance monitoring and issue diagnosis.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Basic Kubernetes monitoring might exist, but specific Rook and Ceph monitoring integrations and dashboards might be missing. Rook-aware alerting might not be configured.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Deployment and configuration of a Rook-integrated monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana). Configuration of alerts based on Rook-specific Ceph metrics. Creation of Rook-specific Grafana dashboards.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Rook Operator and Ceph Versions Up-to-Date (Rook Focused).](./mitigation_strategies/keep_rook_operator_and_ceph_versions_up-to-date__rook_focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Track Rook Releases and Security Advisories:** Actively monitor Rook release notes, security advisories, and the Rook community for updates and security patches specific to Rook and the embedded Ceph version.
    2.  **Rook-Specific Update Process:** Define and follow Rook's recommended upgrade procedures when updating Rook Operator and Ceph versions. Test updates in a non-production Rook environment first.
    3.  **Automated Rook Updates (If Supported and Tested):** Explore and cautiously implement automated Rook Operator and Ceph updates if supported by your Rook deployment method (e.g., Helm, Operator Lifecycle Manager). Prioritize testing and controlled rollouts.
    4.  **Prioritize Rook Security Updates:**  Prioritize applying security updates released by the Rook project to patch known vulnerabilities in Rook Operator and the managed Ceph version.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Exploitation of Rook/Ceph Vulnerabilities: Outdated Rook and Ceph versions may contain known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise the Rook storage infrastructure. - Severity: High
        *   Data Breach via Rook Vulnerabilities: Exploited vulnerabilities in Rook or Ceph could lead to data breaches, data corruption, or denial of service within the Rook-managed storage. - Severity: High
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exploitation of Rook/Ceph Vulnerabilities: High risk reduction by patching known vulnerabilities in Rook and Ceph.
        *   Data Breach via Rook Vulnerabilities: High risk reduction by minimizing the attack surface related to Rook and Ceph software flaws.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - General update processes might exist, but a specific, proactive process for tracking and updating Rook versions might be missing. Automated Rook updates are likely not implemented.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Establishment of a proactive process for tracking Rook releases and security advisories. Definition of a Rook-specific update procedure including testing and rollback. Exploration of automated Rook updates with careful testing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Scan Container Images Used by Rook for Vulnerabilities.](./mitigation_strategies/scan_container_images_used_by_rook_for_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Scan Rook and Ceph Container Images:** Specifically scan the container images used by Rook Operator and Ceph daemons. These are the images deployed by the Rook Operator. Use a container image scanning tool to identify vulnerabilities in these images.
    2.  **Rook Image Vulnerability Remediation:** Establish a process for addressing vulnerabilities found in Rook and Ceph container images. This includes prioritizing based on severity, patching by updating base images or dependencies (if possible and controlled), and redeploying updated Rook components.
    3.  **Trusted Rook Image Sources:**  Use trusted and verified container image registries for obtaining Rook and Ceph images. Stick to official Rook project recommendations for image sources to minimize supply chain risks.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Vulnerabilities in Rook/Ceph Container Images: Container images used by Rook and Ceph might contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise Rook components. - Severity: High
        *   Supply Chain Attacks via Rook Images: Using compromised or malicious Rook container images from untrusted sources could introduce vulnerabilities or malware. - Severity: High
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Vulnerabilities in Rook/Ceph Container Images: High risk reduction by identifying and remediating vulnerabilities in Rook container images.
        *   Supply Chain Attacks via Rook Images: Medium to High risk reduction by using trusted image sources and scanning images.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Container image scanning might be in place for application images, but specific scanning of Rook and Ceph images might be missing. Remediation processes for Rook image vulnerabilities might not be defined.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Integration of container image scanning specifically for Rook and Ceph container images. Definition of a vulnerability remediation process for Rook image vulnerabilities. Verification of using trusted image registries for Rook components.
