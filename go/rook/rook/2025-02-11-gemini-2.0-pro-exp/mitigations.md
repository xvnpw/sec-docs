# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rook/rook

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Rook Operators](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_rook_operators.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Required Permissions:** Analyze the specific Kubernetes API interactions each Rook operator (Ceph, Cassandra, etc.) needs. This involves understanding which CRDs, deployments, services, secrets, etc., the operator needs to create, modify, delete, and watch.
2.  **Create Custom Roles:** Create custom Kubernetes Roles (or ClusterRoles, but *minimize* their use) defining *only* the necessary `apiGroups`, `resources`, and `verbs` for each operator.  Do *not* use overly permissive roles like `cluster-admin`.
3.  **Create RoleBindings:** Bind these custom Roles to the ServiceAccount used by the Rook operator pod using RoleBindings (or ClusterRoleBindings if absolutely necessary).
4.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically review and audit the RBAC permissions granted to Rook operators. Remove any unnecessary permissions. Use tools like `kubectl auth can-i` to verify permissions.
5.  **Documentation:** Document the rationale for each granted permission.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Operator Compromise (High Severity):** A compromised Rook operator with excessive privileges could manipulate storage across the cluster, leading to data breaches, data loss, or service disruption.  Restricting privileges limits the blast radius.
*   **Insider Threat (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential damage a malicious or negligent administrator with access to the Rook operator can cause.
*   **Configuration Errors (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of accidental misconfigurations that grant excessive privileges.

**Impact:**
*   **Operator Compromise:** Risk significantly reduced. The attacker's capabilities are limited to the specific resources and actions allowed by the restricted RBAC.
*   **Insider Threat:** Risk reduced. Limits the potential damage.
*   **Configuration Errors:** Risk reduced. Forces careful consideration of permissions.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic RBAC roles are defined in Rook Helm charts, but they are often overly permissive. Custom roles exist for the Ceph operator in the `rook-ceph` namespace.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Custom roles are missing for other operators (NFS, Cassandra, etc.).
*   Regular RBAC audits are not yet a standard procedure.
*   Documentation of permission rationale is incomplete.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Policies for Rook Components](./mitigation_strategies/network_policies_for_rook_components.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Communication Flows:** Map the necessary communication paths *between* Rook operator pods, and *between* Rook operator pods and the storage provider pods they manage (e.g., Ceph MONs, OSDs).  Also, consider any external clients that need to access Rook-managed storage.
2.  **Create Network Policies:** Create Kubernetes Network Policies that *explicitly allow* only the required communication. Start with a "deny-all" default policy and add specific allow rules.
3.  **Namespace Isolation:** Use separate namespaces for different Rook operators to simplify network policy management and enhance isolation.
4.  **Label Selectors:** Use label selectors in the network policies to target specific pods (e.g., `app=rook-ceph-operator`, `app=rook-ceph-mon`).
5.  **Ingress and Egress Rules:** Define both ingress (incoming) and egress (outgoing) rules to control traffic flow comprehensively.
6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the network policies to ensure they don't block legitimate traffic while effectively blocking unauthorized access.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Lateral Movement (High Severity):** If an attacker compromises a pod, network policies prevent them from accessing Rook operator pods or storage provider pods managed by Rook.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Storage (Medium Severity):** Prevents direct access to storage provider pods from outside the cluster or from unauthorized namespaces, even if those pods are managed by Rook.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Can help contain the impact of a DoS attack by restricting network traffic.

**Impact:**
*   **Lateral Movement:** Risk significantly reduced. Limits the attacker's ability to move laterally.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Storage:** Risk significantly reduced. Blocks direct access unless explicitly allowed.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Risk partially mitigated. Helps contain the impact.

**Currently Implemented:** Basic network policies isolate the `rook-ceph` namespace.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   More granular network policies are needed *within* the `rook-ceph` namespace to restrict communication between different Ceph components managed by Rook.
*   Network policies are missing for other Rook operators.
*   Regular review and testing of network policies are not standard procedures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring and Auditing Rook Operations](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring_and_auditing_rook_operations.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Enable Kubernetes Audit Logging:** Enable and configure Kubernetes audit logging to capture events related to Rook resources (CRDs, deployments, services, secrets, etc.). Send these logs to a centralized system.
2.  **Configure Rook Operator Logging:** Set the Rook operator log level appropriately (e.g., `INFO` or `DEBUG`). Centralize these logs for analysis.
3.  **Log Analysis:** Regularly analyze the collected logs (Kubernetes audit logs and Rook operator logs) for suspicious activity, errors, and warnings.
4.  **Alerting:** Set up alerts for critical events related to Rook, such as failed deployments, unauthorized access attempts (detected via audit logs), or resource exhaustion.
5.  **Dashboards:** Create dashboards (e.g., using Grafana) to visualize key Rook metrics and provide a real-time overview of the Rook deployment's health and security.  Rook often provides built-in metrics for Prometheus.
6. **Regular Review:** Periodically review the monitoring configuration.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Undetected Compromise (High Severity):** Helps detect compromised Rook operators before significant damage occurs.
*   **Insider Threat (Medium Severity):** Audit logs can help identify malicious or negligent actions by administrators interacting with Rook.
*   **Configuration Errors (Medium Severity):** Monitoring can detect misconfigurations in Rook deployments.
*   **Performance Issues (Low Severity):** Monitoring can help identify performance bottlenecks in Rook itself.

**Impact:**
*   **Undetected Compromise:** Risk significantly reduced. Early detection allows for faster response.
*   **Insider Threat:** Risk reduced. Provides a record of actions.
*   **Configuration Errors:** Risk reduced. Early detection of misconfigurations.
*   **Performance Issues:** Risk reduced. Proactive identification of problems.

**Currently Implemented:** Kubernetes audit logging is enabled. Basic Rook operator logging is configured. Prometheus and Grafana are deployed with basic dashboards.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Alerting is not fully configured for critical security events related to Rook.
*   Automated log analysis is limited.
*   Regular review of the monitoring configuration is not formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Secrets (Used by Rook)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_secrets__used_by_rook_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Use Kubernetes Secrets:** Store all sensitive information that Rook uses (e.g., Ceph authentication keys, any passwords used for external integrations) as Kubernetes Secrets.
2.  **Avoid Hardcoding:** Never hardcode secrets in Rook configuration files, deployments, or operator code.
3.  **Secret Management Solution:** Consider integrating with a dedicated secret management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to manage and inject secrets into Rook deployments. This provides better security and auditability than basic Kubernetes Secrets.
4.  **Secret Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating secrets used by Rook.
5.  **Least Privilege for Secret Access:** Limit access to Kubernetes Secrets to only the Rook operator pods (and any other pods) that *absolutely require* them. Use RBAC.
6.  **Audit Secret Access:** Monitor access to secrets.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Secret Compromise (High Severity):** Compromised secrets used by Rook could grant attackers access to the storage system.
*   **Credential Theft (High Severity):** Hardcoded secrets are easily stolen.
*   **Insider Threat (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential damage from a malicious administrator.

**Impact:**
*   **Secret Compromise:** Risk significantly reduced by using a secret management solution and rotating secrets.
*   **Credential Theft:** Risk eliminated by avoiding hardcoding.
*   **Insider Threat:** Risk reduced by limiting and auditing secret access.

**Currently Implemented:** Rook configuration uses Kubernetes Secrets for Ceph authentication keys.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Integration with a dedicated secret management solution (e.g., Vault) is not implemented.
*   A formal secret rotation process is not in place.
*   Auditing of secret access is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Quotas and Limits (for Rook Operators)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_quotas_and_limits__for_rook_operators_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Analyze Resource Usage:** Determine the typical and maximum resource requirements (CPU, memory) for Rook *operator* pods.
2.  **Define Resource Limits:** Set resource *limits* on individual Rook operator pods to prevent them from consuming excessive resources.
3.  **Define Resource Quotas:** Set resource *quotas* at the namespace level to limit the total resources that all Rook operators within that namespace can consume.
4.  **Monitor Resource Usage:** Continuously monitor resource usage to ensure limits and quotas are effective.
5.  **Adjust as Needed:** Adjust resource quotas and limits as needed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents a compromised Rook operator from consuming all available resources and impacting other applications or the control plane.
*   **Resource Contention (Low Severity):** Ensures fair resource allocation.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Risk significantly reduced. Limits the impact of a DoS attack targeting a Rook operator.
*   **Resource Contention:** Risk reduced. Improves overall system stability.

**Currently Implemented:** Basic resource limits are set on Rook operator pods.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Resource quotas at the namespace level are not implemented.
*   Continuous monitoring and adjustment of limits/quotas are not formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Consideration of Rook Upgrades](./mitigation_strategies/careful_consideration_of_rook_upgrades.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review Release Notes:** Thoroughly review the release notes and upgrade guides for *each* Rook version before upgrading. Pay close attention to security-related changes.
2.  **Test in Non-Production:** Test Rook upgrades in a non-production environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
3.  **Backup and Rollback Plan:** Create a backup of the Rook deployment (including CRD states) *before* upgrading. Have a clear, documented rollback plan.
4.  **Monitor After Upgrade:** Closely monitor the system after the upgrade for any signs of problems, especially those related to Rook's functionality.
5.  **Phased Rollout:** Consider a phased rollout of the Rook operator upgrade, starting with a small subset of pods.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Upgrade-Related Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** New Rook versions may introduce new vulnerabilities or regressions.
*   **Service Disruption (High Severity):** A failed Rook upgrade could disrupt storage services.
*   **Data Loss (Low probability, but High Severity if it occurs):** While Rook upgrades are designed to be non-disruptive, a bug could potentially lead to issues. The backup is crucial.

**Impact:**
*   **Upgrade-Related Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced by testing in a non-production environment.
*   **Service Disruption:** Risk reduced by testing, phased rollouts, and monitoring.
*   **Data Loss:** Risk minimized by having a robust backup and rollback plan.

**Currently Implemented:** Basic testing of upgrades in a staging environment is performed.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A formal, documented upgrade process with a detailed rollback plan is not in place.
*   Phased rollouts are not consistently used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation for Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) *managed by Rook*](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_for_custom_resource_definitions__crds__managed_by_rook.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Schema Validation:** Use Kubernetes' built-in schema validation (OpenAPI v3 schema) to define the expected data types, formats, and constraints for all fields in the CRDs that Rook uses to manage storage (e.g., CephCluster, CephBlockPool, etc.).
2.  **Custom Validation Logic (within Rook Operators):** If schema validation is insufficient, implement custom validation logic *within the Rook operator code* to perform more complex checks on the values provided in the CRDs. This is crucial for preventing misconfigurations that could lead to security issues.
3.  **Sanitization:** Sanitize and escape any user-provided input from CRDs *before* the Rook operator uses it to configure the underlying storage provider. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling within the Rook operator to gracefully handle invalid input in CRDs and prevent the operator from crashing or entering an inconsistent state.
5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the input validation logic with both valid and invalid CRD inputs.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Malicious input to Rook's CRDs could potentially be used to inject commands or configurations into the underlying storage provider (though this is primarily mitigated by securing the storage provider itself).  Rook's input validation acts as a crucial first line of defense.
*   **Configuration Errors (Medium Severity):** Invalid input could lead to misconfigurations of the storage provider, potentially exposing data or disrupting services.
*   **Operator Instability (Medium Severity):** Malformed input could cause the Rook operator to crash or behave unexpectedly.

**Impact:**
*   **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced by schema validation, custom validation logic within the Rook operator, and sanitization.
*   **Configuration Errors:** Risk reduced by ensuring that only valid input is accepted by the Rook operator.
*   **Operator Instability:** Risk reduced by robust error handling and thorough testing.

**Currently Implemented:** Basic schema validation is used for the built-in Rook CRDs.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Custom validation logic *within the Rook operators* is not yet fully implemented for all CRDs and all fields. This is a critical area for improvement.
*   Sanitization of user-provided input from CRDs is not consistently applied within the Rook operators.
*   Thorough testing of input validation with a wide range of invalid inputs is needed.
