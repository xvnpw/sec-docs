## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Rook Operator Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_rook_operator_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Why Critical:** The Rook Operator is the central component responsible for managing the lifecycle of storage resources within the Kubernetes cluster. Compromising it grants the attacker extensive control over the storage infrastructure.

*   **Attack Vector: Code Injection/RCE in Operator (e.g., CVE in a dependency) [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability, such as a known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) in a library or dependency used by the Rook Operator, to inject malicious code and achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the Operator's pod.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Rook to the latest version, including all dependencies.
        *   Employ container image scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
        *   Conduct penetration testing specifically targeting the Rook Operator.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for the Operator's Kubernetes service account (RBAC).
        *   Implement network policies to restrict network access to the Operator pod.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Rook CSI Driver Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_rook_csi_driver_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Code Injection/RCE in CSI Driver (e.g., CVE) [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:** Similar to the Operator vulnerability, an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver's code or its dependencies to gain RCE within the CSI driver's pod.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep CSI drivers updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Scan CSI driver container images for vulnerabilities.
        *   Run the CSI driver with minimal Kubernetes permissions (RBAC).
        *   Restrict network access to CSI driver pods using network policies.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_misconfigurations.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Weak Authentication/Authorization (e.g., default creds) [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:** The attacker leverages weak or default credentials (username/password combinations) to gain unauthorized access to the Rook-managed storage cluster or its components. This could include access to the storage provider's management interface or to Kubernetes resources managed by Rook.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for all storage-related accounts.
        *   Integrate with existing identity providers (e.g., using Kubernetes service accounts and RBAC) where possible.
        *   Disable or change default credentials immediately after installation.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where supported.
        *   Regularly audit access controls and user accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Manipulate Rook CRDs [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4__manipulate_rook_crds__critical_.md)

*   **Why Critical:** Rook uses Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to define and manage storage resources within Kubernetes.  Gaining control over these CRDs allows an attacker to directly manipulate the storage infrastructure.

*   **Attack Vector: Unauthorized Creation/Deletion [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:** The attacker gains sufficient Kubernetes RBAC permissions to create new storage resources (e.g., rogue volumes) or delete existing ones.  This could lead to data loss, service disruption, or the creation of backdoors for persistent access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict RBAC controls on Rook CRDs, limiting who can create, modify, or delete them.
        *   Use Kubernetes admission controllers (e.g., validating webhooks) to enforce policies on CRD operations.
        *   Enable and monitor Kubernetes audit logs to track all CRD changes.
        *   Regularly review and audit RBAC policies.
