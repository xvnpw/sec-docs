Okay, let's create a design document for the Rook project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Rook is an open-source cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud-native environments.  It automates deployment, bootstrapping, configuring, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migrating, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management of storage.  The primary business goals appear to be:

*   Simplify Storage Management: Reduce the operational complexity of deploying and managing persistent storage in Kubernetes environments.
*   Enable Cloud-Native Storage: Provide a consistent and reliable storage experience across different Kubernetes deployments (on-premise, cloud, hybrid).
*   Support Diverse Storage Backends: Offer flexibility by supporting multiple storage providers (Ceph, EdgeFS, Cassandra, NFS, etc.).
*   Promote Open Source Adoption: Foster a community-driven approach to storage management, encouraging contributions and widespread use.
*   Improve Developer Productivity: Allow developers to easily provision and manage storage for their applications without deep storage expertise.
*   Reduce Storage Costs: Optimize storage utilization and potentially reduce costs compared to traditional storage solutions.

Based on these goals, the most important business risks are:

*   Data Loss/Corruption: Failure of the underlying storage provider or Rook itself leading to data loss or corruption would be catastrophic.
*   Service Unavailability: Inability to access storage resources would disrupt applications relying on Rook.
*   Security Breaches: Unauthorized access to data stored through Rook could lead to data breaches and reputational damage.
*   Performance Bottlenecks: Poor storage performance could impact application performance and user experience.
*   Vendor Lock-in (Paradoxical): While Rook aims to *reduce* lock-in, dependence on a specific Rook-supported storage provider could still create a form of lock-in.
*   Operational Complexity (If Misconfigured): While Rook simplifies storage, misconfiguration or improper management could *increase* complexity.
*   Upgrade Failures: Issues during Rook or storage provider upgrades could lead to downtime or data loss.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Rook's security posture is heavily influenced by its role as an orchestrator. It delegates much of the actual data storage security to the underlying storage providers. However, Rook itself introduces security considerations.

Existing Security Controls (based on the GitHub repository and documentation):

*   security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Rook utilizes Kubernetes RBAC to control access to its resources and operations. This is evident in the numerous RBAC YAML files in the repository. Where: Kubernetes RBAC configuration files.
*   security control: Security Contexts: Rook operators and managed pods can be configured with security contexts to restrict their privileges. Where: Kubernetes pod and container specifications.
*   security control: Network Policies: Network policies can be used to restrict network access to Rook and the underlying storage providers. Where: Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resources.
*   security control: Storage Provider Security: Rook relies on the security features of the underlying storage providers (e.g., Ceph's encryption, authentication). Where: Configuration of the specific storage provider.
*   security control: Admission Controllers (Potentially): Kubernetes admission controllers (like Pod Security Admission or third-party solutions) can be used to enforce security policies on Rook deployments. Where: Kubernetes cluster configuration.
*   security control: Regular Updates: The Rook project is actively maintained, with regular releases that include security patches. Where: GitHub releases and project documentation.
*   security control: Community Scrutiny: As an open-source project, Rook benefits from community scrutiny, which can help identify and address security vulnerabilities. Where: GitHub issues and pull requests.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Underlying Storage Provider Vulnerabilities: Rook is ultimately dependent on the security of the chosen storage provider. Vulnerabilities in the storage provider could impact Rook-managed storage.
*   accepted risk: Complexity of Configuration: The flexibility of Rook and its support for multiple storage providers introduces complexity, which can lead to misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities if not managed carefully.
*   accepted risk: Kubernetes Cluster Security: Rook's security is inherently tied to the security of the underlying Kubernetes cluster. A compromised cluster could compromise Rook.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement robust monitoring and alerting for Rook and the underlying storage providers. This should include security-related events.
*   Regularly audit Rook configurations and deployments for security best practices.
*   Consider using a dedicated security scanning tool for container images used by Rook.
*   Implement network policies to isolate Rook and storage provider pods.
*   Use a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and manage sensitive information used by Rook.
*   Enforce principle of least privilege for all Rook components and managed pods.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Rook operators should authenticate with the Kubernetes API using strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., service accounts with limited privileges).
    *   Access to the underlying storage provider should be authenticated using secure credentials.

*   Authorization:
    *   RBAC should be strictly enforced to limit access to Rook resources and operations based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Access to storage resources should be controlled through appropriate authorization mechanisms provided by the storage provider.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Rook should validate all user inputs and configuration parameters to prevent injection attacks or other vulnerabilities. This is particularly important for custom resource definitions (CRDs).

*   Cryptography:
    *   Data at rest should be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms, as supported by the underlying storage provider.
    *   Data in transit should be encrypted using TLS/SSL.
    *   Secrets should be stored and managed securely.

## DEPLOYMENT

Rook is typically deployed within a Kubernetes cluster. There are several possible deployment architectures:

2.  **Cloud-Based Kubernetes:** Rook deployed on a managed Kubernetes service like Amazon EKS, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
3.  **Hybrid Cloud:** Rook deployed across multiple Kubernetes clusters, some on-premise and some in the cloud.

We'll describe the Cloud-Based Kubernetes deployment using AWS EKS as an example:

## BUILD

Rook's build process is automated using GitHub Actions. The repository contains numerous workflow files (YAML) that define the build, test, and release processes.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] --> GitHub["GitHub Repository"]
    GitHub --> GitHubActions["GitHub Actions"]
    GitHubActions --> Build["Build & Test"]
    Build --> ContainerRegistry["Container Registry (e.g., Quay.io)"]
    Build --> SAST["SAST Scanning"]
    Build --> SCA["SCA Scanning"]
    SAST --> Report["Security Report"]
    SCA --> Report
```

*   Developer pushes code to the GitHub repository.
*   GitHub Actions triggers workflows based on events (e.g., push, pull request).
*   Workflows perform various tasks:
    *   Build Rook binaries and container images.
    *   Run unit and integration tests.
    *   Perform static analysis (SAST) using tools like `gosec` (as seen in the workflows).
    *   Perform software composition analysis (SCA) to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies. This isn't explicitly shown in all workflows but is a recommended practice.
    *   Push container images to a container registry (e.g., Quay.io).
    *   Create GitHub releases.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Automated Builds: GitHub Actions ensures consistent and reproducible builds.
*   SAST Scanning: Static analysis tools help identify potential security vulnerabilities in the Rook codebase.
*   SCA Scanning: (Recommended) Scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   Code Review: Pull requests are reviewed by other developers before being merged, providing an opportunity for security review.
*   Signed Commits: (Recommended) Enforcing signed commits helps ensure the integrity of the codebase.
*   Least Privilege: Build workflows should run with the minimum necessary privileges.
