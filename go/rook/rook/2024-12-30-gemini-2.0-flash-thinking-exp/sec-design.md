## 4. Detailed Design

This section provides a deeper dive into the key components and their interactions within the Rook architecture.

### 4.1. Rook Operator

* **Core Functionality:** Acts as a Kubernetes controller, observing the state of custom resources and ensuring the desired state of the storage cluster.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
    * **Storage Cluster Lifecycle Management:**  Handles the deployment, configuration, scaling, and upgrading of the underlying storage cluster (e.g., Ceph).
    * **Custom Resource Management:**  Reacts to changes in Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) related to storage resources, such as creating Ceph clusters, object stores, and block pools.
    * **Health Monitoring and Remediation:** Continuously monitors the health of the storage cluster and its components, taking corrective actions in case of failures.
    * **Resource Provisioning:**  Orchestrates the provisioning of storage resources based on user requests (PVCs).
    * **Secret and Configuration Management:** Manages sensitive information and configuration settings required by the storage cluster.
* **Deployment Details:** Typically deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment or StatefulSet within a dedicated namespace.
* **Required Permissions:** Requires extensive Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions to manage various cluster resources, including pods, deployments, services, secrets, and custom resources.

### 4.2. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

* **Purpose:** Extend the Kubernetes API to introduce new resource types specifically for managing storage.
* **Examples (for Ceph):**
    * `CephCluster`: Defines the desired state of the entire Ceph cluster.
    * `CephObjectStore`: Represents a Ceph object storage instance (e.g., for S3 access).
    * `CephBlockPool`: Defines a pool of storage for block devices.
    * `CephFilesystem`: Represents a shared Ceph filesystem.
    * `CephClient`: Defines a Ceph client user and their associated permissions.
* **Interaction with Operator:** The Rook operator watches for changes in these CRs and takes actions to reconcile the actual state with the desired state defined in the CR.

### 4.3. Ceph Cluster Components

* **MON (Monitor):**
    * **Function:** Maintains a consistent view of the cluster membership and state.
    * **Security Considerations:** Critical for cluster consensus and availability. Compromise can lead to cluster instability.
* **OSD (Object Storage Daemon):**
    * **Function:** Stores the actual data on physical storage devices.
    * **Security Considerations:** Contains sensitive data. Access should be strictly controlled. Data-at-rest encryption is crucial.
* **MGR (Manager):**
    * **Function:** Provides monitoring, orchestration, and an API for the Ceph cluster.
    * **Security Considerations:** Offers administrative access to the cluster. Access should be restricted.
* **MDS (Metadata Server):**
    * **Function:** Manages metadata for the Ceph Filesystem.
    * **Security Considerations:** Metadata integrity is vital for filesystem consistency.
* **RadosGW (RADOS Gateway):**
    * **Function:** Provides object storage access via S3 and Swift compatible APIs.
    * **Security Considerations:** Entry point for external access to object storage. Requires robust authentication and authorization.

### 4.4. Storage Provisioning Workflow

* **Block Storage (using RBD):**
    * **Process Initiation:** An application requests storage by creating a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).
    * **Kubernetes Interaction:** The Kubernetes API server identifies the appropriate StorageClass (configured to use the Rook RBD provisioner).
    * **Rook RBD Provisioner Action:** The Rook RBD provisioner receives the provisioning request.
    * **Ceph Resource Creation:** The provisioner interacts with the Ceph cluster (via the Rook operator) to create a new RBD image in the specified Ceph block pool.
    * **PersistentVolume Creation:** A PersistentVolume (PV) is created, representing the newly provisioned storage.
    * **Binding:** The PV is bound to the requesting PVC, making the storage available to the application.
* **Object Storage (using RadosGW):**
    * **Access Method:** Applications interact with the RadosGW using standard object storage APIs (S3, Swift).
    * **Rook Management:** Rook manages the deployment and configuration of the RadosGW.
    * **Authentication:** Access control is typically managed through Ceph user accounts and S3 access keys (managed as Kubernetes secrets).
* **Shared Filesystem (using CephFS):**
    * **Provisioning:** Similar to block storage, a PVC with the appropriate StorageClass triggers the provisioning process.
    * **Rook CSI Driver:** The Rook CSI (Container Storage Interface) driver for CephFS handles the interaction with the Ceph MDS to create and manage the filesystem.
    * **Mounting:** Multiple pods can mount the same CephFS volume for shared access.

### 4.5. Data Flow (Block Storage Read/Write)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Application Pod"] -- "Read/Write Request" --> B["Kubernetes Node (kubelet)"]
    B -- "Volume Mount" --> C["Rook Ceph RBD CSI Driver"]
    C -- "RBD Protocol" --> D["Ceph MON"]
    D -- "Data Location Lookup" --> E["Ceph OSD"]
    E -- "Data Read/Write" --> F["Storage Device"]
```

**Data Flow Steps:**

1. **Application Initiates Request:** An application pod sends a read or write request to a mounted volume.
2. **Kubelet Intercepts:** The kubelet on the node hosting the pod intercepts the request.
3. **CSI Driver Interaction:** The request is handled by the Rook Ceph RBD CSI driver.
4. **Ceph Monitor Lookup:** The CSI driver communicates with a Ceph MON to determine the location of the requested data.
5. **OSD Interaction:** The request is forwarded to the appropriate Ceph OSD(s) responsible for storing the data.
6. **Storage Device Access:** The OSD performs the read or write operation on the underlying storage device.
