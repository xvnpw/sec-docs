# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rook/rook

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Rook Operators](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__for_rook_operators.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Rook Operators.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Rook Operator Roles:** Create Kubernetes `Roles` or `ClusterRoles` specifically tailored for Rook operators. These roles should control access to Rook custom resources (e.g., `CephCluster`, `CephObjectStore`), Rook operator pods, and necessary Kubernetes resources for Rook's operation. Example roles: `rook-cluster-admin`, `rook-osd-manager`, `rook-monitor-viewer`.
    2.  **Bind Roles to Rook Operator Service Accounts:** Ensure Rook operator deployments (defined in Rook manifests) use dedicated Kubernetes `ServiceAccounts`. Bind the defined Rook-specific `Roles` or `ClusterRoles` to these `ServiceAccounts` using `RoleBindings` or `ClusterRoleBindings` within the Rook namespace.
    3.  **Apply Service Accounts in Rook Operator Manifests:** Verify that Rook operator deployment YAML files are configured to use the dedicated `ServiceAccounts` under `spec.template.spec.serviceAccountName`. This is crucial for enforcing RBAC on Rook operators.
    4.  **Regularly Audit Rook RBAC:** Periodically review and audit the defined Rook operator roles and bindings to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege and are aligned with current Rook operational needs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Rook Operator Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users or processes from gaining control over the Rook operator, potentially leading to cluster-wide storage disruption, data loss, or malicious manipulation of the Ceph cluster managed by Rook.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Rook Operator (High Severity):** Limits the potential damage if a Rook operator account is compromised. RBAC restricts the attacker's actions within the Rook ecosystem and the underlying Ceph cluster.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Rook Operator Access:** High Risk Reduction. RBAC is fundamental for securing access to the Rook control plane.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Rook Operator:** High Risk Reduction. Significantly reduces the impact of a compromised Rook operator account by limiting its capabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Kubernetes RBAC is enabled, and Rook operators use service accounts. However, custom, fine-grained Rook-specific roles are likely not fully defined and enforced. Default Rook manifests might use overly permissive service accounts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Define Granular Rook-Specific Roles:** Create and implement `Roles` and `ClusterRoles` that are specifically designed for different Rook operator functions (e.g., cluster creation, OSD management, monitoring).
    *   **Enforce Least Privilege for Rook Operators:** Review and refine existing service account permissions and roles to strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege for all Rook operator components.
    *   **Automated Rook RBAC Audits:** Implement automated checks and alerts for deviations from the defined Rook RBAC policies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Ceph User Management via Rook](./mitigation_strategies/secure_ceph_user_management_via_rook.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Ceph User Management via Rook.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Rook's Ceph User Creation:** Leverage Rook's tooling (e.g., `kubectl rook-ceph toolbox`) or Kubernetes manifests (e.g., `CephClient` CRD) to create Ceph users specifically for applications accessing storage managed by Rook. Avoid manual Ceph CLI usage outside of Rook's management.
    2.  **Grant Minimal Ceph Permissions via Rook:** When creating Ceph users through Rook, define and apply minimal permissions required for each application's storage access. Utilize Rook's mechanisms to control access to specific Ceph pools, namespaces, and operations (read, write, execute) as defined in Rook's CRDs or toolbox commands.
    3.  **Manage Ceph User Keys as Kubernetes Secrets via Rook:** Rook should be configured to manage Ceph user keys as Kubernetes `Secrets`. Ensure that when creating Ceph users via Rook, the keys are automatically stored as Secrets within the Rook namespace, and applications are configured to retrieve these Secrets for authentication.
    4.  **Implement Key Rotation for Rook-Managed Ceph Users:**  Explore and implement key rotation strategies for Ceph users managed by Rook. This might involve scripting or automation that leverages Rook's APIs or tooling to rotate keys and update associated Kubernetes Secrets.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access via Ceph (High Severity):** Prevents applications or malicious actors from accessing Ceph data they are not authorized to see or modify. Using overly permissive Ceph users or the `client.admin` user grants excessive access to Rook-managed storage.
    *   **Lateral Movement within Rook/Ceph Storage (Medium Severity):** Limits the impact of a compromised application. If an application with limited Ceph permissions (granted via Rook) is compromised, the attacker's access to the broader Rook-managed storage system is restricted.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access via Ceph:** High Risk Reduction. Rook-managed Ceph user control is crucial for limiting access to sensitive data within the storage cluster.
    *   **Lateral Movement within Rook/Ceph Storage:** Medium Risk Reduction. Improves containment of breaches within the Rook-managed storage environment.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Rook provides mechanisms for Ceph user creation and management. However, consistent enforcement of minimal permissions and automated key rotation for Rook-managed users might be missing. Applications might not always be configured to use Rook-managed users and Secrets correctly.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Standardized Rook-Based Ceph User Management:** Establish a mandatory process for creating and managing Ceph users exclusively through Rook's provided tools and CRDs.
    *   **Automated Minimal Permission Granting via Rook:** Develop templates or scripts to automate the creation of Rook-managed Ceph users with pre-defined minimal permission sets based on application requirements.
    *   **Fully Automated Key Rotation for Rook Users:** Implement a fully automated key rotation process specifically for Ceph users managed by Rook, ensuring seamless updates to Kubernetes Secrets and application configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Policies for Rook Managed Services](./mitigation_strategies/network_policies_for_rook_managed_services.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Network Policies for Rook Managed Services.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Apply Network Policies to Rook Namespace:** Enforce Kubernetes Network Policies specifically within the namespace where Rook is deployed. This namespace should house Rook operators, Ceph monitors, OSDs, and other Rook-managed components.
    2.  **Restrict Ingress to Rook Operators and Ceph Monitors:** Define Network Policies to strictly control ingress traffic to Rook operator pods and Ceph monitor pods. Allow only necessary traffic from within the Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Kubernetes control plane, authorized monitoring agents) and potentially from designated external management networks.
    3.  **Isolate Ceph OSD and MDS Network Traffic:** Implement Network Policies to isolate network traffic between Ceph OSDs and MDS pods. Restrict communication to only necessary ports and protocols required for Ceph cluster operation, preventing lateral movement from compromised OSDs or MDS to other parts of the cluster or external networks.
    4.  **Control Egress from Rook Components:** Define Network Policies to control egress traffic from all Rook-managed components (operators, monitors, OSDs, MDS). Limit outbound connections to only essential destinations like the Kubernetes API server, DNS, and authorized monitoring/logging systems. Prevent unauthorized egress traffic that could be used for data exfiltration.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access to Rook/Ceph Services (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive Rook and Ceph services from within the Kubernetes cluster or external networks, protecting the storage infrastructure from network-based attacks.
    *   **Lateral Movement within Rook/Ceph Cluster (Medium Severity):** Limits the ability of compromised pods or nodes within the Kubernetes cluster to access Rook and Ceph services if they are not explicitly authorized by Network Policies.
    *   **Data Exfiltration from Rook/Ceph (Medium Severity):** Restricting egress traffic from Rook components can help prevent data exfiltration attempts in case of compromise or misconfiguration within the Rook-managed storage system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access to Rook/Ceph Services:** High Risk Reduction. Network Policies are a strong control for isolating and securing Rook's network footprint.
    *   **Lateral Movement within Rook/Ceph Cluster:** Medium Risk Reduction. Adds a significant layer of defense against lateral movement within the Rook-managed storage environment.
    *   **Data Exfiltration from Rook/Ceph:** Medium Risk Reduction. Reduces the potential for data leaks originating from Rook components.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic namespace isolation might be in place, but granular Network Policies specifically targeting Rook operators, Ceph monitors, OSDs, and MDS pods with ingress and egress rules are likely not fully implemented. Default allow policies might be in effect.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Define Rook-Specific Network Policies:** Create and deploy detailed Network Policies tailored to the specific communication requirements of Rook operators, Ceph monitors, OSDs, and MDS pods.
    *   **Enforce Default Deny for Rook Namespace:** Implement a default deny Network Policy within the Rook namespace to ensure all traffic is blocked unless explicitly allowed by defined policies.
    *   **Regularly Audit Rook Network Policies:** Periodically review and update Network Policies for the Rook namespace to ensure they remain effective and aligned with evolving security requirements and Rook deployment changes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Rook Managed Encryption at Rest for Ceph Storage](./mitigation_strategies/enable_rook_managed_encryption_at_rest_for_ceph_storage.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Rook Managed Encryption at Rest for Ceph Storage.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Rook `CephCluster` CRD for Encryption:** Modify the Rook `CephCluster` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to explicitly enable encryption at rest for Ceph OSDs. This is typically done by setting the `encryption.enabled` flag to `true` within the `spec` section of the `CephCluster` CRD.
    2.  **Specify Encryption Method in Rook CRD:** Choose and specify the desired encryption method supported by Rook within the `CephCluster` CRD. Rook commonly supports LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) for encryption at rest. Configure the `encryption.method` parameter accordingly.
    3.  **Configure Rook Key Management for Encryption:** Define how encryption keys will be managed by Rook. Rook can be configured to use Kubernetes Secrets for storing encryption keys. Ensure the `encryption.keyManagementService.name` and `encryption.keyManagementService.connectionDetails` (if needed) are correctly configured in the `CephCluster` CRD to utilize Kubernetes Secrets or a dedicated KMS if integrated with Rook.
    4.  **Deploy Rook Cluster with Encryption Enabled:** Apply the updated `CephCluster` CRD. Rook operator will handle the encryption setup during Ceph OSD creation or when encryption is enabled on existing OSDs based on the configuration in the CRD.
    5.  **Verify Rook Managed Encryption:** After Rook cluster deployment or update, verify that encryption at rest is enabled and managed by Rook. Check Rook operator logs and Ceph OSD status to confirm encryption is active and keys are managed as configured in the `CephCluster` CRD.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach from Physical Media Theft of Rook Storage (High Severity):** Protects data at rest within the Rook-managed Ceph storage cluster if physical storage media (disks, nodes) are stolen, improperly disposed of, or accessed without authorization.
    *   **Data Breach from Insider Threats with Physical Access to Rook Storage (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized data access by malicious insiders who might gain physical access to storage media managed by Rook.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach from Physical Media Theft of Rook Storage:** High Risk Reduction. Rook-managed encryption at rest is a critical control for mitigating this threat within the Rook storage context.
    *   **Data Breach from Insider Threats with Physical Access to Rook Storage:** Medium Risk Reduction. Adds a layer of defense against insider threats targeting physical Rook storage media.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented. Rook-managed encryption at rest is currently not enabled for the Ceph storage cluster deployed by Rook. Data is stored in plain text on the underlying storage devices managed by Rook.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Enable Encryption in Rook `CephCluster` CRD:** Modify the `CephCluster` CRD to enable Rook-managed encryption at rest by setting `encryption.enabled: true` and configuring the desired method and key management.
    *   **Configure Rook Key Management:** Choose a key management strategy supported by Rook (Kubernetes Secrets or KMS integration) and configure it within the `CephCluster` CRD.
    *   **Deploy Rook Cluster with Encryption:** Apply the updated `CephCluster` CRD to deploy or update the Rook cluster with encryption at rest enabled and managed by Rook.
    *   **Verification and Monitoring of Rook Encryption:** Implement monitoring and alerting to continuously verify that Rook-managed encryption at rest remains enabled and keys are managed securely as configured in the `CephCluster` CRD.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Rook Managed Encryption in Transit for Ceph Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_rook_managed_encryption_in_transit_for_ceph_communication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Rook Managed Encryption in Transit for Ceph Communication.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Ceph TLS/SSL via Rook `CephCluster` CRD:** Configure the Rook `CephCluster` CRD to enable TLS/SSL encryption for all communication between Ceph components managed by Rook (monitors, OSDs, MDS, clients). This is typically achieved by setting configuration options within the `spec` section of the `CephCluster` CRD related to TLS/SSL.
    2.  **Configure Rook Managed Certificate Management:** Implement certificate management for Rook-managed Ceph components. Rook can be configured to generate self-signed certificates (for testing) or to integrate with external Certificate Authorities (CAs) or cert-manager within Kubernetes for managing and issuing certificates for Ceph services. Configure the `CephCluster` CRD to specify the chosen certificate management method and related details.
    3.  **Deploy Rook Cluster with TLS/SSL Enabled:** Apply the updated `CephCluster` CRD. Rook operator will handle the TLS/SSL configuration for Ceph components during deployment or update, using the specified certificate management method.
    4.  **Verify Rook Managed Encryption in Transit:** After Rook cluster configuration, verify that encryption in transit is enabled and managed by Rook for Ceph communication. Monitor Rook operator logs and Ceph component status to confirm TLS/SSL is active and certificates are correctly used for communication between Rook-managed Ceph services.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Rook/Ceph Communication (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from eavesdropping on or manipulating network communication between Rook-managed Ceph components, protecting sensitive data transmitted within the Rook storage cluster.
    *   **Data Breach from Network Sniffing within Rook/Ceph Environment (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches if network traffic within the Rook-managed Ceph environment is intercepted and analyzed by unauthorized parties.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Rook/Ceph Communication:** High Risk Reduction. Rook-managed encryption in transit is essential for preventing MITM attacks targeting communication within the Rook storage cluster.
    *   **Data Breach from Network Sniffing within Rook/Ceph Environment:** Medium Risk Reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of passive network sniffing leading to data exposure within the Rook-managed storage environment.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented. Rook-managed encryption in transit for Ceph communication is currently not enforced. Communication between Ceph components managed by Rook is happening in plain text.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Enable TLS/SSL in Rook `CephCluster` CRD:** Configure the `CephCluster` CRD to enable Rook-managed TLS/SSL for Ceph communication by setting appropriate TLS/SSL related options.
    *   **Implement Rook Managed Certificate Management:** Choose a certificate management approach supported by Rook (self-signed, CA integration, cert-manager) and configure it within the `CephCluster` CRD.
    *   **Deploy Rook Cluster with TLS/SSL:** Apply the updated `CephCluster` CRD to deploy or update the Rook cluster with encryption in transit enabled and managed by Rook.
    *   **Verification and Monitoring of Rook Encryption in Transit:** Verify and continuously monitor that Rook-managed encryption in transit is enabled and functioning correctly for all Ceph communication within the Rook storage cluster.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Updates for Rook and Underlying Ceph Version](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_updates_for_rook_and_underlying_ceph_version.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Security Updates for Rook and Underlying Ceph Version.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Rook and Ceph Security Advisories:** Establish a process to actively monitor security advisories and release notes from both the Rook project and the upstream Ceph project. Subscribe to relevant mailing lists, watch GitHub repositories, and regularly check official security announcement channels for both Rook and Ceph.
    2.  **Regularly Check for Rook and Ceph Updates:** Periodically check for new versions of Rook and Ceph that include security patches and bug fixes. Consult Rook documentation and release notes for recommended upgrade paths and compatibility information between Rook and Ceph versions.
    3.  **Test Rook and Ceph Updates in Staging:** Before applying updates to production Rook deployments, thoroughly test them in a dedicated staging or development environment that mirrors the production setup. Verify compatibility, functionality, and performance of the updated Rook and Ceph versions in the staging environment.
    4.  **Apply Rook and Ceph Updates in Production:** Schedule maintenance windows to apply security updates to the production Rook deployment. Follow Rook's recommended upgrade procedures, which may involve rolling updates of Rook operators and Ceph components to minimize downtime.
    5.  **Automate Rook and Ceph Update Process (where possible):** Explore automation tools and techniques to streamline the process of checking for, testing, and applying Rook and Ceph security updates. Consider using tools that can automate vulnerability scanning of Rook and Ceph container images and provide notifications for available updates.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Rook and Ceph (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting publicly known security vulnerabilities present in specific versions of Rook and the underlying Ceph software, which could lead to compromise of the storage system, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits Targeting Rook or Ceph (Medium Severity):** While updates primarily address known vulnerabilities, a proactive and timely update strategy for Rook and Ceph improves responsiveness and reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered zero-day vulnerabilities as soon as patches become available from the Rook and Ceph communities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Rook and Ceph:** High Risk Reduction. Regular security updates are a fundamental and highly effective mitigation against known vulnerabilities in Rook and Ceph.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits Targeting Rook or Ceph:** Medium Risk Reduction. Proactive updates enhance the project's security posture and improve response time to emerging threats, including zero-day vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. There is general awareness of the need for Rook and Ceph updates, but a formal, documented, and consistently executed process for proactive security updates is likely missing. Updates might be applied reactively in response to specific issues rather than proactively on a regular schedule. Vulnerability scanning and automated update notifications for Rook and Ceph are not consistently implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal Rook and Ceph Update Process Documentation:** Document a clear and comprehensive process for managing security updates for Rook and the underlying Ceph version, including responsibilities, timelines, procedures for monitoring advisories, testing updates, and applying them to production.
    *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning for Rook and Ceph:** Integrate automated vulnerability scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline and runtime environment to regularly scan Rook and Ceph container images and deployed components for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Proactive Rook and Ceph Update Scheduling:** Establish a proactive schedule for regularly checking for and applying security updates for Rook and Ceph, rather than relying solely on reactive responses to security incidents.
    *   **Dedicated Staging Environment for Rook and Ceph Updates:** Ensure a dedicated staging environment is maintained that accurately mirrors the production Rook deployment for thorough testing of updates before they are applied to production.
