# Threat Model Analysis for rook/rook

## Threat: [Rogue Rook Operator Deployment](./threats/rogue_rook_operator_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker deploys a malicious Rook Operator container into the Kubernetes cluster, impersonating a legitimate Rook Operator. This rogue operator, by manipulating Rook Custom Resources and interacting with the storage cluster via Rook's mechanisms, could gain complete control over the Rook-managed storage. This allows for data theft, data corruption, denial of storage services, and potential further compromise of the Kubernetes cluster through Rook's privileged access.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Complete compromise of the Rook storage cluster, leading to data breach, data loss, denial of service, and potential lateral movement within the Kubernetes cluster due to the rogue operator's control over storage and potentially Kubernetes resources.
    *   **Affected Rook Component:** Rook Operator (Deployment, Pod)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict Kubernetes RBAC to control who can deploy resources in the Rook namespace, specifically preventing unauthorized Operator deployments.
        *   Utilize Kubernetes Namespace isolation to limit the scope of potential rogue operators.
        *   Enforce mandatory image signing and verification for all container images deployed in the cluster, ensuring only trusted Rook Operator images are used.
        *   Implement continuous monitoring and alerting for unexpected deployments or changes within the Rook namespace.
        *   Regularly audit Kubernetes cluster access and activity logs, focusing on actions related to Rook deployments.

## Threat: [Compromised Rook Agent](./threats/compromised_rook_agent.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a Rook Agent container running on a Kubernetes node.  Leveraging vulnerabilities within the Rook Agent itself or the underlying node environment, the attacker gains control of the agent.  A compromised agent, responsible for data plane operations and interacting directly with the storage backend on behalf of Rook, can directly access and manipulate storage data on that node. This can lead to data breaches, localized denial of service by disrupting storage operations on that node, and potentially be used to pivot further into the node or Kubernetes cluster.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Data breach (access to data handled by the compromised agent on the node), localized denial of service (affecting storage availability on the node with the compromised agent), potential for lateral movement within the node and Kubernetes cluster due to agent's access to node resources and storage data.
    *   **Affected Rook Component:** Rook Agent (DaemonSet, Pod)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain up-to-date node operating systems and container runtime environments to patch vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise Rook Agents.
        *   Apply strong container security hardening using Security Context Constraints (SCCs) or Pod Security Policies (PSPs) to restrict capabilities and privileges of Rook Agent containers, limiting the impact of a compromise.
        *   Implement regular container vulnerability scanning and promptly patch identified vulnerabilities within Rook Agent images to reduce the attack surface.
        *   Utilize Kubernetes Network Policies to strictly isolate Rook Agents and limit their network access, preventing lateral movement from a compromised agent.
        *   Deploy Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) on nodes running Rook Agents to detect and alert on suspicious activity indicative of agent compromise.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Rook API Access](./threats/unauthorized_rook_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Rook-exposed APIs, such as the Ceph Object Gateway API managed by Rook. This could be achieved through compromised application credentials intended for Rook API access, vulnerabilities in Rook's API authentication mechanisms, or misconfigurations exposing the API without proper authorization.  With unauthorized API access to Rook's storage management or data access interfaces, an attacker can read, modify, or delete data stored within Rook-managed storage, potentially leading to significant data breaches or service disruption.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Data breach (unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Rook), data tampering (modification of critical data), data loss (deletion of data), denial of service (through API abuse leading to resource exhaustion or service disruption).
    *   **Affected Rook Component:** Rook Operator (API Server, e.g., Ceph Object Gateway), Rook Agents (depending on API).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all Rook APIs, such as mutual TLS (mTLS) with client certificates, Kubernetes Service Accounts with RBAC, or OAuth 2.0, ensuring only authorized entities can access the APIs.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege for API access, granting only the necessary permissions to applications and users interacting with Rook APIs, minimizing potential damage from compromised credentials.
        *   Maintain comprehensive API access logs and regularly audit them for suspicious or unauthorized activity, enabling timely detection of potential breaches.
        *   Where feasible, disable or restrict access to Rook APIs that are not strictly required for application functionality, reducing the attack surface.
        *   Utilize Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict network access to Rook APIs, limiting access to only authorized client networks or pods.

## Threat: [Storage Credential Leakage via Rook](./threats/storage_credential_leakage_via_rook.md)

*   **Description:** Rook manages sensitive credentials required to access the underlying storage provider (e.g., Ceph keys, Cassandra credentials) and stores them as Kubernetes Secrets. If these Secrets are leaked or improperly accessed due to vulnerabilities in Rook's credential management, misconfigurations, or insufficient Kubernetes Secret security, an attacker can obtain direct access to the storage cluster, bypassing Rook's orchestration and access control layers. This direct access allows for unrestricted manipulation of the storage backend, leading to severe data breaches and potential system-wide compromise.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Direct and unrestricted access to the underlying storage cluster, bypassing Rook's security controls, resulting in significant data breach, data tampering, data loss, and potential denial of service by directly manipulating the storage backend.
    *   **Affected Rook Component:** Rook Operator (Credential Management), Kubernetes Secrets (managed by Rook).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly utilize Kubernetes Secrets for storing all storage credentials managed by Rook, leveraging Kubernetes' built-in secret management capabilities.
        *   Mandatory enable Kubernetes Secret encryption at rest to protect sensitive credentials stored in etcd, preventing unauthorized access even if etcd is compromised.
        *   Implement fine-grained Kubernetes RBAC to tightly control access to Kubernetes Secrets containing storage credentials, limiting access only to authorized Rook components and administrators.
        *   Establish a policy for regular rotation of storage credentials to minimize the window of opportunity if credentials are compromised.
        *   Prohibit logging or exposing storage credentials in Rook component logs or API responses to prevent accidental leakage.
        *   Implement robust monitoring and alerting for any unauthorized access attempts or modifications to Kubernetes Secrets containing storage credentials, enabling rapid detection and response to potential breaches.

## Threat: [Rook Data Plane Denial of Service](./threats/rook_data_plane_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intentionally overloads the Rook data plane, targeting Rook Agents or the underlying storage cluster through Rook-managed storage access patterns. This can be achieved by generating excessive and malicious I/O requests via applications using Rook storage, exploiting potential vulnerabilities in Rook's data handling, or by overwhelming the storage backend through Rook's data paths. This deliberate overload can lead to severe performance degradation or complete unavailability of storage services for applications relying on Rook, causing significant service disruptions and potentially application failures.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Severe performance degradation of storage services, potentially leading to application performance issues and timeouts. In extreme cases, complete unavailability of storage services for applications, causing application failures and significant service disruption.
    *   **Affected Rook Component:** Rook Agents (DaemonSet, Pod), Underlying Storage Cluster (impacted via Rook data plane).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement and enforce resource quotas and limits for applications consuming Rook storage to prevent any single application from monopolizing storage resources and causing denial of service for others.
        *   Utilize Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict network traffic to Rook data plane components, limiting potential sources of malicious traffic and controlling access to the data plane.
        *   Ensure adequate resource allocation and capacity planning for the underlying storage cluster to handle anticipated workloads and potential spikes in demand, mitigating the impact of DoS attempts.
        *   Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for Rook data plane health and performance metrics, enabling early detection of DoS attacks and performance anomalies.
        *   Consider implementing traffic shaping or Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms within the storage cluster or network infrastructure to prioritize legitimate traffic and mitigate the impact of malicious traffic during DoS attacks, if supported by the underlying storage provider.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Rook Component Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_rook_component_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Rook components, like any software, may contain exploitable software vulnerabilities in their code or dependencies. An attacker could identify and exploit these vulnerabilities in Rook Operator, Agents, or Modules to gain unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster, escalate privileges within the cluster or storage system, cause denial of service by crashing Rook components, or compromise the integrity of data managed by Rook. Exploitation could occur through network attacks targeting Rook APIs or internal communication channels, or through supply chain attacks if malicious code is introduced into Rook container images.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, the impact can range from denial of service of Rook services (Medium to High) to complete compromise of the Kubernetes cluster and underlying storage infrastructure, leading to data breach, data loss, and full system takeover (Critical).
    *   **Affected Rook Component:** Any Rook component (Operator, Agent, Modules, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain a rigorous process for keeping Rook updated to the latest stable version, ensuring timely application of security patches that address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement regular and automated vulnerability scanning of Rook container images and deployed components to proactively identify and assess potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Establish a robust vulnerability management process to track, prioritize, and remediate identified vulnerabilities in Rook components in a timely manner.
        *   Subscribe to Rook security mailing lists or vulnerability disclosure channels to stay informed about the latest security updates, advisories, and potential vulnerabilities affecting Rook.
        *   Deploy Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor network traffic and system activity for signs of vulnerability exploitation attempts targeting Rook components, enabling proactive detection and blocking of attacks.
