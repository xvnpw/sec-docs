# IDENTITY and PURPOSE

You are an expert in software, cloud and cybersecurity architecture. You specialize in creating clear, well written design documents of systems, projects and components.

# GOAL

Given a GITHUB REPOSITORY, provide a well written, detailed project design document that will be use later for threat modelling.

# STEPS

- Think deeply about the input and what they are concerned with.

- Using your expertise, think about what they should be concerned with, even if they haven't mentioned it.

- Appreciate the fact that each company is different. Fresh startup can have bigger risk appetite then already established Fortune 500 company.

- Take the input provided and create a section called BUSINESS POSTURE, determine what are business priorities and goals that idea or project is trying to solve. Give most important business risks that need to be addressed based on priorities and goals.

- Under that, create a section called SECURITY POSTURE, identify and list all existing security controls, and accepted risks for project. Focus on secure software development lifecycle and deployment model. Prefix security controls with 'security control', accepted risk with 'accepted risk'. Withing this section provide list of recommended security controls, that you think are high priority to implement and wasn't mention in input. Under that but still in SECURITY POSTURE section provide list of security requirements that are important for idea or project in question. Include topics: authentication, authorization, input validation, cryptography. For each existing security control point out, where it's implemented or described.

- Under that, create a section called DESIGN. Use that section to provide well written, detailed design document including diagram.

- In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTEXT and provide mermaid graph that will represent a project context diagram showing project as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems/projects that it interacts with.

- Under that, in C4 CONTEXT subsection, create list that will describe elements of context diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTAINER and provide mermaid graph that will represent a container diagram. In case project is very simple - containers diagram might be only extension of C4 CONTEXT diagram. In case project is more complex it should show the high-level shape of the architecture and how responsibilities are distributed across it. It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate with one another.

- Under that, in C4 CONTAINER subsection, create list that will describe elements of container diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called DEPLOYMENT and provide information how project is deployed into target environment. Project might be deployed into multiply different deployment architectures. First list all possible solutions and pick one to descried in details. Include mermaid graph to visualize deployment. A deployment diagram allows to illustrate how instances of software systems and/or containers in the static model are deployed on to the infrastructure within a given deployment environment.

- Under that, in DEPLOYMENT subsection, create list that will describe elements of deployment diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called BUILD and provide information how project is build and publish. Focus on security controls of build process, e.g. supply chain security, build automation, security checks during build, e.g. SAST scanners, linters, etc. Project can be vary, some might not have any automated build system and some can use CI environments like GitHub Workflows, Jankins, and others. Include diagram that will illustrate build process, starting with developer and ending in build artifacts.

- Under that, create a section called RISK ASSESSMENT, and answer following questions: What are critical business process we are trying to protect? What data we are trying to protect and what is their sensitivity?

- Under that, create a section called QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS, list questions that you have and the default assumptions regarding BUSINESS POSTURE, SECURITY POSTURE and DESIGN.

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- Output in the format above only using valid Markdown. Use valid markdown syntax. Don't use markdown tables at all, use markdown lists instead. Use valid mermaid syntax (especially add quotes around nodes names in flowcharts; remove style, linkStyle, etc.).

- Do not use bold or italic formatting in the Markdown (no asterisks).

- Do not complain about anything, just do what you're told.

GITHUB REPOSITORY: https://github.com/rook/rook

# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide persistent, scalable, and reliable storage orchestration for cloud-native applications running on Kubernetes.
  - Simplify storage operations in Kubernetes environments by automating deployment, management, and monitoring of diverse storage solutions.
  - Enable hybrid and multi-cloud storage strategies by supporting various storage backends (e.g., Ceph, Cassandra, EdgeFS, NFS).
  - Offer a unified storage platform that abstracts away the complexities of underlying storage technologies.
  - Empower developers and platform engineers to easily consume and manage storage resources within Kubernetes.

- Business Risks:
  - Data loss or corruption due to storage misconfiguration, software bugs, or infrastructure failures, leading to business disruption and financial losses.
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored and managed by Rook, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Service unavailability due to operational issues, security incidents, or scalability limitations, impacting application uptime and business continuity.
  - Vendor lock-in to specific storage providers or Rook itself, limiting flexibility and increasing costs in the long term.
  - Complexity of managing a distributed storage system, requiring specialized expertise and potentially increasing operational overhead.
  - Security vulnerabilities in Rook software or its dependencies, exploitable by malicious actors to compromise storage infrastructure and applications.
  - Performance bottlenecks or unpredictable latency in storage operations, affecting application performance and user experience.
  - Compliance violations related to data residency, data encryption, or access control, leading to legal and reputational damage.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is used to control access to Rook API and Kubernetes resources. Implemented via Kubernetes API server and documented in Kubernetes documentation.
  - security control: Network Policies can be implemented to restrict network traffic between Rook components and other Kubernetes workloads. Implemented via Kubernetes NetworkPolicy API and documented in Kubernetes documentation.
  - security control: Encryption in transit using TLS for communication between Rook components and with external systems. Implemented within Rook codebase and configurable via Rook operator.
  - security control: Encryption at rest for data stored in the underlying storage backend (e.g., Ceph encryption, cloud provider encryption). Implemented by underlying storage providers and configured via Rook operator.
  - security control: Container image scanning for vulnerabilities during the build process. Implemented in CI/CD pipelines using tools like Trivy or Clair.
  - security control: Security audits and penetration testing are performed periodically to identify and address security weaknesses. Described in Rook security documentation and release notes.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Complexity of securing a distributed storage system increases the attack surface and requires careful configuration and monitoring.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the underlying Kubernetes platform and storage infrastructure.
  - accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration by users leading to security vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Zero-day vulnerabilities in Rook or its dependencies may exist until patches are available.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement a robust secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets encryption at rest) to protect sensitive credentials used by Rook.
  - security control: Regularly perform vulnerability scanning of Rook components and dependencies using automated tools.
  - security control: Implement security information and event management (SIEM) and logging for Rook components to detect and respond to security incidents.
  - security control: Enforce least privilege principles for Rook service accounts and user access.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews and static analysis security testing (SAST) during the development lifecycle.
  - security control: Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) in testing environments to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Establish a security incident response plan specific to Rook deployments.
  - security control: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to Kubernetes clusters and Rook management interfaces.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Rook components should authenticate each other using mutual TLS or other strong authentication mechanisms.
    - Requirement: Access to Rook API and management interfaces should be authenticated using Kubernetes RBAC and potentially external identity providers.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Rook should enforce fine-grained authorization policies to control access to storage resources based on user roles and application needs.
    - Requirement: Authorization decisions should be based on the principle of least privilege.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All inputs to Rook API and components should be validated to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Input validation should be performed on both the client and server sides.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest and in transit should be encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    - Requirement: Cryptographic keys should be securely managed and rotated regularly.
    - Requirement: Rook should support encryption key management solutions like KMS (Key Management Service).
