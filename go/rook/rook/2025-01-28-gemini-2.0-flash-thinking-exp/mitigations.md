# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rook/rook

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Rook Resources](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__for_rook_resources.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Rook Resources.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Rook CRDs and Resources:**  Pinpoint all Rook Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) like `CephCluster`, `CephObjectStore`, `CephFilesystem`, etc., and related Kubernetes resources managed by Rook operators (pods, services).
    2.  **Define Rook-Specific RBAC Roles:** Create Kubernetes RBAC Roles and ClusterRoles tailored to Rook operations. These roles should control access to Rook CRDs and resources. Examples:
        *   `rook-cluster-admin`: Full control over `CephCluster` CRDs.
        *   `rook-object-store-user`: Limited access to `CephObjectStoreUser` CRDs.
        *   `rook-monitor-viewer`: Read-only access to Rook monitoring resources.
    3.  **Bind Roles to Rook Operators and Users:**  Use RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings to assign these Rook-specific Roles to:
        *   The Rook operator service account itself (essential for Rook to function).
        *   Service accounts of applications that need to provision or consume Rook storage.
        *   User accounts of administrators managing Rook clusters.
    4.  **Apply to Rook Namespaces:** Ensure these RBAC configurations are applied in the Kubernetes namespaces where Rook operators and Rook-managed storage resources are deployed.
    5.  **Regularly Audit Rook RBAC:** Periodically review and audit the defined Rook RBAC roles and bindings to ensure they remain aligned with the principle of least privilege and project security requirements.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Rook Resource Management (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized modification or deletion of Rook storage clusters, object stores, file systems, leading to data loss or service disruption.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Rook (Medium Severity):** Limits the ability of compromised accounts to gain excessive control over the Rook storage infrastructure.
    *   **Accidental Rook Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unintended changes to Rook configurations by limiting who can make modifications.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduced risk related to unauthorized management and misconfiguration of Rook storage.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Kubernetes RBAC is generally enabled, but **specific Rook RBAC roles and bindings are likely missing**. Default Kubernetes roles are not Rook-aware.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Definition and deployment of Rook-specific RBAC Roles and RoleBindings. This requires creating roles that understand Rook CRDs and resources and applying them appropriately to Rook operators, application service accounts, and administrative users.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Network Policies to Isolate Rook Services](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_network_policies_to_isolate_rook_services.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Network Policies to Isolate Rook Services.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Rook Service Network Requirements:** Analyze the network communication patterns of Rook components (Operators, Ceph Monitors, OSDs, Object Gateways, etc.). Determine which services need to communicate with each other and with external entities (like applications).
    2.  **Default Deny in Rook Namespaces:** Implement a default deny Network Policy in the Kubernetes namespaces where Rook operators and Rook-managed storage services are running. This policy should block all ingress and egress traffic by default *within these namespaces*.
    3.  **Allow Rook Internal Communication:** Create Network Policies to explicitly allow necessary *internal* communication between Rook components within the Rook namespaces. For example, allow communication between Ceph Monitors and OSDs, between Rook operators and Ceph daemons.
    4.  **Allow Application Access to Rook Services:** Define Network Policies to permit *ingress* traffic to Rook storage services (e.g., Ceph Object Gateway, CephFS MDS) *only from authorized application namespaces*. Use namespace selectors and pod selectors to restrict access to specific applications.
    5.  **Restrict External Access to Rook Services:** Minimize or eliminate external access to Rook services from outside the Kubernetes cluster unless absolutely necessary. If external access is required (e.g., for monitoring), strictly control and secure it.
    6.  **Regularly Review Rook Network Policies:** Periodically review and update Network Policies to ensure they still accurately reflect Rook's network requirements and security best practices.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lateral Movement to Rook Infrastructure (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from easily moving from compromised application pods to Rook infrastructure components and gaining control of storage.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Rook Services (High Severity):** Limits access to Rook services from unauthorized pods or networks within the Kubernetes cluster.
    *   **Exposure of Rook Services to External Networks (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of Rook services being directly accessible and potentially exploited from external networks.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduced risk of lateral movement and unauthorized access to Rook storage infrastructure.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely **missing** or partially implemented. Default Kubernetes Network Policies might not be configured, and Rook-specific policies for isolating Rook components are likely not in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Creation and deployment of Network Policies specifically designed to isolate Rook services and control traffic flows to and from Rook components. This requires a detailed understanding of Rook's network architecture and application access patterns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Access to Rook Dashboard and Monitoring Interfaces](./mitigation_strategies/secure_access_to_rook_dashboard_and_monitoring_interfaces.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Access to Rook Dashboard and Monitoring Interfaces.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Default Rook Dashboard Exposure (If Possible):** If the Rook dashboard is not actively required for routine operations, consider disabling its default public exposure. Configure Rook to *not* create public services for the dashboard.
    2.  **Implement Authentication for Rook Dashboards:** If dashboards are needed, enforce strong authentication. Rook dashboards themselves might have built-in authentication options, or you can use external authentication mechanisms:
        *   **Rook Dashboard User Management:** Utilize Rook's built-in user management features (if available) to create dedicated user accounts with strong passwords.
        *   **Kubernetes Authentication Proxy for Rook Dashboard:** Deploy a Kubernetes authentication proxy (like kube-oidc-proxy) in front of the Rook dashboard service to authenticate users against Kubernetes authentication providers before granting access.
    3.  **RBAC for Rook Dashboard Access:** Integrate RBAC with dashboard access control. Ensure that users accessing the dashboard are granted only the necessary permissions based on their roles (e.g., read-only monitoring vs. administrative actions).
    4.  **HTTPS/TLS for Rook Dashboard:** Always expose Rook dashboards over HTTPS/TLS to encrypt communication and protect credentials in transit. Configure ingress controllers or service configurations to enforce HTTPS.
    5.  **Restrict Network Access to Rook Dashboard:** Use Network Policies to limit network access to the Rook dashboard service to only authorized networks or IP ranges.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Rook Management UI (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the Rook dashboard and potentially gaining insights into storage configurations or performing administrative actions.
    *   **Credential Theft for Rook Dashboard (Medium Severity):** Weak or unencrypted access to dashboards can lead to credential theft and subsequent unauthorized access.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Rook Dashboard (Medium Severity):** Unsecured dashboards can expose sensitive information about the storage infrastructure to unauthorized parties.
*   **Impact:** Moderately to Significantly Reduced risk of unauthorized access to Rook management interfaces.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially **missing** or weakly implemented. Default Rook deployments might expose dashboards with minimal or no strong authentication. HTTPS might be enabled, but robust authentication and authorization are likely not configured by default *within Rook itself*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Configuration of strong authentication and authorization for Rook dashboards. This might involve configuring Rook's built-in authentication, integrating with Kubernetes authentication proxies, and enforcing HTTPS access.  Disabling default public exposure if dashboards are not essential.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Encryption at Rest for Rook-Managed Storage](./mitigation_strategies/enable_encryption_at_rest_for_rook-managed_storage.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Encryption at Rest for Rook-Managed Storage.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Rook Cluster CRD for Encryption:** When deploying or modifying a Rook `CephCluster` CRD, explicitly enable encryption at rest in the specification. This typically involves setting parameters within the `storage` section of the CRD.
    2.  **Specify Encryption Method in Rook CRD:** Choose the desired encryption method supported by Rook and the underlying storage provider (e.g., LUKS for Ceph OSDs). Configure the `encryption` settings in the Rook `CephCluster` CRD to specify the encryption type.
    3.  **Provide Encryption Keys to Rook Securely:** Rook needs access to encryption keys. Use Kubernetes Secrets to securely provide these keys to the Rook operator.
        *   **Generate Keys:** Generate strong encryption keys outside of Kubernetes and store them securely.
        *   **Create Kubernetes Secrets:** Create Kubernetes Secrets in the Rook operator namespace containing the encryption keys.
        *   **Reference Secrets in Rook CRD:** Reference these Secrets in the `encryption` section of the Rook `CephCluster` CRD so Rook can use them to configure encryption.
    4.  **Verify Rook Encryption Configuration:** After deploying the Rook cluster with encryption enabled, verify that encryption at rest is indeed active on the underlying storage. Check Rook operator logs and Ceph OSD status to confirm encryption is configured.
    5.  **Key Rotation for Rook Encryption (If Supported):** If Rook and the underlying storage system support key rotation for encryption at rest, implement a key rotation policy and procedure.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breaches from Physical Storage Compromise (High Severity):** Protects data if physical storage media (disks, nodes) are stolen or improperly disposed of.
    *   **Data Breaches from Insider Threats with Physical Access (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data access by malicious insiders who might gain physical access to storage hardware.
    *   **Data Breaches from Storage System Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Adds a layer of defense even if the underlying storage system itself is compromised.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduced risk of data breaches related to physical storage compromise.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely **missing** or not consistently implemented. Encryption at rest in Rook requires explicit configuration in the `CephCluster` CRD and is not enabled by default.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Configuration of encryption at rest for all Rook-managed storage clusters by modifying the `CephCluster` CRDs. This includes choosing an encryption method, securely managing encryption keys using Kubernetes Secrets, and verifying the encryption setup.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Encryption in Transit for Rook Data Access](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_encryption_in_transit_for_rook_data_access.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Encryption in Transit for Rook Data Access.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Rook Services for TLS/SSL:** Configure Rook services that handle data access (e.g., Ceph Monitors, OSDs, Object Gateway, MDS for CephFS) to use TLS/SSL for communication. This typically involves:
        *   **Certificate Generation for Rook:** Generate TLS certificates for Rook components. You can use a Kubernetes Certificate Manager (like cert-manager) or manually generate certificates.
        *   **Secret Creation for Rook Certificates:** Create Kubernetes Secrets to store the TLS certificates and keys for Rook services.
        *   **Reference Certificates in Rook CRDs:** Configure the Rook `CephCluster`, `CephObjectStore`, `CephFilesystem` CRDs to reference these Secrets containing the TLS certificates. Rook operators will then configure the underlying Ceph daemons to use TLS.
    2.  **Enforce TLS for Application Connections:** Ensure applications connecting to Rook storage are configured to use TLS/SSL.
        *   **Object Storage (S3):** Applications should use HTTPS to connect to the Rook Object Gateway (S3 endpoint).
        *   **Block Storage (RBD):**  Configure RBD clients to use secure connections (if supported by the client and Rook configuration).
        *   **File Storage (CephFS):** Configure CephFS clients to use secure mounts (if supported and configured in Rook).
    3.  **Enforce TLS for Rook Internal Communication (Where Applicable):** Configure Rook to use TLS for internal communication between its components (e.g., between Ceph Monitors and OSDs) if supported and recommended by Rook documentation.
    4.  **Regular Certificate Rotation for Rook:** Implement a process for regular rotation and renewal of TLS certificates used by Rook services to maintain strong encryption and prevent certificate expiration.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Rook Data Traffic (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and eavesdropping on data transmitted between applications and Rook storage services.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping on Rook Network Traffic (High Severity):** Protects sensitive data from being intercepted and read during transmission within the Kubernetes cluster and between applications and Rook.
    *   **Data Tampering in Transit to/from Rook (Medium Severity):** TLS/SSL provides integrity checks, reducing the risk of data modification during transmission.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduced risk of data breaches and manipulation due to network eavesdropping and MitM attacks targeting Rook data traffic.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially **partially implemented** but needs explicit Rook configuration.  HTTPS for Object Gateway might be easier to enable, but TLS for other Rook services and internal communication requires more deliberate Rook configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Full enforcement of encryption in transit for all data access paths to Rook storage. This requires configuring TLS/SSL for all relevant Rook services through CRD configurations, ensuring applications are configured to use secure connections, and implementing certificate management for Rook.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Rook and Underlying Storage Components](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_rook_and_underlying_storage_components.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Rook and Underlying Storage Components.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Rook Release Notes and Security Advisories:** Subscribe to Rook project release notes, security mailing lists, and GitHub notifications to stay informed about new Rook versions, security patches, and vulnerability disclosures.
    2.  **Plan Rook Upgrades:** Establish a process for planning and executing Rook upgrades. This should include:
        *   **Testing Upgrades in a Staging Environment:** Always test Rook upgrades in a non-production staging environment that mirrors your production setup before applying them to production.
        *   **Following Rook Upgrade Procedures:** Carefully follow the official Rook upgrade documentation and procedures for your specific Rook version and underlying storage provider (e.g., Ceph).
        *   **Backups Before Upgrades:** Take backups of critical data and Rook configurations before initiating any Rook upgrade process.
    3.  **Automate Rook Upgrades (Where Possible and Safe):** Explore options for automating Rook upgrades to ensure timely patching. Kubernetes operators and tools like Argo CD or Flux can assist with automated upgrades, but careful testing and monitoring are still crucial.
    4.  **Update Underlying Storage Components:** Rook often relies on underlying storage systems like Ceph. Ensure that the underlying storage components managed by Rook (e.g., Ceph daemons) are also regularly updated with security patches and bug fixes, following the recommended update procedures for those systems.
    5.  **Vulnerability Scanning Post-Upgrade:** After each Rook upgrade, perform vulnerability scanning of the Rook operator and agent container images to ensure the upgrade has not introduced new vulnerabilities and to verify that known vulnerabilities have been addressed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Rook Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in Rook operators, agents, or underlying storage components that have been patched in newer versions.
    *   **Denial of Service due to Rook Bugs (Medium Severity):** Upgrades often include bug fixes that can improve Rook stability and reduce the risk of denial-of-service conditions caused by software defects.
    *   **Data Corruption due to Rook Bugs (Medium Severity):** Bug fixes in Rook and underlying storage components can address potential data corruption issues.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduced risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities and improved overall Rook stability and security posture.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely **partially implemented** or inconsistently applied.  Organizations may have general update processes, but specific procedures for Rook upgrades and monitoring Rook security advisories might be missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establishment of a formal process for monitoring Rook releases and security advisories, planning and testing Rook upgrades, and regularly applying updates to Rook operators, agents, and underlying storage components.  Automation of upgrades where feasible and safe.
