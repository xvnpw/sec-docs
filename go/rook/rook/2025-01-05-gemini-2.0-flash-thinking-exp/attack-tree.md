## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Application Data Stored in Rook](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_application_data_stored_in_rook.md)

**Exploit Rook API Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Exploit Kubernetes API Server Vulnerabilities Related to Rook:**
        * **Exploit RBAC Misconfigurations Allowing Unauthorized Access to Rook Resources:**
            * Weak Kubernetes RBAC policies for Rook CRDs: Attackers exploit overly permissive roles or bindings that grant unauthorized access to Rook's custom resources, allowing them to view, modify, or delete storage configurations or data.
            * Overly permissive ClusterRoles or RoleBindings affecting Rook: Similar to the above, but involving cluster-wide roles that inadvertently grant excessive permissions to interact with Rook resources.
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Rook Operator or Agents:**
        * Remote Code Execution in Rook Operator: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the Rook Operator's code or dependencies to execute arbitrary commands within the operator's container, potentially gaining full control over the Rook deployment.
        * Privilege Escalation within Rook Operator: Attackers exploit flaws to escalate their privileges within the Rook Operator, allowing them to perform actions they are not authorized for, such as accessing sensitive data or modifying configurations.
        * Exploiting insecure API endpoints exposed by Rook components:  If Rook components expose unsecured or poorly secured API endpoints, attackers can leverage these to interact with the Rook cluster without proper authorization.

**Compromise Underlying Ceph Storage:**
    * **Compromise Ceph OSD Nodes:**
        * Exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system of OSD nodes: Attackers target known vulnerabilities in the OS running on the OSD nodes to gain unauthorized access to the underlying storage.
        * Exploit misconfigurations in the network allowing direct access to OSD nodes: Network misconfigurations might expose OSD nodes directly to the network, allowing attackers to bypass Rook's control plane and interact with the storage directly.
    * **Compromise Ceph Monitor Nodes:**
        * Exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system of Monitor nodes: Similar to OSD nodes, attackers target OS vulnerabilities to compromise the Ceph Monitor nodes, potentially disrupting cluster quorum and availability.
        * Exploit misconfigurations in the network allowing direct access to Monitor nodes: Network misconfigurations might expose Monitor nodes, allowing attackers to interfere with cluster management and potentially cause denial of service.
    * **Exploit Ceph Authentication Mechanisms:**
        * **Obtain Ceph keyring credentials:**
            * Steal credentials from application configuration: Attackers find Ceph keyring credentials stored insecurely within the application's configuration files or environment variables.
            * Steal credentials from compromised Kubernetes Secrets: Attackers compromise Kubernetes Secrets where Ceph credentials are stored, gaining access to the keyring.
            * Exploit vulnerabilities in how Rook manages Ceph credentials: Attackers exploit flaws in Rook's credential management processes to obtain the necessary authentication keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Application Functionality by Manipulating Rook Storage](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_application_functionality_by_manipulating_rook_storage.md)

**Denial of Service (DoS):**
    * Exhaust Rook Resources:
        * Send excessive read/write requests to overwhelm the Ceph cluster: Attackers flood the Ceph cluster with a large volume of read or write requests, exceeding its capacity and causing performance degradation or unavailability.
        * Fill up storage capacity, preventing the application from writing data: Attackers write large amounts of data to the Ceph cluster, filling up the available storage and preventing the application from storing new data.
    * **Disrupt Rook Control Plane:**
        * Overload the Rook Operator with malicious requests: Attackers send a high volume of invalid or malicious requests to the Rook Operator, overwhelming it and potentially causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
        * Exploit vulnerabilities in Rook agents causing them to crash: Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in Rook agents running on the nodes, causing them to crash and disrupting the management of the Ceph cluster.
    * **Disrupt Underlying Ceph Cluster:**
        * Target Ceph Monitor nodes to disrupt cluster quorum: Attackers target the Ceph Monitor nodes with DoS attacks or exploit vulnerabilities to disrupt the cluster's quorum, leading to instability and potential data unavailability.
        * Target Ceph OSD nodes to cause data unavailability: Attackers target the Ceph OSD nodes, making them unavailable and leading to data unavailability or data loss depending on the replication configuration.
