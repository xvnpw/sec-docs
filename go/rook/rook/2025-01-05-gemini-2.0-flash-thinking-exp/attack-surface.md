# Attack Surface Analysis for rook/rook

## Attack Surface: [Rook Operator Pod Compromise](./attack_surfaces/rook_operator_pod_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a running Rook operator pod within the Kubernetes cluster.
    *   **How Rook Contributes:** Rook operators manage the entire lifecycle of the storage cluster. Their compromise grants extensive control over storage resources, which is a direct function of Rook.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the operator's container image or gains access through compromised Kubernetes credentials, allowing them to execute commands within the operator pod, directly impacting Rook's operations.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical. Full control over the storage cluster, including data manipulation, deletion, and potential disruption of the entire storage infrastructure managed by Rook. Could lead to data loss, corruption, and denial of service for applications relying on the storage provided by Rook.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Rook operator images to patch known vulnerabilities specific to Rook.
        *   Implement strong Kubernetes RBAC policies to restrict access to operator pods and their associated service accounts, focusing on permissions related to Rook resources.
        *   Employ network policies to limit network access to and from operator pods, specifically targeting communication related to Rook's functions.
        *   Utilize container security scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in Rook operator images before deployment.
        *   Implement runtime security monitoring to detect and prevent malicious activities within Rook operator pods.

## Attack Surface: [Rook Agent Pod Compromise](./attack_surfaces/rook_agent_pod_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a running Rook agent pod on a storage node.
    *   **How Rook Contributes:** Rook agents are responsible for interacting directly with the underlying storage daemons (e.g., Ceph OSDs) on behalf of Rook. Their compromise allows for direct manipulation of data managed by Rook on that specific node.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the agent's container image or gains access through compromised node credentials, allowing them to directly access and modify data on the local storage devices managed by Rook.
    *   **Impact:** High. Data on the compromised storage node managed by Rook is at risk of being accessed, modified, or deleted. Could lead to data inconsistencies and potential service disruption if the compromised node holds critical data managed by Rook.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Rook agent images to patch known vulnerabilities specific to Rook.
        *   Implement strong Kubernetes RBAC policies to restrict access to agent pods and their associated service accounts, focusing on permissions related to Rook's data plane operations.
        *   Employ network policies to limit network access to and from agent pods, specifically targeting communication related to Rook's storage management.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Rook Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_rook_custom_resource_definitions__crds_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient Kubernetes permissions manipulates Rook CRDs to perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **How Rook Contributes:** Rook uses CRDs as the primary interface for defining and managing storage resources. Maliciously crafted CRD objects are interpreted and acted upon directly by the Rook operators.
    *   **Example:** An attacker creates a malicious `CephBlockPool` CRD with overly permissive settings or attempts to modify existing Rook CRDs in a way that compromises the storage cluster's security or stability, directly impacting Rook's managed resources.
    *   **Impact:** High. Depending on the manipulated Rook CRD, this could lead to unauthorized resource creation, deletion, or modification within Rook's storage domain, potentially causing data loss, service disruption, or security breaches within the Rook-managed storage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict Kubernetes RBAC policies to control who can create, read, update, and delete Rook CRDs.
        *   Utilize Kubernetes admission controllers specifically configured to validate Rook CRD objects and prevent the creation of malicious configurations.
        *   Regularly review and audit Rook CRD configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration of Underlying Storage (e.g., Ceph) via Rook](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_of_underlying_storage__e_g___ceph__via_rook.md)

*   **Description:** Rook, while orchestrating the storage, might introduce insecure configurations to the underlying storage backend.
    *   **How Rook Contributes:** Rook's configuration settings and defaults for the underlying storage (e.g., Ceph) are directly managed by Rook and can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly hardened by Rook's configuration mechanisms.
    *   **Example:** Rook might configure Ceph with default, weak authentication credentials or with overly permissive access controls through its configuration mechanisms, making the underlying storage vulnerable if an attacker gains access to those credentials exposed or managed by Rook.
    *   **Impact:** High. If the underlying storage configured by Rook is compromised, all data managed by it via Rook is at risk.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow security best practices for configuring the underlying storage backend (e.g., Ceph) as recommended by Rook's documentation.
        *   Review Rook's configuration settings for the underlying storage and ensure they align with security best practices specifically for Rook deployments.
        *   Change default credentials for the underlying storage immediately after deployment, following Rook's recommended procedures.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the underlying storage as configured and managed by Rook.

## Attack Surface: [Leaked or Compromised Rook Service Account Credentials](./attack_surfaces/leaked_or_compromised_rook_service_account_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Credentials for Kubernetes service accounts used by Rook components are leaked or compromised.
    *   **How Rook Contributes:** Rook relies on Kubernetes service accounts with specific permissions to manage storage resources. Compromising these credentials grants an attacker the same privileges as the Rook components, allowing direct interaction with Rook's functionalities.
    *   **Example:** A Rook service account token is accidentally committed to a public repository or is exposed through a container vulnerability within a Rook component. An attacker uses this token to interact with the Kubernetes API and manipulate Rook resources.
    *   **Impact:** High. Depending on the permissions granted to the compromised Rook service account, an attacker could gain significant control over the storage cluster managed by Rook.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust secret management practices to securely store and manage service account tokens used by Rook.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to Rook service accounts.
        *   Regularly rotate service account credentials used by Rook components.
        *   Utilize Kubernetes features like workload identity where applicable to minimize reliance on static credentials for Rook components.
