# Threat Model Analysis for rook/rook

## Threat: [Data Tampering via Compromised Rook Operator](./threats/data_tampering_via_compromised_rook_operator.md)

**Threat:** Data Tampering via Compromised Rook Operator
    * **Description:** An attacker compromises the Rook Operator's pod or service account. This allows them to manipulate the Ceph cluster through Rook's custom resource definitions (CRDs) and reconciliation loops. They could alter storage pool configurations, modify access permissions, or even initiate data deletion.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, unauthorized access to data, denial of service by disrupting storage operations.
    * **Affected Rook Component:** Rook Operator (core logic for managing Ceph).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong Kubernetes RBAC to restrict access to the Rook Operator's resources and service account.
        * Follow security best practices for container image management and ensure the Rook Operator image is from a trusted source.
        * Regularly audit the permissions granted to the Rook Operator's service account.
        * Implement admission controllers to validate changes to Rook CRDs.
        * Consider using a security scanner to identify vulnerabilities in the Rook Operator's container image.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Data via Misconfigured Ceph Pool Permissions](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_data_via_misconfigured_ceph_pool_permissions.md)

**Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Data via Misconfigured Ceph Pool Permissions
    * **Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigurations in Ceph pool permissions *managed by Rook*. This could allow unauthorized applications or users within the Kubernetes cluster to access data stored in Ceph pools they shouldn't have access to. This might involve manipulating Ceph user capabilities through Rook's interfaces.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, unauthorized data access, potential data exfiltration.
    * **Affected Rook Component:** Rook Operator (managing Ceph user and pool configurations).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully define and manage Ceph user capabilities and pool permissions using Rook's interfaces.
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for applications accessing Ceph storage.
        * Regularly review and audit Ceph pool permissions and user capabilities.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to storage resources.

## Threat: [Compromise of Rook Agent on a Kubernetes Node](./threats/compromise_of_rook_agent_on_a_kubernetes_node.md)

**Threat:** Compromise of Rook Agent on a Kubernetes Node
    * **Description:** An attacker compromises a Kubernetes node running a Rook agent. This agent has access to secrets and credentials necessary to interact with the Ceph cluster *through Rook*. A compromised agent could be used to perform unauthorized actions on the storage, potentially bypassing higher-level controls.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, unauthorized access, potential for lateral movement within the storage infrastructure.
    * **Affected Rook Component:** Rook Agent (running on Kubernetes nodes).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Harden Kubernetes nodes and implement strong security controls.
        * Regularly patch and update the operating system and software running on the nodes.
        * Implement node isolation and network segmentation.
        * Monitor node activity for suspicious behavior.
        * Securely manage the credentials used by the Rook agent.
