## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Disrupt Application Functionality by Manipulating Rook Storage

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "Disrupt Application Functionality by Manipulating Rook Storage," focusing on the potential threats, their mechanisms, impact, and mitigation strategies within an application utilizing Rook for storage management on Kubernetes.

**Overall Goal:** The attacker aims to disrupt the normal functioning of the application by compromising the underlying storage provided by Rook. This can lead to various forms of disruption, including data unavailability, data corruption, and complete application failure.

**Attack Vector:** The attacker leverages the complexities of the Rook and Ceph architecture to target specific components and functionalities.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Tree Path:**

**1. Denial of Service (DoS):**

This is the primary tactic employed to disrupt application functionality by making the storage unavailable or severely degraded.

**    1.1. Exhaust Rook Resources:**

        **1.1.1. Send excessive read/write requests to overwhelm the Ceph cluster:**

            * **Mechanism:** The attacker floods the Ceph cluster with a massive number of read or write requests. This can be achieved by compromising application clients, leveraging botnets, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's interaction with the storage.
            * **Target:** Ceph OSDs (Object Storage Daemons) are the primary target, as they handle the actual data storage and retrieval. Monitors and MDS (Metadata Server, if used) can also be indirectly affected by the increased load.
            * **Impact:**
                * **High Latency:**  The Ceph cluster becomes overloaded, leading to significant delays in processing requests. This directly impacts the application's ability to read and write data, causing timeouts and errors.
                * **Resource Exhaustion:** OSDs may run out of CPU, memory, or disk I/O resources, potentially leading to crashes or becoming unresponsive.
                * **Network Congestion:** Excessive traffic can saturate the network, further hindering communication within the Ceph cluster and between the application and the storage.
                * **Application Unavailability:** If the application relies heavily on the storage, the inability to access data will render it unusable.
            * **Prerequisites:**
                * Ability to generate a large volume of requests.
                * Knowledge of the application's storage access patterns or the ability to brute-force access.
                * Potentially compromised application credentials or vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized access.
            * **Detection:**
                * **Monitoring Ceph Performance Metrics:** High CPU utilization, disk I/O wait times, and request latency on OSDs and Monitors.
                * **Network Monitoring:** Spike in network traffic to and from Ceph nodes.
                * **Application Logs:** Increased error rates related to storage access.
                * **Rook Operator Logs:** Potential warnings or errors related to Ceph cluster performance.
            * **Mitigation:**
                * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on application access to the storage.
                * **Resource Quotas and Limits:** Configure resource quotas and limits within Ceph to prevent individual clients from consuming excessive resources.
                * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Ceph network to limit external access.
                * **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Deploy IDPS to detect and block malicious traffic patterns.
                * **Regular Performance Testing and Capacity Planning:** Ensure the Ceph cluster is adequately sized to handle expected workloads and potential spikes.
                * **Application Security Best Practices:** Secure the application to prevent it from being a source of malicious requests.

        **1.1.2. Fill up storage capacity, preventing the application from writing data:**

            * **Mechanism:** The attacker writes a large amount of data to the Ceph cluster, consuming all available storage space. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's write functionality or by gaining unauthorized access to the storage system.
            * **Target:** Ceph OSDs are the direct target, as they hold the persistent data.
            * **Impact:**
                * **Application Write Failures:** The application will be unable to write new data, leading to errors and potential data loss if critical operations are interrupted.
                * **Service Disruption:** Applications that rely on continuous data writing will experience significant disruptions.
                * **Data Inconsistency:** If some writes succeed while others fail, the application's data can become inconsistent.
            * **Prerequisites:**
                * Ability to write data to the Ceph cluster.
                * Potentially compromised application credentials or vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized write access.
            * **Detection:**
                * **Monitoring Ceph Storage Utilization:**  Track the available storage space on the Ceph cluster. Alerts should be triggered when utilization reaches critical thresholds.
                * **Application Logs:** Errors related to failed write operations due to insufficient storage.
                * **Rook Operator Logs:** Potential warnings or errors related to low storage space.
            * **Mitigation:**
                * **Storage Quotas:** Implement storage quotas for individual users or applications to prevent a single entity from consuming all the space.
                * **Monitoring and Alerting:** Proactively monitor storage utilization and set up alerts for low space conditions.
                * **Regular Capacity Planning:** Ensure sufficient storage capacity is available for current and future needs.
                * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** If the attack originates through the application, implement robust input validation to prevent malicious data injection.

        **1.2.1. Overload the Rook Operator with malicious requests:**

            * **Mechanism:** The attacker sends a high volume of invalid or malicious requests to the Rook Operator. This could involve manipulating API calls, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Operator's API, or simply flooding it with requests.
            * **Target:** The Rook Operator, responsible for managing and orchestrating the Ceph cluster.
            * **Impact:**
                * **Operator Unresponsiveness:** The Operator may become overloaded and unresponsive, hindering its ability to manage the Ceph cluster.
                * **Ceph Cluster Instability:**  If the Operator is unable to function, it can lead to issues with scaling, healing, and other management operations within the Ceph cluster.
                * **Application Disruption:**  Indirectly, this can lead to application disruption if the Ceph cluster becomes unstable or requires manual intervention.

**    1.3. Disrupt Underlying Ceph Cluster:**

        **1.3.1. Target Ceph Monitor nodes to disrupt cluster quorum:**

            * **Mechanism:** The attacker targets the Ceph Monitor nodes with DoS attacks (e.g., network flooding, resource exhaustion) or exploits vulnerabilities in the Monitor daemons.
            * **Target:** Ceph Monitor nodes, which maintain the cluster map and quorum.
            * **Impact:**
                * **Loss of Quorum:** If a sufficient number of Monitors become unavailable, the Ceph cluster loses quorum and becomes unable to process read/write requests or make configuration changes.
                * **Data Unavailability:**  The application will be unable to access its data.
                * **Cluster Stagnation:** The cluster will be unable to heal or recover from failures.
