Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Filebrowser - High-Risk Sub-Tree

Attacker's Goal: Gain unauthorized control or access to the application's resources or data by leveraging weaknesses in the Filebrowser component.

High-Risk Sub-Tree:

└── Compromise Application via Filebrowser [CRITICAL NODE]
    ├── Gain Unauthorized Access to Files Managed by Filebrowser [HIGH RISK PATH]
    │   ├── Exploit Authentication Bypass in Filebrowser [CRITICAL NODE]
    │   │   └── Leverage Default Credentials (if any) [HIGH RISK PATH]
    │   └── Exploit Authorization Bypass in Filebrowser [CRITICAL NODE]
    │       └── Access files/directories outside authorized scope (Path Traversal) [HIGH RISK PATH]
    ├── Modify Files Managed by Filebrowser [HIGH RISK PATH]
    │   ├── Exploit Write Access Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]
    │   │   └── Overwrite existing files with malicious content [HIGH RISK PATH]
    │   ├── Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]
    │   │   └── Upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, executables) [HIGH RISK PATH]
    │   │       └── Bypass file type restrictions [HIGH RISK PATH]
    │   │   └── Overwrite critical application files if Filebrowser has access [HIGH RISK PATH]
    ├── Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
    │   ├── Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities leading to Code Execution [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
    │   │   └── Upload and execute a web shell [HIGH RISK PATH]
    └── Leverage Misconfigurations in Filebrowser Deployment [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
        ├── Weak or Default Configuration Settings [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
        │   └── Use default admin credentials (if any) [HIGH RISK PATH]
        │   └── Exploit insecure default permissions [HIGH RISK PATH]
        ├── Insecure Deployment Environment [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* **Compromise Application via Filebrowser [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This is the ultimate goal and represents any successful exploitation of Filebrowser to compromise the application.

* **Gain Unauthorized Access to Files Managed by Filebrowser [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Exploit Authentication Bypass in Filebrowser [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Leverage Default Credentials (if any) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * Attack Vector: Attacker attempts to log in using commonly known default usernames and passwords for Filebrowser.
    * **Exploit Authorization Bypass in Filebrowser [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Access files/directories outside authorized scope (Path Traversal) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * Attack Vector: Attacker manipulates file paths in requests (e.g., using "../") to access files or directories they shouldn't have access to.

* **Modify Files Managed by Filebrowser [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Exploit Write Access Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Overwrite existing files with malicious content [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * Attack Vector: Attacker exploits vulnerabilities allowing them to overwrite existing files with malicious code, scripts, or data.
    * **Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, executables) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * Attack Vector: Attacker uploads files containing malicious code (e.g., PHP web shells, compiled executables) that can be executed on the server.
                * **Bypass file type restrictions [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                    * Attack Vector: Attacker uses techniques like changing file extensions, using null bytes, or exploiting MIME type inconsistencies to bypass file type validation mechanisms.
        * **Overwrite critical application files if Filebrowser has access [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * Attack Vector: Attacker uploads files with the same names as critical application files, overwriting them and potentially disrupting or compromising the application.

* **Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities leading to Code Execution [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Upload and execute a web shell [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * Attack Vector: Attacker uploads a script (e.g., PHP, Python) that allows them to execute arbitrary commands on the server remotely through a web interface.

* **Leverage Misconfigurations in Filebrowser Deployment [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Weak or Default Configuration Settings [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Use default admin credentials (if any) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * Attack Vector: Attacker uses default administrative credentials to gain full control over Filebrowser.
        * **Exploit insecure default permissions [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * Attack Vector: Default permissions allow unauthorized access or modification of files and directories managed by Filebrowser.
    * **Insecure Deployment Environment [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Filebrowser running with excessive privileges [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * Attack Vector: Filebrowser is configured to run with higher privileges than necessary, allowing attackers to perform actions beyond the intended scope if a vulnerability is exploited.
        * **Filebrowser exposed directly to the internet without proper security measures [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * Attack Vector: Filebrowser is directly accessible from the internet without proper authentication, authorization, or network security controls, significantly increasing the attack surface and ease of exploitation.
