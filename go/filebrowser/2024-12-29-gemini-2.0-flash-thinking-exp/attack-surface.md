Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Filebrowser (High and Critical severity only):

*   **Path Traversal Vulnerability**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate file paths in requests to access files and directories outside the intended scope.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser's core functionality involves handling user-provided file paths for operations like download, preview, and edit. Insufficient validation within Filebrowser allows "../" sequences or absolute paths to bypass intended directory restrictions.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a download request like `/download?file=../../../../etc/passwd` through Filebrowser to attempt to download the server's password file.
    *   **Impact:** Reading sensitive system files, accessing application configuration files managed by Filebrowser, or potentially writing to arbitrary locations if Filebrowser's write operations are also vulnerable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Within Filebrowser's codebase, implement strict input validation and sanitization for all file path parameters. Use canonicalization techniques to resolve symbolic links and relative paths within Filebrowser. Employ whitelisting of allowed directories within Filebrowser's access scope. Avoid directly using user input in Filebrowser's file system operations.

*   **Arbitrary File Upload**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker can upload malicious files to the server through Filebrowser.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser provides the direct functionality for users to upload files. Lack of restrictions on file types or insufficient checks on file content within Filebrowser allows attackers to upload executable files or other malicious content.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses Filebrowser's upload feature to upload a PHP web shell disguised as an image file. If the underlying web server is configured to execute PHP files in Filebrowser's upload directory, the attacker can gain remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting Filebrowser, defacement of the website served by the same server, data exfiltration from the server, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Within Filebrowser, implement strict file type validation based on content (magic numbers) rather than just file extensions. Sanitize filenames within Filebrowser to prevent injection attacks. Consider integrating antivirus scanning into Filebrowser's upload process.

*   **Authentication Bypass or Weaknesses**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can bypass Filebrowser's authentication mechanisms or exploit weak password policies to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser directly manages user authentication and session management. Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser's authentication logic or weak default settings can lead to unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** Exploiting a vulnerability in Filebrowser's login logic that allows bypassing the password check, or successfully brute-forcing weak default credentials configured within Filebrowser.
    *   **Impact:** Full access to the file system managed by Filebrowser, including the ability to read, modify, and delete files through Filebrowser's interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Within Filebrowser, enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity). Implement account lockout mechanisms within Filebrowser after multiple failed login attempts. Use secure session management techniques (e.g., HTTPOnly and Secure flags for cookies) within Filebrowser. Implement multi-factor authentication within Filebrowser. Regularly audit Filebrowser's authentication code for vulnerabilities. Avoid default credentials in Filebrowser and force users to change them upon initial setup.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Filenames or File Content**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages generated by Filebrowser and viewed by other users.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser displays filenames and potentially previews file content. If Filebrowser does not properly sanitize these outputs, malicious JavaScript embedded in filenames or file content can be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they interact with Filebrowser.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a file with a malicious JavaScript payload in its name using Filebrowser. When another user views the file list in Filebrowser, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies or performing actions on their behalf within the Filebrowser application.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking within Filebrowser, cookie theft related to the Filebrowser domain, redirection to malicious websites from within Filebrowser, defacement of the Filebrowser interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement proper output encoding and sanitization within Filebrowser for all user-generated content displayed in its web interface, including filenames and file previews. Use context-aware encoding within Filebrowser. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources within the context of the Filebrowser application.

*   **Insecure Configuration and Exposure of Sensitive Information**
    *   **Description:**  Sensitive configuration details of Filebrowser are exposed, or insecure default configurations are used within Filebrowser.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser uses configuration files to store settings. If these files are accessible through the web interface due to Filebrowser's configuration or contain sensitive information in plaintext within Filebrowser's configuration, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:**  A misconfiguration in the web server hosting Filebrowser allows direct access to Filebrowser's configuration file, revealing database credentials or API keys used by Filebrowser.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive credentials used by Filebrowser, potentially leading to further compromise of the application or related systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Store sensitive configuration data securely within Filebrowser, potentially using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions. Avoid storing sensitive information in plaintext in Filebrowser's configuration files. Ensure Filebrowser's configuration files are not accessible through the web interface by default.

*   **Command Injection (If Command Execution is Enabled)**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the server through Filebrowser's command execution feature.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** If Filebrowser offers functionality to execute commands (even with restrictions), improper input sanitization within Filebrowser can allow attackers to inject malicious commands.
    *   **Example:**  A feature within Filebrowser to rename files uses user input directly in a system command. An attacker provides a filename like `; rm -rf /` through Filebrowser, potentially deleting critical system files.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the server hosting Filebrowser, data deletion on the server, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid using system calls based on user input within Filebrowser whenever possible. If necessary within Filebrowser, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization. Use parameterized commands or safe API alternatives within Filebrowser. Consider running commands initiated by Filebrowser in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
