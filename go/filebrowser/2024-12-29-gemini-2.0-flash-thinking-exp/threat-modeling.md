Here is the updated threat list, including only high and critical threats that directly involve the `filebrowser` application:

- **Threat:** User Impersonation via Weak Authentication
  - **Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in using default credentials or easily guessable passwords specific to the `filebrowser` instance. They might also use brute-force techniques targeting the `filebrowser` login mechanism. Upon successful login, they can impersonate a legitimate user within `filebrowser`.
  - **Impact:** Full access to the compromised user's files and directories managed by `filebrowser`, potential data breaches within the scope of `filebrowser`, unauthorized modifications or deletions of files managed by `filebrowser`.
  - **Affected Component:** Authentication Module
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Enforce strong password policies specifically for `filebrowser` users.
    - Disable or change default credentials for `filebrowser` immediately upon setup.
    - Implement account lockout mechanisms within `filebrowser` after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    - Consider integrating `filebrowser` with a more robust authentication system if available.

- **Threat:** Session Hijacking
  - **Description:** An attacker could intercept or steal a valid user's session ID specifically for `filebrowser`. This could occur if HTTPS is not enforced for `filebrowser` or if there are vulnerabilities in `filebrowser`'s session management. With the session ID, they can impersonate the user within `filebrowser` without needing their credentials.
  - **Impact:** Full access to the compromised user's files and directories managed by `filebrowser` for the duration of the hijacked session, potential data breaches within the scope of `filebrowser`, unauthorized modifications or deletions of files managed by `filebrowser`.
  - **Affected Component:** Session Management
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Enforce HTTPS for all communication with the `filebrowser` instance.
    - Ensure `filebrowser` uses the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies.
    - Regularly regenerate session IDs within `filebrowser`.
    - Implement proper session timeout mechanisms within `filebrowser`.

- **Threat:** Unauthorized File Access due to Misconfigured Permissions
  - **Description:** Incorrectly configured user or group permissions within `filebrowser` directly allow users to access files and directories managed by `filebrowser` that they should not have access to. This is a configuration issue within the `filebrowser` application itself.
  - **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information managed by `filebrowser` to unauthorized users, potential data breaches within the scope of `filebrowser`, and unauthorized modifications or deletions of files within `filebrowser`.
  - **Affected Component:** Access Control Module
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring user and group permissions within `filebrowser`.
    - Regularly review and audit access control settings within `filebrowser`.
    - Ensure default permissions in `filebrowser` are restrictive.

- **Threat:** Malicious File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution
  - **Description:** An attacker with upload privileges in `filebrowser` could upload a malicious file. If `filebrowser` or the underlying system is not properly configured, this file could be executed, leading to remote code execution on the server hosting `filebrowser`. This is a direct consequence of how `filebrowser` handles uploaded files.
  - **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server hosting `filebrowser`, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, steal data, or disrupt services.
  - **Affected Component:** Upload Functionality
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Ensure the directory where `filebrowser` stores uploaded files does not allow direct execution of scripts by the web server.
    - Implement robust file type validation and sanitization within `filebrowser` on upload.
    - Consider using a separate, isolated storage location for files uploaded through `filebrowser`.
    - Regularly scan files uploaded through `filebrowser` for malware.

- **Threat:** Path Traversal via File Operations
  - **Description:** An attacker could manipulate file paths provided to `filebrowser` (e.g., in download, rename, or delete requests) to access or modify files outside the directories intended to be managed by `filebrowser`. This exploits vulnerabilities in how `filebrowser` handles file paths.
  - **Impact:** Access to sensitive files and directories on the server outside the intended scope of `filebrowser`, potential data breaches, and unauthorized modifications or deletions of critical system files.
  - **Affected Component:** File Handling Functions (e.g., download, rename, delete)
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all file paths within `filebrowser`.
    - Ensure `filebrowser` uses absolute paths internally and avoids relying on user-provided relative paths.

- **Threat:** Configuration Tampering
  - **Description:** If the `filebrowser` configuration file is accessible or modifiable by unauthorized users (due to incorrect file permissions on the server or vulnerabilities in how `filebrowser` stores its configuration), an attacker could change settings to grant themselves more privileges within `filebrowser`, disable security features of `filebrowser`, or redirect access.
  - **Impact:** Complete compromise of the `filebrowser` instance, potentially leading to unauthorized access to all files managed by `filebrowser`, data breaches within the scope of `filebrowser`, and further system compromise.
  - **Affected Component:** Configuration Loading/Saving Mechanism
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Ensure the `filebrowser` configuration file has restrictive permissions, accessible only to the `filebrowser` process and authorized administrators on the server.
    - Consider encrypting sensitive information within the `filebrowser` configuration file.
    - Implement integrity checks for the `filebrowser` configuration file.

- **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Publicly Accessible Directories
  - **Description:** If `filebrowser` is configured to allow public access to certain directories, sensitive files within those directories managed by `filebrowser` could be unintentionally exposed if not properly managed within `filebrowser`'s public access settings.
  - **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of confidential information managed by `filebrowser` to the public.
  - **Affected Component:** Access Control Configuration, Public Access Feature
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully review and restrict public access to only necessary directories within `filebrowser`.
    - Ensure sensitive files are not placed in directories configured for public access within `filebrowser`.
    - Implement authentication even for publicly accessible areas within `filebrowser` if possible.

- **Threat:** Command Injection (If Enabled)
  - **Description:** If `filebrowser` has features that allow execution of system commands (directly or indirectly through file operations), vulnerabilities in input sanitization within `filebrowser` could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed on the server with the privileges of the `filebrowser` process. This is a direct vulnerability within `filebrowser`'s code.
  - **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server hosting `filebrowser`, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, steal data, or disrupt services.
  - **Affected Component:** Command Execution Functionality (if present)
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid or disable any features within `filebrowser` that allow command execution if not absolutely necessary.
    - If command execution is required by `filebrowser`, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization within `filebrowser`, and use safe command execution methods that avoid shell interpretation.
    - Run the `filebrowser` process with the least necessary privileges on the server.
