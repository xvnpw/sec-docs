# Project Design Document: Filebrowser for Threat Modeling (Improved)

**Project Name:** Filebrowser

**Project Repository:** [https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser)

**Document Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2023-10-27
**Author:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced and more detailed design overview of the Filebrowser project, an open-source web-based file manager, specifically tailored for threat modeling activities. Building upon the initial design, this version further elaborates on system components, data flow, security mechanisms, deployment scenarios, and potential vulnerabilities. The goal is to create a comprehensive resource that facilitates a thorough threat modeling exercise to identify and mitigate security risks associated with Filebrowser.

## 2. Project Overview

Filebrowser is a lightweight, self-hosted web file manager that offers a user-friendly interface for accessing and managing files on a server. It supports a wide range of file operations, including browsing, uploading, downloading, renaming, deleting, archiving, and sharing files and directories. Designed for ease of use and deployment, Filebrowser is configurable to work with various storage backends and authentication providers. Its primary purpose is to provide convenient web-based file access, particularly in scenarios where command-line interfaces are less practical or accessible.

## 3. System Architecture

Filebrowser adopts a classic client-server architecture. The key components interacting within this architecture are:

*   **User Interface (Web Browser):** The front-end client, typically a web browser, through which users interact with Filebrowser.
*   **Web Server (Filebrowser Application):** The core backend application, developed in Go, responsible for handling all business logic, HTTP requests, authentication, authorization, file operations, and communication with the storage backend.
*   **Storage Backend:** The persistent storage layer where files are physically stored. This can be a local file system, network storage, or cloud object storage.

*   **Constraint:** Security features and configurations are version-dependent. This document is a general representation and might not cover all version-specific security aspects. Refer to the official Filebrowser documentation for version-specific details.
*   **Constraint:** Threat modeling based on this document should consider the specific deployment environment and configuration of Filebrowser.

## 9. Conclusion (Enhanced)

This improved design document provides a more detailed and security-focused overview of the Filebrowser project. By elaborating on each component, data flow, deployment scenario, and technology stack, it aims to be a more effective resource for threat modeling. This document highlights critical security considerations for each module and interaction point, enabling security professionals to conduct a more comprehensive threat analysis. Using this document as a foundation, a thorough threat modeling exercise can identify potential vulnerabilities, assess their risks, and guide the implementation of appropriate security controls to protect Filebrowser deployments effectively. The next step is to utilize this document to perform structured threat modeling, such as using STRIDE or PASTA methodologies, to systematically identify and analyze potential threats.
