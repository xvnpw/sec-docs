# Attack Surface Analysis for filebrowser/filebrowser

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default usernames and passwords for administrative accounts.
*   **Filebrowser Contribution:** Filebrowser often defaults to `admin`:`admin` credentials upon initial setup. If these are not changed, it provides immediate, easy access for attackers.
*   **Example:** An attacker scans for publicly accessible Filebrowser instances. They attempt to log in using `admin` as both username and password and successfully gain administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Filebrowser instance, including access to all files, user data, and potentially the underlying server if further exploits are possible.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately change the default administrator password upon initial setup.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for all users.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Upload](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:** Allowing users to upload files without proper validation of file type, size, or content.
*   **Filebrowser Contribution:** Filebrowser's core functionality is file management, including uploads. If upload features are not secured, it becomes a prime target for malicious uploads.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a web shell (e.g., a PHP script) disguised as an image file. They then access this web shell through the browser, gaining command execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) and not just file extensions.
    *   Limit file upload size to reasonable values.
    *   Scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus or sandboxing solutions.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the web root to prevent direct execution.
    *   Use a dedicated upload directory with restricted execution permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting flaws in file path handling to access files or directories outside of the intended scope.
*   **Filebrowser Contribution:** Filebrowser manipulates file paths for browsing, uploading, and downloading. Vulnerabilities in these operations can lead to path traversal.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL or upload request containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`) to read sensitive system files or write files to arbitrary locations.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive files), unauthorized file modification or deletion, and potentially remote code execution if combined with file upload vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate all user-supplied file paths to prevent traversal sequences.
    *   Use secure file path handling functions provided by the programming language or framework.
    *   Implement chroot jails or similar mechanisms to restrict file system access.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Filebrowser Contribution:** Filebrowser's web interface might be vulnerable to XSS if user-supplied data (e.g., file names, directory names, metadata) is not properly sanitized before being displayed.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a file with a filename containing a malicious JavaScript payload. When another user browses the directory containing this file, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or redirecting them to a malicious site.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account compromise, defacement of the web interface, and potential redirection to phishing or malware sites.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement proper output encoding for all user-supplied data displayed in the web interface.
    *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of scripts and other resources.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Default settings that are not secure and increase the attack surface.
*   **Filebrowser Contribution:** Filebrowser might have default configurations that enable unnecessary features, use weak security settings, or expose sensitive information.
*   **Example:** Filebrowser is deployed with default settings that allow public access without authentication, or with debugging features enabled in a production environment.
*   **Impact:** Unintended access to files, information disclosure, and increased vulnerability to other attacks due to exposed features or information.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Review and harden the default configuration before deploying Filebrowser.
    *   Disable unnecessary features and functionalities.
    *   Follow security best practices for web application deployment, such as using HTTPS and setting appropriate permissions.
