# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for filebrowser/filebrowser

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Enable Authentication:** Ensure Filebrowser is configured to require authentication for all access. This is typically done in the Filebrowser configuration file (e.g., `filebrowser.json` or command-line arguments). Look for settings like `--auth.method` or similar and ensure it's not set to `none` or `noauth`.
    *   Step 2: **Implement Strong Password Policies:**
        *   **Communicate password complexity requirements to users.**  Advise users to create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
        *   **Consider using a password manager** to generate and store strong passwords.
    *   Step 3: **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
        *   **Explore Filebrowser's authentication options.** Check if Filebrowser natively supports MFA or integration with external MFA providers.
        *   **If native MFA is not available, consider placing Filebrowser behind a reverse proxy or gateway** that provides MFA capabilities.
        *   **Enable and configure MFA for all users, especially administrators.**
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access - Severity: High
        *   Data Breach - Severity: High
        *   Account Takeover - Severity: High

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_authorization.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Define User Roles and Groups:** Identify different user roles and groups within your organization that will need access to Filebrowser. Determine the level of access each role/group requires (read-only, read-write, admin).
    *   Step 2: **Configure Filebrowser User and Permission Management:**
        *   **Utilize Filebrowser's user management features** to create user accounts and assign them to appropriate groups.
        *   **Leverage Filebrowser's permission system** to define granular access control lists (ACLs) for directories and files.  Specify which users or groups have read, write, delete, or admin permissions for specific paths.
        *   **Avoid granting overly broad permissions.**  Start with the least privilege principle and grant only necessary permissions.
    *   Step 3: **Regularly Review and Audit Permissions:**
        *   **Establish a schedule for reviewing user permissions and group memberships.**
        *   **Audit logs for Filebrowser access and permission changes** to detect any unauthorized modifications or access attempts.
        *   **Remove or adjust permissions for users who no longer require access or whose roles have changed.**
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access - Severity: High
        *   Privilege Escalation - Severity: Medium
        *   Data Breach - Severity: High

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Allowed File Types for Uploads](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_allowed_file_types_for_uploads.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Identify Necessary File Types:** Determine the specific file types that users legitimately need to upload through Filebrowser for your application's functionality.
    *   Step 2: **Implement Server-Side File Type Validation:**
        *   **Configure Filebrowser (if it offers built-in file type restrictions).** Check Filebrowser's configuration options for settings related to allowed file extensions or MIME types.
        *   **If Filebrowser lacks built-in restrictions, implement validation in a reverse proxy or a custom script/application** that handles file uploads before they reach Filebrowser's backend.
        *   **Create a whitelist of allowed file extensions.**  Only permit uploads of extensions that are on this whitelist.
        *   **Perform file content analysis (magic number checks) in addition to extension validation.**
    *   Step 3: **Reject Invalid File Types:** Configure the validation mechanism to reject uploads of files that do not match the allowed file types and provide informative error messages to the user.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Malware Upload - Severity: High
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Severity: High (If vulnerable file types are uploaded and processed)
