* **Goal:** Execute arbitrary code on the server.
* **Attack:** Upload a file with an executable extension (e.g., .php, .jsp, .py, .sh, .exe) disguised as a seemingly harmless file type or directly as an executable if allowed.
* **Impact:** Critical (Remote Code Execution, Full Server Compromise)
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Implement strict file type validation using a whitelist of allowed extensions.
    * Configure the web server to prevent execution of scripts and executables within Filebrowser upload directories.
    * Consider using sandboxing for uploaded files to limit the impact of malicious executables.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1.3. Path Traversal Upload](./attack_tree_paths/2___high_risk_path__1_1_3__path_traversal_upload.md)

* **Goal:** Write files to arbitrary locations on the server file system, potentially overwriting critical files or gaining access to sensitive areas.
* **Attack:** Craft filenames with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`, `C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM`) during upload.
* **Impact:** High (Overwrite configuration files, gain access to sensitive data, escalate privileges)
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Implement robust filename sanitization and validation to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences.
    * Enforce least privilege file system permissions to limit the impact of successful path traversal.
    * Restrict access to the upload directory and monitor for unusual file creation patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.1. Access Sensitive Files](./attack_tree_paths/3___high_risk_path__2_1_1__access_sensitive_files.md)

* **Goal:** Retrieve confidential data stored on the server.
* **Attack:** Navigate through Filebrowser to access directories and files containing sensitive information (e.g., configuration files, database backups, source code, user data).
* **Impact:** High (Data breach, privacy violation, intellectual property theft)
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low
* **Detection Difficulty:** Low
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Implement strict access control lists (ACLs) and role-based access control (RBAC) within Filebrowser configuration to restrict access to sensitive directories and files.
    * Regularly review and audit file access permissions to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.
    * Enforce the principle of least privilege by granting users only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [HIGH RISK PATH] 3.1.1. Delete/Rename/Move Sensitive Files](./attack_tree_paths/4___high_risk_path__3_1_1__deleterenamemove_sensitive_files.md)

* **Goal:** Disrupt application functionality or gain unauthorized access by manipulating critical files.
* **Attack:** Use path traversal sequences in file operation requests (rename, delete, move) to target files outside the intended directory.
* **Impact:** High (Denial of service, data loss, privilege escalation)
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Implement robust path sanitization and validation for all file operations (rename, delete, move).
    * Enforce least privilege file system permissions to limit the impact of unauthorized file manipulation.
    * Restrict access to critical files and directories and monitor file operation logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [HIGH RISK PATH - Potential] 4.2.1. Exploit Authentication Bypass Bug](./attack_tree_paths/5___high_risk_path_-_potential__4_2_1__exploit_authentication_bypass_bug.md)

* **Goal:** Bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access without valid credentials.
* **Attack:** Exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in Filebrowser's authentication logic (e.g., SQL injection, logic flaws, session manipulation).

* **Effort:** Medium to High
* **Skill Level:** Medium to High
* **Detection Difficulty:** High
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Regularly update Filebrowser to the latest version to patch known authorization bypass vulnerabilities.
    * Perform security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on authorization mechanisms.
    * Implement robust and well-tested authorization mechanisms within Filebrowser.

* **Goal:** Access files and directories due to overly permissive configurations.
* **Attack:** Exploit misconfigurations in Filebrowser's permission settings that grant excessive access to users or roles.
* **Impact:** High (Unauthorized data access, privilege escalation)
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low
* **Detection Difficulty:** Low
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Regularly review and audit Filebrowser configuration, paying close attention to access control settings.
    * Implement the principle of least privilege when configuring user and role permissions.
    * Provide clear documentation and training to administrators on secure configuration practices for Filebrowser.

* **Goal:** Compromise application by exploiting known vulnerabilities in the specific Filebrowser version being used.
* **Attack:** Research and exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) affecting the installed version of Filebrowser.
* **Impact:** Varies (information disclosure to RCE, depending on the vulnerability)
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Effort:** Low to Medium
* **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Regularly update Filebrowser to the latest stable version.
