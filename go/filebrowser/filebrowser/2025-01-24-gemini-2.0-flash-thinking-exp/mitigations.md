# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for filebrowser/filebrowser

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Anonymous Access:**  Within Filebrowser's configuration (e.g., `filebrowser.json` or command-line flags), ensure that options like `--noauth` or similar flags that enable anonymous access are *not* used.  Verify that authentication is explicitly required for all access attempts.
    2.  **Utilize Filebrowser's User Management:** Leverage Filebrowser's built-in user management features to create user accounts. Avoid relying on external authentication unless explicitly supported and securely configured with Filebrowser.
    3.  **Configure Password Policies (if available):** Check Filebrowser's documentation for any options to enforce password complexity or password rotation policies within its user management system. If available, configure these policies to strengthen passwords.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (Severity: High) - Attackers gaining access to sensitive files and directories without proper credentials due to weak or missing authentication in Filebrowser.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: Medium) - Attackers attempting to guess passwords for Filebrowser user accounts.
    *   Credential Stuffing (Severity: Medium) - Attackers using compromised credentials from other breaches to attempt login to Filebrowser accounts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: Significantly reduces risk by ensuring only authenticated users can access Filebrowser.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: Moderately reduces risk by making password guessing harder (especially with strong password policies if configurable in Filebrowser).
    *   Credential Stuffing: Moderately reduces risk, especially if combined with strong passwords and potentially MFA if Filebrowser can be integrated with an external MFA provider (though direct Filebrowser MFA might be limited).
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partial and details. Example: Yes - Filebrowser is configured to require password authentication.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify areas missing. Example: Password complexity policies within Filebrowser are not configured (if this feature is available). MFA integration with Filebrowser is not explored.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Granular Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/implement_granular_access_control.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define User Roles and Permissions within Filebrowser:** Utilize Filebrowser's user and group management features to define roles and assign permissions.  Focus on using Filebrowser's permission model to control access to directories and operations (read, write, delete, upload, download) *within Filebrowser*.
    2.  **Directory-Based Access Control in Filebrowser:** Configure Filebrowser to restrict user access to specific directories based on their roles or groups *using Filebrowser's configuration*. Ensure users only have access to directories they need within the Filebrowser interface.
    3.  **Regularly Review Filebrowser Permissions:** Periodically review user permissions configured *within Filebrowser* to ensure they remain appropriate and follow the principle of least privilege.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data (Severity: High) - Users accessing files and directories within Filebrowser that they are not authorized to view or modify, due to misconfigured permissions in Filebrowser.
    *   Data Breaches due to Insider Threats (Severity: Medium) - Malicious or negligent insiders exploiting overly broad access permissions *configured in Filebrowser*.
    *   Lateral Movement after Compromise (Severity: Medium) - Attackers gaining access to one Filebrowser account and then using excessive permissions *within Filebrowser* to access other sensitive areas managed by Filebrowser.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data: Significantly reduces risk by limiting access based on Filebrowser's permission settings.
    *   Data Breaches due to Insider Threats: Moderately reduces risk by controlling what actions insiders can perform within Filebrowser.
    *   Lateral Movement after Compromise: Moderately reduces risk by limiting the scope of access an attacker gains within Filebrowser after compromising an account.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partial and details. Example: Yes - Basic user roles are defined in Filebrowser, and directory permissions are set for some key areas.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify areas missing. Example: Directory-level access control in Filebrowser is not fully implemented across all directories. Regular reviews of Filebrowser permissions are not scheduled.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Filebrowser Configuration Documentation:** Thoroughly read Filebrowser's configuration documentation (e.g., for `filebrowser.json`, command-line flags, environment variables) to understand all available settings and their security implications *specific to Filebrowser*.
    2.  **Apply Filebrowser Security Best Practices:** Configure Filebrowser according to security best practices *as they relate to Filebrowser's settings*. This includes settings related to authentication, authorization, access control, logging *within Filebrowser*, and any other security-relevant options provided by Filebrowser.
    3.  **Minimize Filebrowser Permissions:** When configuring permissions *within Filebrowser*, adhere to the principle of least privilege. Grant only the necessary permissions to users and roles *within Filebrowser*.
    4.  **Regularly Audit Filebrowser Configuration:** Periodically review Filebrowser's configuration files and settings to ensure they remain secure and aligned with security policies. Check for any misconfigurations or deviations from best practices *in Filebrowser's setup*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Vulnerabilities due to Misconfiguration (Severity: Medium to High, depending on misconfiguration) - Security weaknesses introduced by incorrect or insecure configuration settings *within Filebrowser*.
    *   Unauthorized Access due to Weak Configuration (Severity: Medium) - Loosely configured access controls *in Filebrowser* leading to unauthorized access through Filebrowser.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities due to Misconfiguration: Moderately to Significantly reduces risk by ensuring Filebrowser is securely configured.
    *   Unauthorized Access due to Weak Configuration: Moderately reduces risk by strengthening access controls *within Filebrowser*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partial and details. Example: Partial - Basic Filebrowser configuration is done, but a dedicated security review of Filebrowser's configuration has not been performed.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify areas missing. Example: A detailed security configuration review of Filebrowser needs to be conducted based on Filebrowser's documentation and security best practices. A Filebrowser configuration hardening checklist should be created and followed.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor and Log Activity](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_and_log_activity.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Filebrowser Logging:** Configure Filebrowser to enable logging of user activity *within Filebrowser*. Check Filebrowser's configuration options for enabling logs, specifying log levels, and log file locations.
    2.  **Review Filebrowser Logs:** Establish a process for regularly reviewing and analyzing Filebrowser logs. Look for suspicious patterns, unauthorized access attempts *within Filebrowser*, errors, and other security-relevant events logged by Filebrowser.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Delayed Detection of Security Incidents (Severity: Medium to High) - Without Filebrowser logging and monitoring, security incidents *within Filebrowser* might go unnoticed.
    *   Lack of Audit Trail (Severity: Medium) - Insufficient Filebrowser logging makes it difficult to investigate security incidents *related to Filebrowser usage*, identify the scope of compromise, and take corrective actions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Delayed Detection of Security Incidents: Moderately to Significantly reduces risk by enabling faster detection of issues within Filebrowser.
    *   Lack of Audit Trail: Moderately reduces risk by providing an audit trail for Filebrowser-related activities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partial and details. Example: Partial - Basic Filebrowser logging might be enabled by default, but detailed logging and regular log review are not in place.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify areas missing. Example: Comprehensive Filebrowser logging needs to be configured to capture all relevant events within Filebrowser. Log review and analysis processes for Filebrowser logs need to be established.]
