# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for filebrowser/filebrowser

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Authentication and Authorization (Filebrowser-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_authentication_and_authorization__filebrowser-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strong Password Policies:** Configure File Browser to require strong passwords. Go to Settings -> Global Settings and set:
        *   Minimum password length (e.g., 12 characters).
        *   Require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
    2.  **Disable Default Admin:** Create a new administrative user with a strong, unique password. Then, *delete* or disable the default `admin` account.  This is done through File Browser's user management interface.
    3.  **Granular Permissions (RBAC):** For *each* user and group:
        *   Go to Settings -> Users (or Groups).
        *   Define specific rules:
            *   **Scope:** Select the exact directories and subdirectories the user can access. *Never* grant access to the entire filesystem unless absolutely necessary.
            *   **Actions:** Check only the allowed actions (create, rename, delete, download, upload, share). Be restrictive.
            *   **Conditions:** (Optional, use with caution) Add IP address restrictions *if* you understand the limitations (proxies, VPNs).  This is done within the rule definition.
        *   Regularly review and update these rules.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Limited):** (Severity: High) - Strong passwords make it harder to guess credentials, but without MFA or rate limiting (which require a reverse proxy), File Browser is still vulnerable.
    *   **Unauthorized File Access:** (Severity: High) - Granular permissions prevent users from accessing files they shouldn't, even if they have a valid account.
    *   **Unauthorized File Modification/Deletion:** (Severity: High) - Granular permissions restrict write/delete access.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** (Severity: High) - Disabling the default admin and using granular permissions prevents attackers from gaining administrative control.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced (but not eliminated without external mitigations).
    *   **Unauthorized File Access:** Risk significantly reduced (dependent on meticulous permission configuration).
    *   **Unauthorized File Modification/Deletion:** Risk significantly reduced (dependent on permission configuration).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Password complexity rules: Partially implemented in File Browser's settings.
    *   Granular permissions (RBAC): Fully implemented in File Browser's rule system.
    *   Disable default admin: Possible through manual user management.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Native MFA:** Completely missing. This is a *major* limitation of relying solely on File Browser's built-in features.
    *   Password strength enforcement beyond basic rules: Missing.
    *   Automated review/expiration of user permissions: Missing (requires manual review).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Attack Surface via Feature Disabling](./mitigation_strategies/limit_attack_surface_via_feature_disabling.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Unused Features:** In File Browser's settings (Settings -> Global Settings), disable any features that are not absolutely necessary.  This includes:
        *   **Sharing:** If not required, disable the file sharing functionality.
        *   **Command Execution:** *Strongly consider disabling this feature entirely* unless it is absolutely essential and you have implemented *very* strict controls (see below).
        *   **Previews:** If previews (image thumbnails, etc.) are not needed, disable them to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in image processing libraries.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Unused Features:** (Severity: Variable, depends on the feature) - Disabling unused features directly reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Command Injection (If Command Execution is Disabled):** (Severity: Critical) - Disabling the feature eliminates this risk entirely.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Vulnerable Libraries (If Previews are Disabled):** (Severity: Critical) - Disabling previews eliminates this specific attack vector.
    *   **Unauthorized File Sharing (If Sharing is Disabled):** (Severity: High) - Disabling sharing eliminates this risk.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Unused Features:** Risk reduced proportionally to the number of disabled features.
    *   **Command Injection:** Risk eliminated (if disabled).
    *   **RCE via Previews:** Risk eliminated (if disabled).
    *   **Unauthorized File Sharing:** Risk eliminated (if disabled).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Feature disabling: Supported in File Browser's settings.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None, as this strategy is about using existing configuration options.

## Mitigation Strategy: [(Conditional) Command Execution Restrictions (Use with Extreme Caution)](./mitigation_strategies/_conditional__command_execution_restrictions__use_with_extreme_caution_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **If Command Execution is *Absolutely* Necessary:**
        *   Create a *strict whitelist* of allowed commands and arguments.  This is likely done through File Browser's configuration (refer to the documentation for the exact method).
        *   *Thoroughly* sanitize any user-provided input to these commands *within the application logic that calls File Browser's command execution*.  File Browser itself likely does *not* perform sufficient sanitization.  This is a *critical* step and requires careful coding.
        *   Regularly review and update the whitelist.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection:** (Severity: Critical) - Strict whitelisting and input sanitization (done *externally* to File Browser, in the calling application) are crucial to prevent attackers from running arbitrary commands.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** Risk reduced significantly (but only if implemented correctly, and the sanitization is *not* solely File Browser's responsibility).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic command execution functionality: Exists in File Browser.
    *   Whitelist configuration:  Likely supported, but check File Browser's documentation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Robust input sanitization:**  File Browser likely does *not* provide sufficient sanitization.  This *must* be handled by the application using File Browser's command execution feature. This is a *major* point of potential vulnerability.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Review Audit Logs](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_review_audit_logs.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Audit Logs:** Enable File Browser's audit logging feature (Settings -> Global Settings).
    2. **Regular Log Review:** Regularly review the logs *within the File Browser interface* for suspicious activity:
        *   Failed login attempts.
        *   Unusual file access patterns.
        *   Changes to user permissions.
        *   Creation of shared links.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Undetected Breaches (Limited):** (Severity: High) - Logs allow for the detection of successful or attempted breaches, but without external analysis, detection is limited.
    *   **Insider Threats (Limited):** (Severity: Medium) - Logs can help identify malicious or negligent actions, but manual review is required.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Undetected Breaches:** Improves detection capabilities (but limited without external logging).
    *   **Insider Threats:** Improves detection and provides evidence (but limited without external logging).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic audit logging: Supported in File Browser.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automated log analysis and alerting:** Requires manual review within the File Browser interface.  No integration with external systems.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Sharing Feature (Filebrowser-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_sharing_feature__filebrowser-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Password Protection:** *Always* require a strong, unique password for *every* shared link. This is configured when creating the share within File Browser.
    2.  **Expiration Dates:** Set expiration dates for all shared links. Choose a reasonable timeframe. This is configured when creating the share.
    3. **Review Shared Links:** Regularly review the list of active shared links *within the File Browser interface* to identify any unauthorized or suspicious sharing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access via Shared Links:** (Severity: High) - Password protection and expiration dates prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Data Leakage:** (Severity: High) - Limiting the lifespan of shared links reduces the risk.
    *   **Malicious Sharing:** (Severity: Medium) - Manual review helps detect malicious or negligent sharing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Malicious Sharing:** Improves detection (but relies on manual review).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Password protection for shares: Supported.
    *   Expiration dates for shares: Supported.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated auditing of share creation: Requires manual review within the File Browser interface.
    *   Download count limits: May not be available in all versions.
