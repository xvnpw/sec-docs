Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "File Upload (malicious files)" attack tree path, tailored for a development team using `filebrowser/filebrowser`.

## Deep Analysis: File Upload (Malicious Files) Attack Vector in Filebrowser

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "File Upload (malicious files)" attack vector within the context of the `filebrowser/filebrowser` application.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities, assessing the effectiveness of existing mitigations, and recommending concrete improvements to enhance security.  The ultimate goal is to prevent attackers from successfully uploading and executing malicious code on the server.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the file upload functionality provided by `filebrowser/filebrowser`.  It considers:

*   **Filebrowser's Codebase:**  We'll examine the relevant parts of the `filebrowser/filebrowser` Go code (available on GitHub) to understand how file uploads are handled, validated, and stored.
*   **Configuration Options:** We'll analyze how Filebrowser's configuration settings (e.g., `config.json`, command-line flags) impact file upload security.
*   **Deployment Environment:** We'll consider common deployment scenarios (e.g., Docker, bare-metal, behind a reverse proxy) and how they might introduce or mitigate vulnerabilities.
*   **Interaction with Other Systems:** We'll briefly touch upon how the file upload functionality interacts with other system components (e.g., web server, operating system, antivirus software).
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection) except where they directly relate to the file upload process.  It also doesn't cover physical security or social engineering.

**1.3 Methodology:**

The analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Code Review:**  We'll perform a targeted code review of the `filebrowser/filebrowser` repository, focusing on the file upload handling logic.  This includes searching for known vulnerable patterns and potential bypasses.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:** We'll examine the available configuration options related to file uploads and identify potentially insecure default settings or misconfigurations.
3.  **Threat Modeling:** We'll use the provided attack tree path as a starting point and expand upon it, considering various attack scenarios and attacker motivations.
4.  **Vulnerability Assessment:** We'll identify specific vulnerabilities based on the code review, configuration analysis, and threat modeling.
5.  **Mitigation Review:** We'll evaluate the effectiveness of the listed mitigations and identify any gaps or weaknesses.
6.  **Recommendation Generation:** We'll provide concrete, actionable recommendations for improving the security of the file upload functionality.  These recommendations will be prioritized based on their impact and feasibility.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**2.1 Attack Scenario Breakdown:**

The core attack scenario is straightforward:

1.  **Attacker Access:** The attacker gains access to the Filebrowser interface. This could be through:
    *   **Legitimate Credentials:**  The attacker has a valid user account (perhaps obtained through phishing, credential stuffing, or a weak password).
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in Filebrowser (e.g., an authentication bypass) or the underlying system to gain access without valid credentials.
    *   **Publicly Accessible Instance:** The Filebrowser instance is unintentionally exposed to the public internet without proper authentication.

2.  **File Upload:** The attacker uses the Filebrowser interface to upload a malicious file.  This file could be:
    *   **Web Shell:** A script (PHP, Python, Perl, etc.) that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.  This is the most dangerous type of upload.
    *   **Malware:**  A virus, worm, or Trojan horse designed to infect the server or other users who download the file.
    *   **Oversized File:**  An extremely large file intended to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by consuming disk space or memory.
    *   **File with a Deceptive Extension:**  A file disguised with a harmless extension (e.g., `.jpg`) but containing executable code that might be triggered by a vulnerability in a file viewer or other software.
    *   **File Containing Sensitive Information:**  A file designed to overwrite a legitimate file with attacker-controlled content, potentially leading to data breaches or further attacks.
    *  **Double Extension File:** A file with double extension like `malicious.php.jpg`, that can bypass some basic file type validation.

3.  **Execution/Triggering:** The attacker triggers the execution of the malicious file.  This could happen in several ways:
    *   **Direct Access:** The attacker accesses the uploaded file directly through a web browser (e.g., `https://example.com/uploads/shell.php`). This relies on the web server being configured to execute files in the upload directory.
    *   **Indirect Execution:** The attacker exploits another vulnerability (e.g., a command injection flaw in a different part of the application) to execute the uploaded file.
    *   **User Interaction:**  Another user downloads and opens the malicious file, triggering its execution on their system.
    *   **Automated Processing:**  A server-side process (e.g., a scheduled task, a file indexing service) attempts to process the malicious file, leading to its execution.

**2.2 Vulnerability Assessment (Based on Code Review and Configuration):**

This section requires access to the specific version of `filebrowser/filebrowser` being used.  However, I can outline common vulnerabilities and areas to investigate:

*   **Insufficient File Type Validation:**
    *   **MIME Type Spoofing:**  Filebrowser might rely solely on the `Content-Type` header provided by the client, which is easily manipulated.  An attacker could upload a PHP file with a `Content-Type` of `image/jpeg`.
    *   **Extension Blacklisting:**  Filebrowser might use a blacklist of forbidden extensions (e.g., `.php`, `.exe`).  Attackers can often bypass blacklists using alternative extensions (e.g., `.php5`, `.phtml`, `.phar`), case variations (`.PhP`), or null bytes (`shell.php%00.jpg`).
    *   **Lack of Magic Number/File Signature Validation:**  Filebrowser might not check the file's actual content (its "magic number" or file signature) to verify its type.  This is crucial for preventing attackers from disguising malicious files.

*   **Insecure Storage:**
    *   **Uploads Within Web Root:**  If uploaded files are stored within the web server's document root (e.g., `/var/www/html/uploads`), they can be directly accessed via a URL. This is a major security risk.
    *   **Predictable File Paths:**  If the file paths for uploaded files are predictable (e.g., based on the upload time or a sequential ID), an attacker might be able to guess the path to a previously uploaded malicious file.
    *   **Lack of File Permissions Control:** Filebrowser might not set appropriate file permissions on uploaded files.  Ideally, uploaded files should *not* have execute permissions.

*   **Configuration Issues:**
    *   **Disabled Security Features:**  Filebrowser might have security features (e.g., antivirus integration) that are disabled by default or through misconfiguration.
    *   **Weak Default Settings:**  Default settings for upload limits, allowed file types, or storage locations might be overly permissive.
    *   **Lack of Auditing:**  Filebrowser might not log file upload events adequately, making it difficult to detect and investigate malicious activity.

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Filebrowser uses external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries could be exploited.

* **Race Conditions:**
    *   If file validation and storage are not atomic operations, there might be a race condition where an attacker can upload a malicious file and execute it before validation completes.

**2.3 Mitigation Review:**

Let's analyze the provided mitigations:

*   **Strict file type validation (MIME types, file signatures):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Potentially effective, but *must* be implemented correctly.  MIME type validation alone is insufficient.  File signature (magic number) validation is essential.  The validation logic must be robust and resistant to bypass techniques.
    *   **Gaps:**  Needs to handle edge cases (e.g., compressed files, archives), and the list of allowed/denied file types must be carefully considered and regularly updated.

*   **Antivirus scanning of uploaded files:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  A valuable layer of defense, but not a silver bullet.  Antivirus software can be bypassed by new or obfuscated malware.
    *   **Gaps:**  Requires regular updates to the antivirus definitions.  May introduce performance overhead.  May not detect all types of malicious files (e.g., web shells that are not recognized as traditional malware).  False positives can also be a problem.

*   **Store uploads outside the web root:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Highly effective at preventing direct execution of uploaded files via the web server.  This is a crucial security measure.
    *   **Gaps:**  Doesn't prevent indirect execution or attacks that rely on user interaction.

*   **Sandboxed execution (if possible):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  The most robust mitigation, but also the most complex to implement.  If uploaded files can be executed in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Docker container, a virtual machine), the impact of a successful attack is significantly reduced.
    *   **Gaps:**  Requires significant infrastructure and expertise.  May not be feasible for all types of files or applications.  Sandboxes can sometimes be escaped.

**2.4 Recommendations:**

Based on the analysis, here are prioritized recommendations:

1.  **High Priority:**
    *   **Implement Robust File Type Validation:**
        *   **Use File Signature (Magic Number) Validation:**  This is the *most critical* step.  Use a reliable library (e.g., `libmagic` in Go) to determine the file type based on its content, not just its extension or MIME type.
        *   **Use a Whitelist, Not a Blacklist:**  Define a list of *allowed* file types, rather than trying to block all potentially dangerous types.  This is much more secure.
        *   **Handle Compressed Files Carefully:**  If you allow uploads of compressed files (e.g., `.zip`, `.tar.gz`), you need to validate the contents of the archive *after* decompression.
        *   **Regularly Review and Update the Whitelist:**  As new file types emerge and attack techniques evolve, you need to keep your whitelist up-to-date.
    *   **Store Uploads Outside the Web Root:**  This is essential to prevent direct execution of uploaded files.  Configure Filebrowser to store uploads in a directory that is *not* accessible via a web URL.
    *   **Set Strict File Permissions:**  Ensure that uploaded files do not have execute permissions.  Use the most restrictive permissions possible.
    *   **Sanitize Filenames:**  Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal attacks and other issues.  Remove or replace potentially dangerous characters (e.g., `../`, `/`, `\`).
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of uploads per user per time period to mitigate DoS attacks and brute-force attempts.

2.  **Medium Priority:**
    *   **Integrate Antivirus Scanning:**  Use a reputable antivirus solution to scan uploaded files.  Ensure that the antivirus definitions are regularly updated.
    *   **Implement Comprehensive Auditing:**  Log all file upload events, including the username, IP address, filename, file size, and the result of the validation checks.  This will help you detect and investigate suspicious activity.
    *   **Review and Harden Configuration:**  Carefully review all Filebrowser configuration options related to file uploads.  Ensure that security features are enabled and that default settings are not overly permissive.
    *   **Regularly Update Filebrowser:**  Keep Filebrowser and its dependencies up-to-date to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Consider a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can provide an additional layer of defense against file upload attacks and other web-based threats.

3.  **Low Priority (But Still Important):**
    *   **Explore Sandboxed Execution:**  If feasible, investigate using sandboxing techniques to isolate the execution of uploaded files.
    *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks, which could be used in conjunction with file upload vulnerabilities.
    *   **Educate Users:**  Train users about the risks of uploading and downloading files from untrusted sources.

**2.5 Conclusion:**

The "File Upload (malicious files)" attack vector is a significant threat to any application that allows users to upload files, including `filebrowser/filebrowser`. By implementing a combination of robust file type validation, secure storage practices, antivirus scanning, and other security measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks.  Regular security audits, code reviews, and penetration testing are also essential to ensure that your defenses remain effective over time. This deep analysis provides a starting point for securing your Filebrowser deployment against this critical attack vector. Remember to tailor the recommendations to your specific environment and risk profile.
