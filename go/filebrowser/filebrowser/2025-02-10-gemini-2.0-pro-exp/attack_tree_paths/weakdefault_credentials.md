Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Weak/Default Credentials" attack tree path for a Filebrowser application, structured as you requested:

## Deep Analysis: Weak/Default Credentials in Filebrowser

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the "Weak/Default Credentials" attack path against a Filebrowser instance, identifying specific vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, potential impacts, and robust mitigation strategies.  This analysis aims to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the application's security posture against this common and high-impact threat.  We will go beyond the basic description to explore real-world scenarios and edge cases.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target Application:**  Filebrowser (https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) and its web-based administrative interface.  We assume a standard deployment, without significant custom modifications to the authentication mechanisms.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploitation of weak or default credentials used for administrative access.  This includes both the initial setup phase and ongoing operation.
*   **Attacker Profile:**  We consider attackers ranging from opportunistic script kiddies to more sophisticated adversaries with knowledge of common default credentials and brute-forcing techniques.  We *do not* consider insider threats within this specific analysis (though they could leverage this vulnerability).
*   **Out of Scope:**  This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors such as XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, or vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or network infrastructure, *except* where they directly relate to the credential weakness.  We also do not cover physical security.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Expand on the initial attack tree description to identify specific scenarios and attacker motivations.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examine the Filebrowser codebase (to the extent possible without a full code audit) and documentation for potential weaknesses related to credential handling and default settings.  This includes reviewing relevant issues and pull requests on the GitHub repository.
3.  **Exploitation Analysis:**  Detail the steps an attacker would take to exploit weak or default credentials, including tools and techniques.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Quantify the potential damage an attacker could inflict after gaining administrative access.  This goes beyond "full administrative access" to describe specific actions.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Propose concrete and prioritized recommendations for mitigating the identified vulnerabilities, including code changes, configuration adjustments, and operational best practices.  We will consider both preventative and detective controls.
6.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Identify any remaining risks after implementing the proposed mitigations.

### 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path: Weak/Default Credentials

#### 4.1 Threat Modeling

*   **Scenario 1:  Initial Setup Neglect:** A system administrator deploys Filebrowser, fails to change the default `admin/admin` credentials during the initial setup, and leaves the application exposed on the public internet.  An opportunistic attacker scans for open Filebrowser instances and uses a well-known default credential list to gain access.
*   **Scenario 2:  Credential Reuse:** An administrator uses a weak password (e.g., "password123") or reuses a password that has been compromised in a previous data breach.  An attacker uses credential stuffing or brute-forcing techniques to gain access.
*   **Scenario 3:  Forgotten Reset:**  An administrator temporarily changes the password to a weak one for testing or troubleshooting purposes and forgets to revert to a strong password.
*   **Scenario 4:  Social Engineering (Indirect):**  While not directly exploiting the application, an attacker might use social engineering tactics to trick an administrator into revealing their credentials, which could be weak or reused.
*   **Attacker Motivation:**  Data theft, data modification, system disruption, using the compromised server as a launchpad for further attacks, installing malware (e.g., ransomware), defacement.

#### 4.2 Vulnerability Analysis

*   **Default Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the existence of well-known default credentials (`admin/admin`).  This is a common issue in many applications, and Filebrowser is no exception.  The documentation *does* warn about changing these credentials, but human error and oversight remain significant factors.
*   **Weak Password Enforcement (Potential):**  If Filebrowser's password policy is not sufficiently strong, it could allow administrators to choose easily guessable passwords.  This needs to be verified by examining the code and configuration options.  We need to check for:
    *   Minimum password length.
    *   Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
    *   Password history (preventing reuse).
    *   Rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-forcing.
*   **Lack of Mandatory Password Change:**  Filebrowser *should* force a password change upon the first login with default credentials.  If this is not enforced, the vulnerability persists.
* **Lack of Prominent Warnings:** While documentation exists, the application itself could provide more prominent, in-application warnings and reminders about the dangers of default credentials, especially during the initial setup and on subsequent logins if the default password is still in use.

#### 4.3 Exploitation Analysis

1.  **Reconnaissance:**
    *   An attacker uses search engines (e.g., Shodan, Censys) to identify publicly accessible Filebrowser instances.  They might search for specific HTTP headers or page titles associated with Filebrowser.
    *   Port scanning tools (e.g., Nmap) can be used to identify open ports commonly used by Filebrowser (default is 8080, but can be configured).

2.  **Credential Testing:**
    *   **Manual Attempt:** The attacker navigates to the Filebrowser login page and attempts to log in with `admin/admin`.
    *   **Automated Brute-Forcing:** Tools like Hydra, Burp Suite Intruder, or custom scripts can be used to automate the process of trying various username/password combinations.  These tools can:
        *   Use wordlists of common default credentials.
        *   Implement credential stuffing attacks (using credentials leaked from other breaches).
        *   Perform brute-force attacks (trying all possible combinations within a defined character set and length).
    *   **Bypassing Rate Limiting (If Present):**  If Filebrowser implements rate limiting, attackers might try to circumvent it by:
        *   Using a distributed network of bots (botnet).
        *   Rotating IP addresses.
        *   Slowing down the attack rate to stay below the threshold.

3.  **Post-Exploitation:** Once the attacker gains administrative access, they have full control over the Filebrowser instance.

#### 4.4 Impact Assessment

*   **Data Breach:**  The attacker can access, download, and exfiltrate all files managed by Filebrowser.  This could include sensitive personal data, intellectual property, financial records, or other confidential information.
*   **Data Modification/Destruction:**  The attacker can modify or delete files, potentially causing significant data loss and operational disruption.
*   **System Compromise:**  The attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., malware, webshells) to the server, potentially compromising the underlying operating system and using the server as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network.
*   **Ransomware Deployment:**  The attacker could encrypt the files managed by Filebrowser and demand a ransom for their decryption.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization using Filebrowser, leading to loss of trust and potential legal consequences.
*   **Service Disruption:** The attacker can shut down or reconfigure the Filebrowser instance, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
* **Configuration Manipulation:** The attacker can change settings, add new users (potentially with weak credentials), or modify existing user permissions.

#### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

*   **Preventative Controls:**
    *   **Mandatory Password Change on First Login:**  The most critical mitigation is to *force* users to change the default password upon the first login with `admin/admin`.  This should be a non-bypassable requirement.  The application should not allow any further actions until the password is changed.
    *   **Strong Password Policy Enforcement:**  Implement a robust password policy that enforces:
        *   Minimum length (e.g., 12 characters).
        *   Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
        *   Password history (preventing reuse of recent passwords).
        *   Consider using a password strength meter to provide feedback to users.
    *   **Account Lockout/Rate Limiting:**  Implement mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks:
        *   **Account Lockout:**  Lock the account after a certain number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts).  The lockout should be temporary (e.g., 30 minutes) or require administrative intervention to unlock.
        *   **Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of login attempts allowed from a single IP address within a specific time period.  This should be configurable.
        *   **CAPTCHA:** Implement a CAPTCHA on the login page to deter automated attacks. However, be aware that CAPTCHAs can be bypassed by sophisticated attackers.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Strongly recommend (or even require) the use of MFA for administrative accounts.  This adds an extra layer of security, even if the password is compromised.  Filebrowser supports TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) as an MFA option.
    *   **Secure Configuration Defaults:**  Ensure that Filebrowser is shipped with secure default configurations, including disabling unnecessary features and restricting access by default.
    *   **In-Application Warnings:**  Display prominent warnings and reminders within the application about the dangers of using default or weak credentials.  These warnings should be persistent and difficult to dismiss permanently.
    * **Disable Default Admin Account:** Provide an option to disable the default `admin` account entirely after a new administrative user has been created with a strong password.

*   **Detective Controls:**
    *   **Audit Logging:**  Implement comprehensive audit logging to track all login attempts (successful and failed), password changes, and other security-relevant events.  This allows for detection of suspicious activity and forensic analysis after an incident.
    *   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns, such as brute-force attacks against the Filebrowser login page.
    *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate Filebrowser logs with a SIEM system to correlate events and identify potential security incidents.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

#### 4.6 Residual Risk Assessment

Even with all the above mitigations in place, some residual risk remains:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  There is always the possibility of unknown vulnerabilities in Filebrowser or its dependencies that could be exploited.
*   **Social Engineering:**  Attackers could still attempt to trick administrators into revealing their credentials through phishing or other social engineering tactics.
*   **Insider Threats:**  A malicious insider with legitimate access could still abuse their privileges.
*   **Compromised MFA Device:** If an attacker gains physical access to an administrator's MFA device (e.g., phone), they could bypass MFA.
* **Bypass of Account Lockout:** Sophisticated attackers may find ways to bypass account lockout mechanisms, such as using distributed botnets or exploiting vulnerabilities in the lockout implementation.

These residual risks highlight the need for a layered security approach, including ongoing monitoring, regular security updates, and user education.

### 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The "Weak/Default Credentials" attack path is a significant threat to Filebrowser instances.  The combination of high likelihood, very high impact, and low attacker effort makes it a critical vulnerability to address.  The most important recommendation is to **enforce a mandatory password change upon the first login with default credentials.**  This, combined with strong password policies, MFA, account lockout/rate limiting, and comprehensive audit logging, will significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks.  Regular security audits and penetration testing are also crucial for identifying and addressing any remaining vulnerabilities. The development team should prioritize these mitigations to enhance the security of Filebrowser and protect its users from this common and dangerous attack vector.
