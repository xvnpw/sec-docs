# Attack Surface Analysis for filebrowser/filebrowser

## Attack Surface: [Weak/Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weakdefault_credentials.md)

*   *Description:*  Gaining administrative or user access through easily guessable or unchanged default credentials.
*   *Filebrowser Contribution:* `filebrowser` has a built-in user management system with default credentials (admin/admin).
*   *Example:* An attacker uses "admin/admin" to log in and gain full control over the file system managed by `filebrowser`.
*   *Impact:* Complete system compromise; unauthorized file access, modification, deletion, and potential command execution.
*   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Enforce strong password policies during setup (minimum length, complexity requirements).  Provide clear warnings about default credentials. Consider prompting for password change on first login.
    *   **Users:** Immediately change the default administrator password to a strong, unique password.  Use strong passwords for all user accounts.  Consider enabling multi-factor authentication if supported by a future version or through external integrations.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass.md)

*   *Description:*  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication process to gain access without valid credentials.
*   *Filebrowser Contribution:* `filebrowser`'s authentication logic handles session management, token validation, and the login flow.  Flaws in any of these components could lead to bypass.
*   *Example:* An attacker crafts a specially formatted request that bypasses a session validation check, allowing them to impersonate a logged-in user.
*   *Impact:* Unauthorized access to files and functionality, potentially with elevated privileges.
*   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Conduct thorough security reviews and penetration testing of the authentication code.  Follow secure coding practices for session management (e.g., using cryptographically secure random number generators for session IDs, proper session expiration).  Keep dependencies updated.
    *   **Users:** Keep `filebrowser` updated to the latest version to receive security patches.  Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary File Upload (RCE)](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_file_upload__rce_.md)

*   *Description:*  Uploading malicious files that can be executed on the server.
*   *Filebrowser Contribution:* `filebrowser` provides file upload functionality.  Insufficient restrictions on file types and content allow for malicious uploads.
*   *Example:* An attacker uploads a PHP web shell (e.g., `shell.php`) and then accesses it via a web browser to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   *Impact:* Remote Code Execution (RCE), leading to complete system compromise.
*   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation using a whitelist approach (allow only specific, known-safe extensions *and* validate the file content, not just the extension).  Store uploaded files outside the web root or in a directory with restricted execution permissions.  Consider integrating with a file scanning service.
    *   **Users:** Configure `filebrowser` to restrict uploads to only necessary file types.  If possible, disable uploads entirely if not required.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal.md)

*   *Description:*  Accessing files and directories outside the intended root directory.
*   *Filebrowser Contribution:* `filebrowser` handles file system navigation and access.  Vulnerabilities in input sanitization can allow attackers to manipulate file paths.
*   *Example:* An attacker uses a URL like `/files/../../etc/passwd` to attempt to read the system's password file.
*   *Impact:* Unauthorized access to sensitive system files and data.
*   *Risk Severity:* **High**
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided input used in file paths.  Normalize file paths before using them.  Implement robust checks to ensure that requested files are within the allowed directory.
    *   **Users:** Keep `filebrowser` updated.  Avoid using custom scripts or modifications that might introduce path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Command Execution (Misconfigured Commands)](./attack_surfaces/command_execution__misconfigured_commands_.md)

*   *Description:*  Executing arbitrary commands on the server through `filebrowser`'s command feature.
*   *Filebrowser Contribution:* `filebrowser` allows administrators to define custom commands that can be executed through the interface.
*   *Example:* An attacker with access to a user account that can execute commands uses a command like `bash -c "rm -rf /"` (if poorly configured) to delete the entire file system.  Or, a less privileged user might exploit a command to read files they shouldn't have access to.
*   *Impact:*  System compromise, data loss, denial of service.
*   *Risk Severity:* **High**
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for command arguments.  Use a whitelist approach for allowed commands, and carefully define the scope of each command.  Provide clear documentation on the security implications of this feature.
    *   **Users:**  *Disable* the command feature entirely if it's not absolutely necessary.  If used, define commands with extreme caution, using the principle of least privilege.  Limit command execution to specific, trusted users.  Regularly audit the configured commands.

## Attack Surface: [Symlink Following](./attack_surfaces/symlink_following.md)

*   *Description:* Exploiting insecure handling of symbolic links to access files outside the intended directory.
*   *Filebrowser Contribution:* Filebrowser allows navigation and potentially creation of symbolic links.
*   *Example:* An attacker creates a symbolic link named `safe_link` within their allowed directory that points to `/etc/passwd`. If Filebrowser follows this link without proper checks, the attacker can read the contents of `/etc/passwd`.
*   *Impact:* Unauthorized access to sensitive files outside the user's permitted area.
*   *Risk Severity:* **High**
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust checks to ensure that symbolic links resolve to locations within the user's allowed directory. Consider disabling symlink creation entirely if not strictly necessary. Provide configuration options to control symlink behavior.
    *   **Users:** If possible, disable symlink creation and following within Filebrowser's configuration. If symlinks are necessary, carefully audit their usage and ensure they point to safe locations.
