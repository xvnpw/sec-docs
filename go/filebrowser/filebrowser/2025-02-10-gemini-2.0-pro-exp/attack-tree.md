## Attack Tree Path: [Known CVEs (e.g., Path Traversal)](./attack_tree_paths/known_cves__e_g___path_traversal_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in Filebrowser, particularly path traversal flaws. Path traversal allows attackers to access files outside the intended directory by manipulating file paths with sequences like `../`.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a URL like `/files/../../../../etc/passwd` to access the system's password file.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Increases to High/Very High if unpatched and a high-severity CVE exists).
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Potential for full system compromise, data exfiltration).
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Public exploits often available).
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Regularly update Filebrowser to the latest version.
    *   Monitor CVE databases and security advisories.
    *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with path traversal rules.
    *   Conduct penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Execution (if enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/command_execution__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** Abusing the built-in command execution feature of Filebrowser to run arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses the feature to execute `rm -rf /` (if permissions allow) or install malware.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (If enabled and poorly secured).
*   **Impact:** Very High (Direct command execution).
*   **Effort:** Low (If access is granted).
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Disable the feature unless absolutely necessary.
    *   If enabled, strictly restrict allowed commands using a whitelist.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization.
    *   Log all command executions.

## Attack Tree Path: [File Upload (malicious files)](./attack_tree_paths/file_upload__malicious_files_.md)

*   **Description:** Uploading malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) to the server, which can then be executed or triggered.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell (`shell.php`) and accesses it via the web server.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Common attack vector).
*   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (Depends on file type and server configuration).
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strict file type validation (MIME types, file signatures).
    *   Antivirus scanning of uploaded files.
    *   Store uploads outside the web root.
    *   Sandboxed execution (if possible).

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak/Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/weakdefault_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default or easily guessable credentials for Filebrowser's administrative interface.
*   **Example:** An attacker logs in using `admin/admin`.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Common problem).
*   **Impact:** Very High (Full administrative access).
*   **Effort:** Very Low.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Never use default credentials.
    *   Enforce strong password policies.
    *   Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Input Validation (leading to other vulns)](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_input_validation__leading_to_other_vulns_.md)

*   **Description:** Insufficient validation of user-provided input opens the door to various injection attacks or other vulnerabilities. This is a foundational issue that can enable other attacks.
*   **Example:** Lack of input validation on a search feature allows an attacker to inject special characters that modify the search query, potentially leading to unauthorized file access or even command injection if the search results are used unsafely.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (depends on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
        * Implement comprehensive server-side input validation and sanitization.
        * Use a whitelist approach (define what *is* allowed).
        * Parameterize queries (if applicable).
        * Escape output appropriately.
        * Regularly perform security code reviews and penetration testing.
