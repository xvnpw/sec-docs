Okay, let's break down this threat with a deep analysis.

## Deep Analysis: Unauthorized File Modification/Deletion (Write Access Misconfiguration) in File Browser

### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Unauthorized File Modification/Deletion" threat within the context of the `filebrowser/filebrowser` application.  This includes identifying potential attack vectors, vulnerable code sections, and effective mitigation strategies beyond the high-level descriptions already provided.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the security posture of File Browser against this specific threat.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the *internal* mechanisms of File Browser that handle file modification and deletion.  We are concerned with vulnerabilities *within* the application's code, not just misconfigurations of the `filebrowser.json` file (although that is a contributing factor).  The scope includes:

*   **Code Analysis:** Examining the Go source code of `filebrowser/filebrowser`, particularly the parts related to:
    *   `/api/resources` endpoint handling (especially PUT, POST, and DELETE methods).
    *   File system interaction functions (e.g., `os.Remove`, `os.Rename`, `io.Copy`, etc.).
    *   Authorization logic that checks user permissions against defined `rules`.
*   **Attack Vector Identification:**  Identifying specific ways an attacker might exploit potential vulnerabilities to bypass authorization checks.
*   **Mitigation Refinement:**  Expanding on the provided mitigation strategies with concrete implementation details and code-level recommendations.

We *exclude* external factors like operating system permissions (assuming the File Browser process itself has appropriate permissions) or network-level attacks.  We are focusing on the application's internal security.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough manual review of the relevant Go source code from the `filebrowser/filebrowser` GitHub repository.  This will involve:
    *   Identifying the entry points for file modification/deletion requests (primarily the `/api/resources` handlers).
    *   Tracing the code execution path from request reception to file system operation.
    *   Analyzing the authorization checks performed at each stage.
    *   Looking for potential vulnerabilities like:
        *   Insufficient input validation (path traversal, injection vulnerabilities).
        *   Logic errors in permission checks.
        *   Race conditions.
        *   Improper error handling that could leak information or lead to unexpected behavior.
        *   Use of unsafe functions or libraries.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Optional, if feasible):**  If time and resources permit, we may perform dynamic analysis using a debugger (like Delve) to step through the code execution during file modification/deletion operations. This can help confirm findings from the static code review and identify subtle vulnerabilities.
3.  **Attack Scenario Development:**  Based on the code review, we will develop specific attack scenarios that could lead to unauthorized file modification/deletion.  These scenarios will be as concrete as possible, describing the steps an attacker might take.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendation Detailing:**  We will refine the provided mitigation strategies, providing specific code-level recommendations and best practices to address the identified vulnerabilities.
5.  **Documentation:**  All findings, attack scenarios, and recommendations will be documented in this report.

### 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat

Now, let's dive into the analysis itself, based on the methodology outlined above.

#### 4.1 Code Review Findings (Hypothetical - Requires Access to Specific Code Version)

Since I don't have access to a specific, frozen version of the `filebrowser/filebrowser` code, I'll outline *hypothetical* vulnerabilities and code snippets that *could* exist, based on common security issues in file management applications.  This is illustrative and needs to be verified against the actual codebase.

*   **Entry Point Analysis (`/api/resources`):**

    Let's assume the following (simplified) Go code handles a DELETE request:

    ```go
    func handleDelete(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        filePath := r.URL.Query().Get("path")
        user := getUserFromRequest(r) // Hypothetical function to get user info

        if !isAuthorized(user, filePath, "delete") { // Hypothetical authorization check
            http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", http.StatusForbidden)
            return
        }

        err := os.Remove(filePath)
        if err != nil {
            http.Error(w, "Error deleting file", http.StatusInternalServerError)
            return
        }

        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    }

    func isAuthorized(user User, filePath string, action string) bool {
        // ... (Implementation details - potential vulnerabilities here) ...
        return true // Placeholder - needs to be replaced with actual logic
    }
    ```

*   **Potential Vulnerabilities:**

    1.  **Path Traversal:**  If `filePath` is not properly sanitized, an attacker could use `../` sequences to escape the intended directory and delete files outside the allowed scope.  For example, if the user is only allowed to access `/home/user/files`, an attacker might send a request with `path=../../etc/passwd` to try and delete a system file.

        *   **Vulnerable Code (Hypothetical):**  The `handleDelete` function directly uses the `filePath` from the request without sanitization.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Use `filepath.Clean()` and check if the resulting path is still within the allowed base directory.  Reject any requests that attempt to traverse outside the permitted area.

        ```go
        import "path/filepath"
        import "strings"

        func handleDelete(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            filePath := r.URL.Query().Get("path")
            user := getUserFromRequest(r)

            // Sanitize the path
            cleanPath := filepath.Clean(filePath)
            baseDir := "/home/user/files" // Example base directory

            // Check for path traversal
            if !strings.HasPrefix(cleanPath, baseDir) {
                http.Error(w, "Invalid path", http.StatusBadRequest)
                return
            }

            if !isAuthorized(user, cleanPath, "delete") {
                http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", http.StatusForbidden)
                return
            }

            err := os.Remove(cleanPath) // Use the cleaned path
            if err != nil {
                http.Error(w, "Error deleting file", http.StatusInternalServerError)
                return
            }

            w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
        }
        ```

    2.  **Authorization Bypass (Logic Errors):**  The `isAuthorized` function might have flaws in how it checks user permissions against the configured `rules`.  For example:

        *   **Incorrect Rule Matching:**  The logic for matching file paths to rules might be incorrect, allowing access to files that should be denied.
        *   **Default Allow:**  If no rule matches a file path, the function might default to allowing access instead of denying it (fail-safe should be *deny*).
        *   **Case Sensitivity Issues:**  The comparison of file paths or usernames might be case-sensitive when it should be case-insensitive (or vice-versa), leading to unexpected behavior.
        *   **Regular Expression Errors:** If regular expressions are used in the rules, they might be overly permissive or contain vulnerabilities (e.g., ReDoS).

        *   **Vulnerable Code (Hypothetical):**  A flawed `isAuthorized` function that doesn't handle edge cases correctly.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Thoroughly review and test the `isAuthorized` function.  Implement unit tests that cover various scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions.  Use a secure-by-default approach (deny access unless explicitly allowed).  Consider using a well-tested library for rule matching if possible.

    3.  **Race Conditions:**  If multiple requests are made to modify or delete the same file concurrently, a race condition could occur.  For example, one request might pass the authorization check, but before it can delete the file, another request modifies the file's permissions, making the first request unauthorized.

        *   **Vulnerable Code (Hypothetical):**  The `handleDelete` function doesn't use any locking or synchronization mechanisms to prevent concurrent access to the same file.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Use file locking (e.g., `flock`) or other synchronization primitives to ensure that only one request can modify or delete a file at a time.  Consider using a database transaction if file metadata is stored in a database.

    4.  **Symlink Attacks:** If File Browser follows symbolic links, an attacker could create a symlink that points to a sensitive file outside the allowed directory.  If File Browser doesn't properly handle symlinks, it might delete the target file instead of the symlink itself.

        *   **Vulnerable Code (Hypothetical):** The code doesn't check if `filePath` is a symlink and blindly calls `os.Remove` on it.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use `os.Lstat` to check if a file is a symlink.  If it is, either refuse to delete it or carefully evaluate the target of the symlink to ensure it's within the allowed directory.  Consider disallowing symlink creation within File Browser.

#### 4.2 Attack Scenarios

1.  **Path Traversal to Delete System Files:**

    *   **Attacker:**  A user with limited write access to a specific directory.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  The attacker sends a DELETE request to `/api/resources?path=../../etc/passwd`.
        2.  If File Browser doesn't sanitize the path, `os.Remove("../../etc/passwd")` is executed, potentially deleting a critical system file.
    *   **Impact:**  System instability, potential denial of service.

2.  **Authorization Bypass due to Rule Mismatch:**

    *   **Attacker:**  A user with read-only access to a directory.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  The attacker crafts a DELETE request for a file within that directory.
        2.  Due to a flaw in the `isAuthorized` function (e.g., incorrect regular expression), the authorization check passes.
        3.  The file is deleted.
    *   **Impact:**  Data loss.

3. **Symlink attack to delete files outside scope**
    *   **Attacker:** A user with limited write access to a specific directory.
    *   **Steps:**
        1. The attacker creates symlink that points to file outside of allowed directory.
        2. The attacker sends a DELETE request to `/api/resources?path=<path_to_symlink>`.
        3.  If File Browser doesn't sanitize the path, `os.Remove("<target_file_outside_scope>")` is executed, potentially deleting a critical system file.
    *   **Impact:**  System instability, potential denial of service.

#### 4.3 Mitigation Refinement

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Carefully define `rules` in `filebrowser.json` to grant only the necessary permissions to each user.  Avoid using wildcard characters (`*`) excessively.  Use specific file paths and directory structures.
    *   **Code-Level:**  Ensure the `isAuthorized` function correctly interprets and enforces these rules.

*   **Read-Only Mode:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Use the `view` permission in `filebrowser.json` to restrict users to read-only access.
    *   **Code-Level:**  Ensure that the code handling file modification/deletion requests checks for the `view` permission and rejects any write operations if it's set.

*   **Regular Audits:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Establish a process for regularly reviewing the `filebrowser.json` configuration and the File Browser logs.  Look for any suspicious activity or misconfigured permissions.
    *   **Code-Level:**  Consider adding logging to the `isAuthorized` function to record all authorization decisions, including failures. This can help with auditing and debugging.

*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Implementation:**  As described above, use `filepath.Clean()` and check for path traversal.  Validate all user-supplied input, including file names, to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code-Level:**  Implement robust input validation checks at the beginning of all request handlers that deal with file system operations.

* **Symlink Handling:**
    * **Implementation:** Use `os.Lstat` to detect symlinks and implement a policy for handling them.
    * **Code-Level:** Add checks to functions that interact with the file system to handle symlinks appropriately.

* **File Locking:**
    * **Implementation:** Use a file locking mechanism (like `flock` if available on the target OS) to prevent race conditions.
    * **Code-Level:** Wrap file modification/deletion operations in a critical section protected by a file lock.

* **Unit and Integration Tests:**
    * **Implementation:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests to verify the correctness of the authorization logic and input validation.
    * **Code-Level:** Create test cases that cover various attack scenarios, including path traversal, authorization bypass, and race conditions.
