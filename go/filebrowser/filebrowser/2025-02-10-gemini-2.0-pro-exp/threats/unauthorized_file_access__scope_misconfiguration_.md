Okay, let's break down this threat with a deep analysis.

## Deep Analysis: Unauthorized File Access (Scope Misconfiguration) in File Browser

### 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Unauthorized File Access (Scope Misconfiguration)" threat against a web application utilizing the `filebrowser/filebrowser` project.  This includes identifying the root causes, potential attack vectors, and effective mitigation strategies, focusing on both configuration best practices and the underlying code-level vulnerabilities.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to prevent this critical vulnerability.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `filebrowser/filebrowser` component and its handling of file paths and access control.  We will examine:

*   **Configuration:**  The `filebrowser.json` (or equivalent configuration mechanism) and how `scope` and `rules` are defined and interpreted.
*   **Code:** The Go code within the `filebrowser/filebrowser` repository responsible for:
    *   Request parsing and URL handling.
    *   Path validation and canonicalization.
    *   Authorization checks based on `scope` and `rules`.
    *   Error handling related to file access.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Specific methods an attacker might use to exploit misconfigurations or code vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Both configuration-based and code-level defenses.

We will *not* cover general web application security best practices (e.g., input validation for other parts of the application, XSS prevention) except where they directly relate to File Browser's file access mechanisms. We also will not cover vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or web server, assuming those are configured securely.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Configuration Review:**  Analyze example `filebrowser.json` configurations, highlighting both secure and insecure setups.  Identify common misconfigurations that could lead to unauthorized access.
2.  **Code Analysis (Static):**  Examine the relevant Go source code in the `filebrowser/filebrowser` GitHub repository.  Identify the specific functions and code blocks responsible for handling file paths, access control, and error handling.  Look for potential vulnerabilities like:
    *   Insufficient path sanitization.
    *   Incorrect use of `filepath.Clean()` or similar functions.
    *   Logic errors in authorization checks.
    *   Improper handling of symbolic links.
    *   Regular expression vulnerabilities in `rules`.
3.  **Attack Vector Identification:**  Based on the configuration and code analysis, define specific attack vectors an attacker could use.  This will include:
    *   Path traversal attempts (e.g., `../`, `./`, absolute paths).
    *   Exploitation of symbolic links.
    *   Bypassing regular expression rules.
    *   Manipulating URL parameters related to file paths.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Refine the initial mitigation strategies based on the findings of the code analysis and attack vector identification.  Provide specific code-level recommendations where applicable.
5.  **Testing Recommendations:**  Outline specific testing procedures to validate the effectiveness of the mitigations. This includes both positive (valid access) and negative (invalid access) test cases.

### 4. Deep Analysis

#### 4.1 Configuration Review

A common misconfiguration is setting the `scope` too broadly. For example:

**Insecure Configuration:**

```json
{
  "port": 8080,
  "baseURL": "",
  "address": "",
  "log": "stdout",
  "database": "/path/to/filebrowser.db",
  "root": "/srv/www", // Too broad!  Gives access to the entire webroot.
  "commands": [],
  "users": [
    {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "admin_password_hash",
      "scope": ".", // Refers to the "root" - also too broad!
      "locale": "",
      "viewMode": "mosaic",
      "singleClick": false,
      "perm": {
        "admin": true,
        "execute": true,
        "create": true,
        "rename": true,
        "modify": true,
        "delete": true,
        "share": true,
        "download": true
      },
      "rules": []
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration grants the "admin" user access to the entire `/srv/www` directory.  If there are sensitive files or directories within the webroot (e.g., configuration files, backup files, source code), the attacker could access them.

**Secure Configuration (Example):**

```json
{
  "port": 8080,
  "baseURL": "",
  "address": "",
  "log": "stdout",
  "database": "/path/to/filebrowser.db",
  "root": "/srv/www", // Still the webroot, but scope is restricted below.
  "commands": [],
  "users": [
    {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "admin_password_hash",
      "scope": "/srv/www/uploads", // Much more restrictive!
      "locale": "",
      "viewMode": "mosaic",
      "singleClick": false,
      "perm": {
        "admin": true,
        "execute": true,
        "create": true,
        "rename": true,
        "modify": true,
        "delete": true,
        "share": true,
        "download": true
      },
      "rules": [
          {"allow": false, "regex": "\\.php$"}, // Prevent access to PHP files
          {"allow": true, "regex": ".*"} // Allow everything else within the scope
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration restricts the "admin" user to the `/srv/www/uploads` directory.  Even though the `root` is still `/srv/www`, the `scope` limits access. The `rules` further restrict access, preventing the user from viewing PHP files even within the `uploads` directory.

#### 4.2 Code Analysis (Static)

Key areas of the `filebrowser/filebrowser` code to examine include:

*   **`http/request.go` (and related files):**  This is likely where incoming HTTP requests are parsed, and the requested file path is extracted.  We need to see how the URL path is handled, whether it's decoded, and how it's passed to other functions.
*   **`files/handler.go` (and related files):**  This likely contains the core logic for handling file operations (read, write, delete, etc.).  We need to examine:
    *   **Path Sanitization:**  How is the requested path cleaned and validated?  Is `filepath.Clean()` used correctly?  Are there any custom sanitization routines?  Are symbolic links handled securely?
    *   **Authorization Checks:**  How are the `scope` and `rules` from the configuration applied?  Is the cleaned path checked against the allowed scope?  Are the regular expressions in `rules` correctly compiled and applied?  Are there any potential bypasses?
    *   **Error Handling:**  What happens if a path is invalid or access is denied?  Are error messages informative but not revealing sensitive information?

**Potential Vulnerabilities (Hypothetical Examples):**

*   **Insufficient `filepath.Clean()` Usage:** If `filepath.Clean()` is used *before* checking against the `scope`, an attacker might be able to use a path like `/srv/www/uploads/../../sensitive_file` to bypass the scope restriction.  `filepath.Clean()` would resolve this to `/srv/sensitive_file`, which might be outside the intended scope but still within the `root`. The correct approach is to check the *original* path against the scope *before* cleaning.
*   **Symbolic Link Vulnerability:** If File Browser doesn't properly handle symbolic links, an attacker could create a symbolic link within the allowed scope that points to a file outside the scope.
*   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):**  Poorly crafted regular expressions in `rules` could be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks, where a specially crafted input causes the regular expression engine to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.
* **Double Decoding Vulnerability:** If the application double-decodes the URL, an attacker could bypass restrictions. For example, `%2e%2e%2f` decodes to `../`, but if double decoded, it could bypass filters looking for `../`.

#### 4.3 Attack Vector Identification

Based on the above, potential attack vectors include:

1.  **Basic Path Traversal:**
    *   `http://example.com/files/../config.yaml` (if `scope` is too broad)
    *   `http://example.com/files/uploads/../config.yaml` (if `scope` is `/srv/www/uploads` but the check is flawed)
2.  **Symbolic Link Attack:**
    *   Create a symbolic link within the `uploads` directory: `ln -s /etc/passwd uploads/passwd_link`
    *   Access the link via File Browser: `http://example.com/files/uploads/passwd_link`
3.  **Regular Expression Bypass:**
    *   If a rule tries to block `.php` files with a flawed regex like `.*\.php`, an attacker might be able to bypass it with a carefully crafted filename.
4.  **Double Decoding Attack:**
    *   `http://example.com/files/%252e%252e%252fconfig.yaml` (if double decoding occurs)
5. **Null Byte Injection:**
    *   `http://example.com/files/uploads/image.jpg%00.php` (if the code doesn't handle null bytes correctly, it might treat this as a PHP file)

#### 4.4 Mitigation Strategy Refinement

1.  **Strict Scope and Root:**
    *   Define `scope` to be the *absolute minimum* directory required for each user.
    *   Consider setting `root` to a dedicated directory for File Browser, separate from the main webroot, to further isolate it.
2.  **Granular Rules:**
    *   Use `rules` to restrict access to specific file types and subdirectories within the `scope`.
    *   Prefer simple, restrictive rules over complex regular expressions.
    *   Test all rules thoroughly.
3.  **Code-Level Path Sanitization (Critical):**
    *   **Canonicalize *after* Scope Check:**  The *original*, uncleaned path must be checked against the `scope` *before* any cleaning or canonicalization is performed.
    *   **`filepath.Clean()` is Necessary, But Not Sufficient:** Use `filepath.Clean()` to normalize paths, but understand its limitations. It primarily handles `.` and `..` components.
    *   **Absolute Path Prevention:** Explicitly prevent access to absolute paths (paths starting with `/`) unless absolutely necessary and carefully controlled.
    *   **Symbolic Link Handling:**  Decide on a policy for symbolic links:
        *   **Disallow:**  The simplest and safest option is to completely disallow access to files via symbolic links.
        *   **Follow (Carefully):** If symbolic links must be followed, ensure that the *target* of the link is also within the allowed `scope`. This requires careful checking.
    *   **Null Byte Handling:** Ensure that null bytes are handled correctly and do not allow attackers to bypass file extension checks.
    *   **Double Decoding Prevention:** Ensure that the application does not double-decode URLs.
4.  **Regular Expression Best Practices:**
    *   Avoid overly complex regular expressions.
    *   Use a regular expression tester to validate expressions and check for ReDoS vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a dedicated regular expression library with built-in ReDoS protection.
5.  **Secure Error Handling:**
    *   Do not reveal sensitive information in error messages (e.g., full file paths, server configuration details).
    *   Log detailed error information (including the original requested path) for auditing and debugging purposes, but do not expose this information to the user.

#### 4.5 Testing Recommendations

1.  **Positive Tests:**
    *   Verify that authorized users can access files and directories within their allowed `scope`.
    *   Test different file types and directory structures.
2.  **Negative Tests (Crucial):**
    *   **Path Traversal:** Attempt to access files outside the `scope` using various path traversal techniques (`../`, `./`, absolute paths, encoded characters).
    *   **Symbolic Link Attacks:** Create symbolic links within the `scope` that point to files outside the `scope` and attempt to access them.
    *   **Regular Expression Bypass:** Try to bypass any regular expression rules using carefully crafted filenames.
    *   **Double Decoding:** Test with double-encoded URLs.
    *   **Null Byte Injection:** Test with filenames containing null bytes.
    *   **Boundary Conditions:** Test with very long paths, paths with special characters, and empty paths.
    *   **Concurrent Requests:** Test with multiple concurrent requests to identify potential race conditions.
3.  **Automated Testing:**
    *   Integrate these tests into an automated testing framework to ensure continuous security.
    *   Use a web application security scanner to identify potential vulnerabilities.
