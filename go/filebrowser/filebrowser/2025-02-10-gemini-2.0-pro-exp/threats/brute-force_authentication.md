Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Brute-Force Authentication" threat for the `filebrowser/filebrowser` application.

## Deep Analysis: Brute-Force Authentication Threat for File Browser

### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Brute-Force Authentication" threat against the `filebrowser/filebrowser` application.  This includes:

*   Identifying the specific attack vectors and vulnerabilities that make brute-force attacks possible.
*   Assessing the effectiveness of existing and proposed mitigation strategies.
*   Providing concrete recommendations for strengthening the application's defenses against this threat.
*   Determining the residual risk after implementing mitigations.
*   Identifying any gaps in monitoring and detection capabilities related to brute-force attempts.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the authentication mechanisms of the `filebrowser/filebrowser` application, as exposed through its web interface and any relevant API endpoints.  The scope includes:

*   **Login Form:** The primary web-based login form.
*   **API Authentication:**  Any API endpoints that handle user authentication (e.g., if the application uses API keys or tokens for programmatic access).
*   **Password Handling:**  How passwords are processed, validated, and stored (although we won't have direct access to the database, we'll analyze the code handling these aspects).
*   **Session Management:** How sessions are created and maintained after successful authentication (to a lesser extent, as this is more directly related to session hijacking, but relevant if weak session IDs could be brute-forced).
*   **Relevant Configuration Files:**  Examining configuration options that might impact authentication security (e.g., settings related to password policies, lockout thresholds, etc.).
*   **Underlying Libraries:** Identifying any third-party libraries used for authentication or cryptography, and assessing their known vulnerabilities.

The scope *excludes* attacks that bypass authentication entirely (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in the web server itself or other services running on the same host).  It also excludes social engineering attacks.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Code Review:**  We will examine the `filebrowser/filebrowser` source code (available on GitHub) to identify the specific functions and logic responsible for authentication.  We'll look for:
    *   Password validation routines.
    *   Implementation of rate limiting or account lockout.
    *   Use of secure password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    *   Any custom authentication logic that might introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):** We will set up a local instance of `filebrowser/filebrowser` and perform controlled brute-force attacks using tools like:
    *   **Burp Suite:**  A web security testing tool that can automate password guessing attacks.
    *   **Hydra:**  A command-line tool specifically designed for brute-forcing various network services.
    *   **Custom Scripts:**  Python scripts using libraries like `requests` to simulate login attempts.
    *   We will test the effectiveness of any implemented rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.
*   **Configuration Review:** We will examine the default configuration files and any documentation related to security settings to understand how the application can be configured to mitigate brute-force attacks.
*   **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities in `filebrowser/filebrowser` and any of its dependencies that could be related to authentication weaknesses.  This includes checking:
    *   **CVE Databases:**  (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
    *   **GitHub Issues:**  The project's issue tracker.
    *   **Security Forums and Blogs:**  Online resources discussing web application security.
*   **Threat Modeling (Review):** We will revisit the existing threat model to ensure it accurately reflects the findings of our analysis and to identify any gaps.

### 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat

#### 4.1. Attack Vectors

*   **Web Login Form:** The most obvious attack vector is the standard web-based login form.  Attackers can use automated tools to submit thousands of username/password combinations.
*   **API Endpoints (if applicable):** If `filebrowser/filebrowser` exposes API endpoints that require authentication, these could also be targeted by brute-force attacks.  This is especially relevant if the API uses basic authentication or simple token-based authentication without proper rate limiting.
*   **Forgotten Password Functionality:** If the application has a "forgot password" feature, this could be abused to try and guess usernames or security questions, potentially leading to account takeover. This is a separate threat, but often targeted alongside brute-force.
* **Default Credentials:** If default credentials are not changed after installation.

#### 4.2. Vulnerability Analysis (Code Review & Dynamic Testing)

Let's break down the analysis based on the mitigation strategies:

*   **Strong Password Policies:**
    *   **Code Review:** We need to examine the code (likely in files like `users.go`, `auth.go`, or similar) to see how password complexity is enforced.  Look for regular expressions or other validation logic that checks for:
        *   Minimum length.
        *   Presence of uppercase and lowercase letters.
        *   Presence of numbers.
        *   Presence of special characters.
        *   *Absence* of common password patterns (e.g., "password123").
    *   **Dynamic Testing:** We'll attempt to create accounts with weak passwords (e.g., "123456", "password") to see if the application rejects them.
    *   **Findings (Example):**  Let's assume the code review reveals that the minimum password length is only 6 characters, and there are no requirements for special characters.  This is a weakness. Dynamic testing confirms that we can create an account with the password "abcdef".

*   **Account Lockout:**
    *   **Code Review:** We need to find the code that handles failed login attempts.  Look for:
        *   A counter that tracks failed attempts.
        *   A mechanism to store this counter (e.g., in a database or in-memory cache).
        *   Logic to lock the account (temporarily or permanently) after a threshold is reached.
        *   A way to unlock the account (e.g., after a timeout or through administrator intervention).
        *   Protection against race conditions (multiple simultaneous login attempts).
    *   **Dynamic Testing:** We'll repeatedly submit incorrect passwords to see if the account gets locked out.  We'll also test different lockout durations and unlock mechanisms.
    *   **Findings (Example):**  The code review might reveal that account lockout is implemented, but the counter is stored in memory and is reset on server restart.  This is a vulnerability, as an attacker could potentially trigger a server restart to bypass the lockout. Dynamic testing shows that after 5 failed attempts, the account is locked for 5 minutes.

*   **Rate Limiting (Authentication Attempts):**
    *   **Code Review:**  We need to find code that limits the number of login attempts allowed from a single IP address or user within a given time period.  Look for:
        *   Use of middleware or libraries that implement rate limiting.
        *   Configuration options for setting rate limits (e.g., requests per minute).
        *   Storage of rate limiting data (e.g., in memory, Redis, or a database).
        *   Handling of edge cases (e.g., what happens when the rate limit is exceeded).
    *   **Dynamic Testing:** We'll use tools like Burp Suite or custom scripts to send a large number of login requests in a short period.  We'll observe whether the application throttles these requests.
    *   **Findings (Example):**  The code review might show that rate limiting is implemented using a simple in-memory counter, but it only applies to successful login attempts.  Failed attempts are not rate-limited.  This is a major vulnerability. Dynamic testing confirms that we can send hundreds of failed login attempts per second without being blocked.

* **Password Storage:**
    * **Code Review:** Check how passwords are being stored. They should be hashed using strong, one-way hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2. Check if salt is being used.
    * **Findings (Example):** Code review shows that passwords are being hashed using bcrypt with randomly generated salt.

#### 4.3. Configuration Review

*   We'll examine the `filebrowser` configuration files (e.g., `filebrowser.json` or environment variables) for settings related to:
    *   `PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH`
    *   `PASSWORD_REQUIRE_UPPERCASE`
    *   `PASSWORD_REQUIRE_LOWERCASE`
    *   `PASSWORD_REQUIRE_NUMBER`
    *   `PASSWORD_REQUIRE_SYMBOL`
    *   `LOGIN_ATTEMPTS_THRESHOLD`
    *   `LOGIN_LOCKOUT_DURATION`
    *   `RATE_LIMIT_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`
    *   `RATE_LIMIT_LOGIN_DURATION`
*   We'll check the default values for these settings and whether they can be easily modified by administrators.

#### 4.4. Vulnerability Research

*   We'll search CVE databases, GitHub issues, and security forums for any known vulnerabilities in `filebrowser/filebrowser` related to authentication.
*   We'll also research vulnerabilities in any third-party libraries used for authentication.

#### 4.5. Residual Risk

After implementing the mitigation strategies, some residual risk will likely remain.  This could include:

*   **Sophisticated Attacks:**  Highly targeted attacks using advanced techniques (e.g., distributed brute-force attacks, credential stuffing) might still be possible, although they would be significantly more difficult.
*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  Undiscovered vulnerabilities in `filebrowser/filebrowser` or its dependencies could be exploited.
*   **User Error:**  Users might still choose weak passwords, even with strong password policies in place.
*   **Compromised Credentials:** If a user's credentials are stolen from another service (e.g., through a data breach), they could be used to access `filebrowser/filebrowser`.

### 5. Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following:

1.  **Strengthen Password Policies:**
    *   Increase the minimum password length to at least 12 characters.
    *   Require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    *   Consider using a password strength meter to provide feedback to users.
    *   Reject common passwords and patterns.

2.  **Improve Account Lockout:**
    *   Store the failed login attempt counter in a persistent storage (e.g., database) to prevent it from being reset on server restart.
    *   Implement a gradually increasing lockout duration (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour).
    *   Consider implementing a CAPTCHA after a few failed attempts.
    *   Provide a clear and secure mechanism for users to unlock their accounts (e.g., email verification).

3.  **Implement Robust Rate Limiting:**
    *   Rate-limit *both* successful and failed login attempts.
    *   Use a sliding window approach to track attempts over time.
    *   Consider using a distributed rate limiting solution (e.g., Redis) if the application is deployed in a clustered environment.
    *   Log rate limiting events for monitoring and auditing.

4.  **API Security:**
    *   If API endpoints are used, implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys with proper scoping and rate limiting).
    *   Avoid using basic authentication.

5.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.

6.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   Keep all dependencies up to date to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Use a dependency scanning tool to identify vulnerable libraries.

7.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious authentication activity (e.g., high numbers of failed login attempts, access from unusual locations).
    *   Log all authentication events (successes and failures) for auditing and forensic analysis.

8.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    *   Strongly consider implementing 2FA to provide an additional layer of security. This would significantly mitigate the risk of brute-force attacks, even if passwords are weak.

9. **Forgotten Password Functionality:**
    * Implement secure reset tokens.
    * Use email verification.
    * Rate limit password reset requests.

### 6. Conclusion

Brute-force authentication is a serious threat to the `filebrowser/filebrowser` application. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this analysis, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks and protect user accounts and data.  Continuous monitoring, regular security audits, and staying informed about emerging threats are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture. The most impactful immediate improvements are implementing robust rate limiting on *failed* login attempts, strengthening password policies, and ensuring the account lockout mechanism is persistent. Adding 2FA would provide the strongest defense against this threat.
