# Threat Model Analysis for filebrowser/filebrowser

## Threat: [Default Credentials Exploitation](./threats/default_credentials_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to log in using default or commonly known credentials (e.g., "admin/password") that were not changed during the initial setup. They might try brute-forcing common default credentials. This directly exploits Filebrowser's built-in authentication mechanism.

**Impact:** Successful login grants the attacker full administrative access to Filebrowser, allowing them to browse, upload, download, modify, and delete files within the configured directories. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Authentication module, specifically the login function.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Require users to change default credentials upon the first login.
*   Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity, etc.) within Filebrowser's configuration.
*   Consider implementing account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts within Filebrowser.

## Threat: [Inadequate Access Controls Leading to Unauthorized File Access](./threats/inadequate_access_controls_leading_to_unauthorized_file_access.md)

**Description:** An authenticated user, or an attacker who has gained unauthorized access, can access files and directories beyond their intended permissions due to misconfigured access controls *within Filebrowser*. This directly relates to how Filebrowser manages and enforces permissions.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized individuals, potential modification or deletion of critical files, and privilege escalation within the file system context managed by Filebrowser.

**Affected Component:** Authorization module, permission management logic, file access control functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement granular access controls based on the principle of least privilege *within Filebrowser's configuration*.
*   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions within Filebrowser.
*   Ensure that Filebrowser's permission system correctly reflects the intended file system access restrictions.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerability](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths provided to Filebrowser (e.g., through URL parameters or API calls) to access files and directories outside the intended scope. This is a vulnerability in how Filebrowser handles and validates file paths.

**Impact:** Access to sensitive system files, configuration files, or other restricted data on the server. This could lead to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or even remote code execution if executable files are accessed and triggered.

**Affected Component:** File handling component, specifically functions responsible for resolving and accessing file paths.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all file path inputs *within Filebrowser's codebase*.
*   Use absolute paths internally within Filebrowser to avoid relative path traversal issues.
*   Regularly update Filebrowser to patch known path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Arbitrary File Upload Leading to Malware or Code Execution](./threats/arbitrary_file_upload_leading_to_malware_or_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads malicious files (e.g., web shells, executable code) through Filebrowser's upload functionality. This is a direct consequence of how Filebrowser handles file uploads and validates file types.

**Impact:** Introduction of malware onto the server, potential for remote code execution if the uploaded files are accessed or executed by the server or other users. This can lead to complete server compromise.

**Affected Component:** File upload module, file validation functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict file type validation based on content (magic numbers) rather than just file extensions *within Filebrowser*.
*   Sanitize uploaded file names to prevent injection attacks *within Filebrowser*.
*   Store uploaded files in a location outside the web server's document root and with restricted execution permissions.

## Threat: [Exposure of Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** Filebrowser's configuration files (e.g., `settings.json`, database files if used) are not properly secured and can be accessed by unauthorized users, either through direct file system access *or through vulnerabilities in Filebrowser itself* that allow reading these files.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, user credentials, and other configuration settings, potentially leading to full system compromise or access to connected resources.

**Affected Component:** Configuration loading and handling mechanisms, file system access permissions *within Filebrowser*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store configuration files outside the web server's document root and with restricted access permissions (e.g., 600 or 400).
*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files; use environment variables or a secrets management system.
*   Ensure Filebrowser's internal mechanisms for accessing configuration files are secure.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Management](./threats/insecure_session_management.md)

**Description:** Filebrowser uses weak session management practices, such as predictable session IDs, lack of proper session invalidation, or transmission of session tokens over unencrypted connections (if HTTPS is not enforced). This is a flaw in Filebrowser's session handling implementation.

**Impact:** An attacker can impersonate a legitimate user, gaining access to their files and potentially performing actions on their behalf.

**Affected Component:** Authentication and session management module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure HTTPS is enforced for all connections to Filebrowser.
*   Use cryptographically secure and unpredictable session IDs *within Filebrowser*.
*   Implement proper session invalidation upon logout or after a period of inactivity *within Filebrowser*.
*   Set appropriate session timeouts *within Filebrowser*.
*   Consider using HttpOnly and Secure flags for session cookies.
