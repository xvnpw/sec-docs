## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Filebrowser](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_filebrowser.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success here means the application is compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Upload Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_upload_functionality.md)

This node represents a significant attack surface. If file upload functionality is not properly secured, it opens the door to numerous high-impact attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass File Type Restrictions](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_file_type_restrictions.md)

A crucial control point in preventing malicious file uploads. If bypassed, attackers can upload files that would otherwise be blocked.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload File to Gain Initial Foothold](./attack_tree_paths/upload_file_to_gain_initial_foothold.md)

Successfully uploading a file, even if not immediately executable, can provide a foothold for further attacks, such as deploying a web shell or overwriting sensitive files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Access Control Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_access_control_vulnerabilities.md)

Failure of access control is a fundamental security flaw. If an attacker can bypass authentication or authorization, they can gain unauthorized access to resources and functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication.md)

Circumventing the authentication process grants the attacker full access to the application as a legitimate user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

Insecure configurations, whether default or introduced through misconfiguration, can create significant vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser Code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_filebrowser_code.md)

Direct vulnerabilities within the Filebrowser application itself can allow attackers to bypass intended security measures and gain control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious File & Execute Malicious File](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_file_&_execute_malicious_file.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Bypass File Type Restrictions:** Using techniques like double extensions, MIME type manipulation, or null byte injection to upload executable files despite file type checks.
* **Exploit Vulnerability in File Processing:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in image processing libraries or archive extraction routines to achieve code execution during the upload or processing phase.
* **Leverage File Location for Execution (Upload to Web-Accessible Directory):** Uploading malicious files to directories directly accessible by the web server, allowing them to be executed via a direct HTTP request.
* **Exploit File Inclusion Vulnerabilities:** If the application directly includes uploaded files without proper sanitization, attackers can upload malicious code that will be executed when the application includes the file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload to Web-Accessible Directory](./attack_tree_paths/upload_to_web-accessible_directory.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* Exploiting misconfigurations in Filebrowser or the web server that allow uploads to directories within the web root.
* Leveraging vulnerabilities in Filebrowser that bypass intended upload restrictions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Inclusion Vulnerabilities (if application directly includes uploaded files)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_inclusion_vulnerabilities__if_application_directly_includes_uploaded_files_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* Uploading files containing malicious code (e.g., PHP, JSP) and then manipulating the application to include these files, leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Web Shell (e.g., PHP, JSP)](./attack_tree_paths/upload_web_shell__e_g___php__jsp_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* Bypassing file type restrictions to upload a web shell script.
* Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary file uploads.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Default Credentials:** Using default usernames and passwords that have not been changed.
* **Brute-Force Weak Credentials:** Attempting to guess user credentials through repeated login attempts.
* **Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in Filebrowser's authentication mechanisms.
* **Session Hijacking:** Stealing or intercepting valid session tokens to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials (if not changed)](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials__if_not_changed_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* Simply attempting to log in with the default username and password provided by Filebrowser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Files/Directories Outside Intended Scope (Path Traversal)](./attack_tree_paths/access_filesdirectories_outside_intended_scope__path_traversal_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* Using path traversal sequences (e.g., "../") in file paths provided to Filebrowser to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Default Settings](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_default_settings.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Default Admin Credentials:** Using the default administrator credentials to gain full access.
* **Insecure Permissions Configuration:** Exploiting default permission settings that grant excessive access to files or functionalities.
* **Enabled Features with Security Risks:** Abusing features that are enabled by default but pose security risks if not properly configured or controlled (e.g., public links without proper authentication).

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/default_admin_credentials.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* Attempting to log in with the default administrator username and password.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities within Filebrowser itself](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerabilities_within_filebrowser_itself.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Exploiting Unsafe Deserialization:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Filebrowser handles deserialization of data, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.
* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or components used by Filebrowser.
