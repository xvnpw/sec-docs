# Attack Surface Analysis for filebrowser/filebrowser

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** The application ships with pre-configured default usernames and passwords.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser has default credentials that, if not changed, provide immediate access.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the default username "admin" and password "admin" to log in and gain full control over the file system.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Filebrowser instance and access to the underlying file system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Ensure the initial setup process forcefully requires changing default credentials. Provide clear documentation on how to do this.
        *   **Users:**  Immediately change the default username and password upon installation and initial configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Filename Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_filename_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate filenames during upload or rename operations to access files and directories outside the intended scope.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser's file upload and rename functionalities might not adequately sanitize or validate filenames.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a file named `../../../../etc/passwd`. If not properly handled, this could allow the attacker to overwrite or read sensitive system files.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, potential for arbitrary file read/write, and possible privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation on filenames and paths. Sanitize filenames by removing or encoding potentially dangerous characters (e.g., `..`, `/`, `\`). Use secure file handling APIs that prevent path traversal.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about the filenames of uploaded files, although the primary responsibility lies with the application's handling.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Upload Types](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_upload_types.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows uploading files of any type without proper restrictions.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser's upload functionality might not have sufficient checks on the content or type of uploaded files.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script (web shell) with a `.php` extension. If the web server executes PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker can gain remote command execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, malware distribution, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension. Store uploaded files in a location that is not directly accessible by the web server or is configured to prevent script execution. Consider using a dedicated storage service.
        *   **Users:** Be aware of the risks of uploading executable files. Configure the web server to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directory.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Filenames/Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_filenamescontent.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the application's interface through filenames or file content, which is then executed in other users' browsers.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser displays filenames and potentially previews file content without proper sanitization or encoding.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a file with a filename like `<script>alert("XSS")</script>.txt`. When another user views this filename in Filebrowser, the JavaScript code executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the Filebrowser interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement proper output encoding and sanitization for all user-supplied data displayed in the UI, including filenames and file content previews. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML contexts, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript contexts).
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about clicking on unusual filenames or interacting with potentially suspicious content.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Configuration File](./attack_surfaces/exposed_configuration_file.md)

*   **Description:** The application's configuration file, containing sensitive information, is accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser's configuration file might be stored in a publicly accessible location or have overly permissive access controls.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the `settings.json` file and retrieves database credentials or API keys, allowing them to compromise other systems.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potential for further attacks on related systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Store the configuration file outside the web server's document root. Ensure proper file system permissions are set to restrict access to authorized users only. Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the configuration file if possible (consider using environment variables or a secrets management system).
        *   **Users:** Ensure the Filebrowser installation directory and configuration files have appropriate access restrictions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how user sessions are handled can lead to unauthorized access.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser might use predictable session IDs, lack proper session invalidation, or not enforce secure session cookies.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts a session cookie and uses it to impersonate a legitimate user.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use cryptographically secure random session IDs. Implement proper session invalidation upon logout and after a period of inactivity. Set secure and HTTP-only flags on session cookies to prevent client-side script access and transmission over insecure connections. Consider using a robust session management library.
        *   **Users:** Log out of Filebrowser sessions when finished, especially on shared computers.

## Attack Surface: [Command Execution (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/command_execution__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows users to execute commands directly on the server.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser might have a feature that allows executing system commands, which, if not properly secured, can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the command execution feature to run commands like `rm -rf /` or `netcat` to gain control of the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** **Strongly discourage and ideally remove this feature.** If absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization. Use parameterized commands or whitelisting of allowed commands. Run commands with the least possible privileges.
        *   **Users:** If this feature is enabled, understand the significant risks involved and only use it with extreme caution. Monitor server activity for suspicious commands.
