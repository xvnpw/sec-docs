## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Leverage Insecure Default Settings

This section provides a detailed breakdown of each attack vector within the "Leverage Insecure Default Settings" path.

### 1. Default Admin Credentials

**Description:**

Filebrowser, like many applications, might ship with a default administrator username and password for initial setup and access. If these credentials are well-known, easily guessable, or not immediately changed upon deployment, attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain full administrative control over the application. This grants them the highest level of privileges, allowing them to access, modify, and delete any files, configure settings, and potentially compromise the underlying server.

**Impact:**

* **Complete System Compromise:**  Full administrative access allows attackers to manipulate the application and potentially the underlying operating system.
* **Data Breach:** Access to all files and directories managed by Filebrowser, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.
* **Malware Deployment:**  The ability to upload and execute malicious files on the server.
* **Account Takeover:**  Potential to create new administrative accounts or modify existing ones for persistent access.
* **Denial of Service:**  Configuration changes could disrupt the application's functionality or even crash the server.

**Likelihood:**

The likelihood of this attack vector being successful depends on:

* **Visibility of Default Credentials:**  Are the default credentials easily found in documentation, online forums, or through simple web searches?
* **Enforcement of Password Change:** Does the application force or strongly encourage users to change the default password upon initial login?
* **Complexity of Default Credentials:** Are the default credentials simple and easily guessable (e.g., "admin/password")?

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Eliminate Default Credentials:** The most secure approach is to avoid shipping with any default administrative credentials. Instead, enforce a secure initial setup process where the administrator is required to create their own credentials.
* **Strong Password Policy Enforcement:** If default credentials are unavoidable for initial setup, enforce a strong password policy immediately upon first login, requiring users to change the default to a complex and unique password.
* **Prominent Security Warnings:** Display clear and prominent warnings during the initial setup process about the security risks of using default credentials.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Implement and encourage the use of 2FA for administrative accounts to add an extra layer of security even if default credentials are compromised.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to ensure that default credentials are not inadvertently reintroduced or left unchanged.

**Example Scenario:**

An attacker discovers through online documentation or a simple Google search that the default administrator credentials for a specific version of Filebrowser are "admin" and "password". They attempt to log in to the application using these credentials and successfully gain full administrative access. They then proceed to download sensitive files, modify user permissions, and potentially upload a backdoor for persistent access.

### 2. Insecure Permissions Configuration

**Description:**

Filebrowser relies on a permission system to control access to files and functionalities. If the default permission settings are overly permissive, attackers can exploit this to access resources they shouldn't. This could involve granting excessive read, write, or execute permissions to anonymous users or lower-privileged accounts.

**Impact:**

* **Unauthorized Data Access:**  Users or anonymous individuals gaining access to sensitive files and directories they are not authorized to view.
* **Data Modification or Deletion:**  Unauthorized modification or deletion of files, potentially leading to data corruption or loss.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  Lower-privileged users gaining access to functionalities or resources reserved for administrators.
* **Circumvention of Access Controls:**  Bypassing intended security measures designed to protect specific data or functionalities.

**Likelihood:**

The likelihood of this attack vector being successful depends on:

* **Granularity of Default Permissions:** Are the default permissions overly broad, granting access to a wide range of users or groups?
* **Clarity of Permission Model:** Is the permission model easy to understand and configure correctly, reducing the chance of misconfiguration?
* **Default Role Assignments:** Are default roles assigned with overly broad privileges?
* **Lack of Least Privilege Principle:** Does the default configuration violate the principle of least privilege, granting more access than necessary?

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design default permissions based on the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary access required for basic functionality.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement a robust RBAC system with clearly defined roles and permissions. Ensure default roles have minimal privileges.
* **Secure Default Permissions:** Set restrictive default permissions for files and directories, requiring explicit granting of access.
* **Clear Documentation and Guidance:** Provide clear documentation and guidance on how to configure permissions securely, emphasizing the importance of restricting access.
* **Permission Auditing Tools:**  Provide tools or features that allow administrators to easily audit and review existing permissions to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Permission Reviews:** Encourage regular reviews of permission configurations to ensure they remain appropriate and secure.

**Example Scenario:**

The default configuration of Filebrowser grants read access to all files for any authenticated user. An attacker creates a basic user account and logs in. They are then able to browse and download sensitive files that should have been restricted to a specific group of users.

### 3. Enabled Features with Security Risks

**Description:**

Filebrowser might have features enabled by default that, while offering convenience, pose security risks if not properly configured or controlled. Examples include public link sharing without strong authentication, guest access with excessive privileges, or API endpoints that are accessible without proper authorization.

**Impact:**

* **Unauthenticated Access to Resources:**  Public links or guest access allowing anyone to access files or functionalities without authentication.
* **Data Exposure through Public Links:**  Sensitive files being shared publicly without proper controls, leading to data breaches.
* **Abuse of Functionality:**  Attackers exploiting enabled features for malicious purposes, such as uploading unauthorized files or modifying configurations.
* **API Exploitation:**  Unprotected API endpoints allowing attackers to interact with the application programmatically without proper authorization.

**Likelihood:**

The likelihood of this attack vector being successful depends on:

* **Visibility of Enabled Features:** Are these potentially risky features prominently displayed and easily accessible by default?
* **Strength of Default Configuration for Risky Features:** Are these features enabled with secure default settings (e.g., requiring strong passwords for public links)?
* **User Awareness and Guidance:** Is there clear guidance provided to users about the security implications of these features and how to configure them securely?
* **Availability of Security Controls:** Are there sufficient security controls available to restrict access and usage of these features?

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Disable Risky Features by Default:**  Consider disabling potentially risky features by default and requiring explicit enablement by the administrator.
* **Secure Default Configuration for Risky Features:** If features are enabled by default, ensure they are configured with the most secure settings possible (e.g., requiring passwords for public links, limiting guest access privileges).
* **Granular Control over Feature Access:** Provide granular controls to restrict who can enable and use these potentially risky features.
* **Clear Warnings and Guidance:** Display clear warnings and provide comprehensive guidance about the security implications of these features and how to configure them securely.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring for the usage of these features to detect and respond to potential abuse.
* **Regular Security Reviews of Enabled Features:** Conduct regular security reviews to assess the risks associated with enabled features and ensure they are appropriately configured.

**Example Scenario:**

The public link sharing feature is enabled by default without requiring a password. A user inadvertently shares a sensitive file using a public link. An attacker discovers this link and gains access to the confidential information without any authentication.
