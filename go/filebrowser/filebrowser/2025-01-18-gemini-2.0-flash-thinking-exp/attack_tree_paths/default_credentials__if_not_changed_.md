### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Default Credentials (if not changed)

**Attack Tree Path:** Default Credentials (if not changed)

**Attack Vectors:**

* Simply attempting to log in with the default username and password provided by Filebrowser.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Vulnerability Description:** Filebrowser, like many applications, may ship with default administrative credentials for initial setup and configuration. If these default credentials are not changed by the administrator during or after installation, they become a readily available entry point for attackers.

* **Technical Details:**
    * **Default Credentials:**  The specific default username and password for Filebrowser are publicly known and often documented in the official documentation or easily discoverable through online searches. It's crucial to identify these specific credentials. *(Note: As an AI, I cannot provide the actual default credentials here for security reasons. This information should be readily available in the Filebrowser documentation or through a secure search.)*
    * **Login Mechanism:** The attack relies on the standard login form provided by Filebrowser. An attacker simply needs to enter the default username and password into the respective fields.
    * **Authentication Bypass:** If the default credentials are still active, the authentication mechanism will grant access, bypassing any intended security measures.

* **Impact Assessment:**  A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have severe consequences:
    * **Full Administrative Access:** Gaining access with default credentials typically grants the attacker full administrative privileges within the Filebrowser application.
    * **Data Breach:** The attacker can access, download, modify, or delete any files managed by Filebrowser, leading to a significant data breach.
    * **Malware Upload:** The attacker can upload malicious files to the server through Filebrowser, potentially compromising the server itself or other connected systems.
    * **System Disruption:** The attacker could potentially disrupt the service by deleting critical files or modifying configurations.
    * **Lateral Movement:**  If the Filebrowser instance is running on a server connected to other internal networks, the attacker might use this initial access as a stepping stone to compromise other systems.
    * **Reputation Damage:**  A security breach due to unchanged default credentials reflects poorly on the organization's security practices and can damage its reputation.
    * **Compliance Violations:** Depending on the type of data stored in Filebrowser, a breach could lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

* **Likelihood Assessment:** The likelihood of this attack being successful depends on several factors:
    * **Administrator Awareness:** If the administrator is unaware of the importance of changing default credentials or lacks the technical expertise to do so, the likelihood increases significantly.
    * **Deployment Environment:**  Filebrowser instances exposed to the public internet are at a higher risk compared to those on private networks with restricted access.
    * **Security Practices:** Organizations with poor security practices and a lack of security awareness training are more susceptible.
    * **Ease of Exploitation:** This attack is extremely easy to execute, requiring minimal technical skill. Attackers can simply try the known default credentials.
    * **Automated Attacks:**  Attackers often use automated tools and scripts to scan for systems using default credentials, making this a common target.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**  Several strategies can be implemented to mitigate the risk associated with default credentials:
    * **Mandatory Password Change on First Login:**  The most effective solution is to force users to change the default password upon their first login. This eliminates the risk of the default credentials remaining active.
    * **Strong Password Enforcement:** Implement and enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, etc.) to prevent users from setting weak passwords after changing the default.
    * **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks against the login form, even if default credentials are not changed.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Adding MFA provides an extra layer of security, even if the initial password is compromised.
    * **Security Audits and Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly conduct security audits and vulnerability scans to identify instances where default credentials might still be in use.
    * **Clear Documentation and Prominent Warnings:**  Ensure the documentation clearly highlights the importance of changing default credentials and display prominent warnings during the initial setup process.
    * **Consider Removing Default Credentials:**  Explore the possibility of not including default credentials at all and requiring administrators to set up the initial user account during installation.
    * **Security Awareness Training:** Educate administrators and users about the risks associated with default credentials and the importance of secure password management.

* **Attack Scenario Example:**

    1. An attacker identifies a publicly accessible Filebrowser instance, perhaps through a Shodan search or similar reconnaissance techniques.
    2. The attacker knows or finds the default username and password for Filebrowser.
    3. The attacker navigates to the Filebrowser login page.
    4. The attacker enters the default username and password.
    5. If the administrator has not changed the default credentials, the attacker successfully logs in with full administrative privileges.
    6. The attacker can now browse, download, upload, modify, or delete files, potentially leading to data theft, malware deployment, or service disruption.

**Conclusion:**

The "Default Credentials (if not changed)" attack path represents a significant security vulnerability in Filebrowser. Its ease of exploitation and potentially severe impact make it a high-priority concern. The development team must prioritize implementing robust mitigation strategies, particularly enforcing mandatory password changes on first login, to protect users and their data. Clear communication and warnings during the installation and setup process are also crucial to raise awareness and encourage secure configuration practices. Ignoring this vulnerability leaves Filebrowser installations highly susceptible to compromise.
