### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Default Admin Credentials

**Attack Tree Path:** Default Admin Credentials

**Attack Vectors:**
* Attempting to log in with the default administrator username and password.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

**4.1 Vulnerability Description:**

The core vulnerability lies in the existence and potential persistence of default administrative credentials within the Filebrowser application. Many applications, during their initial setup or as a fallback mechanism, may have pre-configured administrator accounts with well-known usernames and passwords. If these default credentials are not changed by the administrator during or after the initial setup, they become a significant security weakness.

**4.2 Filebrowser Specifics:**

Based on publicly available information and common practices for such applications, it's highly probable that Filebrowser has a default administrator username and password. While the specific credentials might vary depending on the version or installation method, they are often documented or easily discoverable through online searches or by examining default configuration files.

**Common Default Credentials (Hypothetical Examples - Actual values should be verified):**

* **Username:** `admin`
* **Password:** `password`, `admin`, `filebrowser`, `12345`

**4.3 Attack Vector Analysis:**

The attack vector is straightforward: an attacker attempts to log in to the Filebrowser application's administrative interface using the known default username and password. This can be done through:

* **Manual Login Attempts:** The attacker directly accesses the login page of the Filebrowser application and enters the default credentials. This is the simplest and most direct method.
* **Brute-Force Attacks (with a limited scope):**  While a full-scale brute-force attack against a strong password would be time-consuming, attempting a small set of common default credentials is quick and often successful. Attackers might use automated tools to try a list of common default username/password combinations.
* **Scripted Login Attempts:** Attackers can write scripts to automate the login process, making it easier to test multiple default credential combinations.

**4.4 Impact Assessment:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability grants the attacker full administrative access to the Filebrowser application. The potential impact is severe and can include:

* **Unauthorized Access to Files:** The attacker can access, download, and potentially modify or delete any files managed by Filebrowser. This can lead to data breaches, data loss, and compromise of sensitive information.
* **Configuration Changes:** The attacker can modify the application's configuration, potentially disabling security features, adding new users with administrative privileges, or changing access controls to further their malicious objectives.
* **Account Takeover:** The attacker effectively takes over the administrator account, allowing them to maintain persistent access and control over the application.
* **Server Compromise (Indirect):** Depending on the Filebrowser's configuration and the underlying server's security, the attacker might be able to leverage their administrative access within Filebrowser to gain access to the server itself. This could involve uploading malicious files or exploiting other vulnerabilities.
* **Denial of Service:** The attacker could intentionally disrupt the service by deleting critical files or misconfiguring the application.

**4.5 Likelihood Assessment:**

The likelihood of this attack being successful is **high**, especially if the administrator has not changed the default credentials. Factors contributing to this high likelihood include:

* **Ease of Discovery:** Default credentials are often publicly known or easily guessed.
* **Common Oversight:** Administrators may forget or neglect to change default credentials during the initial setup.
* **Lack of Awareness:** Some administrators may not be aware of the security risks associated with default credentials.
* **Automation:** Attackers can easily automate the process of trying common default credentials.

**4.6 Mitigation Strategies:**

Preventing this attack is relatively straightforward and relies on basic security hygiene:

* **Mandatory Password Change on First Login:** The application should force the administrator to change the default password upon the initial login.
* **Strong Password Enforcement:** Implement password complexity requirements to prevent the use of weak or easily guessable passwords.
* **Unique Default Credentials per Instance:** If default credentials are absolutely necessary, generate unique random credentials for each installation instance.
* **Clear Documentation and Prompts:** Provide clear instructions and prompts during the setup process emphasizing the importance of changing default credentials.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review user accounts and permissions to ensure no default accounts remain active.
* **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks by temporarily disabling accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect suspicious login attempts, especially those using default usernames. Alert administrators to unusual activity.
* **Security Best Practices Education:** Educate administrators about the importance of secure password management and the risks associated with default credentials.

**4.7 Detection and Monitoring:**

Detecting attempts to exploit this vulnerability can be achieved through:

* **Login Attempt Monitoring:**  Actively monitor login logs for failed login attempts, especially those using common default usernames like "admin".
* **Alerting on Multiple Failed Attempts:** Configure alerts to trigger when multiple failed login attempts originate from the same IP address or user account.
* **Anomaly Detection:**  Establish baseline login patterns and identify unusual login activity, such as logins from unfamiliar locations or at unusual times.

**5. Conclusion:**

The "Default Admin Credentials" attack path represents a significant and easily exploitable vulnerability in the Filebrowser application if default credentials are not changed. The potential impact of successful exploitation is severe, granting attackers full administrative control. Implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly enforcing a password change on first login and promoting strong password practices, is crucial to securing the application and protecting sensitive data. Regular security audits and monitoring for suspicious login activity are also essential for early detection and response to potential attacks.
