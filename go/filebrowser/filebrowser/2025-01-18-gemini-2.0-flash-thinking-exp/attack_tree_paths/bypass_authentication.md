### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Bypass Authentication

#### 4.1 Attack Vector: Default Credentials

**Description:** This attack vector relies on the common practice of users failing to change default usernames and passwords after installing or configuring software. If Filebrowser ships with default credentials or if default credentials are easily guessable based on the application name or common patterns, attackers can use these to gain immediate access.

**Likelihood:** The likelihood of this attack being successful depends on whether Filebrowser has default credentials and how prominently this information is available (e.g., in documentation or online forums). If default credentials exist and are widely known, the likelihood is **high**, especially for less security-conscious users or deployments.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker full administrative access to the Filebrowser instance, allowing them to:
* Access, modify, and delete any files managed by Filebrowser.
* Potentially upload malicious files.
* Gain insights into the server's file structure and potentially other sensitive information.
* Depending on the server configuration, potentially pivot to other systems on the network.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser:**
* **Hardcoded default credentials:**  The application itself might contain default usernames and passwords.
* **Predictable default credentials:**  The default credentials might follow a simple pattern (e.g., username: admin, password: password).
* **Lack of enforced password change on first login:** Filebrowser might not force users to change default credentials upon initial setup.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Eliminate default credentials:**  The most effective mitigation is to avoid shipping Filebrowser with any default credentials.
* **Force password change on first login:** Implement a mechanism that requires users to set a new, strong password during the initial setup process.
* **Strong password policy enforcement:**  Encourage or enforce the use of strong, unique passwords.
* **Security hardening documentation:** Clearly document the importance of changing default credentials and provide guidance on creating strong passwords.
* **Regular security audits:** Periodically review the codebase and configuration for any potential instances of default credentials.

#### 4.2 Attack Vector: Brute-Force Weak Credentials

**Description:** This attack involves an attacker systematically trying various username and password combinations to guess valid credentials. The effectiveness of this attack depends on the complexity of user passwords and the presence of account lockout mechanisms.

**Likelihood:** The likelihood of success depends on several factors:
* **Password complexity:** If users choose weak or easily guessable passwords, the likelihood increases.
* **Presence of account lockout:** If Filebrowser implements account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts, the likelihood decreases significantly.
* **Rate limiting:** Implementing rate limiting on login attempts can slow down brute-force attacks.
* **Availability of valid usernames:** Attackers might need to guess usernames as well, which adds complexity.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker access to the targeted user's account, with the privileges associated with that account. This could range from read-only access to full administrative control, depending on the compromised account.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser:**
* **Lack of account lockout:**  Allowing unlimited login attempts makes brute-force attacks feasible.
* **No rate limiting on login attempts:**  Attackers can make numerous attempts quickly without being blocked.
* **Weak password policy:**  Not enforcing strong password requirements encourages users to choose easily guessable passwords.
* **Information disclosure:** Error messages that reveal whether a username exists can aid attackers in targeting valid accounts.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement account lockout:**  Temporarily disable accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
* **Implement rate limiting:**  Restrict the number of login attempts from a specific IP address within a given timeframe.
* **Enforce strong password policies:**  Require passwords of a certain length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and prevent the use of common passwords.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Adding an extra layer of security beyond passwords significantly reduces the effectiveness of brute-force attacks.
* **CAPTCHA or similar challenge-response mechanisms:**  Help differentiate between human users and automated bots attempting brute-force attacks.
* **Security logging and monitoring:**  Log failed login attempts and monitor for suspicious activity.

#### 4.3 Attack Vector: Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser

**Description:** This attack vector involves exploiting flaws in Filebrowser's authentication logic to bypass the normal login process. These vulnerabilities could be due to coding errors, design flaws, or the use of insecure libraries. This includes both known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and zero-day vulnerabilities.

**Likelihood:** The likelihood of this attack being successful depends on:
* **Presence of vulnerabilities:**  Whether such vulnerabilities exist in the current version of Filebrowser.
* **Public disclosure of vulnerabilities:**  Known vulnerabilities are easier for attackers to exploit.
* **Patching practices:**  If the development team is quick to patch vulnerabilities, the window of opportunity for attackers is smaller.
* **Complexity of the vulnerability:** Some vulnerabilities are easier to exploit than others.

**Impact:** The impact of successfully exploiting an authentication bypass vulnerability is severe. It can grant attackers complete access to the Filebrowser instance, potentially with administrative privileges, regardless of valid user credentials.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser:**
* **SQL Injection:**  Flaws in database queries that allow attackers to manipulate SQL statements to bypass authentication checks.
* **Authentication logic errors:**  Bugs in the code that handles user authentication, allowing bypass under specific conditions.
* **Path traversal vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting flaws in how file paths are handled to access restricted resources without authentication.
* **Insecure deserialization:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how data is deserialized to execute arbitrary code and bypass authentication.
* **Use of vulnerable dependencies:**  Filebrowser might rely on third-party libraries with known authentication bypass vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure coding practices:**  Implement secure coding guidelines to minimize the introduction of vulnerabilities.
* **Regular security audits and penetration testing:**  Proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Vulnerability scanning:**  Use automated tools to scan the codebase for known vulnerabilities.
* **Dependency management:**  Keep third-party libraries up-to-date and monitor for security advisories.
* **Input validation and sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
* **Principle of least privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and processes.
* **Stay informed about security vulnerabilities:**  Monitor security news and advisories related to Filebrowser and its dependencies.
* **Implement a robust patching process:**  Quickly apply security patches to address known vulnerabilities.

#### 4.4 Attack Vector: Session Hijacking

**Description:** Session hijacking involves an attacker stealing or intercepting a valid session token belonging to an authenticated user. This allows the attacker to impersonate the legitimate user without needing their actual credentials.

**Likelihood:** The likelihood of this attack depends on:
* **Security of session token management:** How securely session tokens are generated, stored, and transmitted.
* **Network security:**  Whether the network connection is secured (HTTPS) to prevent eavesdropping.
* **Client-side security:**  Vulnerabilities on the user's machine (e.g., malware) could allow attackers to steal session tokens.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities:**  XSS can be used to steal session tokens.

**Impact:** Successful session hijacking allows the attacker to perform any actions the legitimate user is authorized to perform, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or other malicious activities.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser:**
* **Insecure session token generation:**  Using predictable or easily guessable session tokens.
* **Lack of HTTPS enforcement:**  Transmitting session tokens over unencrypted HTTP connections makes them vulnerable to interception.
* **Session fixation vulnerabilities:**  Allowing attackers to set the session ID for a user.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities:**  Attackers can inject malicious scripts to steal session tokens.
* **Lack of HTTPOnly and Secure flags on session cookies:**  These flags help protect session cookies from client-side scripts and insecure connections.
* **Long session timeouts:**  Leaving sessions active for extended periods increases the window of opportunity for hijacking.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce HTTPS:**  Ensure all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.
* **Generate strong, unpredictable session tokens:**  Use cryptographically secure random number generators.
* **Set HTTPOnly and Secure flags on session cookies:**  Prevent client-side scripts from accessing session cookies and ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS.
* **Implement session timeouts and inactivity timeouts:**  Automatically invalidate sessions after a period of inactivity or after a set duration.
* **Regenerate session tokens after login:**  Prevent session fixation attacks.
* **Protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Implement robust input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Implement proper session management:**  Store session tokens securely on the server-side.
* **Consider using HttpOnly and Secure flags for cookies:** This prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie and ensures it's only sent over HTTPS.
* **Educate users about the risks of using public Wi-Fi:**  Unsecured networks make session hijacking easier.
