### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Upload Malicious File & Execute Malicious File

This attack path involves two key stages: successfully uploading a malicious file and then executing that file within the context of the Filebrowser application or the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**

#### 4.1. Bypass File Type Restrictions

**Description:** Attackers attempt to circumvent file type checks implemented by the application to prevent the upload of executable or otherwise harmful files.

**Filebrowser Relevance:** Filebrowser likely implements file type restrictions to prevent users from uploading arbitrary executable files that could compromise the server or other users. This vector targets weaknesses in these restrictions.

**Technical Details & Examples:**

* **Double Extensions:** Uploading a file with a name like `evil.txt.exe`. The application might only check the first extension (`.txt`) and allow the upload. The operating system, however, might recognize the last extension (`.exe`) for execution.
* **MIME Type Manipulation:** Modifying the `Content-Type` header in the HTTP request to a permitted type (e.g., `image/jpeg`) while uploading an executable file. The server might rely solely on this header for validation.
* **Null Byte Injection:** Inserting a null byte (`%00`) into the filename (e.g., `evil.exe%00.txt`). Some systems might truncate the filename at the null byte, effectively bypassing checks on the intended extension.
* **Magic Byte Spoofing:**  Adding the "magic bytes" of a permitted file type (e.g., the GIF header) to the beginning of a malicious executable file. Basic file signature checks might be fooled.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser:**

* **Client-side validation only:** Relying solely on JavaScript for file type validation, which can be easily bypassed by manipulating the browser or intercepting the request.
* **Weak server-side validation:**  Using simple string matching on file extensions without considering case sensitivity or multiple extensions.
* **Ignoring or incorrectly parsing MIME types.**

**Attacker Steps:**

1. Craft a malicious file (e.g., a reverse shell executable).
2. Employ one of the bypass techniques to modify the filename or HTTP request headers.
3. Attempt to upload the modified file through the Filebrowser interface.

**Impact:** Successful bypass allows the attacker to upload executable files to the server.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Robust Server-Side Validation:** Implement strict server-side validation that checks file extensions, MIME types (after proper parsing), and potentially file signatures (magic bytes).
* **Use a Whitelist Approach:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed file extensions and MIME types instead of a blacklist.
* **Sanitize Filenames:**  Remove potentially harmful characters and enforce a consistent naming convention.
* **Consider Deep Content Inspection:** For sensitive applications, consider using libraries that can analyze the actual content of the file to determine its type, regardless of the extension or MIME type.

#### 4.2. Exploit Vulnerability in File Processing

**Description:** Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in libraries or routines used by Filebrowser to process uploaded files (e.g., image resizing, archive extraction) to achieve code execution.

**Filebrowser Relevance:** Filebrowser might use libraries to generate thumbnails for images, extract contents of archives (like ZIP files), or perform other operations on uploaded files. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited.

**Technical Details & Examples:**

* **Image Processing Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting bugs in libraries like ImageMagick or Pillow (used for image manipulation) to trigger buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues that can lead to remote code execution. Examples include exploiting specific image formats or malformed image headers.
* **Archive Extraction Vulnerabilities (Zip Slip):** Crafting malicious ZIP archives that, when extracted, write files outside the intended destination directory, potentially overwriting system files or placing executable files in accessible locations.
* **Document Processing Vulnerabilities:** If Filebrowser attempts to preview or process documents (like PDFs or Office documents), vulnerabilities in the parsing libraries could be exploited.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser:**

* **Using outdated or vulnerable versions of third-party libraries.**
* **Insufficient input validation when processing file contents.**
* **Lack of proper sandboxing or isolation during file processing.**

**Attacker Steps:**

1. Identify the file processing functionalities used by Filebrowser.
2. Research known vulnerabilities in the relevant libraries.
3. Craft a malicious file that exploits the identified vulnerability.
4. Upload the malicious file through the Filebrowser interface.
5. Trigger the vulnerable processing routine (e.g., by requesting a thumbnail or attempting to extract the archive).

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update all third-party libraries used by Filebrowser to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize file content before passing it to processing libraries.
* **Secure File Processing:** Implement secure file processing practices, such as:
    * **Sandboxing:** Run file processing tasks in isolated environments with limited privileges.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the user account running the file processing service has only the necessary permissions.
    * **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (e.g., memory, CPU time) for file processing to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.

#### 4.3. Leverage File Location for Execution (Upload to Web-Accessible Directory)

**Description:** Attackers upload malicious files to directories that are directly accessible by the web server. This allows them to execute the file by simply requesting its URL.

**Filebrowser Relevance:** If Filebrowser stores uploaded files in a directory that is served by the web server (e.g., within the `public_html` or `www` directory), these files can be accessed directly via HTTP.

**Technical Details & Examples:**

* Uploading a PHP script containing malicious code (e.g., a web shell) to a web-accessible directory. The attacker can then access the script via its URL and execute commands on the server.
* Uploading an executable file (if file type restrictions are bypassed) to a web-accessible directory and then accessing it directly through the browser.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser:**

* **Default configuration placing uploaded files in a web-accessible directory.**
* **Lack of proper configuration options to control the storage location of uploaded files.**
* **Insufficient access controls on the upload directory.**

**Attacker Steps:**

1. Identify the directory where Filebrowser stores uploaded files.
2. Determine if this directory is directly accessible by the web server.
3. Upload a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script) to this directory.
4. Access the malicious file via its URL in a web browser.

**Impact:**  Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by directly accessing the uploaded malicious file.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Store Uploaded Files Outside the Web Root:**  The most effective mitigation is to store uploaded files in a directory that is *not* directly accessible by the web server.
* **Implement Access Controls:**  Configure the web server to prevent direct execution of files in the upload directory. This can be done using `.htaccess` files (for Apache) or similar configurations for other web servers.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources, mitigating the impact of potentially executed malicious scripts.
* **Consider a Separate File Serving Mechanism:**  Instead of directly serving files from the upload directory, consider using a separate mechanism to serve files, potentially through a dedicated API endpoint that enforces access controls and prevents direct execution.

#### 4.4. Exploit File Inclusion Vulnerabilities

**Description:** If the Filebrowser application directly includes uploaded files without proper sanitization, attackers can upload malicious code that will be executed when the application includes the file.

**Filebrowser Relevance:** This vulnerability arises if Filebrowser uses server-side scripting languages (like PHP) and includes uploaded files using functions like `include`, `require`, or similar, without ensuring the files are safe.

**Technical Details & Examples:**

* Uploading a PHP file containing malicious code and then tricking the application into including this file. For example, if the application has a parameter like `?page=uploaded_file.php`, an attacker could upload a file named `uploaded_file.php` containing malicious code.
* Exploiting local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities where the application allows including arbitrary local files.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser:**

* **Directly including user-provided filenames in `include` or `require` statements without proper validation or sanitization.**
* **Lack of restrictions on the types of files that can be included.**

**Attacker Steps:**

1. Craft a malicious file containing code in the server-side scripting language (e.g., PHP).
2. Upload the malicious file through the Filebrowser interface.
3. Identify a point in the application where file inclusion occurs and can be influenced by user input.
4. Manipulate the input (e.g., a URL parameter) to point to the uploaded malicious file.

**Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by forcing the application to include and execute their malicious file.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Avoid Direct File Inclusion of User-Provided Files:**  The best practice is to avoid directly including files based on user input.
* **Use a Whitelist of Allowed Files:** If file inclusion is necessary, use a strict whitelist of allowed files and map user input to these predefined files.
* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user input that is used to determine which file to include.
* **Path Traversal Prevention:** Implement measures to prevent path traversal attacks (e.g., by stripping out `..` sequences from filenames).
* **Consider Alternative Templating Engines:** If the inclusion is for templating purposes, consider using secure templating engines that automatically escape potentially harmful code.
