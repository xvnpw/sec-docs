## Deep Dive Analysis: Unauthorized File Modification/Deletion Threat in Filebrowser

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the "Unauthorized File Modification/Deletion" threat within the Filebrowser application context. It expands on the initial description, explores potential attack scenarios, and offers more detailed recommendations for mitigation.

**1. Threat Overview:**

The core of this threat lies in the potential for an attacker, whether internal or external, to gain unauthorized access and manipulate files and directories managed by Filebrowser. This manipulation can range from subtle data alteration to complete deletion, leading to significant consequences. The threat leverages vulnerabilities in either the authentication/authorization mechanisms of Filebrowser or compromised user credentials.

**2. Detailed Analysis of Attack Vectors:**

* **Compromised Filebrowser Credentials:**
    * **Phishing:** Attackers could trick legitimate users into revealing their Filebrowser credentials through deceptive emails or websites mimicking the Filebrowser login page.
    * **Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing:** If Filebrowser doesn't have robust protection against repeated login attempts, attackers might try to guess credentials or use lists of previously compromised credentials from other breaches.
    * **Malware:** Malware installed on a user's device could capture their login credentials as they are entered into Filebrowser.
    * **Insider Threat:** A disgruntled or malicious employee with legitimate Filebrowser access could intentionally misuse their privileges.
    * **Weak Password Policies:** If Filebrowser allows weak or easily guessable passwords, attackers can exploit this vulnerability.

* **Exploiting Authorization Flaws within Filebrowser:**
    * **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**  Attackers might be able to manipulate parameters in Filebrowser URLs or API requests to access or modify files belonging to other users without proper authorization checks. For example, changing a file ID in a delete request to target another user's file.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers might find vulnerabilities that allow them to elevate their privileges within Filebrowser, granting them access to files and functionalities they shouldn't have.
    * **Missing Authorization Checks:**  Certain file manipulation functionalities might lack proper checks to ensure the requesting user has the necessary permissions.
    * **Flaws in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation:** If Filebrowser implements RBAC, vulnerabilities in its implementation could allow attackers to bypass role restrictions or assign themselves higher-level roles.
    * **Session Hijacking/Fixation:** Attackers could steal or manipulate user session identifiers to impersonate legitimate users and perform unauthorized actions.
    * **API Vulnerabilities:** If Filebrowser exposes an API, vulnerabilities in the API endpoints related to file manipulation could be exploited.

**3. Deeper Dive into Impact:**

* **Data Integrity Loss:**
    * **Data Corruption:** Attackers could subtly alter data within files, making it unreliable or unusable. This could have significant consequences depending on the nature of the data.
    * **Data Tampering:**  Attackers could intentionally modify important files for malicious purposes, such as altering financial records, project documents, or configuration files.
    * **Introduction of Malicious Content:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts or code into files, potentially leading to further compromise of the system or other users.

* **Data Unavailability:**
    * **File Deletion:**  Attackers could permanently delete critical files and directories, leading to data loss and disruption of services relying on those files.
    * **Ransomware (within Filebrowser scope):** While less likely directly through Filebrowser's intended functionality, a compromised account could be used to upload ransomware that encrypts files within its managed scope.
    * **Denial of Service:**  Mass deletion of files could overload the system or make it unusable for legitimate users.

* **Potential for System Instability:**
    * **Deletion of Configuration Files:** If Filebrowser is managing configuration files for other applications, their deletion could lead to instability or failure of those applications.
    * **Resource Exhaustion:**  Malicious modification of large numbers of files could consume significant system resources, impacting performance.

* **Reputational Damage:** If sensitive data managed by Filebrowser is compromised or deleted, it can lead to significant reputational damage for the organization using it.

* **Compliance and Legal Ramifications:** Depending on the type of data managed by Filebrowser, unauthorized modification or deletion could lead to breaches of data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and associated legal consequences.

**4. In-Depth Analysis of Affected Components:**

* **File Manipulation Module:**
    * **Specific Functions:** This module encompasses all functionalities related to interacting with files and directories. This includes:
        * **Upload:**  While not direct modification, a compromised account could upload malicious files.
        * **Download:**  While not modification/deletion, understanding download access is crucial for overall security.
        * **Edit:**  Directly responsible for modifying file content.
        * **Rename:**  Can be used to obscure or disrupt file organization.
        * **Delete:**  The primary function for causing data unavailability.
        * **Move/Copy:**  Can be used to relocate sensitive data to less protected areas or create unauthorized backups.
        * **Creating new files/directories:**  Could be used to plant malicious files or create confusion.
    * **Vulnerability Points:**  This module is vulnerable if it doesn't properly validate user input (file names, paths, content), doesn't enforce authorization checks before performing actions, or has flaws in its file system interaction logic.

* **Authorization Module:**
    * **Core Responsibility:** This module is responsible for verifying the identity of users and determining their access rights to specific files and functionalities.
    * **Vulnerability Points:**
        * **Authentication Bypass:**  Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass the login process entirely.
        * **Broken Authentication:** Weaknesses in session management, password recovery mechanisms, or multi-factor authentication (if implemented).
        * **Broken Access Control:**  Failures to enforce access restrictions based on user roles or permissions (as mentioned in the attack vectors).
        * **Lack of Input Validation on Authorization Data:**  Attackers might be able to manipulate user IDs, group IDs, or role assignments if not properly validated.

**5. Detailed Scenario Examples:**

* **Scenario 1: Insider Threat with Compromised Credentials:** A disgruntled employee with legitimate Filebrowser access logs in and intentionally deletes critical project files to sabotage the company.
* **Scenario 2: External Attacker Exploiting IDOR:** An attacker discovers that Filebrowser uses predictable file IDs in its URLs. They manipulate the file ID in a delete request to delete a sensitive document belonging to another user.
* **Scenario 3: External Attacker Exploiting Missing Authorization Check:** An attacker finds an API endpoint for renaming files that doesn't verify if the user has permission to rename the *target* file, allowing them to rename files they shouldn't have access to.
* **Scenario 4: Credential Stuffing Attack:** An attacker uses a list of compromised username/password combinations from a previous data breach to attempt logins on Filebrowser. If successful, they gain unauthorized access and delete files.
* **Scenario 5: Privilege Escalation through Vulnerability:** An attacker finds a vulnerability in Filebrowser's role management system, allowing them to assign themselves administrator privileges and then delete any file.

**6. Evaluation of Existing Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Implement granular access control lists (ACLs) or similar permission systems within Filebrowser's configuration:**
    * **Strengths:** This is a crucial mitigation. Fine-grained control allows administrators to define precisely which users or groups have specific permissions (read, write, delete) on individual files or directories.
    * **Considerations:** The implementation needs to be robust and easy to manage. Overly complex ACLs can be difficult to maintain and may introduce new vulnerabilities. Filebrowser's configuration needs to support this level of granularity.

* **Enforce the principle of least privilege for users and roles within Filebrowser:**
    * **Strengths:** Limiting user permissions to only what is necessary minimizes the potential damage from a compromised account.
    * **Considerations:** Requires careful planning and understanding of user roles and their required access. Regular review of user permissions is necessary.

* **Log all file modification and deletion activities performed through Filebrowser:**
    * **Strengths:** Essential for detection, investigation, and auditing. Logs provide evidence of unauthorized activity.
    * **Considerations:** Logs need to be comprehensive, secure, and regularly reviewed. Consider integrating with a centralized logging system for better analysis and alerting. Include details like timestamp, user, affected file/directory, and action performed.

* **Regularly back up data managed by Filebrowser:**
    * **Strengths:** Provides a recovery mechanism in case of data loss due to unauthorized deletion or modification.
    * **Considerations:** Backups need to be performed regularly, stored securely (separate from the Filebrowser instance), and tested for restorability. Consider different backup strategies (full, incremental, differential).

**7. Additional Security Recommendations:**

Beyond the initial mitigation strategies, consider the following:

* **Secure Configuration:**
    * **Change Default Credentials:** Ensure default usernames and passwords for Filebrowser are changed immediately upon installation.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any Filebrowser features that are not required to reduce the attack surface.
    * **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure all communication with Filebrowser is encrypted using HTTPS to protect credentials in transit.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation on all user-provided data, especially file names and paths, to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities and injection attacks.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in Filebrowser's configuration and code.
* **Keep Filebrowser Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Filebrowser to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities. Subscribe to security advisories for timely updates.
* **Implement Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address to mitigate brute-force attacks.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA for all Filebrowser users to add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
* **Security Headers:** Configure appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`) to protect against common web attacks.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which could potentially be used to manipulate file operations.
* **Principle of Least Authority (for Filebrowser process):** If possible, run the Filebrowser process with the minimum necessary privileges on the underlying operating system.
