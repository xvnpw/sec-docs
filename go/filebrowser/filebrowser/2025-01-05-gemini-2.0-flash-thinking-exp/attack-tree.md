**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Exploit File Manipulation Vulnerabilities (High Risk):**

*   **Upload Malicious Executable File:**
    *   **Critical Node: Execute Uploaded File (e.g., via application logic, misconfiguration):**
        *   Attack Vector: After successfully bypassing file type restrictions, the attacker relies on the application's logic or server misconfiguration to execute the uploaded file. This could involve storing the file in a web-accessible directory without proper execution prevention, or application code that processes the file in a way that leads to its execution (e.g., using `eval()` or similar functions). Successful execution can lead to full system compromise.
*   **Upload File with Malicious Content (High Risk):**
    *   **Critical Node: Trigger Execution of Malicious Content (e.g., XSS, SSRF via file content):**
        *   Attack Vector: Even if executable files are blocked, attackers can upload files with malicious content that gets executed in a different context. This commonly involves:
            *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Uploading files (e.g., HTML, SVG) containing malicious JavaScript that executes in another user's browser when they access the file.
            *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Uploading files (e.g., XML, configuration files) containing malicious URLs that the server processes, leading to requests to internal or external resources, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing further attacks.
*   **Overwrite Sensitive Files (High Risk):**
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability in Filebrowser:**
        *   Attack Vector: A path traversal vulnerability in Filebrowser allows an attacker to manipulate file paths to access files and directories outside the intended upload location. This is achieved by using special characters like `../` in the filename or path.
    *   Attack Vector: Once a path traversal vulnerability is exploited, the attacker can overwrite critical application files, such as configuration files, application scripts, or other sensitive data. This can lead to application disruption, privilege escalation, or the injection of malicious code.
*   **Delete Critical Files:**
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability in Filebrowser:**
        *   Attack Vector: Similar to overwriting, exploiting a path traversal vulnerability allows attackers to navigate to and delete critical files necessary for the application's functionality, leading to denial of service.
*   **Rename Sensitive Files to Disrupt Functionality:**
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability in Filebrowser:**
        *   Attack Vector: By exploiting a path traversal vulnerability, attackers can rename critical files, breaking dependencies and causing the application to malfunction.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Exploit Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser (High Risk) ***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_vulnerabilities_in_filebrowser__high_risk_.md)

*   OR
    *   *** Bypass Authentication (High Risk) ***
        *   ** Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in Filebrowser (Critical Node) **
        *   ** Exploit Weak or Default Credentials (if applicable) (Critical Node) **

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Exploit Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities in Filebrowser (High Risk):**

*   **Bypass Authentication (High Risk):**
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in Filebrowser:**
        *   Attack Vector: Filebrowser itself might contain vulnerabilities in its authentication mechanism that allow attackers to bypass the login process entirely without providing valid credentials. This could be due to flaws in the code handling authentication requests or session management.
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Weak or Default Credentials (if applicable):**
        *   Attack Vector: If Filebrowser is deployed with default or easily guessable credentials (usernames and passwords), attackers can simply use these credentials to gain unauthorized access. This is a common issue if administrators fail to change default settings after installation.
