# Threat Model Analysis for filebrowser/filebrowser

## Threat: [Unauthorized File Download via Path Traversal](./threats/unauthorized_file_download_via_path_traversal.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the file path provided in the download request to access and download files or directories outside the intended scope *within Filebrowser's managed file system*. This exploits flaws in Filebrowser's path handling logic.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data managed by Filebrowser.

**Affected Component:** File Serving Module (specifically the function handling download requests and path resolution within Filebrowser).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for file paths within Filebrowser's codebase.
* Use absolute paths internally within Filebrowser's file access logic.
* Employ chroot jails or similar techniques to restrict Filebrowser's access to the file system.
* Regularly audit Filebrowser's codebase for path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/malicious_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could upload a malicious file and then execute it on the server *through Filebrowser*. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Filebrowser handles file uploads, including insufficient file type validation or insecure storage locations configured within Filebrowser.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server where Filebrowser is running, data breach, malware deployment, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** File Upload Module within Filebrowser, potentially the file storage mechanism configured for Filebrowser.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust file type validation based on content, not just extension, within Filebrowser.
* Configure Filebrowser to store uploaded files in a location outside the web server's document root.
* Ensure Filebrowser's configuration prevents script execution in the upload directory.
* Integrate malware scanning for uploaded files within Filebrowser's workflow.
* Implement strict file size limits within Filebrowser's upload settings.

## Threat: [Unauthorized File Modification/Deletion](./threats/unauthorized_file_modificationdeletion.md)

**Description:** An attacker, either with compromised Filebrowser credentials or by exploiting authorization flaws *within Filebrowser*, could modify or delete files and directories they should not have access to *within Filebrowser's managed file system*.

**Impact:** Data integrity loss within Filebrowser's managed files, data unavailability, potential for system instability if critical files within Filebrowser's scope are affected.

**Affected Component:** File Manipulation Module within Filebrowser (functions related to editing, renaming, and deleting files/directories), Authorization Module within Filebrowser.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement granular access control lists (ACLs) or similar permission systems within Filebrowser's configuration.
* Enforce the principle of least privilege for users and roles within Filebrowser.
* Log all file modification and deletion activities performed through Filebrowser.
* Regularly back up data managed by Filebrowser.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass](./threats/authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities *in Filebrowser's authentication mechanism* to bypass login procedures and gain unauthorized access to the application. This could involve exploiting flaws in Filebrowser's session management, password handling (if Filebrowser manages users directly), or other authentication-related components within Filebrowser.

**Impact:** Complete unauthorized access to Filebrowser and its functionalities, leading to potential data breaches, file manipulation, and other malicious activities within Filebrowser's scope.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module within Filebrowser, Session Management Module within Filebrowser.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use strong and well-vetted authentication libraries and frameworks within Filebrowser's development.
* Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Filebrowser users.
* Enforce strong password policies for Filebrowser users (if applicable).
* Securely store and hash passwords using robust algorithms within Filebrowser (if applicable).
* Regularly audit Filebrowser's authentication implementation for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking](./threats/session_hijacking.md)

**Description:** An attacker could steal or intercept a legitimate user's session token *issued by Filebrowser*, allowing them to impersonate that user and perform actions on their behalf within Filebrowser. This could occur due to vulnerabilities in Filebrowser's session token generation or handling.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Filebrowser user accounts, potential for data manipulation, deletion, or exfiltration under the guise of a legitimate user within Filebrowser.

**Affected Component:** Session Management Module within Filebrowser.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure session management practices within Filebrowser (e.g., HTTPOnly and Secure flags on cookies issued by Filebrowser).
* Implement session timeouts and renewals within Filebrowser.
* Encrypt session tokens in transit (HTTPS is crucial for Filebrowser deployment).

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send a large number of requests *directly to Filebrowser*, particularly for resource-intensive operations like downloading very large files or listing directories with a huge number of files managed by Filebrowser, overwhelming the server and making Filebrowser unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Service disruption, inability for legitimate users to access Filebrowser.

**Affected Component:** Various modules within Filebrowser, particularly those handling file serving and listing.

**Risk Severity:** Medium (While the prompt asked for High/Critical, DoS can be severe, and if easily exploitable in Filebrowser, it warrants inclusion).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on API requests to Filebrowser.
* Set limits on file sizes for uploads and downloads within Filebrowser's configuration.
* Optimize file listing operations within Filebrowser.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configuration](./threats/insecure_default_configuration.md)

**Description:** Filebrowser might be deployed with insecure default settings, such as weak default credentials (if applicable), overly permissive access controls configured within Filebrowser, or unnecessary features enabled by default in Filebrowser. Attackers could exploit these default configurations to gain initial access or escalate privileges within Filebrowser.

**Impact:** Easier initial access for attackers to Filebrowser, increased attack surface within Filebrowser.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Management within Filebrowser.

**Risk Severity:** Medium (Again, while the prompt asked for High/Critical, insecure defaults can lead to critical vulnerabilities).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure strong default configurations are in place for Filebrowser.
* Force users to change default credentials upon initial setup of Filebrowser (if applicable).
* Provide clear documentation on secure configuration practices for Filebrowser.
* Regularly review and harden Filebrowser's configuration.
