# Attack Surface Analysis for filebrowser/filebrowser

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Filebrowser ships with default administrative credentials that, if unchanged, grant immediate full access to the application and the managed file system.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser's initial setup process might not enforce or prominently guide users to change these default credentials.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the default username and password to log in and gain complete control over the files accessible through Filebrowser.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the file system managed by Filebrowser, including data exfiltration, modification, and deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Enforce a password change upon the first login or during the initial setup.
            *   Provide clear and easily accessible documentation on how to change default credentials.
            *   Consider generating unique default credentials per installation instance.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Immediately change the default administrative credentials upon installation.
            *   Use strong, unique passwords for all Filebrowser accounts.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Filebrowser's handling of user-provided file paths for operations like download, upload, rename, or delete is vulnerable, allowing access to files and directories outside the intended scope.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser needs to process user-provided paths. If these paths are not rigorously validated and sanitized, attackers can use techniques like "../" sequences to navigate the file system beyond the intended boundaries.
    *   **Example:** A user crafts a download request with a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to retrieve the server's password file.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files and directories on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or even remote code execution if writable system files are accessed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all file paths received from users.
            *   Resolve user-provided paths relative to a defined and restricted root directory.
            *   Avoid directly using user input in file system operations; use secure file system APIs.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Restrict the root directory accessible by Filebrowser to the absolute minimum necessary.
            *   Ensure Filebrowser runs with the least necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary File Upload](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:** Filebrowser's file upload functionality lacks sufficient restrictions, allowing attackers to upload malicious files to the server.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser's core purpose is file management, including uploads. If this process doesn't have proper checks, attackers can upload any file type, including executable scripts or malware.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image file. If the web server executes PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker can gain remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, defacement of the website, malware deployment, data exfiltration, and potential compromise of the underlying server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust file type validation based on content (magic numbers) and not just file extensions.
            *   Sanitize filenames to prevent injection attacks.
            *   Store uploaded files in a location outside the web server's document root or configure the web server to prevent script execution in the upload directory.
            *   Implement file size limits.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Configure the web server to prevent the execution of scripts in the upload directory.
            *   Regularly scan the upload directory for suspicious files.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Filebrowser improperly sanitizes user-supplied data (like filenames or directory names) when displaying it in the web interface, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in other users' browsers.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser displays filenames, directory names, and potentially file contents. If these are not properly encoded before rendering in HTML, malicious JavaScript can be embedded.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a file with a malicious filename like `<script>alert("XSS")</script>.txt`. When another user views this filename in Filebrowser, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the Filebrowser interface, and potentially gaining access to the user's account.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement proper output encoding (escaping) for all user-supplied data displayed in the HTML context.
            *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Keep their web browsers up to date with the latest security patches.
            *   Use browser extensions that can help mitigate XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Filenames/Paths](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_filenamespaths.md)

*   **Description:** Filebrowser uses filenames or paths in system commands without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Certain Filebrowser functionalities might involve executing system commands (e.g., for file previews or archiving). If filenames or paths are incorporated into these commands without proper escaping, it creates a command injection vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a file named `; rm -rf / #.txt`. If Filebrowser uses this filename in a system command without sanitization, it could lead to the deletion of critical system files.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, data loss, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Avoid using system commands with user-supplied data whenever possible.
            *   If system commands are necessary, use parameterized commands or secure APIs that prevent command injection.
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for filenames and paths.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Run Filebrowser in a sandboxed environment or container if possible.
            *   Monitor system logs for suspicious command executions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in how Filebrowser manages user sessions can allow attackers to hijack or manipulate active user sessions.
    *   **How Filebrowser Contributes:** Filebrowser needs to maintain user sessions after login. Vulnerabilities in session ID generation, storage, or invalidation can be exploited to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** Predictable session IDs allow an attacker to guess a valid session ID and impersonate a user. Lack of proper session timeouts leaves sessions active for extended periods, increasing the risk of hijacking.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially leading to data breaches, file manipulation, and other malicious actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Generate cryptographically secure, random session IDs.
            *   Store session IDs securely (e.g., using HttpOnly and Secure flags for cookies).
            *   Implement proper session timeouts and inactivity timeouts.
            *   Regenerate session IDs after successful login to prevent session fixation attacks.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Avoid using Filebrowser on untrusted networks.
            *   Log out of Filebrowser sessions when finished.
            *   Ensure that the connection to Filebrowser is secured using HTTPS.
