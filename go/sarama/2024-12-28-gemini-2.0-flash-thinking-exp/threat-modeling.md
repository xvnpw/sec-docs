## High and Critical Sarama Threats

This list details high and critical security threats directly involving the Shopify Sarama Go library for interacting with Apache Kafka.

### Threat: Broker Spoofing

* **Description:** An attacker on the network could intercept communication between the Sarama client and the legitimate Kafka broker, impersonating the broker. This is facilitated by the Sarama client establishing a connection based on the provided broker addresses. The attacker could then potentially provide false metadata to the client, leading to incorrect application behavior or data corruption.
* **Impact:** The application might receive incorrect metadata about the Kafka cluster, leading to failures in producing or consuming messages. Malicious data could be injected into the application's workflow if the client is directed to a rogue broker for message operations.
* **Affected Sarama Component:** `Broker.connect()`, `MetadataRequest`, `MetadataResponse` handling, specifically the connection establishment and metadata retrieval logic within Sarama.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Enforce TLS encryption for all communication between the Sarama client and Kafka brokers. Configure `sarama.Config.Net.TLS.Enable = true`. This ensures the client can verify the broker's identity.
    * Verify the broker's certificate if TLS is enabled. Configure `sarama.Config.Net.TLS.Config.InsecureSkipVerify = false` and provide appropriate CA certificates. This prevents the client from accepting self-signed or invalid certificates.

### Threat: Credential Exposure

* **Description:** Authentication credentials (e.g., SASL username and password, or TLS client certificates) used by the Sarama client to connect to Kafka could be exposed if stored insecurely within the application's code, Sarama configuration, or environment variables. An attacker gaining access to these credentials could directly use Sarama (or another Kafka client) to impersonate the application and perform unauthorized actions on the Kafka cluster.
* **Impact:** An attacker could produce malicious messages, consume sensitive data, or modify Kafka cluster configurations depending on the permissions associated with the exposed credentials. This directly leverages Sarama's authentication mechanisms.
* **Affected Sarama Component:** `sarama.Config.Net.SASL.Enable`, `sarama.Config.Net.SASL.User`, `sarama.Config.Net.SASL.Password`, `sarama.Config.Net.SASL.Mechanism`, `sarama.Config.Net.TLS.Enable`, `sarama.Config.Net.TLS.Config`.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code or Sarama configuration.
    * Store credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or dedicated configuration services.
    * Ensure proper access control and encryption for any storage mechanism used for credentials.
    * For TLS client authentication, securely manage and store the client certificate and key.

### Threat: Dependency Vulnerabilities

* **Description:** Sarama, like any software library, relies on other dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited, potentially through Sarama's usage of those libraries, to compromise the application. This is a risk inherent in using external libraries.
* **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from information disclosure to remote code execution within the application using Sarama.
* **Affected Sarama Component:** Indirectly affects all components through underlying dependencies. The risk manifests when Sarama utilizes a vulnerable function or component from its dependencies.
* **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly update Sarama to the latest version, which often includes updates to its dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
    * Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Sarama's dependencies.
    * Follow secure development practices and keep dependencies up-to-date.
