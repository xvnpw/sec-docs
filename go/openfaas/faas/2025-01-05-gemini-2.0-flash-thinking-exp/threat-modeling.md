# Threat Model Analysis for openfaas/faas

## Threat: [Unsecured Function Image Deployment](./threats/unsecured_function_image_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could push a malicious container image to the container registry used by OpenFaaS if the registry has weak or no authentication/authorization. OpenFaaS then deploys this image as a function. This malicious image could contain backdoors, malware, or code designed to steal data or compromise the OpenFaaS environment upon deployment.
    *   **Impact:**  Deployment of compromised functions could lead to data breaches, resource hijacking (e.g., cryptocurrency mining) within the OpenFaaS cluster, or denial of service attacks originating from the compromised function.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Function Deployment process, Container Registry integration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the container registry.
        *   Utilize private container registries that require credentials.
        *   Implement image scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities in container images before deployment to OpenFaaS.
        *   Enforce image signing and verification to ensure only trusted images are deployed by OpenFaaS.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Function Invocation](./threats/unauthorized_function_invocation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could bypass intended access controls and directly invoke functions through the OpenFaaS Gateway API if the API is not properly secured with authentication and authorization. This allows unauthorized execution of function logic managed by OpenFaaS.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data processed by functions, execution of unintended actions within the OpenFaaS environment, resource consumption leading to increased costs or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** OpenFaaS Gateway, Function Invocation mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization on the OpenFaaS Gateway API (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Utilize OpenFaaS namespaces to isolate functions and control access via the Gateway.
        *   Implement function-level authorization if finer-grained control is required at the Gateway level.
        *   Rate-limit function invocations at the Gateway to mitigate abuse.

## Threat: [Exposure of Secrets in Function Environment Variables](./threats/exposure_of_secrets_in_function_environment_variables.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently store sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets directly in function environment variables when configuring function deployments in OpenFaaS. If the function environment managed by OpenFaaS is compromised or logs are exposed, these secrets could be revealed.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized access to external services or databases used by the functions, compromise of other systems using the exposed credentials.
    *   **Affected Component:** Function Deployment configuration within OpenFaaS, Function execution environment managed by OpenFaaS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in environment variables within OpenFaaS function configurations.
        *   Utilize OpenFaaS Secrets or a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets with encryption at rest) integrated with OpenFaaS.
        *   Ensure proper access controls on secrets managed by OpenFaaS to limit which functions and users can access them.

## Threat: [Compromise of the OpenFaaS Gateway](./threats/compromise_of_the_openfaas_gateway.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the OpenFaaS Gateway software itself or the underlying infrastructure it runs on to gain unauthorized access. This allows them to directly interact with the OpenFaaS control plane, manipulate function deployments, access sensitive data managed by OpenFaaS, or disrupt the entire platform.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the OpenFaaS deployment, potential data breaches involving data processed by functions, denial of service affecting all functions, ability to deploy malicious functions through OpenFaaS.
    *   **Affected Component:** OpenFaaS Gateway.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the OpenFaaS Gateway software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Harden the underlying infrastructure where the Gateway is running.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Gateway's management interface.
        *   Regularly audit the Gateway's configuration and security settings.

## Threat: [Insecure Function-to-Function Communication](./threats/insecure_function-to-function_communication.md)

*   **Description:** If functions deployed within OpenFaaS communicate with each other without proper authentication and authorization, a compromised function could potentially access or manipulate data from other functions that it shouldn't have access to. This is facilitated by OpenFaaS's internal networking.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches involving data exchanged between functions, lateral movement within the application deployed on OpenFaaS, compromise of multiple functions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Function Invocation mechanism within OpenFaaS, Networking within the OpenFaaS cluster.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure communication protocols between functions (e.g., mutual TLS).
        *   Utilize API keys or tokens for function-to-function authentication.
        *   Leverage OpenFaaS namespaces and network policies to restrict communication between functions.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Function Configuration](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_function_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured function deployments within OpenFaaS might grant excessive privileges to the function container, allowing it to interact with the underlying host or Kubernetes/Swarm cluster in unintended ways. An attacker could exploit this misconfiguration to gain elevated privileges within the OpenFaaS environment or potentially escape the container.
    *   **Impact:**  Container escape from functions managed by OpenFaaS, compromise of the underlying infrastructure supporting OpenFaaS, ability to control other containers or nodes within the OpenFaaS cluster.
    *   **Affected Component:** Function Deployment configuration within OpenFaaS, underlying container runtime (Docker), underlying infrastructure (Kubernetes/Swarm).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when configuring function deployments in OpenFaaS.
        *   Utilize security context constraints (SCCs) or Pod Security Policies (PSPs) in Kubernetes to restrict function capabilities.
        *   Regularly review and audit function deployment configurations within OpenFaaS.

## Threat: [API Key Compromise for OpenFaaS API](./threats/api_key_compromise_for_openfaas_api.md)

*   **Description:** If API keys used to interact with the OpenFaaS API are compromised (e.g., leaked in code used to manage OpenFaaS, exposed through insecure storage), attackers can use these keys to perform unauthorized actions on the OpenFaaS platform, such as deploying, updating, or deleting functions.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized manipulation of the OpenFaaS environment, potential deployment of malicious functions, denial of service affecting the OpenFaaS platform.
    *   **Affected Component:** OpenFaaS API, API Key management within OpenFaaS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat API keys as sensitive credentials and store them securely (e.g., using secrets management solutions).
        *   Implement API key rotation policies for OpenFaaS API keys.
        *   Restrict access to OpenFaaS API keys to authorized personnel and systems.
        *   Monitor OpenFaaS API key usage for suspicious activity.
