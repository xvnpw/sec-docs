## Deep Analysis: Exploit Default/Weak Credentials on OpenFaaS Gateway

This analysis delves into the specific attack path "Exploit OpenFaaS Gateway Vulnerabilities -> Bypass Authentication/Authorization -> Exploit API Gateway Authentication Flaws -> Exploit Default/Weak Credentials" within the context of an OpenFaaS deployment. We will focus on the final stage, "Exploit Default/Weak Credentials," its implications, and actionable recommendations for the development team.

**Focus Area: Exploit Default/Weak Credentials**

This stage represents a critical failure in the security posture of the OpenFaaS gateway. It indicates that despite potential prior bypasses of authentication and authorization mechanisms, the attacker ultimately succeeds due to the presence of easily guessable or default credentials. This is a testament to the importance of basic security hygiene.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack:**

1. **Target:** The primary target at this stage is the authentication mechanism of the OpenFaaS gateway. This typically involves the `basic-auth-plugin` or, in older deployments, the default authentication mechanism of the underlying orchestrator (e.g., Kubernetes).

2. **Mechanism:** Attackers employ various techniques to exploit default or weak credentials:
    * **Dictionary Attacks:** Using lists of common passwords and usernames.
    * **Brute-Force Attacks:** Systematically trying all possible combinations of characters for usernames and passwords.
    * **Credential Stuffing:** Utilizing credentials compromised from other breaches, assuming users reuse passwords across different services.
    * **Exploiting Known Default Credentials:** Attempting to log in using well-known default usernames and passwords that might not have been changed during initial setup. Examples include:
        * `admin:password`
        * `user:user`
        * Combinations based on the application name or common defaults for related technologies.
    * **Exploiting Weak Credentials:** Guessing simple or predictable passwords based on common patterns, personal information, or easily discoverable details.

3. **Entry Point:** The attacker interacts with the OpenFaaS gateway's authentication endpoint. This is typically the `/system/login` path when using the `basic-auth-plugin`.

4. **Success Condition:** The attacker successfully authenticates by providing a valid default or weak username/password combination.

**Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

Gaining access through default or weak credentials has severe consequences:

* **Full Control of the OpenFaaS Gateway:** The attacker gains administrative privileges, allowing them to:
    * **Deploy and Invoke Functions:** Execute arbitrary code within the OpenFaaS environment. This can lead to data breaches, malware deployment, and resource exhaustion.
    * **Modify Function Configurations:** Alter function settings, potentially introducing backdoors or disrupting services.
    * **Access Sensitive Data:** Retrieve information stored within functions or accessible through function invocations.
    * **Disrupt Service Availability:** Delete functions, overload the system, or manipulate routing rules.
* **Lateral Movement:** The compromised gateway can serve as a launching pad for further attacks within the internal network. Attackers can use it to scan for other vulnerabilities and compromise other systems.
* **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can leverage compromised functions to extract sensitive data from the application or connected databases.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful breach can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
* **Financial Loss:** Recovery from a security incident can be costly, involving incident response, data recovery, legal fees, and potential fines.
* **Compliance Violations:** Failure to secure access to sensitive data can lead to violations of regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.

**Why This Attack Path is Common and Dangerous:**

* **Human Error:** Forgetting to change default credentials during initial setup or using easily guessable passwords is a common oversight.
* **Lack of Awareness:** Developers or operators may not fully understand the security implications of using default credentials.
* **Inadequate Security Policies:** The organization may lack clear policies regarding password complexity and mandatory password changes.
* **Weak Default Configurations:** While OpenFaaS itself doesn't inherently ship with default credentials for the gateway, relying on plugins or underlying orchestrator defaults can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly configured.
* **Legacy Systems:** Older deployments might still be using less secure authentication mechanisms with default credentials.

**Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations for the Development Team:**

To prevent exploitation of default or weak credentials, the development team should implement the following measures:

1. **Eliminate Default Credentials:**
    * **Never ship with default credentials:** Ensure that the OpenFaaS gateway and any related components (like authentication plugins) do not have default usernames and passwords.
    * **Force Password Change on First Login:** Implement a mechanism that requires users to change default credentials immediately upon initial setup.
    * **Provide Clear Documentation:** Document the process for setting strong passwords and changing default credentials.

2. **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**
    * **Minimum Length Requirements:** Mandate a minimum password length (e.g., 12 characters or more).
    * **Complexity Requirements:** Enforce the use of a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    * **Prevent Common Password Usage:** Implement checks against lists of commonly used and easily guessable passwords.
    * **Regular Password Rotation:** Encourage or enforce periodic password changes.

3. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    * **Add an Extra Layer of Security:** Require users to provide a second form of verification (e.g., OTP from an authenticator app, SMS code) in addition to their password. This significantly reduces the risk of successful attacks even if credentials are compromised.

4. **Account Lockout Policies:**
    * **Limit Login Attempts:** Implement lockout policies that temporarily disable accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts. This helps to thwart brute-force attacks.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to proactively identify and address potential weaknesses, including the presence of default or weak credentials.
    * **Simulate Attacks:** Penetration testing can simulate real-world attacks to assess the effectiveness of security controls.

6. **Secure Credential Storage:**
    * **Hashing and Salting:** Ensure that passwords are not stored in plaintext but are properly hashed using strong, salted hashing algorithms.

7. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Limit Access:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Avoid using overly permissive administrative accounts for routine operations.

8. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * **Detect Suspicious Activity:** Implement monitoring systems to detect unusual login attempts, multiple failed login attempts, or logins from unusual locations.
    * **Alert on Potential Breaches:** Configure alerts to notify administrators of suspicious activity, allowing for timely investigation and response.

9. **Educate Users and Operators:**
    * **Security Awareness Training:** Provide regular training to developers and operators on the importance of strong passwords and secure credential management practices.

**Specific Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Review Default Configurations:** Thoroughly review the default configurations of the OpenFaaS gateway and any authentication plugins being used. Ensure that no default credentials are present.
* **Implement Password Complexity Checks:** Integrate password complexity checks into the user registration or password change process.
* **Consider Using a Dedicated Identity Provider:** Explore integrating with a dedicated identity provider (e.g., Keycloak, Auth0) for more robust authentication and authorization management.
* **Automate Security Checks:** Integrate security checks into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for potential vulnerabilities, including the presence of default credentials.
* **Provide Clear Documentation and Best Practices:** Create clear and concise documentation for operators on how to securely configure and manage credentials for the OpenFaaS gateway.

**Conclusion:**

The "Exploit Default/Weak Credentials" attack path, while seemingly simple, represents a significant security vulnerability in any OpenFaaS deployment. A successful exploit at this stage grants attackers significant control over the system and can lead to severe consequences. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies and focusing on secure credential management practices, the development team can significantly strengthen the security posture of the OpenFaaS gateway and prevent this common and damaging attack vector. This final step in the attack path highlights the critical importance of basic security hygiene and the need for continuous vigilance in securing applications.
