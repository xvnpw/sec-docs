## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Deploy Malicious Functions -> Exploit Lack of Function Image Verification -> Deploy Functions that Exfiltrate Data in OpenFaaS

This analysis delves into the specific attack path outlined for an OpenFaaS deployment, examining the attacker's motivations, techniques, potential impact, and providing actionable recommendations for the development team.

**Context:** The core vulnerability being exploited here is the **lack of robust function image verification** within the OpenFaaS environment. This means the system relies on the user (or an automated process) to provide the image name and potentially tag, without cryptographically verifying the integrity and authenticity of the image content.

**Attack Tree Path Breakdown:**

**1. Deploy Malicious Functions:**

* **Attacker Goal:**  Gain execution capability within the OpenFaaS environment. This is the initial foothold required to carry out further malicious actions.
* **Attacker Techniques:**
    * **Compromised Credentials:**  An attacker might gain access to the OpenFaaS CLI, UI, or API credentials of legitimate users or administrators. This allows them to deploy functions as if they were authorized.
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Deployment Processes:** If the deployment pipeline or tooling has vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure API endpoints, injection flaws), attackers could inject malicious function deployments.
    * **Social Engineering:**  Deceiving legitimate users into deploying malicious functions. This could involve tricking users into running a malicious `faas-cli deploy` command or using a compromised UI.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:**  If the organization uses custom function templates or base images, attackers could compromise these upstream components, leading to the deployment of malicious functions built upon them.
    * **Unsecured API Access:** If the OpenFaaS API is exposed without proper authentication or authorization, attackers could directly deploy functions.

**2. Exploit Lack of Function Image Verification:**

* **Attacker Goal:** Leverage the absence of cryptographic verification to deploy malicious function images without detection.
* **Vulnerability Details:**
    * **No Signature Verification:** OpenFaaS, by default, doesn't enforce verification of digital signatures on function images. This means an attacker can create a malicious image and push it to a registry (potentially even a public one with a similar name) and deploy it.
    * **Reliance on Image Name/Tag:** The system relies on the provided image name and tag for deployment. Attackers can manipulate these to point to their malicious images.
    * **Lack of Content Digest Verification:**  Even if the image name is correct, the system doesn't inherently verify the content of the image using a content digest (like a SHA256 hash). This allows attackers to replace the content of a legitimate image (if they gain access to the registry) without changing the name or tag.
* **Attacker Actions:**
    * **Creating Malicious Images:** Attackers craft Docker images containing their malicious code. These images might have similar names to legitimate functions to avoid immediate suspicion.
    * **Pushing to Accessible Registries:**  The malicious images can be pushed to public registries like Docker Hub or to compromised private registries.
    * **Deploying with Malicious Image Names:**  Using compromised credentials or exploited deployment processes, attackers deploy functions specifying the names and tags of their malicious images.

**3. Deploy Functions that Exfiltrate Data:**

* **Attacker Goal:**  Execute code within the OpenFaaS environment that steals sensitive data and transmits it to an external location under their control.
* **Malicious Function Capabilities:**
    * **Accessing Environment Variables:** Functions can access environment variables, which might contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or configuration settings.
    * **Interacting with Internal Services:** Depending on network configuration, malicious functions might be able to access internal databases, APIs, or other services within the organization's network.
    * **Reading Filesystem:**  Functions can potentially access files within their container, which might contain configuration files or temporary data.
    * **Making Outbound Network Requests:**  The core of the exfiltration process involves the function making requests to external servers controlled by the attacker.
* **Data Exfiltration Techniques:**
    * **Direct HTTP/HTTPS Requests:** The most straightforward method, sending stolen data to an attacker-controlled server via standard web protocols.
    * **DNS Tunneling:** Encoding data within DNS queries to bypass firewall restrictions.
    * **Email:** Sending data via email to an external address.
    * **Integration with Cloud Storage:**  Uploading data to attacker-controlled cloud storage buckets.
    * **Exfiltrating through other OpenFaaS Functions:**  If the attacker has deployed multiple malicious functions, they could use one function to gather data and another to exfiltrate it, making detection harder.

**Impact and Risks:**

* **Data Breach:** The primary risk is the loss of sensitive data, potentially leading to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.
* **Compromise of Internal Systems:**  Malicious functions could be used as a stepping stone to further compromise internal systems if they have network access.
* **Resource Consumption:**  Malicious functions could consume excessive resources, leading to performance degradation or denial of service for legitimate functions.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach involving OpenFaaS could damage the organization's reputation and erode trust with customers.
* **Supply Chain Compromise:** If the attack originates from compromised base images or templates, it can have a widespread impact on multiple deployments.

**Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Implement Function Image Verification:**
    * **Image Signing and Verification:**  Utilize tools like Docker Content Trust (Notary) to sign function images and configure OpenFaaS to verify these signatures before deployment. This ensures the image hasn't been tampered with and originates from a trusted source.
    * **Mandatory Content Digest Verification:** Configure OpenFaaS to strictly enforce the use of content digests (SHA256 hashes) when deploying functions. This ensures that the deployed image matches the intended version, even if the tag is reused.
* **Strengthen Access Control and Authentication:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users and service accounts interacting with OpenFaaS.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for accessing OpenFaaS management interfaces (CLI, UI, API).
    * **API Key Management:**  Securely manage and rotate API keys used for deployment.
* **Enhance Deployment Pipeline Security:**
    * **Secure Build Processes:** Implement secure coding practices and vulnerability scanning in the function build process.
    * **Integrate Security Checks:**  Automate security checks (e.g., vulnerability scanning, static analysis) within the CI/CD pipeline before deploying functions.
    * **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Treat function deployments as immutable, making it harder for attackers to modify deployed functions.
* **Network Security Measures:**
    * **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the OpenFaaS environment and restrict network access to only necessary services.
    * **Egress Filtering:**  Implement strict egress filtering rules to prevent malicious functions from making unauthorized outbound connections.
    * **Network Policies:**  Use network policies within Kubernetes to control traffic flow between functions and other services.
* **Monitoring and Logging:**
    * **Centralized Logging:**  Collect and analyze logs from OpenFaaS components and function executions to detect suspicious activity.
    * **Security Monitoring:**  Implement security monitoring tools to detect anomalies and potential attacks.
    * **Alerting:**  Set up alerts for suspicious events, such as unauthorized deployments or unusual network traffic.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Vulnerability Assessments:**  Regularly scan the OpenFaaS environment for known vulnerabilities.
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct penetration testing to identify weaknesses in the security posture.
* **Developer Training and Awareness:**
    * **Secure Coding Practices:** Train developers on secure coding practices for serverless functions.
    * **Security Awareness:**  Educate developers and operators about the risks associated with insecure function deployments.
* **Consider Private Registries:**
    * **Control Image Access:**  Using a private container registry provides better control over who can push and pull function images.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path described highlights a critical security gap stemming from the lack of default function image verification in OpenFaaS. By exploiting this weakness, attackers can deploy malicious code within the environment and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data. Addressing this vulnerability through the implementation of image signing and verification, alongside robust access controls and network security measures, is crucial for securing the OpenFaaS deployment. The development team should prioritize these mitigation strategies to protect their application and data from this significant threat. This analysis serves as a starting point for a more detailed security assessment and the development of a comprehensive security plan for the OpenFaaS environment.
