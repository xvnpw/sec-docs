### High and Critical OpenFaaS Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve OpenFaaS components:

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Function Invocation
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the **OpenFaaS Gateway's** authentication or authorization mechanisms, such as bypassing API key checks or exploiting flaws in JWT validation, to invoke functions without proper credentials. They could then execute arbitrary code within the function's environment.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, execution of malicious code leading to further compromise, resource consumption and potential denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** **OpenFaaS Gateway** API endpoint, potentially the authentication middleware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization on the **Gateway**, such as requiring API keys or using a dedicated authentication provider.
        *   Regularly review and update **Gateway** authentication configurations.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for function access.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for communication between services.

*   **Threat:** Gateway Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker floods the **OpenFaaS Gateway** with a large number of requests, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network). This can prevent legitimate users from accessing functions and potentially crash the **Gateway**.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, impacting application availability and potentially leading to financial losses or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** **OpenFaaS Gateway**.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the **Gateway** to restrict the number of requests from a single source.
        *   Deploy the **Gateway** with sufficient resources and consider horizontal scaling.
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
        *   Implement request queuing mechanisms to handle bursts of traffic.

*   **Threat:** Injection Attacks via Gateway Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is not properly sanitized by the **Gateway** before being passed to a function. This could lead to command injection if the function executes shell commands based on the input, or other forms of injection depending on the function's logic.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands on the function's container or the underlying host, data breaches, and potential system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** **OpenFaaS Gateway**, function input handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the **Gateway** before passing data to functions.
        *   Avoid executing shell commands directly within functions based on user input. If necessary, use parameterized commands or safer alternatives.
        *   Follow secure coding practices within functions to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Compromise of Secrets Management
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the secrets store used by **OpenFaaS** to manage sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials). This could be due to vulnerabilities in the secrets store integration or misconfigurations within **OpenFaaS**.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, and potential system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** **OpenFaaS** secrets store integration (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets integration, HashiCorp Vault integration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a robust and secure secrets management solution integrated with **OpenFaaS**.
        *   Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit.
        *   Implement strict access control policies for the secrets store.
        *   Regularly rotate secrets.
        *   Avoid hardcoding secrets in function code or environment variables.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Function Deployment/Modification
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the **OpenFaaS** control plane (e.g., `faas-cli`, **OpenFaaS** API) and deploys malicious functions, modifies existing ones, or deletes legitimate functions.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application, disruption of services, data breaches, and potential system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** **OpenFaaS** control plane (API, `faas-cli`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to the **OpenFaaS** control plane with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Restrict access to the underlying Kubernetes/Swarm API using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
        *   Implement audit logging for control plane activities.
        *   Use network policies to restrict access to the control plane components.
