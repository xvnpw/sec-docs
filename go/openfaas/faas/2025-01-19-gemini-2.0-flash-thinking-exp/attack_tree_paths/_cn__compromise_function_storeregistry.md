## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Function Store/Registry

This document provides a deep analysis of a specific attack path targeting the function store/registry within an OpenFaaS environment. We will define the objective, scope, and methodology of this analysis before delving into the specifics of the chosen attack path.

### 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the chosen attack path targeting the OpenFaaS function store/registry. This includes:

*   Identifying the steps involved in the attack.
*   Analyzing the potential vulnerabilities exploited at each step.
*   Assessing the impact and consequences of a successful attack.
*   Developing comprehensive mitigation strategies to prevent and detect such attacks.
*   Providing actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the security of the OpenFaaS deployment.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following attack tree path:

**[CN] Compromise Function Store/Registry**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Registry Authentication/Authorization:**
    *   **Access Registry with Stolen Credentials:** Attackers obtain valid credentials (usernames and passwords or API keys) for the function store/registry (e.g., Docker Hub, a private registry). This allows them to perform actions like pulling, pushing, or deleting images.
**High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Function Image:**
    *   **Push Backdoored Image with Same Name/Tag:** Attackers, having gained access to the registry, push a malicious function image with the same name and tag as a legitimate function. When OpenFaaS attempts to deploy or update this function, the backdoored image is used instead, leading to code execution within the OpenFaaS environment.

This analysis will consider the standard OpenFaaS architecture and common configurations. It will not delve into highly customized or edge-case scenarios unless explicitly mentioned.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### [CN] **Compromise Function Store/Registry**

This high-level objective represents a significant security breach that can have severe consequences for the OpenFaaS environment and the applications it hosts. Compromising the registry allows attackers to manipulate the very foundation of the deployed functions.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Registry Authentication/Authorization:**

*   **Access Registry with Stolen Credentials:**

    *   **Detailed Analysis:** This initial step hinges on the attacker gaining unauthorized access to the credentials used to authenticate with the function store/registry. This could involve various techniques:
        *   **Phishing:** Tricking users into revealing their credentials through deceptive emails or websites.
        *   **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force:** Using lists of known username/password combinations or systematically trying different passwords.
        *   **Data Breaches:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in other systems to obtain credentials that are reused for the registry.
        *   **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent insiders with legitimate access.
        *   **Compromised Developer Machines:** Attackers gaining access to developer workstations where credentials might be stored or used.
        *   **Insecure Credential Storage:** Credentials stored in plaintext or weakly encrypted formats.

    *   **Vulnerabilities Exploited:**
        *   **Weak Password Policies:** Allowing easily guessable passwords.
        *   **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Absence of an additional layer of security beyond username and password.
        *   **Insufficient Access Controls:**  Granting excessive permissions to users or applications.
        *   **Insecure Credential Management Practices:**  Poor handling and storage of sensitive credentials.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Authentication Mechanisms:**  Flaws in the registry's authentication implementation.

    *   **Impact:** Successful acquisition of registry credentials grants the attacker significant control over the function images. They can:
        *   **Pull legitimate images:**  Analyze them for vulnerabilities or intellectual property.
        *   **Push malicious images:**  Inject backdoors or malware.
        *   **Delete images:**  Cause disruption and prevent deployments.
        *   **Modify image tags:**  Potentially redirect deployments to unintended versions.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Mandate complex passwords and regular password changes.
        *   **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Require a second factor of authentication for all registry access.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users and applications accessing the registry.
        *   **Secure Credential Management:** Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets with encryption at rest) to store and manage registry credentials.
        *   **Regular Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers and operations teams about phishing and other social engineering attacks.
        *   **Monitor for Suspicious Login Attempts:** Implement logging and alerting for unusual login patterns or failed login attempts.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the registry to authorized systems.

**High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Function Image:**

*   **Push Backdoored Image with Same Name/Tag:**

    *   **Detailed Analysis:** Once the attacker has gained authenticated access to the registry, they can leverage this access to push malicious container images. The key to this attack path is using the same name and tag as a legitimate function image. When OpenFaaS attempts to deploy or update a function, it pulls the image based on its name and tag. If a malicious image with the same identifier exists, OpenFaaS will unknowingly pull and deploy the compromised version. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the OpenFaaS environment, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, internal networks, or other resources.

    *   **Vulnerabilities Exploited:**
        *   **Lack of Image Verification/Signing:** OpenFaaS, by default, might not verify the authenticity or integrity of the images it pulls from the registry.
        *   **Trust in Registry Content:**  Implicit trust in the content of the registry without proper validation.
        *   **Overly Permissive Registry Access:**  Even with stolen credentials, the ability to push images with arbitrary names and tags indicates a potential flaw in registry access controls.
        *   **Delayed Vulnerability Scanning:** If vulnerability scanning of images is performed only after deployment, the malicious image might already be running.

    *   **Impact:**  The impact of deploying a backdoored function image is severe:
        *   **Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the OpenFaaS function's container.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data processed by the function can be stolen.
        *   **Service Disruption:** The malicious function can be designed to crash or degrade the performance of the application.
        *   **Lateral Movement:** The compromised function can be used as a stepping stone to attack other services within the network.
        *   **Supply Chain Attack:**  This represents a significant supply chain vulnerability, as the malicious code is injected into the core deployment process.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Image Signing and Verification (e.g., Docker Content Trust):**  Ensure that only signed and trusted images can be pulled and deployed by OpenFaaS. This verifies the publisher and integrity of the image.
        *   **Enable Content Trust in Docker/Container Registry:** Configure the registry to enforce content trust, preventing the pushing of unsigned images.
        *   **Regular Vulnerability Scanning of Images:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning of container images both in the registry and during the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Image Provenance Tracking:**  Maintain a clear record of where images originate and how they are built.
        *   **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Treat deployed functions as immutable. If an update is needed, deploy a new version rather than modifying an existing one.
        *   **Runtime Security Monitoring:** Implement tools to monitor the behavior of running containers for suspicious activity.
        *   **Network Policies:**  Restrict network access for function containers to only necessary resources.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodically review registry access controls and security configurations.

### 5. Overall Impact Assessment
