# Threat Model Analysis for openfaas/faas

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass on the Gateway](./threats/authentication_bypass_on_the_gateway.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the OpenFaaS Gateway's authentication mechanisms (e.g., weak API key generation, flaws in authentication logic) to bypass authentication checks. They might then be able to invoke functions without valid credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access to application logic and data.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to functions, potential data breaches, ability to execute arbitrary code within the function environment, disruption of service.

**Affected Component:** OpenFaaS Gateway (specifically the authentication middleware and API endpoints).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong API key generation and management practices.
* Regularly review and audit the Gateway's authentication and authorization logic.
* Implement multi-factor authentication for accessing the Gateway's management interface.
* Keep the OpenFaaS Gateway software up-to-date with the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Function Invocation Abuse and Resource Exhaustion](./threats/function_invocation_abuse_and_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker could repeatedly invoke functions, either maliciously or through exploiting a vulnerability in the OpenFaaS Gateway, leading to excessive resource consumption on the underlying infrastructure. This could cause denial of service for legitimate users or incur significant costs.

**Impact:** Denial of service, increased infrastructure costs, performance degradation for other functions.

**Affected Component:** OpenFaaS Gateway (handling function requests), Function Invoker (responsible for executing functions).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on the OpenFaaS Gateway to restrict the number of invocations per function or per user.
* Set appropriate resource limits (CPU, memory) for each function within OpenFaaS configuration.
* Monitor function execution metrics provided by OpenFaaS to detect unusual activity.
* Implement authentication and authorization on the OpenFaaS Gateway to restrict who can invoke specific functions.

## Threat: [Function Image Tampering](./threats/function_image_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise the function image registry or the build process integrated with OpenFaaS to inject malicious code into function images. When these tampered images are deployed via OpenFaaS, the malicious code will be executed.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the function environment managed by OpenFaaS, potential data breaches, compromise of resources accessible by the function.

**Affected Component:** Function Store/Registry (as integrated with OpenFaaS), Function Build Process (as used by OpenFaaS).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the function image registry with strong authentication and authorization.
* Implement image signing and verification within the OpenFaaS deployment process to ensure the integrity of function images.
* Secure the CI/CD pipeline used to build and deploy function images through OpenFaaS.
* Regularly scan function images for vulnerabilities before deploying them with OpenFaaS.

## Threat: [Secrets Management Vulnerabilities](./threats/secrets_management_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If secrets (e.g., API keys, database credentials) used by functions deployed through OpenFaaS are not managed securely within the OpenFaaS ecosystem, attackers could gain access to them. This could allow them to access protected resources or impersonate legitimate services.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, compromise of other systems or services.

**Affected Component:** Secrets Store (if used by OpenFaaS), Function (accessing secrets managed by OpenFaaS), OpenFaaS Gateway (if secrets are managed there).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize OpenFaaS's built-in secrets management capabilities or integrate with external secrets management solutions securely.
* Grant functions only the necessary permissions to access specific secrets within the OpenFaaS configuration.
* Rotate secrets regularly.
* Avoid hardcoding secrets in function code or environment variables directly managed by OpenFaaS.
