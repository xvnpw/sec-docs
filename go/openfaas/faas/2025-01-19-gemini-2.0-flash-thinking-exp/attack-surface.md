# Attack Surface Analysis for openfaas/faas

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to OpenFaaS Gateway](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_openfaas_gateway.md)

**Description:** The OpenFaaS Gateway, the central point for function management and invocation, is accessible without proper authentication.

**How FaaS Contributes:** The Gateway is a core component of OpenFaaS, and its accessibility directly controls function deployment and execution. Lack of enforced authentication opens it up.

**Example:** An attacker uses `curl` or the OpenFaaS CLI to deploy a malicious function to the Gateway without providing any credentials.

**Impact:**  Critical. Attackers can deploy and execute arbitrary code within the OpenFaaS environment, potentially leading to data breaches, resource hijacking, and further attacks on internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement API Key Authentication:**  Require API keys for all requests to the Gateway. This can be configured in OpenFaaS.
* **Utilize OAuth 2.0 or other Identity Providers:** Integrate with an identity provider for more robust authentication and authorization.
* **Restrict Network Access:**  Use network policies or firewalls to limit access to the Gateway to authorized networks or IP addresses.

## Attack Surface: [Function Input Injection](./attack_surfaces/function_input_injection.md)

**Description:**  Malicious or unexpected data is injected into a function's input, leading to unintended behavior or code execution within the function.

**How FaaS Contributes:** OpenFaaS facilitates the invocation of functions with user-provided input. If functions don't properly validate this input, they become vulnerable.

**Example:** A function designed to process image uploads is sent a specially crafted file that exploits a vulnerability in the image processing library, leading to remote code execution within the function's container.

**Impact:** High. Can lead to code execution within the function's environment, data breaches (if the function has access to sensitive data), and resource abuse.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Validation and Sanitization within Functions:**  Developers must implement robust input validation and sanitization within their function code to handle unexpected or malicious input.
* **Use Type Checking and Data Validation Libraries:** Employ libraries that enforce data types and validate input against expected formats.
* **Principle of Least Privilege for Functions:**  Grant functions only the necessary permissions and access to resources to minimize the impact of a compromise.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Function Deployment Process](./attack_surfaces/insecure_function_deployment_process.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in how functions are deployed to OpenFaaS allow for the introduction of malicious code.

**How FaaS Contributes:** OpenFaaS relies on container images for function deployment. If this process is insecure, malicious images can be introduced.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the function registry used by OpenFaaS and pushes a compromised function image that contains malware. When this function is deployed, the malware is executed.

**Impact:** Critical. Allows for the deployment and execution of arbitrary malicious code within the OpenFaaS environment.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Function Registry:** Use a private Docker Registry with strong authentication and authorization.
* **Implement Image Scanning and Vulnerability Analysis:** Scan function images for known vulnerabilities before deployment.
* **Enforce Signed Images:**  Use image signing mechanisms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of function images.
* **Restrict Deployment Permissions:** Limit who can deploy functions to the OpenFaaS environment.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Function Secrets](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_function_secrets.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information (secrets) used by functions is exposed or accessible to unauthorized parties.

**How FaaS Contributes:** OpenFaaS provides mechanisms for managing secrets, but misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in this system can lead to exposure.

**Example:** A function's environment variables, which contain database credentials, are inadvertently logged or exposed through a monitoring system.

**Impact:** High. Exposure of secrets can lead to unauthorized access to databases, APIs, and other sensitive resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use OpenFaaS Secrets Management Securely:** Utilize the built-in secrets management features of OpenFaaS and ensure proper access controls are in place.
* **Encrypt Secrets at Rest and in Transit:** Ensure secrets are encrypted when stored and during transmission.
* **Principle of Least Privilege for Secrets:** Grant functions access only to the secrets they absolutely need.
* **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Never hardcode secrets directly into function code or configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Function Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_function_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Functions rely on external libraries and dependencies that contain security vulnerabilities.

**How FaaS Contributes:** OpenFaaS executes the code within the function's container, including any vulnerable dependencies.

**Example:** A function uses an outdated version of a popular library with a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the function.

**Impact:** High. Vulnerabilities in dependencies can lead to code execution within the function's environment and potentially compromise the underlying infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep function dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* **Use Dependency Scanning Tools:** Employ tools to scan function dependencies for known vulnerabilities during development and deployment.
* **Pin Dependency Versions:**  Specify exact versions of dependencies to avoid unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Function Environment Isolation](./attack_surfaces/insecure_function_environment_isolation.md)

**Description:**  The isolation between function execution environments is insufficient, allowing for potential cross-contamination or escape.

**How FaaS Contributes:** OpenFaaS relies on containerization for function isolation. Weaknesses in the container runtime or configuration can compromise this isolation.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a container escape vulnerability in the underlying container runtime to gain access to the host system from within a function's container.

**Impact:** Critical. Can lead to complete compromise of the underlying infrastructure and access to other functions or sensitive data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Container Runtime Up-to-Date:** Ensure the container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd) is updated with the latest security patches.
* **Harden Container Configurations:**  Implement security best practices for container configurations, such as using read-only file systems and limiting capabilities.
* **Utilize Security Contexts:**  Leverage Kubernetes security contexts (if applicable) to further restrict function container privileges.
