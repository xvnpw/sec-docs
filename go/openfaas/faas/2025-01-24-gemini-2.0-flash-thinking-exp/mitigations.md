# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for openfaas/faas

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Function Execution using OpenFaaS RBAC](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_function_execution_using_openfaas_rbac.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When deploying functions using OpenFaaS, define the minimum necessary permissions required for the function to operate correctly *within the OpenFaaS context*.
    2.  Avoid using overly permissive service accounts or roles for function deployments *managed by OpenFaaS*.
    3.  Utilize **OpenFaaS Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage access to functions and platform resources. Define roles with specific permissions (e.g., function invocation, function management) and assign them to users or service accounts based on their needs *within the OpenFaaS platform*.  This is configured through OpenFaaS's `faas-cli` and Kubernetes RBAC integration.
    4.  Regularly review and audit function permissions *within OpenFaaS RBAC configurations* to ensure they remain aligned with the principle of least privilege and remove any unnecessary permissions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Privilege Escalation (High Severity): An attacker gaining higher privileges than intended due to overly permissive function permissions *within the OpenFaaS platform*.
    *   Unauthorized Function Management (Medium Severity): Users or services gaining unauthorized access to manage functions (deploy, update, delete) due to lack of RBAC enforcement in OpenFaaS.
*   **Impact:** High Reduction for Privilege Escalation, Medium Reduction for Unauthorized Function Management.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Kubernetes RBAC is enabled for the OpenFaaS namespace, which provides a foundation for OpenFaaS RBAC.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular OpenFaaS RBAC roles are not fully defined and implemented using OpenFaaS's specific RBAC features.  Function permissions within OpenFaaS are not regularly audited.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Secrets Management for Functions using OpenFaaS Secret Provider](./mitigation_strategies/secure_secrets_management_for_functions_using_openfaas_secret_provider.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all secrets required by functions deployed on OpenFaaS (e.g., API keys, database credentials, certificates).
    2.  Never hardcode secrets directly in function code, configuration files, or *OpenFaaS function environment variables*.
    3.  Integrate OpenFaaS with a secure secret management solution like HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets (used with OpenFaaS's secret provider), or a cloud provider's secret manager.  OpenFaaS provides mechanisms to integrate with these.
    4.  Store secrets securely in the chosen secret management solution *outside of OpenFaaS function definitions*.
    5.  Configure functions to retrieve secrets at runtime from the secret management solution using **OpenFaaS's secret provider mechanism**. This involves configuring function deployments to reference secrets managed by the external provider through OpenFaaS annotations or labels.
    6.  Implement secret rotation policies to periodically change secrets, reducing the window of opportunity if a secret is compromised. *This should be integrated with the chosen secret management solution and potentially orchestrated with OpenFaaS deployments if needed*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Secret Exposure (High Severity): Hardcoded secrets being exposed in *OpenFaaS function configurations*, logs, or environment variables, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
    *   Credential Stuffing/Replay Attacks (High Severity): Stolen secrets being used to impersonate legitimate users or services *accessing resources through OpenFaaS functions*.
    *   Data Breach (High Severity): Compromised secrets providing access to sensitive data *accessible by OpenFaaS functions*.
*   **Impact:** High Reduction for Secret Exposure, Credential Stuffing/Replay Attacks, and Data Breach related to secret compromise.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Kubernetes Secrets are used to store some API keys, but direct integration with OpenFaaS secret provider is not fully utilized for all secrets.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Full integration with OpenFaaS secret provider for all function secrets is missing.  A dedicated secret management solution like HashiCorp Vault integrated with OpenFaaS is not implemented. Secret rotation is not implemented in conjunction with OpenFaaS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS/HTTPS for OpenFaaS Gateway](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tlshttps_for_openfaas_gateway.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Obtain a TLS/SSL certificate for the domain or hostname used to access the **OpenFaaS Gateway**.
    2.  Configure the **OpenFaaS Gateway** to use the TLS certificate. This typically involves configuring the Gateway deployment with the certificate and private key, often through Kubernetes Secrets and Gateway deployment manifests.
    3.  Enforce HTTPS redirection to ensure all traffic to the **OpenFaaS Gateway** is encrypted. This can be configured at the ingress controller level or within the Gateway configuration itself if supported.
    4.  Regularly renew the TLS certificate before it expires. Automate certificate renewal using tools like Let's Encrypt and cert-manager, ensuring these tools are correctly configured to update the **OpenFaaS Gateway's** TLS configuration.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity): Interception of unencrypted traffic to the **OpenFaaS Gateway**, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive data or modify requests intended for OpenFaaS functions.
    *   Data Exposure in Transit (High Severity): Sensitive data transmitted in plaintext over HTTP to/from the **OpenFaaS Gateway**, vulnerable to interception.
    *   Session Hijacking (Medium Severity): Unencrypted session cookies or tokens used for **OpenFaaS Gateway** authentication being intercepted and used to impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** High Reduction for Man-in-the-Middle Attacks and Data Exposure in Transit, Medium Reduction for Session Hijacking related to OpenFaaS Gateway access.
*   **Currently Implemented:** TLS/HTTPS is enabled for the OpenFaaS Gateway using a certificate managed by cert-manager.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  HTTPS redirection is not strictly enforced in all configurations accessing the OpenFaaS Gateway. Certificate renewal process monitoring specific to OpenFaaS Gateway configuration could be improved.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting on OpenFaaS Gateway](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_on_openfaas_gateway.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify appropriate rate limits for the **OpenFaaS Gateway** based on expected traffic patterns and resource capacity for function invocations. Consider different rate limits for different function categories or API endpoints exposed through the Gateway if needed.
    2.  Configure rate limiting mechanisms on the **OpenFaaS Gateway**. This can be achieved using ingress controllers with rate limiting capabilities (e.g., Nginx Ingress Controller with rate limiting annotations applied to the OpenFaaS Gateway service) or dedicated API Gateway solutions placed in front of OpenFaaS.
    3.  Define appropriate responses when rate limits are exceeded (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests) *returned by the OpenFaaS Gateway*.
    4.  Monitor rate limiting metrics *specifically for the OpenFaaS Gateway* to identify potential attacks or adjust rate limits as needed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity): Overwhelming the **OpenFaaS Gateway** with excessive requests, making functions unavailable to legitimate users *through the OpenFaaS platform*.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity): Automated attempts to guess credentials or exploit vulnerabilities by sending a large number of requests *to the OpenFaaS Gateway*.
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity): Uncontrolled request volume leading to resource exhaustion on the **OpenFaaS Gateway** and backend infrastructure supporting OpenFaaS function execution.
*   **Impact:** High Reduction for DoS Attacks, Medium Reduction for Brute-Force Attacks and Resource Exhaustion targeting the OpenFaaS Gateway.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic rate limiting is configured on the ingress controller for the OpenFaaS Gateway, limiting requests per IP address.
*   **Missing Implementation:** More granular rate limiting based on function categories or specific API endpoints exposed through the OpenFaaS Gateway is not implemented. Rate limiting metrics *specifically for the OpenFaaS Gateway* are not actively monitored. Dynamic rate limit adjustments based on traffic patterns *at the OpenFaaS Gateway level* are not in place.
