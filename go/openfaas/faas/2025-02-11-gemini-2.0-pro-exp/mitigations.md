# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for openfaas/faas

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits Enforcement (FaaS-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_enforcement__faas-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Enforce strict resource limits (CPU, memory, execution time) on *each* function.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **FaaS Context:**  In FaaS, functions are often short-lived and execute in response to events.  Resource limits are *crucial* because a single runaway function can impact the entire platform, affecting other users/functions.
    2.  **`stack.yml` Configuration:**  Use OpenFaaS's `stack.yml` to define `limits` (maximum) and `requests` (guaranteed) for CPU and memory, and `exec_timeout` for execution time.  This leverages the underlying container orchestration (usually Kubernetes).
        ```yaml
        functions:
          my-function:
            limits:
              memory: 128Mi
              cpu: 0.5
            requests:
              memory: 64Mi
              cpu: 0.2
            exec_timeout: 30s
        ```
    3.  **FaaS-Specific Monitoring:**  Monitor function resource usage *per invocation* and *per function*.  OpenFaaS integrations with Prometheus/Grafana are designed for this.  Set alerts for functions exceeding limits or exhibiting anomalous behavior.  This is different from monitoring a traditional long-running application.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **FaaS-Specific Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):**  A single function consuming excessive resources can prevent *other* functions from running, a key concern in a multi-tenant FaaS environment.
    *   **Cost Overruns in Pay-per-Use FaaS (Medium Severity):**  Uncontrolled resource consumption directly translates to higher costs in cloud-based FaaS offerings.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **FaaS-Specific DoS:**  Directly prevents resource exhaustion DoS attacks targeting the FaaS platform. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Cost Overruns:**  Controls costs by preventing runaway function resource usage. Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example:  `image-processor` function has limits in `stack.yml`. Prometheus/Grafana dashboards are used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example:  `notification-sender` lacks limits. Alerts for overconsumption are not configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Function Isolation Enforcement (FaaS-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/function_isolation_enforcement__faas-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Ensure strong isolation between functions, even within the same cluster.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **FaaS Context:**  Functions are often deployed by different teams or even different users.  Strong isolation is essential to prevent one compromised function from affecting others.
    2.  **Containerization:** OpenFaaS uses containers (Docker, containerd) for isolation.  This is the *baseline*, but further steps are needed.
    3.  **Network Policies (Kubernetes):**  If using Kubernetes, implement Network Policies to restrict network access *between* functions.  A compromised function should only be able to communicate with the resources it *absolutely* needs.  This is *crucially* important in FaaS.
    4.  **Security-Enhanced Runtimes (Optional):** Consider using runtimes like gVisor or Kata Containers for *stronger* isolation than standard runc.  This adds overhead, so evaluate the performance impact. This is a FaaS-specific consideration due to the multi-tenancy and short-lived nature of functions.
    5. **Namespaces (Kubernetes):** Use Kubernetes namespaces to logically separate functions belonging to different teams or applications. This provides an additional layer of isolation and access control.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lateral Movement between Functions (High Severity):**  A compromised function should not be able to attack other functions on the same platform. This is a *primary* concern in FaaS.
    *   **Container Escape (Medium Severity):**  Stronger isolation (e.g., with gVisor) reduces the impact of a container escape vulnerability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Lateral Movement:**  Significantly reduces the risk of cross-function attacks. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Container Escape:**  Provides an additional layer of defense. Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Basic Kubernetes Network Policies isolate the `openfaas-fn` namespace.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example:  Fine-grained Network Policies *between* functions are missing.  gVisor/Kata are not used. Namespace separation is not fully utilized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Event Source Authentication and Authorization (FaaS-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/event_source_authentication_and_authorization__faas-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Securely authenticate and authorize the sources of events that trigger functions.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **FaaS Context:**  Functions are *event-driven*.  The security of the event source is *directly* tied to the security of the function.
    2.  **Authentication:**  Ensure that only authorized event sources can trigger your functions.  The method depends on the event source:
        *   **Message Queues (Kafka, NATS, etc.):** Use credentials and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict who can publish messages to the topics that trigger your functions.
        *   **HTTP Webhooks:**  Validate the authenticity of webhook requests using techniques like HMAC signatures (shared secret) or mutual TLS authentication.
        *   **Cloud Provider Events (AWS S3, Azure Event Grid, etc.):**  Use IAM roles and policies to control access to the event sources.
    3.  **Authorization:**  Even after authentication, verify that the event source has the *permission* to trigger the specific function.  This can be done within the function itself or using platform-level mechanisms (e.g., IAM policies).
    4. **Event Validation:** After authenticating the *source*, validate the *content* of the event itself. Check for expected structure and data types to prevent injection attacks *via* the event payload. This is input validation, but it's *specifically* important in the context of FaaS event triggers.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Function Invocation (High Severity):**  Prevents attackers from triggering functions with malicious or unexpected inputs. This is a *direct* threat to FaaS.
    *   **Injection Attacks via Event Payloads (High Severity):**  Malicious data injected into the event payload can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the function.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Event Flooding (Medium Severity):**  While resource limits help, securing the event source prevents an attacker from overwhelming the system with events.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Invocation:**  Eliminates the risk of unauthorized function execution. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Injection via Events:**  Prevents injection attacks that leverage the event payload. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **DoS via Events:**  Reduces the risk of DoS attacks originating from the event source. Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example:  HMAC signatures are used to validate webhooks from GitHub.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example:  Authentication and authorization for message queue triggers are not fully implemented. Event payload validation is basic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Cold Start Mitigation (Performance and Security)](./mitigation_strategies/cold_start_mitigation__performance_and_security_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize function cold starts.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **FaaS Context:** Cold starts (the time it takes to initialize a function instance) are inherent to FaaS. While primarily a performance issue, they have security implications.
    2.  **Keep Functions Warm:** Use techniques like "function warming" (periodically invoking functions to keep them in memory) to reduce cold starts. OpenFaaS provides mechanisms for this.
    3.  **Optimize Function Code:** Minimize dependencies and code size to reduce the time it takes to load the function.
    4.  **Choose Appropriate Runtimes:** Some language runtimes (e.g., Go, compiled languages) have faster startup times than others (e.g., Python, Node.js with many dependencies).
    5. **Provisioned Concurrency (Cloud-Specific):** Some cloud providers (like AWS Lambda) offer "provisioned concurrency" to keep a specified number of function instances warm, eliminating cold starts (at a cost).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Timing Attacks (Low Severity):** While not a primary concern, consistent cold start times can make timing attacks slightly more difficult.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Amplification (Low Severity):** If an attacker can trigger many cold starts, it could potentially amplify a DoS attack by consuming more resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Timing Attacks:** Minor reduction in risk. Risk reduction: Low.
    *   **DoS Amplification:** Minor reduction in risk. Risk reduction: Low.
    *   **Performance:** Significant improvement in function response times. (Primary benefit)

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Basic function warming is enabled for frequently used functions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Code optimization for cold starts is not a priority. Provisioned concurrency is not used.
