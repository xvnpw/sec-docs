# Threat Model Analysis for openfaas/faas

## Threat: [Function Code Injection via Unvalidated Input (FaaS Context)](./threats/function_code_injection_via_unvalidated_input__faas_context_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input to a function that is not properly sanitized. This input is used in a way that allows code execution *within the function's runtime environment*, leveraging FaaS-specific execution contexts (e.g., exploiting how the FaaS platform handles input/output or interacts with the underlying container). This is *not* a general web injection, but one exploiting the FaaS execution model.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the function; arbitrary code execution; access to sensitive data the function handles; potential lateral movement to other functions or FaaS components if permissions allow.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The specific vulnerable function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Rigorous input validation and sanitization, specifically tailored to the expected data format and function logic. Whitelisting is strongly preferred.
        *   **Avoid Dangerous Functions/Patterns:**  Prohibit or severely restrict the use of functions like `eval()`, `exec()`, `system()`, or any dynamic code execution based on user input.  Identify and mitigate FaaS-specific patterns that could be abused.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Function Context):** Ensure the function's runtime environment has the absolute minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid running as root within the container.
        *   **Code Review (FaaS-Specific):**  Code reviews must focus on how the function interacts with the FaaS platform and its input/output handling, looking for FaaS-specific injection vectors.
        *   **Static Analysis (FaaS-Aware):** Use static analysis tools that understand FaaS execution models and can detect injection vulnerabilities specific to the chosen FaaS platform.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Function Resource Exhaustion (FaaS-Specific)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_function_resource_exhaustion__faas-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts input that causes a function to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network) *within the constraints of the FaaS platform*. This exploits the scaling and resource management mechanisms of OpenFaaS itself.  The attacker repeatedly invokes the function, aiming to exhaust resources allocated to the function or the underlying FaaS infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:** Unresponsive function; potential cascading failures affecting other functions; possible denial of service for the entire OpenFaaS deployment if scaling limits are not properly configured or if the underlying infrastructure is overwhelmed.
    *   **Affected Component:** The targeted function, OpenFaaS Gateway, and potentially worker nodes (faas-netes if using Kubernetes).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **FaaS-Specific Resource Limits:** Configure strict resource limits (CPU, memory, execution time, *concurrent invocations*) for *each* function using OpenFaaS's configuration options.
        *   **Input Validation (Size/Complexity):** Validate input size and complexity to prevent excessively large or computationally expensive inputs that could bypass resource limits.
        *   **Rate Limiting (at Gateway):** Implement rate limiting at the OpenFaaS API Gateway to control the invocation rate per user, IP, or other criteria. This is a *critical* FaaS-level control.
        *   **Timeout Configuration (FaaS Level):** Set appropriate function execution timeouts *within OpenFaaS* to prevent long-running or hung processes from consuming resources indefinitely.
        *   **Circuit Breakers (FaaS Integration):** Integrate circuit breakers with OpenFaaS to automatically stop invoking a failing function, preventing cascading failures.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Function Deployment (to OpenFaaS)](./threats/unauthorized_function_deployment__to_openfaas_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the OpenFaaS deployment environment (e.g., Kubernetes cluster credentials, OpenFaaS CLI access) and deploys a malicious function or modifies an existing function's code or configuration *through the OpenFaaS deployment mechanisms*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the deployed malicious function; ability to execute arbitrary code with the function's privileges; access to any data the function handles; potential to compromise the entire OpenFaaS deployment or connected services.
    *   **Affected Component:**  OpenFaaS Gateway, faas-netes (if using Kubernetes), and the deployed function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication/Authorization (for OpenFaaS):** Implement robust authentication and authorization for *all* access to the OpenFaaS deployment environment (Kubernetes RBAC, OpenFaaS CLI authentication).
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Deployment Permissions):** Grant only the *minimum* necessary permissions to users and service accounts that interact with OpenFaaS for deployments.
        *   **Image Signing (for Function Images):**  Enforce the use of signed function container images (e.g., Docker Content Trust, Notary) to verify the integrity and origin of deployed functions.  OpenFaaS should reject unsigned images.
        *   **Audit Logging (OpenFaaS Actions):** Enable comprehensive audit logging for all OpenFaaS deployment-related actions (function creation, updates, deletion).
        *   **Regular Security Audits (OpenFaaS Deployment):** Conduct regular security audits of the OpenFaaS deployment environment, including access controls, network policies, and configuration.

## Threat: [OpenFaaS Gateway Bypass (Direct Function Access)](./threats/openfaas_gateway_bypass__direct_function_access_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker directly accesses functions or internal OpenFaaS components, *bypassing the OpenFaaS API Gateway* and its security controls (authentication, authorization, rate limiting). This is often due to misconfigured network policies or exposed internal services within the FaaS deployment.
    *   **Impact:** Bypass of all Gateway-level security; unauthorized function invocation; potential access to internal OpenFaaS components and their data; ability to launch attacks without being subject to rate limits or other Gateway protections.
    *   **Affected Component:** OpenFaaS Gateway, individual functions, and potentially other OpenFaaS components (e.g., queue-worker, Prometheus).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Network Policies (Strict Enforcement):** Implement *strict* network policies (e.g., Kubernetes Network Policies) to isolate functions and internal OpenFaaS components.  *Only* allow traffic from the OpenFaaS Gateway to functions.  Deny all other direct access.
        *   **Service Mesh (for Advanced Control):** Consider using a service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) for more granular network control, mutual TLS authentication between services, and enhanced observability within the OpenFaaS deployment.
        *   **Regular Security Audits (Network Configuration):** Regularly audit network configurations and access controls to ensure that the Gateway cannot be bypassed.
        *   **Internal Authentication (Between Components):** Even for internal communication *within* the OpenFaaS deployment, consider using authentication mechanisms (e.g., mTLS) between components to prevent unauthorized access.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Functions (FaaS-Specific Impact)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_functions__faas-specific_impact_.md)

* **Description:** A function uses vulnerable third-party libraries. While this is a general issue, the *impact* within a FaaS environment is heightened due to the potential for rapid scaling and the shared infrastructure. An attacker exploits these vulnerabilities, and the compromised function is rapidly scaled, amplifying the attack.
    * **Impact:** Code execution within the function's container, data breaches, potential privilege escalation *within the FaaS environment*, and potentially a wider impact due to the rapid scaling of the compromised function.
    * **Affected Component:** The specific function.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (npm, pip, etc.) to track dependencies.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using automated tools. Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Update Dependencies:** Keep dependencies up to date.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to identify and manage open-source components and their risks.
        * **Minimal Base Images:** Use minimal base images for your function containers to reduce the attack surface.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Function Secrets (FaaS Integration)](./threats/misconfigured_function_secrets__faas_integration_.md)

*   **Description:** Secrets (API keys, etc.) required by a function are stored insecurely.  This is particularly relevant in a FaaS context because secrets are often managed *through the FaaS platform* (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, OpenFaaS secrets). Misconfiguration of *these platform-level secret mechanisms* is the threat.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to external services or data. The FaaS platform's secret management is compromised.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific function and the OpenFaaS secrets management mechanism (e.g., faas-netes secrets).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Proper Use of FaaS Secrets Management:** Use the OpenFaaS-provided secrets management solution (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets) *correctly*. Understand its security properties and limitations.
        *   **Avoid Hardcoding:** Never hardcode secrets in function code.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Secret Access):** Grant functions access only to the specific secrets they require.  Don't provide overly broad access.
        *   **Regular Audits of Secret Configuration:** Regularly audit how secrets are configured and accessed within OpenFaaS.
        * **External Secret Stores (Optional):** For enhanced security, consider integrating with external secret stores like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault, and configure OpenFaaS to use them.
