# BUSINESS POSTURE

Memos is a privacy-first, open-source note-taking application. It is designed to be lightweight and fast, allowing users to quickly capture and organize their thoughts and ideas. The project emphasizes simplicity and ease of use, aiming to provide a seamless note-taking experience across different devices.

Business Priorities and Goals:

- Provide a user-friendly and efficient note-taking solution.
- Ensure user data privacy and control.
- Foster an open-source community around the project.
- Offer a stable and reliable application for daily use.
- Enable users to self-host and control their data.

Most Important Business Risks:

- Data loss due to software bugs or infrastructure failures.
- Privacy breaches exposing user notes.
- Security vulnerabilities leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation.
- Lack of user adoption if the application is not perceived as secure or reliable.
- Reputational damage if security incidents occur.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: HTTPS enforced for web access (assumption based on common web application practices).
- security control: Standard authentication mechanisms (username/password, potentially OAuth - needs clarification).
- security control: Authorization model to control access to notes (likely role-based or ownership-based - needs clarification).
- security control: Input validation on user inputs to prevent common web vulnerabilities (assumption, needs verification).
- security control: Regular dependency updates to address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (standard open-source practice).
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security patches and code reviews (inherent in open-source projects).
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- accepted risk: Security of self-hosted deployments is the responsibility of the user.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing or security audits.
- security control: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service.
- security control: Enhance input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks.
- security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring for security events.
- security control: Provide clear security guidelines and best practices for self-hosting users.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure authentication mechanism to verify user identity.
    - requirement: Protection against brute-force attacks on login.
    - requirement: Secure password storage (hashing and salting).
    - requirement: Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

- Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-based or ownership-based access control to notes.
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege applied to user access.
    - requirement: Secure API authorization for programmatic access (if applicable).

- Input Validation:
    - requirement: Validate all user inputs on both client and server-side.
    - requirement: Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
    - requirement: Use appropriate data types and formats to limit potential vulnerabilities.

- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.
    - requirement: Securely store sensitive data at rest (e.g., user passwords).
    - requirement: Consider encryption for user notes at rest for enhanced privacy (optional, depending on business priorities).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

- Storing and retrieving user memos securely and reliably.
- User authentication and authorization to access their memos.
- Maintaining the availability and integrity of the Memos application.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

- User memos: Potentially contain sensitive personal information, private thoughts, and ideas. Sensitivity level: High. Requires confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- User credentials (passwords): Highly sensitive. Sensitivity level: Critical. Requires strong confidentiality and integrity.
- Application configuration and settings: Less sensitive but important for application functionality. Sensitivity level: Medium. Requires integrity and availability.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What database system is used by Memos (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL)?
- Is there a dedicated API server component, or is the API integrated within the web application?
- What authentication mechanisms are currently implemented (username/password, OAuth)?
- What is the authorization model for memos (ownership-based, role-based)?
- Are there any existing security scanning or penetration testing practices in place?
- What is the planned deployment environment (cloud, self-hosted, etc.)?
- Is data at rest encryption considered or implemented?

Assumptions:

- Memos is intended to be a privacy-focused application.
- Security is a significant concern for the project.
- The project follows standard open-source development practices.
- The deployment will likely involve containerization (Docker).
- HTTPS is enforced for all web traffic.
- Basic authentication and authorization are implemented.
