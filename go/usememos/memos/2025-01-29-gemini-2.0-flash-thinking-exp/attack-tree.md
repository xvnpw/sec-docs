## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Memos:](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__high-risk_path__exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_memos.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Stored XSS in Memo Content:**
        *   **[LEAF, HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject malicious JavaScript in memo content:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the content of a memo. This could be done through the memo creation or editing interface.
            *   **Exploitation:** When another user views the memo, the stored JavaScript code executes in their browser.
            *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application for the victim user, or further attacks against the victim's system.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Reflected XSS in Search/Filter Parameters:**
        *   **[LEAF, HIGH-RISK PATH] Craft malicious URL with JavaScript payload in search query:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code within a search or filter parameter.
            *   **Exploitation:** The attacker tricks a victim user into clicking the malicious URL. When the application processes the URL, the JavaScript code is reflected back to the user's browser and executed.
            *   **Impact:** Similar to Stored XSS, but requires victim interaction to click the malicious link. Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection, etc.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Markdown Injection/Abuse:**
        *   **[LEAF, HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject malicious Markdown to bypass sanitization:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker injects specially crafted Markdown syntax into memo content that exploits vulnerabilities in the Markdown parser or bypasses sanitization mechanisms.
            *   **Exploitation:** When the memo is rendered, the malicious Markdown can lead to unexpected behavior, such as loading external resources from attacker-controlled sites, or in some cases, HTML injection if the parser is misconfigured.
            *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (loading images from attacker's server can reveal IP addresses), client-side vulnerabilities, redirection to malicious sites. While often less severe than full XSS, it can still be exploited for malicious purposes.
