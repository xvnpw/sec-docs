# Attack Surface Analysis for usememos/memos

## Attack Surface: [Memo Content Manipulation (Direct Injection)](./attack_surfaces/memo_content_manipulation__direct_injection_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attacks exploiting how `memos` processes and renders user-supplied memo content (Markdown, HTML, or other supported formats) to inject malicious code or data. This is *distinct* from general XSS, as it focuses on the *specific* parsing and rendering logic of `memos`.
*   **How `memos` Contributes:** `memos`'s primary function is accepting, storing, and displaying user-generated content.  The Markdown rendering engine, any custom rendering logic, and handling of embedded resources (images, links, iframes if allowed) are all direct contributors to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a memo with malicious Markdown that exploits a vulnerability in the *specific* Markdown parser used by `memos` to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the server or execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browsers of other users.  Another example: if `memos` allows certain HTML tags, an attacker might use these to bypass sanitization and inject malicious scripts.
*   **Impact:**  Server compromise (RCE), user account compromise, data theft, defacement, malware distribution, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if RCE is possible) or **High** (for client-side attacks like XSS).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use a *securely configured*, well-vetted, and *up-to-date* Markdown parser known for its security.  Avoid custom or less-common parsers unless they have undergone rigorous security review.
        *   Implement *strict* input validation *before* Markdown processing, rejecting any input that doesn't conform to a tightly defined whitelist of allowed characters and structures.
        *   Employ a *strong* Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the types of content that can be loaded and executed within the `memos` context.  This is a *critical* defense-in-depth measure, even with a secure parser.
        *   Sanitize the *output* of the Markdown parser (the generated HTML) to ensure that only safe HTML is rendered. This acts as a second layer of defense.
        *   If supporting file uploads (images, etc.), implement *rigorous* file type validation (checking the *actual* file content, not just the extension), size limits, and consider virus scanning. Store uploaded files securely, ideally outside the web root.
        *   Regularly audit the *entire* content processing pipeline (input validation, Markdown parsing, output sanitization, file handling) for vulnerabilities.
        *   If plugins or custom rendering are allowed, implement a *robust* sandboxing mechanism and a *strict* permission system.  This is extremely important if extending functionality.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Memo Access (Bypassing Access Controls)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_memo_access__bypassing_access_controls_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks that bypass `memos`'s built-in access control mechanisms (public/private/protected visibility, user roles) to view, modify, or delete memos without proper authorization.
*   **How `memos` Contributes:** `memos` provides features for controlling memo visibility and potentially user permissions. The logic that *enforces* these features is the direct attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits an IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerability by manipulating the memo ID in a URL or API request to access a private memo that belongs to another user.  Or, an attacker exploits a flaw in the session management to impersonate another user and gain access to their private memos.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches (exposure of private information), privacy violations, unauthorized modification or deletion of memos.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** or **Critical** (depending on the sensitivity of the data exposed and the level of access gained).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization checks *on every server-side request* that accesses or modifies memo data.  *Never* rely solely on client-side checks.
        *   Use a consistent and well-tested authorization framework or library.
        *   Avoid predictable resource identifiers (e.g., sequential IDs). Use UUIDs or other unpredictable identifiers for memos and other resources.
        *   Thoroughly test *all* access control logic, including edge cases, concurrent requests, and different user roles/permissions.
        *   Implement secure session management, using strong, randomly generated session IDs, HTTPS, and appropriate session timeouts and invalidation.
        *   Regularly audit the access control implementation and conduct penetration testing.

## Attack Surface: [API Abuse (Targeting `memos`-Specific Endpoints)](./attack_surfaces/api_abuse__targeting__memos_-specific_endpoints_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks specifically targeting the `memos` API to perform unauthorized actions, extract data, or cause denial of service. This focuses on vulnerabilities *within* the API's design and implementation, not general API security principles.
*   **How `memos` Contributes:** `memos` exposes an API for interacting with the application.  The design and implementation of *these specific API endpoints* are the direct attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers an undocumented or poorly secured API endpoint in `memos` that allows them to bypass authentication and create, modify, or delete memos. Or, an attacker exploits a vulnerability in a specific API endpoint's parameter handling to inject malicious code. Another example is an attacker using the API to rapidly create memos, exceeding rate limits and causing a denial of service.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of service, data breaches, unauthorized access to memos, system compromise (if RCE is possible).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** or **Critical** (depending on the specific vulnerability and its impact).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Require *strong* authentication for *all* `memos` API endpoints that access or modify data.
        *   Implement *strict* input validation and sanitization for *all* API parameters, specific to the expected data type and format for each endpoint.
        *   Implement *robust* rate limiting and throttling on *all* API requests, with different limits potentially applied to different endpoints and user roles.
        *   Use a well-defined API specification (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) and keep it *up-to-date*. This helps with both security and maintainability.
        *   Securely handle API keys and tokens. Avoid hardcoding them. Use appropriate expiration and revocation mechanisms.
        *   *Log all API requests*, including successful and failed attempts, for auditing and security monitoring.
        *   Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing *specifically targeting the `memos` API*.
        *   Avoid exposing unnecessary information in API responses or error messages.  Be careful about revealing internal implementation details.
