                  [CRITICAL]

                  is improperly handled)

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise User Accounts](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_user_accounts.md)

*   **1.1 Weak Passwords `[HIGH RISK]`**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit users' tendency to choose weak, easily guessable, or reused passwords.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** High (Full account compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity, character types).
        *   Implement and encourage the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Educate users about password security best practices (avoiding reuse, using password managers).
        *   Monitor for and block brute-force login attempts.
        *   Consider passwordless authentication methods (e.g., WebAuthn).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **2.1 Input Validation Issues `[CRITICAL]`**
    *   **Description:** Insufficient or incorrect validation of user-supplied data allows attackers to inject malicious code or manipulate application logic. This is a broad category encompassing various injection attacks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on code quality)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Can lead to data breaches, code execution, complete system compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploiting known vulnerabilities)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Affected Input Fields:**
        *   Memo Creation: Content, title, visibility settings.
        *   Memo Editing:  Same as creation.
        *   Memo Deletion: Memo ID.
        *   User Authentication: Username, password.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on *both* the client-side (for user experience) and, *crucially*, the server-side (for security).
        *   Use a whitelist approach: Define *allowed* input rather than trying to block *disallowed* input.
        *   Validate data types, lengths, formats, and ranges.
        *   Sanitize all user input before using it in any sensitive context (database queries, system commands, HTML output).
        *   Use a well-vetted input validation library.

    *   **2.1.1 SQL Injection `[CRITICAL]`**
        *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through input fields to manipulate database queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data, modifying data, or even executing arbitrary commands on the database server.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (If parameterized queries are used)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Full database compromise, data exfiltration, data modification)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) *exclusively* for *all* database interactions.  *Never* construct SQL queries by concatenating user input.
            *   Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that handles parameterized queries safely, if possible.
            *   Implement least privilege: The database user account used by the application should have only the minimum necessary permissions.
            *   Regularly audit database interactions for potential vulnerabilities.
            *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with SQL injection detection capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities.md)

*    **3.2 XSS via Memo Content (Stored) `[CRITICAL]`**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into memo content.  This code is then stored on the server and executed in the browsers of other users who view the memo, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or session hijacking.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (If proper sanitization is in place)
    *   **Impact:** High (Account compromise, data theft, session hijacking)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize *all* user-supplied content, including memo content, *before* displaying it.  This is the *most important* defense.
        *   Use a robust HTML sanitizer library that is specifically designed to prevent XSS and is actively maintained.  Examples include DOMPurify (for JavaScript) or equivalents in other languages.
        *   Even if using Markdown, ensure the Markdown parser and renderer are secure and properly configured to prevent the injection of raw HTML or JavaScript.  The output of the Markdown renderer *must* still be sanitized.
        *   Encode output appropriately for the context (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of content that can be executed in the browser.  A well-configured CSP can significantly mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.  Be careful to configure the CSP correctly to avoid breaking legitimate functionality.
        *   Set the `HttpOnly` flag on session cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing them.
        *   Regularly test for XSS vulnerabilities using automated scanners and manual penetration testing.
