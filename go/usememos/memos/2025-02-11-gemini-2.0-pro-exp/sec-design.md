# BUSINESS POSTURE

Memos is an open-source, self-hosted memo hub with knowledge management and social networking features. Based on the GitHub repository, the business priorities and goals appear to be:

*   Provide a lightweight, easy-to-use, and self-hostable note-taking/memo service.
*   Enable users to easily capture and share thoughts, ideas, and information.
*   Offer a privacy-focused alternative to centralized note-taking services.
*   Foster a community around the project through open-source development.
*   Support basic knowledge management features like tagging and linking.
*   Allow for some level of social interaction (sharing memos, potentially comments in the future).

The most important business risks that need to be addressed are:

*   Data breaches: Unauthorized access to user memos and personal information.
*   Data loss: Accidental or malicious deletion of user data.
*   Service unavailability: Downtime or performance issues preventing users from accessing their memos.
*   Abuse of the platform: Users posting malicious content or spamming other users.
*   Compromise of the host system: Attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in Memos to gain access to the underlying server.
*   Lack of user adoption: Insufficient interest in the project, leading to stagnation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls (based on the repository and common practices):

*   security control: Authentication: User accounts with password-based login (implementation in server-side Go code).
*   security control: Authorization: Basic access control to ensure users can only access their own memos and public memos (implementation in server-side Go code).
*   security control: Data storage: SQLite database for storing memos and user data (default configuration).
*   security control: Docker deployment: Option to deploy Memos using Docker, providing some level of isolation.
*   security control: Reverse proxy configuration: Examples provided for using Nginx as a reverse proxy, enabling HTTPS and other security features.
*   security control: Basic input sanitization: Likely implemented in the frontend (React) and backend (Go) to prevent basic injection attacks.
*   security control: Open-source code: Allows for community review and identification of vulnerabilities.

Accepted risks:

*   accepted risk: Limited protection against sophisticated attacks: The project's simplicity and focus on self-hosting may mean it's not designed to withstand targeted attacks by highly skilled adversaries.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries: Vulnerabilities in dependencies could impact the security of Memos.
*   accepted risk: User responsibility for server security: Self-hosting means users are responsible for securing their own servers and infrastructure.
*   accepted risk: No built-in encryption at rest: Data stored in the SQLite database is not encrypted by default.
*   accepted risk: No built-in two-factor authentication (2FA).

Recommended security controls (high priority):

*   security control: Implement robust input validation and sanitization on both the frontend and backend to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other injection attacks.
*   security control: Offer optional two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced account security.
*   security control: Provide guidance and tooling for secure backups and disaster recovery.
*   security control: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service.
*   security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Consider adding Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate XSS risks.
*   security control: Provide clear security documentation and best practices for self-hosting users.
*   security control: Implement audit logging to track user actions and potential security events.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Users must be able to create accounts and securely log in.
    *   Passwords must be securely hashed and salted.
    *   Support for password reset functionality.
    *   Consider offering optional 2FA.
*   Authorization:
    *   Users should only be able to access their own memos and public memos.
    *   Administrators should have elevated privileges.
    *   Consider role-based access control (RBAC) if more granular permissions are needed.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user input must be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi, etc.).
    *   Implement both client-side and server-side validation.
    *   Use a whitelist approach where possible, only allowing known-good characters and patterns.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication between the client and server.
    *   Consider offering optional encryption at rest for the database.

## BUILD

The Memos build process involves building both the Go backend and the React frontend. The repository provides a Makefile for automating the build process.

```mermaid
graph LR
    developer["Developer"] -- "Writes code" --> code[Source Code (GitHub)]
    code -- "Pushes to" --> github[GitHub Repository]
    github -- "Triggers" --> build_server[Build Server (e.g., GitHub Actions, Local Machine)]
    subgraph Build Server
        build_server -- "Fetches code" --> code2[Source Code]
        code2 -- "Builds frontend" --> frontend[Frontend Build (React)]
        code2 -- "Builds backend" --> backend[Backend Build (Go)]
        frontend -- "Packages into" --> docker_image[Docker Image]
        backend -- "Packages into" --> docker_image
    end
    docker_image -- "Pushes to" --> registry[Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub)]

```

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Dependency management: Go modules and npm/yarn are used for managing dependencies. Regularly updating dependencies is crucial.
*   security control: Static analysis: While not explicitly mentioned in the repository, integrating static analysis tools (e.g., linters, SAST scanners) into the build process is highly recommended. Examples include `golangci-lint` for Go and ESLint/SonarQube for JavaScript.
*   security control: Build automation: The Makefile and Dockerfile provide a degree of build automation, ensuring consistent builds.
*   security control: Containerization: Building a Docker image helps ensure a consistent and isolated runtime environment.
*   security control: (Recommended) Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Use SCA tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   security control: (Recommended) Container image scanning: Scan the resulting Docker image for vulnerabilities before deploying it.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
    *   User memo creation, storage, and retrieval.
    *   User account management.
    *   (Potentially) Social interaction features (sharing, comments).

*   Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
    *   User memos: Highly sensitive, as they may contain personal thoughts, ideas, or confidential information.
    *   User account information (username, email, hashed password): Sensitive, as it can be used to access the user's account and potentially other accounts if the user reuses passwords.
    *   (Potentially) User interaction data (shares, comments): Moderately sensitive, depending on the content.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
