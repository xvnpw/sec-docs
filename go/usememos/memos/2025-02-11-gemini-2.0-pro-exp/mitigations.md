# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for usememos/memos

## Mitigation Strategy: [Private by Default & Draft Mode](./mitigation_strategies/private_by_default_&_draft_mode.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement "Private by Default" and "Draft" modes for new memos.

**Description:**
1.  **Code Change (Backend):** Modify the database schema to include a `status` field for each memo (e.g., `draft`, `private`, `public`).
2.  **Code Change (Backend):** When a new memo is created via the API or web interface, set the `status` to `draft` by default.
3.  **Code Change (Frontend):**  In the memo creation UI, add a prominent visual indicator (e.g., a dropdown or toggle) to allow the user to choose between `draft`, `private`, and `public`.  The default selection should be `draft`.
4.  **Code Change (Frontend & Backend):**  "Draft" memos should *not* be visible to anyone, even the creator, in the main memo list or via search.  They should only be accessible via a dedicated "Drafts" section.
5.  **Code Change (Frontend & Backend):**  "Private" memos should be visible only to the creator.  The backend should enforce this access control.
6.  **Code Change (Frontend):**  Clearly distinguish between `draft`, `private`, and `public` memos in the UI with visual cues (icons, colors, labels).

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Public Disclosure of Sensitive Information (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of accidentally publishing sensitive data.
    *   **Accidental Data Leakage (Severity: Medium):**  Provides a buffer against hasty posting.

**Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Public Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk.  The default private setting acts as a safety net.
    *   **Accidental Data Leakage:**  Reduces the risk by providing a "draft" state for incomplete or unvetted memos.

**Currently Implemented (Assumption):**
    *   Memos likely has a "private" mode, but it might not be the *default*.
    *   A dedicated "Draft" mode is likely *not* implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   Making "private" the *default* setting for new memos.
    *   Implementing a distinct "Draft" mode separate from "private."
    *   Adding clear visual distinctions between all three states in the UI.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Warning/Confirmation Dialogs](./mitigation_strategies/content_warningconfirmation_dialogs.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement strong confirmation dialogs before publishing a memo.

**Description:**
1.  **Code Change (Frontend):**  When a user attempts to change a memo's status from `draft` or `private` to `public`, trigger a JavaScript modal dialog.
2.  **Dialog Content:** The dialog should:
    *   Display a clear warning message: "Warning: Making this memo public will make it visible to everyone.  Are you sure you want to proceed?"
    *   Include a checkbox list: "Does this memo contain: [ ] Passwords, [ ] API Keys, [ ] Personal Information, [ ] Confidential Documents?"
    *   Require the user to type "CONFIRM" (or a similar phrase) into a text input field to enable the "Publish" button.  This prevents accidental clicks.
    *   Disable the "Publish" button until all conditions are met.
3.  **Code Change (Backend):**  While the primary enforcement is on the frontend, the backend should *also* verify the memo's status before updating it in the database. This is a defense-in-depth measure.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Public Disclosure of Sensitive Information (Severity: High):**  Forces the user to consciously acknowledge the risks of public posting.
    *   **Accidental Data Leakage (Severity: Medium):**  Provides a final check before publishing.

**Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Public Disclosure:**  Significantly reduces the risk, especially for users who might not fully understand the implications of public posting.
    *   **Accidental Data Leakage:**  Reduces the risk by adding a deliberate confirmation step.

**Currently Implemented (Assumption):**
    *   Memos likely has *some* form of confirmation dialog, but it might be a simple "OK/Cancel" dialog without the enhanced features (checkboxes, typing confirmation).

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implementing the more robust confirmation dialog with the checklist and typing requirement.
    *   Backend verification of the memo status change (defense-in-depth).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Markdown Sanitization and Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/strict_markdown_sanitization_and_rendering.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Employ a secure Markdown parser, renderer, and Content Security Policy (CSP).

**Description:**
1.  **Library Selection:** Choose a Markdown rendering library specifically designed for security (e.g., a library that explicitly disallows arbitrary HTML and JavaScript). Research its security history.
2.  **Configuration:** Configure the Markdown renderer to be as restrictive as possible.  Whitelist only a safe subset of Markdown features (e.g., bold, italics, lists, links â€“ but *not* inline HTML or script tags).
3.  **CSP Implementation:**
    *   **Code Change (Backend/Server Configuration):**  Implement a strict CSP using HTTP headers.
    *   **CSP Directives:**  The CSP should:
        *   `default-src 'self'`:  Only allow resources from the same origin.
        *   `script-src 'self'`:  Only allow scripts from the same origin.  *Do not* use `'unsafe-inline'` or `'unsafe-eval'`.
        *   `style-src 'self'`: Only allow styles from the same origin.
        *   `img-src 'self' data: https://trusted-image-host.com`: Allow images from the same origin, data URLs (for embedded images), and a specific trusted host (if necessary).
        *   `connect-src 'self'`: Only allow AJAX requests to the same origin.
        *   `frame-src 'none'`:  Disallow iframes.
        *   `object-src 'none'`: Disallow plugins (Flash, etc.).
    *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the CSP to ensure it doesn't break legitimate functionality. Use browser developer tools to monitor CSP violations.
4.  **Regular Updates:**  Keep the Markdown rendering library and any related dependencies up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):**  Prevents attackers from injecting malicious JavaScript into memos.
    *   **Markdown Injection (Severity: Medium):**  Limits the ability of attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the Markdown rendering process.

**Impact:**
    *   **XSS:**  Very significantly reduces the risk.  A well-configured CSP and secure Markdown renderer are crucial defenses against XSS.
    *   **Markdown Injection:**  Reduces the risk by limiting the attack surface.

**Currently Implemented (Assumption):**
    *   Memos likely uses *some* form of Markdown rendering, but the level of sanitization and the strictness of the CSP are unknown.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   Reviewing and potentially replacing the existing Markdown rendering library with a more security-focused one.
    *   Implementing a *strict* CSP with the specific directives outlined above.
    *   Establishing a process for regularly updating the Markdown library and related dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict File Type Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_file_type_validation.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Validate uploaded files (attached to memos) based on content, not extension, and whitelist allowed types.

**Description:**
1.  **Library Selection:** Use a library that can reliably determine the true MIME type of a file by examining its content (e.g., using "magic numbers" or file signatures).  Examples include `python-magic` (Python), `file` command (Linux), or appropriate libraries for other languages.
2.  **Code Change (Backend):**
    *   When a file is uploaded as part of a memo, *do not* trust the file extension or the MIME type provided by the client.
    *   Use the chosen library to determine the *actual* MIME type of the file.
    *   Compare the detected MIME type against a *whitelist* of allowed types (e.g., `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `application/pdf`).
    *   *Reject* any file that does not match an allowed type.
    *   Store the *detected* MIME type, not the user-provided one.
3.  **Code Change (Frontend):**  While the primary validation is on the backend, provide feedback to the user in the frontend if they attempt to upload an unsupported file type.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload (Severity: High):**  Prevents attackers from uploading executable files or other malicious content disguised as images or documents and attaching them to memos.
    *   **File Type Spoofing (Severity: Medium):**  Prevents attackers from bypassing file type restrictions by simply changing the file extension.

**Impact:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload:**  Very significantly reduces the risk.  Content-based validation is a strong defense against this threat.
    *   **File Type Spoofing:**  Completely eliminates this risk.

**Currently Implemented (Assumption):**
    *   Memos likely has *some* file type validation, but it might rely on file extensions or user-provided MIME types, which are unreliable.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implementing content-based file type validation using a reliable library.
    *   Using a strict whitelist of allowed MIME types.
    *   Storing the detected MIME type, not the user-provided one.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Private Tags](./mitigation_strategies/private_tags.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Allow users to mark tags associated with memos as private.

**Description:**
1.  **Code Change (Backend):**  Modify the database schema to add a `visibility` field (or similar) to the tags table (e.g., `public`, `private`).
2.  **Code Change (Frontend):**  In the tag creation/editing UI (when creating or editing a memo), add an option (e.g., a checkbox) to mark a tag as private.
3.  **Code Change (Backend & Frontend):**  Ensure that private tags are only visible to the owner of the memo.  The backend should enforce this access control.  The frontend should not display private tags to other users.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Tags (Severity: Medium):**  Prevents sensitive information from being leaked through publicly visible tags associated with memos.

**Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Significantly reduces the risk, especially for users who might use tags to categorize sensitive memos.

**Currently Implemented (Assumption):**
    *   This feature is likely *not* implemented.  Tags are typically public.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   Adding the `visibility` field to the tags table.
    *   Adding the UI element to control tag visibility.
    *   Implementing the backend and frontend logic to enforce tag privacy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Filtering](./mitigation_strategies/content_filtering.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement content filtering to prevent users from posting specific words or patterns within memos.

**Description:**
1.  **Configuration Interface:** Create an administrative interface (accessible only to administrators) to define:
    *   **Banned Words List:** A list of specific words that are not allowed in memos.
    *   **Regular Expressions:** A list of regular expressions that define patterns to be blocked (e.g., patterns that match credit card numbers, social security numbers, or other sensitive data).
2.  **Code Change (Backend):**
    *   Before saving a new memo or updating an existing one, scan the memo content (title, body, tags) against the banned words list and regular expressions.
    *   If a match is found, reject the memo and return an error message to the user.
    *   Consider using a dedicated library for regular expression matching to ensure efficiency and security.
3.  **Code Change (Frontend):**  Optionally, provide real-time feedback to the user as they type, highlighting any potentially blocked words or patterns. This is a usability enhancement, but the primary enforcement should be on the backend.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Posting of Offensive Content (Severity: Medium):**  Helps prevent users from posting offensive or inappropriate language within memos.
    *   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) (Severity: Medium):**  Can help prevent the accidental or intentional posting of sensitive data within memos (if appropriate regular expressions are defined).
    *   **Spam (Severity: Low):** Can help prevent spam by blocking specific keywords or patterns within memos.

**Impact:**
    *   **Offensive Content:** Reduces the risk, but it's not foolproof (users can find ways to circumvent filters).
    *   **DLP:**  Provides a basic level of DLP, but it's not a substitute for a dedicated DLP solution.
    *   **Spam:** Reduces the risk of spam.

**Currently Implemented (Assumption):**
    *   This feature is likely *not* implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   Creating the administrative interface for configuring banned words and regular expressions.
    *   Implementing the backend logic to scan memo content and enforce the filters.
    *   Optionally, adding frontend feedback for real-time filtering.
