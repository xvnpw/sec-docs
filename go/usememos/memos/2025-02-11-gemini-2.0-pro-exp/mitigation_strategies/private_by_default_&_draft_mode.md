### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will be conducted using the following methods:

*   **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  Since we don't have direct access to the Memos codebase, we will perform a hypothetical code review based on the provided description and common development practices.  We will leverage our knowledge of similar applications and common security vulnerabilities.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  We will use threat modeling principles to identify potential attack vectors and assess the strategy's resilience.
*   **Best Practices Review:**  We will compare the proposed implementation against established security best practices for web applications.
*   **Usability Analysis:**  We will consider the user experience from the perspective of a typical Memos user.
*   **Documentation Review (Hypothetical):** We will assume the existence of Memos documentation and consider how the changes would need to be reflected there.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Mitigation Strategy

### 2.1 Technical Implementation Details

#### 2.1.1 Database Schema Changes

The proposed `status` field is crucial.  Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Table:**  `memos` (or the equivalent table storing memo data)
*   **Field:**  `status`
*   **Data Type:**  `ENUM('draft', 'private', 'public')`  (Using an ENUM is generally preferred for a limited set of predefined values, ensuring data integrity and efficiency.)
*   **Default Value:**  `'draft'` (This enforces the "private by default" aspect.)
*   **Indexing:** An index on the `status` column is recommended for efficient querying, especially when filtering by status (e.g., retrieving all drafts).

#### 2.1.2 Backend Code Changes

*   **Memo Creation API Endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/v1/memo`):**
    *   **Modification:**  The endpoint should *always* set the `status` to `'draft'` if no explicit `status` is provided in the request body.  This is a critical security measure.  Even if the frontend fails to send the correct status, the backend enforces the default.
    *   **Validation:**  The endpoint should validate that the provided `status` (if any) is one of the allowed values (`draft`, `private`, `public`).  Reject any invalid values with a clear error message (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).
    *   **Authorization:** Ensure that only authenticated users can create memos.

*   **Memo Retrieval API Endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/v1/memo`, `GET /api/v1/memo/:id`):**
    *   **Modification:**  These endpoints must filter memos based on the `status` and the user's authentication status.
        *   **Public Memos:**  Visible to everyone.
        *   **Private Memos:**  Visible only to the creator (check `user_id` or equivalent).
        *   **Draft Memos:**  *Not* visible through these general endpoints.  A separate endpoint is needed.

*   **Draft Retrieval API Endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/v1/memo/drafts`):**
    *   **New Endpoint:**  This endpoint should *only* return draft memos belonging to the authenticated user.  It should be heavily protected by authentication and authorization checks.

*   **Memo Update API Endpoint (e.g., `PATCH /api/v1/memo/:id`):**
    *   **Modification:** Allow updating the `status` field, but with strict validation:
        *   Only the memo creator can change the status.
        *   The new status must be one of the allowed values.
        *   Consider adding logic to prevent accidental "downgrades" from `public` to `private` or `draft` if that's not desired behavior.

#### 2.1.3 Frontend Code Changes

*   **Memo Creation UI:**
    *   **Status Selector:**  Implement a clear and prominent UI element (dropdown, radio buttons, or toggle) for selecting the memo status.  The default selection should be "Draft."  Use clear labels: "Draft," "Private," "Public."
    *   **Visual Feedback:**  Provide immediate visual feedback to the user about the selected status.

*   **Memo List UI:**
    *   **Visual Differentiation:**  Clearly distinguish between `public` and `private` memos using icons, colors, or labels.  Drafts should *not* appear in the main memo list.
    *   **Filtering:**  Consider adding filtering options to allow users to easily view only public or only private memos.

*   **Drafts Section:**
    *   **Dedicated UI:**  Create a separate section or view specifically for managing drafts.  This should be easily accessible from the main navigation.
    *   **Draft List:**  Display a list of the user's draft memos, allowing them to edit or publish them.

*   **Memo Display UI:**
    *   **Status Indicator:**  Clearly display the status of the memo (public or private) when viewing a memo.

### 2.2 Threat Mitigation Assessment

*   **Unintended Public Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** The strategy *significantly* mitigates this threat.  The "private by default" setting and the "draft" mode act as strong safeguards against accidental publication.  The clear UI distinctions further reduce the risk of user error.
*   **Accidental Data Leakage:** The "draft" mode provides an excellent buffer against this threat.  Users can save incomplete or unvetted work without any risk of it being exposed.

### 2.3 Usability Considerations

*   **Intuitive Design:** The three-state system (draft, private, public) is generally intuitive and aligns with common mental models for content creation.
*   **Clear Terminology:** Using standard terms like "Draft," "Private," and "Public" enhances usability.
*   **Easy Access to Drafts:**  The dedicated "Drafts" section is crucial for usability.  Users need a straightforward way to manage their unpublished work.
*   **Visual Cues:**  Consistent and clear visual cues are essential for users to quickly understand the status of each memo.

### 2.4 Security Considerations

*   **Backend Enforcement:**  The most critical security aspect is that the backend *must* enforce the access control rules regardless of what the frontend sends.  This prevents malicious users from bypassing the security measures by manipulating requests.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:**  Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms are essential to protect private and draft memos.  Ensure that only the memo creator can access or modify their private and draft memos.
*   **Input Validation:**  The backend must validate all user input, including the `status` field, to prevent injection attacks or other vulnerabilities.
*   **Session Management:** Secure session management is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and data.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks or denial-of-service attacks.

### 2.5 Edge Cases

*   **User Deletion:**  What happens to a user's private and draft memos when their account is deleted?  Options include:
    *   Deleting the memos.
    *   Anonymizing the memos (removing any identifying information).
    *   Archiving the memos (making them inaccessible but not deleting them).
    *   The chosen approach should be clearly documented and comply with any relevant privacy regulations.

*   **Collaboration:**  If Memos ever introduces collaboration features, the status system will need to be extended to handle shared memos with different access levels.

*   **Import/Export:**  If Memos supports importing or exporting data, the `status` field should be included in the import/export process.

* **Changing status from Public:** Consider edge case when user by mistake published memo as Public and now wants to change it back to Private or Draft.

### 2.6 Testing Recommendations

*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for the backend API endpoints to verify:
    *   Correct default `status` assignment.
    *   Proper validation of the `status` field.
    *   Correct access control based on user authentication and memo status.

*   **Integration Tests:**  Write integration tests to verify the interaction between the frontend and backend, ensuring that the UI correctly reflects the memo status and that the backend enforces the access control rules.

*   **End-to-End Tests:**  Write end-to-end tests to simulate user workflows, such as creating, editing, and publishing memos with different statuses.

*   **Security Testing:**  Perform security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify any potential security weaknesses.

*   **Usability Testing:**  Conduct usability testing with real users to ensure that the new features are intuitive and easy to use.

### 2.7 Integration with Existing Features

*   **Search:**  The search functionality should respect the memo status.  Drafts should not be searchable.  Private memos should only be searchable by the creator.
*   **Notifications:**  If Memos has a notification system, consider how notifications should be handled for private and draft memos.
*   **API Clients:**  Any existing API clients will need to be updated to handle the new `status` field and the new "Drafts" endpoint.
