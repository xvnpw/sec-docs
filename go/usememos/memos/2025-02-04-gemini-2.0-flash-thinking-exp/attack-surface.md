# Attack Surface Analysis for usememos/memos

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Note Content (Stored XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_note_content__stored_xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code injected into memo content is stored and executed in the browsers of other users viewing the memo. This is due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided memo content.
*   **Memos Contribution:** Memos' core functionality of creating and displaying notes, especially with rich text formatting like Markdown, makes it vulnerable if input sanitization is lacking.
*   **Example:** A user creates a memo with Markdown including `` `<script>/* malicious JS */</script>` ``. When another user views this memo, the script executes, potentially stealing session cookies or redirecting to malicious sites.
*   **Impact:** High - Account takeover of users viewing the malicious memo, data theft, defacement within the application for other users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Robust Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** Implement strict sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided memo content before rendering. Utilize a security-focused Markdown parser and HTML sanitizer library. Ensure proper escaping of HTML entities and JavaScript-sensitive characters.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to limit script execution sources, mitigating the impact of XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads (If Attachment Feature is Implemented)](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads__if_attachment_feature_is_implemented_.md)

*   **Description:** If Memos allows file attachments to memos, lack of restrictions on file types or content can lead to uploading malicious files, potentially compromising the server or other users.
*   **Memos Contribution:**  A file attachment feature in Memos, if implemented without proper security measures, directly introduces this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image. If the server is misconfigured, this script could be executed, granting the attacker remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Remote code execution on the server, full server compromise, potential for data breaches, malware distribution to users downloading attachments.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict File Type Whitelisting:** Only allow explicitly permitted and safe file types for upload based on application needs.
        *   **File Size Limits:** Enforce reasonable file size limits to prevent denial-of-service.
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Sanitize and validate file names to prevent path traversal and injection attacks.
        *   **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files outside the webroot with restricted access.
        *   **Antivirus/Malware Scanning:** Integrate malware scanning for uploaded files to prevent storage of malicious content.

## Attack Surface: [Password Reset Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/password_reset_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in the password reset process can allow attackers to reset passwords of other users and gain unauthorized account access.
*   **Memos Contribution:** Memos' user account management, including password reset functionality, is a direct contributor if the reset process is not securely implemented.
*   **Example:** The password reset mechanism uses predictable reset tokens. An attacker could guess a token for another user, use it to reset their password, and take over their account.
*   **Impact:** High - Account takeover, unauthorized access to user memos and potentially sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure Token Generation:** Use cryptographically strong, unpredictable, and unique tokens for password reset links.
        *   **Token Expiration:** Implement short expiration times for reset tokens.
        *   **Account Verification:** Ensure password reset requires verification via email to the registered account.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on password reset requests to prevent brute-force token guessing.
