# Threat Model Analysis for usememos/memos

## Threat: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Memo Content](./threats/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_memo_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a memo containing malicious JavaScript code. When other users view this memo, their browsers execute the attacker's script. This is achieved by injecting `<script>` tags or other XSS vectors into the memo content.

**Impact:** Account takeover of other users, session hijacking, redirection of users to malicious websites, theft of sensitive information displayed within memos, and defacement of the Memos interface for other users.

**Affected Component:** Memo rendering module, specifically the function responsible for displaying user-generated memo content in the user interface.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust server-side input sanitization to remove or neutralize potentially malicious code when memos are saved.
*   Utilize output encoding when displaying memo content in the browser to prevent the execution of any remaining malicious scripts.
*   Implement and strictly enforce a Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources, significantly reducing the impact of XSS attacks.
*   Maintain up-to-date sanitization libraries and frameworks used by Memos to protect against emerging XSS vectors.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Memo Content](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_memo_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker creates and submits extremely large memos, potentially filled with excessive text or data. This action can overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) during processing, storage, or rendering of these memos, leading to performance degradation and potentially making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Application becomes slow, unresponsive, or completely unavailable for all users. Server resource exhaustion can lead to service outage and impact other services hosted on the same infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** Memo creation and storage module, memo rendering module, and the database system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict limits on memo size, including character count and data size.
*   Implement rate limiting on memo creation requests to prevent rapid submission of numerous large memos.
*   Continuously monitor server resource utilization and establish alerts for unusual spikes in resource consumption.
*   Employ asynchronous processing for memo creation and rendering tasks to distribute the load and prevent resource exhaustion from impacting user experience.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Incorrect Memo Visibility Settings](./threats/information_disclosure_via_incorrect_memo_visibility_settings.md)

**Description:** Flaws in the implementation of memo visibility settings or a confusing user interface can lead to users unintentionally making private memos publicly accessible or sharing them with unintended users. An attacker could then discover and access these memos if they are inadvertently made public.

**Impact:** Leakage of confidential, sensitive, or private information contained within memos. Violation of user privacy and potential reputational damage for the application and its users. Exposure of sensitive data could lead to further security breaches or misuse of information.

**Affected Component:** Access control module, user interface for managing memo visibility, and the authorization logic that enforces visibility settings.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Conduct thorough reviews and testing of the memo visibility logic to ensure it functions correctly and as intended.
*   Design a user interface for setting memo visibility that is clear, intuitive, and minimizes the risk of user error. Provide clear explanations of each visibility option.
*   Implement granular and robust access control mechanisms to precisely manage who can access specific memos based on visibility settings.
*   Perform regular audits of access control configurations and user permissions to identify and rectify any misconfigurations or unintended access exposures.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass to Access Private Memos](./threats/authorization_bypass_to_access_private_memos.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application's authorization logic to circumvent access controls and gain unauthorized access to memos that are intended to be private or restricted to specific users. This could involve manipulating API requests, exploiting session management weaknesses, or identifying logic errors in access control checks.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive and private information stored within memos. Significant privacy violation and potential data breach. Misuse of disclosed private information, potentially leading to identity theft, blackmail, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** Authorization module, access control logic, and API endpoints responsible for accessing and retrieving memos.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong and comprehensive authorization checks at every point where memos are accessed, ensuring that these checks are consistently enforced on the server-side.
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when designing and implementing access control mechanisms.
*   Conduct regular and rigorous security audits and penetration testing specifically focused on identifying and remediating authorization vulnerabilities.
*   Employ established and secure authentication and session management practices to minimize weaknesses that could be exploited for authorization bypass.
