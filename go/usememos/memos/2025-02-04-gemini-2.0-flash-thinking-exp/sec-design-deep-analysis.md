6.  **Mitigation Strategy Formulation:** For each recommendation, formulate practical and tailored mitigation strategies that can be implemented by the development team or self-hosting users to reduce or eliminate the identified security risks.

### 2. Security Implications of Key Components and Mitigation Strategies

#### 2.1 Frontend (Vue.js)

**Security Implications:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** As a dynamic web application, Memos frontend is susceptible to XSS vulnerabilities. If user-provided data is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the frontend, attackers could inject malicious scripts that execute in other users' browsers. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Memos likely allows users to format notes (e.g., Markdown). Improper handling of formatting could introduce XSS vulnerabilities if malicious Markdown is rendered without proper sanitization.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Misconfiguration or Absence:** Lack of a properly configured CSP can significantly increase the risk of XSS attacks. If CSP is not implemented or is too permissive, browsers may execute malicious scripts from untrusted sources.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** If Memos allows embedding external content (images, links, iframes in future features), a weak CSP could be exploited.
*   **Client-Side Input Validation Bypass:** While client-side validation improves user experience, it is not a security control. Attackers can bypass client-side validation and send malicious data directly to the backend API.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Relying solely on frontend validation for note content or user input fields could lead to backend vulnerabilities if malicious data is processed.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Frontend applications often rely on numerous JavaScript libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the frontend and potentially the user's browser.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Vue.js and its ecosystem have dependencies. Outdated or vulnerable dependencies in the frontend build process could introduce security risks.

**Tailored Recommendations and Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Implement Robust Output Encoding/Escaping:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Ensure all user-provided data, especially memo content, is properly encoded/escaped before being rendered in the frontend. Utilize Vue.js's built-in mechanisms for template escaping and consider using a dedicated library for Markdown sanitization if Markdown is supported.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   Use Vue.js template syntax (e.g., `{{ }}`) for dynamic content, which automatically escapes HTML.
        *   If rendering Markdown, use a well-vetted Markdown library with robust sanitization capabilities (e.g., `DOMPurify` in conjunction with a Markdown parser). Configure the sanitizer to remove potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes.
        *   Regularly review and update the sanitization library and its configuration to address newly discovered bypasses.

2.  **Implement and Enforce a Strict Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a strict CSP to control the resources that the browser is allowed to load. This significantly reduces the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   Define a CSP header in the backend API responses serving the frontend application.
        *   Start with a restrictive CSP and gradually adjust as needed, focusing on directives like `default-src 'self'`, `script-src 'self'`, `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`, `img-src 'self' data:`, `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'none'`, `form-action 'self'`.
        *   Use CSP reporting to monitor and identify violations, allowing for refinement of the policy.
        *   Consider using `nonce` or `hash` for inline scripts and styles if necessary, but prefer external files where possible.

3.  **Complement Client-Side Validation with Server-Side Validation:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Do not rely on client-side validation for security. Implement comprehensive server-side input validation and sanitization for all data received from the frontend.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   Revalidate all input data on the backend API, regardless of client-side validation.
        *   Use a robust validation library in Go to define and enforce input constraints (e.g., data types, formats, lengths, allowed characters).
        *   Sanitize input data on the server-side before storing it in the database to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

4.  **Regularly Scan and Update Frontend Dependencies:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Integrate dependency scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to identify and address vulnerabilities in frontend JavaScript libraries.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` (or equivalent for the chosen package manager) in the CI/CD pipeline to scan frontend dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Automate dependency updates to patch vulnerabilities promptly.
        *   Consider using a dependency management tool that helps track and manage frontend dependencies effectively.

#### 2.2 Backend API (Go)

**Security Implications:**

*   **Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities:** Weak authentication mechanisms, insecure session management, or flawed authorization logic can lead to unauthorized access to user data and application functionality.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** If authentication is easily bypassed or brute-forced, or if authorization is not correctly enforced, attackers could access other users' memos or gain administrative privileges.
*   **SQL Injection:** If the backend API interacts with the database without proper input sanitization and parameterized queries, it is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Attackers could manipulate database queries to bypass security controls, access sensitive data, or modify data.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** If memo content, user search terms, or other user inputs are directly incorporated into SQL queries, SQL injection is a significant risk, especially with MySQL. Even SQLite, while less prone to some advanced injection techniques, is still vulnerable.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** If CSRF protection is not implemented, attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the application, such as creating, modifying, or deleting memos.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:**  If a user is logged into Memos, a CSRF attack could potentially be used to manipulate their memos without their knowledge.
*   **API Security Vulnerabilities:**  Insecure API design, lack of rate limiting, and insufficient input validation on API endpoints can expose the backend to various attacks, including brute-force attacks, denial-of-service (DoS), and data breaches.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Publicly exposed API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting memos need to be secured against unauthorized access and abuse.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** The backend API built with Go relies on libraries and frameworks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the backend server.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Go dependencies need to be regularly scanned and updated to mitigate risks from known vulnerabilities.
*   **Insecure Password Hashing:** Using weak or outdated password hashing algorithms makes user passwords vulnerable to cracking in case of a database breach.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** If passwords are not hashed using a strong algorithm like Argon2, a database compromise could lead to mass password cracking and account takeover.
*   **Session Management Issues:** Insecure session management, such as using predictable session IDs or not properly expiring sessions, can lead to session hijacking and unauthorized access.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Weak session management could allow attackers to steal user sessions and impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Information Disclosure through Error Handling:** Verbose error messages that expose sensitive information (e.g., database schema, internal paths) can aid attackers in reconnaissance and exploitation.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Detailed error messages in API responses or server logs could reveal information useful for attackers.

**Tailored Recommendations and Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Strengthen Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   **Password Hashing:** Use Argon2 for password hashing as recommended. Ensure proper salt generation and iteration count configuration.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints (login, registration, password reset) to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Consider adding 2FA (TOTP, email-based) as a recommended security control to significantly enhance account security.
        *   **OAuth Support:** Explore and implement OAuth for external authentication providers to offer users more convenient and potentially more secure login options.
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Enforce RBAC rigorously to ensure users can only access and modify data they are authorized to. Clearly define roles (admin, user) and their associated permissions.
        *   **Session Management:** Use secure, cryptographically random session IDs. Implement proper session expiration and renewal mechanisms. Store session data securely (e.g., using HTTP-only, Secure cookies or server-side session storage).

2.  **Prevent SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Use parameterized queries or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to interact with the database. Avoid string concatenation for building SQL queries.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions. This ensures that user inputs are treated as data, not as executable SQL code.
        *   If using an ORM, ensure it is configured to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities by default.
        *   Regularly review database queries for potential injection points, especially when new features or functionalities are added.

3.  **Implement CSRF Protection:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement CSRF protection to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   Use CSRF tokens synchronized with user sessions. Generate a unique token per session and include it in forms and AJAX requests.
        *   Validate the CSRF token on the backend before processing any state-changing requests.
        *   Utilize Go frameworks or libraries that provide built-in CSRF protection mechanisms.

4.  **Enhance API Security:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Secure API endpoints with proper authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   **Authentication and Authorization:**  Enforce authentication and authorization for all API endpoints that require access control.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement comprehensive server-side input validation for all API endpoints, validating request parameters, headers, and body data.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
        *   **API Documentation and Security Review:**  Document API endpoints clearly and conduct regular security reviews of API design and implementation.
        *   **Output Sanitization:** Sanitize data returned in API responses to prevent unintended script execution on the client-side if the API is directly consumed by other applications.

5.  **Regularly Scan and Update Backend Dependencies:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Integrate dependency scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to identify and address vulnerabilities in Go dependencies.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   Use tools like `govulncheck` or `dep-scan` in the CI/CD pipeline to scan Go dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Automate dependency updates to patch vulnerabilities promptly.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Go libraries and frameworks used in the project.

6.  **Secure Error Handling:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement secure error handling to prevent information disclosure.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   Log detailed error information server-side for debugging and monitoring purposes, but avoid exposing sensitive details in API responses to the client.
        *   Return generic error messages to the client, such as "Internal Server Error" or "Bad Request," without revealing specific error details or stack traces.
        *   Implement centralized error logging and monitoring to detect and respond to errors effectively.

#### 2.3 Database (SQLite/MySQL)

**Security Implications:**

*   **Database Access Control:** Weak database access control can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. If database credentials are compromised or access is not properly restricted, attackers could directly access and manipulate the database.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** If database files (SQLite) or MySQL credentials are exposed, attackers could read user memos, user credentials, and other sensitive application data.
*   **Data Encryption at Rest (Optional but Recommended for Sensitive Data):**  If sensitive data (e.g., memo content, user credentials - even hashed) is not encrypted at rest, it is vulnerable to compromise if the file system or database storage is accessed by an attacker.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Depending on the sensitivity of user memos, lack of data encryption at rest could be a significant risk, especially for self-hosted instances where physical security might vary.
*   **Database Backup Security:** If database backups are not stored securely, they can become a target for attackers. Compromised backups can lead to data breaches and loss of data integrity.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** If backups are stored in an insecure location or without encryption, they could be accessed by unauthorized parties.
*   **Database Configuration Vulnerabilities:** Misconfigured database settings can introduce security vulnerabilities. Default credentials, unnecessary services enabled, or weak security configurations can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Using default database configurations or not hardening the database server could create exploitable weaknesses.
*   **Data Integrity Issues:**  Lack of proper data validation and constraints at the database level can lead to data integrity issues and potential application vulnerabilities.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Database schema should enforce data types, constraints, and relationships to maintain data integrity and prevent unexpected application behavior.

**Tailored Recommendations and Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Implement Strong Database Access Control:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Restrict database access to only the necessary application components (backend API). Use strong, unique credentials for database access.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   Use dedicated database users with minimal necessary privileges for the backend API to access the database. Avoid using root or administrative database accounts.
        *   Securely store database credentials (e.g., using environment variables or a secrets management solution, not hardcoded in the application).
        *   For MySQL, configure firewall rules to restrict network access to the database server to only the backend API container or server.
        *   For SQLite, ensure proper file system permissions are set on the SQLite database file to restrict access to the application user only.

2.  **Consider Data Encryption at Rest:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Evaluate the sensitivity of user data and consider implementing data encryption at rest for the database.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   **SQLite:** SQLite itself does not natively support encryption at rest. Consider using encrypted file systems (e.g., LUKS) for the volume where the SQLite database file is stored.
        *   **MySQL:** Enable MySQL's built-in encryption at rest features (e.g., Transparent Data Encryption - TDE) if available and appropriate for the deployment environment.
        *   **Application-Level Encryption (Less Recommended for Performance):** As a last resort, consider application-level encryption for sensitive fields before storing them in the database. However, this adds complexity and can impact performance. Database-level encryption is generally preferred.

3.  **Secure Database Backups:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Securely store database backups and implement backup encryption.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   Encrypt database backups at rest and in transit.
        *   Store backups in a secure location with restricted access.
        *   Regularly test backup and recovery procedures to ensure data can be restored effectively.
        *   Consider using a dedicated backup service that provides encryption and secure storage.

4.  **Harden Database Configuration:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Harden database configurations to minimize the attack surface and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   Change default database credentials immediately after installation.
        *   Disable unnecessary database features and services.
        *   Apply database security best practices and hardening guidelines specific to SQLite or MySQL.
        *   Regularly update the database software to patch security vulnerabilities.

5.  **Enforce Data Integrity at the Database Level:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Define database schema with appropriate data types, constraints, and relationships to enforce data integrity.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   Define data types for all database columns to ensure data consistency.
        *   Implement constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY) to enforce data integrity rules.
        *   Use database migrations to manage schema changes and maintain database consistency over time.

#### 2.4 Deployment (Docker Compose, Reverse Proxy)

**Security Implications:**

*   **Docker Container Security:** Misconfigured or vulnerable Docker containers can be exploited to gain access to the host system or other containers.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** If Docker containers are not properly secured, attackers could potentially escape containers, access sensitive data on the host server, or compromise other Memos components.
*   **Reverse Proxy Misconfiguration:**  A misconfigured reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) can introduce vulnerabilities, such as exposing backend services directly, allowing unauthorized access, or failing to properly enforce HTTPS.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** If Nginx is not configured securely, HTTPS might not be properly enforced, or backend services could be directly accessible, bypassing security controls.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Ports:** Exposing unnecessary ports on the host system or Docker containers increases the attack surface.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Exposing database ports or internal application ports directly to the internet is a significant security risk.
*   **Insecure Docker Compose Configuration:** Misconfigurations in `docker-compose.yml` can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as insecure network configurations, volume mounts, or resource limits.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:**  Incorrectly configured Docker Compose file could weaken container isolation or expose sensitive data.
*   **Host Operating System Security:**  The security of the underlying Linux server is crucial. Outdated or unpatched operating systems, weak firewall rules, or insecure system configurations can compromise the entire Memos deployment.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** A compromised Linux server hosting Memos can lead to complete data breach and service unavailability.

**Tailored Recommendations and Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Harden Docker Container Security:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Follow Docker security best practices to secure container images and runtime environment.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   **Minimal Container Images:** Use minimal base images and only include necessary components in container images. Avoid including unnecessary tools or libraries.
        *   **Regular Image Updates:** Regularly update container base images and application dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
        *   **Container Image Scanning:** Integrate container image scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities in container images before deployment.
        *   **Non-Root User:** Run containers as non-root users whenever possible to reduce the impact of container escape vulnerabilities.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Set resource limits (CPU, memory) for containers to prevent resource exhaustion attacks and ensure fair resource allocation.
        *   **Security Profiles (AppArmor, SELinux):** Consider using security profiles (AppArmor or SELinux) to further restrict container capabilities and system calls.

2.  **Secure Reverse Proxy Configuration (Nginx):**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Properly configure Nginx for HTTPS, security headers, and request forwarding.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensure Nginx is configured to enforce HTTPS and redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS. Obtain and configure valid SSL/TLS certificates.
        *   **Security Headers:** Configure Nginx to send security headers like `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, and `Referrer-Policy`.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using a WAF (e.g., ModSecurity with Nginx) to protect against common web application attacks.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting in Nginx to protect against brute-force attacks and DoS.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Nginx updated to the latest version to patch security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Configuration Review:** Regularly review Nginx configuration for security misconfigurations.

3.  **Minimize Port Exposure:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Only expose necessary ports and restrict network access to containers.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   Do not expose database ports (e.g., MySQL port 3306) directly to the internet. Only expose the necessary ports for the reverse proxy (e.g., HTTP port 80 and HTTPS port 443).
        *   Use Docker networking to allow containers to communicate with each other internally without exposing ports to the host or external networks.
        *   Configure firewall rules on the host system to restrict network access to only necessary ports and services.

4.  **Secure Docker Compose Configuration:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Review and secure `docker-compose.yml` configuration.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   **Network Isolation:** Use Docker networks to isolate containers and restrict network communication to only necessary services.
        *   **Volume Security:** Carefully manage volume mounts and ensure that sensitive data is not exposed through insecure volume configurations.
        *   **Environment Variable Security:** Use environment variables to pass sensitive configuration data (e.g., database credentials) to containers, and avoid hardcoding secrets in `docker-compose.yml`.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Define resource limits in `docker-compose.yml` to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure container stability.

5.  **Secure Host Operating System:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Harden and regularly maintain the Linux server hosting Memos.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   **Operating System Hardening:** Apply operating system hardening best practices (e.g., disable unnecessary services, configure strong passwords, restrict SSH access).
        *   **Security Updates:** Regularly apply operating system security updates and patches.
        *   **Firewall Configuration:** Configure a firewall (e.g., `iptables`, `ufw`) to restrict network access to the server to only necessary ports and services.
        *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):** Consider implementing an IDS/IPS for enhanced security monitoring and threat detection.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the host operating system and infrastructure.

#### 2.5 Build Pipeline (CI/CD with GitHub Actions)

**Security Implications:**

*   **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline:** If the CI/CD pipeline is compromised, attackers could inject malicious code into the build artifacts, leading to supply chain attacks.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** A compromised CI/CD pipeline could result in distributing backdoored versions of Memos to users.
*   **Insecure Storage of Secrets:**  Storing secrets (e.g., API keys, database credentials, signing keys) insecurely in the CI/CD pipeline or version control can lead to credential leaks and unauthorized access.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** If secrets used for building, testing, or deploying Memos are leaked, attackers could gain access to infrastructure or compromise the application.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities in Build Tools:** Vulnerabilities in build tools and dependencies used in the CI/CD pipeline can be exploited to compromise the build process.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Vulnerable build tools could be exploited to inject malicious code during the build process.
*   **Lack of Code Integrity Verification:** If code integrity is not verified throughout the build and deployment process, it is possible for malicious code to be introduced without detection.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Without code signing or integrity checks, it's harder to ensure that the deployed application is the intended version and has not been tampered with.
*   **Insufficient Access Control to CI/CD System:**  Weak access control to the CI/CD system can allow unauthorized users to modify build pipelines, access secrets, or manipulate build artifacts.
    *   **Specific Risk for Memos:** Unauthorized access to GitHub Actions workflows or settings could allow attackers to sabotage the build process or inject malicious code.

**Tailored Recommendations and Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Secure CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Harden the CI/CD pipeline configuration and follow security best practices for CI/CD systems.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to CI/CD pipeline users and service accounts.
        *   **Workflow Security Review:** Regularly review CI/CD workflows for security misconfigurations and potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Immutable Infrastructure (Ideally):**  Strive for immutable infrastructure where build artifacts are created once and deployed without modification.
        *   **Audit Logging:** Enable audit logging for CI/CD system actions to track changes and detect suspicious activity.

2.  **Securely Manage Secrets:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Use secure secrets management solutions for storing and accessing secrets in the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   **GitHub Actions Secrets:** Utilize GitHub Actions Secrets for storing sensitive credentials and configuration values. Avoid hardcoding secrets in workflow files or code.
        *   **Secret Masking:** Ensure secrets are properly masked in CI/CD logs to prevent accidental exposure.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Secrets:** Grant access to secrets only to the necessary workflows and steps.
        *   **Rotate Secrets Regularly:** Rotate secrets periodically to limit the impact of potential credential compromise.

3.  **Secure Build Environment:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Ensure the build environment is secure and regularly updated.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**
        *   **Up-to-date Build Tools:** Keep build tools (Go compiler, Node.js, npm/yarn, Docker) and their dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch vulnerabilities.
        *   **Secure Build Agents:** If using self-hosted build agents, ensure they are securely configured and hardened.
        *   **Dependency Scanning in Build Pipeline:** Integrate dependency scanning tools into the build pipeline to identify and address vulnerabilities in build tool dependencies.

*   **Dependency Scanning and Updates:** Regularly scan and update backend Go dependencies using tools like `govulncheck` or `dep-scan` in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Secure Error Handling:** Implement secure error handling to prevent information disclosure in API responses.

**Database (SQLite/MySQL):**

*   **Strong Database Access Control:** Restrict database access to only the backend API using dedicated database users with minimal privileges. Securely store database credentials.
*   **Data Encryption at Rest:** Consider implementing data encryption at rest for the database, especially for sensitive memo content. Use encrypted file systems for SQLite or TDE for MySQL.
*   **Secure Database Backups:** Securely store and encrypt database backups at rest and in transit. Regularly test backup and recovery procedures.
*   **Database Hardening:** Harden database configurations by changing default credentials, disabling unnecessary features, and applying security best practices.
*   **Data Integrity Enforcement:** Define database schema with appropriate data types, constraints, and relationships to enforce data integrity.

**Deployment (Docker Compose, Reverse Proxy):**

*   **Docker Container Hardening:** Follow Docker security best practices, use minimal images, regularly update images, scan images, run containers as non-root, and use resource limits and security profiles.
*   **Secure Reverse Proxy (Nginx) Configuration:** Properly configure Nginx for HTTPS enforcement, security headers, WAF consideration, rate limiting, and regular updates.
*   **Minimize Port Exposure:** Only expose necessary ports and restrict network access to containers.
*   **Secure Docker Compose Configuration:** Review and secure `docker-compose.yml` configuration, focusing on network isolation, volume security, and secure secrets management.
*   **Secure Host Operating System:** Harden and regularly maintain the Linux server, apply security updates, configure firewall rules, and consider IDS/IPS.

**Build Pipeline (CI/CD with GitHub Actions):**

*   **Secure CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** Harden CI/CD pipeline configuration, follow security best practices, implement the principle of least privilege, and enable audit logging.
*   **Secure Secrets Management:** Use GitHub Actions Secrets for storing secrets, mask secrets in logs, and rotate secrets regularly.
*   **Secure Build Environment:** Keep build tools and dependencies updated, secure build agents if self-hosted, and scan build tool dependencies.
*   **Code Integrity Verification:** Implement code signing and hash verification for build artifacts to ensure integrity.
*   **Enforce Access Control to CI/CD System:** Implement RBAC and 2FA for access to GitHub Actions and conduct regular access reviews.
