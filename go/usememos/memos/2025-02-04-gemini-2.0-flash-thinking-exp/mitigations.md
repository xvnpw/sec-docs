## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) - Focused on Memo Content](./mitigation_strategies/strict_content_security_policy__csp__-_focused_on_memo_content.md)

### 1. Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) - Focused on Memo Content

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) - Memo Content Focused
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define CSP Headers:** Configure the web server to send CSP headers, specifically tailored to manage the rendering of memo content within the application.
    2.  **Restrict Script Sources for Memo Display:**  Use `script-src` directive to strictly control where scripts can be loaded from *when displaying memos*. Ideally, restrict it to `'self'` and any explicitly trusted CDNs needed for core application functionality *outside* of memo content itself. Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` if possible, especially for memo rendering.
    3.  **Control Object and Embed Sources:**  Use `object-src` and `embed-src` directives to restrict the sources for plugins and embedded content within memos, minimizing the risk of malicious embedded objects. Consider `object-src 'none'` and `embed-src 'none'` as a starting point and relax only if absolutely necessary for specific memo features.
    4.  **Sanitize Memo Content for CSP Compatibility:** Ensure that the Markdown sanitization process (see strategy #2) produces output that is compatible with the strict CSP.  For example, if using nonces for inline styles, the sanitization process needs to be aware of and support nonce injection.
    5.  **Test and Refine CSP for Memo Rendering:** Thoroughly test the CSP in report-only mode specifically in the context of displaying various types of memo content (text, links, images, potentially embedded media if allowed) to ensure it doesn't break legitimate memo functionality while effectively blocking malicious scripts.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Memo Content - High Severity
*   **Impact:** High reduction in XSS risk specifically within memos. CSP, when correctly configured and focused on memo rendering, is a powerful defense against XSS attacks originating from or targeting memo content.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially partially implemented at a general application level, but likely not specifically tailored and strictly enforced for memo content rendering.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  CSP configuration specifically focused on memo content, especially directives like `script-src`, `object-src`, and `embed-src` in the context of memo display.  Needs implementation in server-side configuration or application framework, ensuring it's applied when rendering memos.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Markdown Sanitization for Memos](./mitigation_strategies/markdown_sanitization_for_memos.md)

### 2. Markdown Sanitization for Memos

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Markdown Sanitization for Memos
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize a Secure Markdown Library:**  Ensure the application uses a robust and actively maintained Markdown parsing library that is known for its security features and includes sanitization capabilities. This library should be specifically used when processing and rendering memo content.
    2.  **Server-Side Sanitization (Mandatory for Memos):**  Sanitize all Markdown input on the server-side *after* it's received from the client and *before* storing it as memo content. This is critical to prevent persistent XSS vulnerabilities within memos stored in the database.
    3.  **Configure Sanitization Rules for Memos:**  Customize the sanitization rules of the Markdown library to be aggressive in removing or encoding potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes *within memos*.  Focus on tags and attributes that can execute JavaScript or load external resources in a way that bypasses CSP (e.g., `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<img>` with `onerror`, `<a>` with `javascript:`).
    4.  **Regularly Update Markdown Library (Memos Dependency):**  Keep the Markdown sanitization library updated as part of the application's dependency management. Security vulnerabilities in Markdown parsers are common, and updates are crucial for maintaining memo security.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Memos - High Severity
*   **Impact:** High reduction in XSS risk within memos. Effective Markdown sanitization is a primary defense against XSS attacks embedded within user-generated memo content.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely partially implemented as Memos probably uses a Markdown library. However, the *rigor* and *configuration* of sanitization specifically for memo content security needs verification and potential strengthening.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Verification and potentially enhancement of server-side Markdown sanitization configuration, specifically tailored for memo content security. Regular updates of the Markdown library used by Memos need to be ensured. Implementation is needed in the backend code that processes and stores memo content.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Encoding for Displaying Memos](./mitigation_strategies/output_encoding_for_displaying_memos.md)

### 3. Output Encoding for Displaying Memos

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Output Encoding for Displaying Memos
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Memo Display Contexts:** Pinpoint all locations in the application where memo content (rendered from Markdown) is displayed to users. This includes memo lists, individual memo views, and any other areas where memo content is presented.
    2.  **Apply Context-Appropriate Encoding for Memos:**  Implement output encoding *specifically when displaying memo content*. Use HTML entity encoding for HTML contexts (most common for web display). Ensure this encoding is applied consistently in all identified memo display contexts.
    3.  **Encode After Sanitization (Memo Content):**  Apply output encoding *after* Markdown sanitization. Sanitization removes malicious code, and encoding prevents the browser from misinterpreting remaining text as code.
    4.  **Verify Encoding in Memo Rendering:**  Thoroughly verify that output encoding is correctly applied in all code paths that render and display memo content to users. Inspect the rendered HTML source to confirm proper encoding.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Displayed Memos - High Severity
*   **Impact:** High reduction in XSS risk when displaying memos. Output encoding is a crucial last-line-of-defense to prevent XSS when rendering user-generated memo content.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely partially implemented due to framework defaults, but needs explicit verification and potentially more robust implementation specifically for memo content rendering.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Verification of consistent and context-appropriate output encoding in *all* parts of the application where *memo content* is displayed. Needs review and potential code adjustments in the frontend and backend rendering logic specifically for memos.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Link Sanitization and Validation in Memos](./mitigation_strategies/link_sanitization_and_validation_in_memos.md)

### 4. Link Sanitization and Validation in Memos

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Link Sanitization and Validation in Memos
*   **Description:**
    1.  **URL Parsing for Memo Links:** When users input links within memos (during Markdown processing), parse these URLs using a secure URL parsing library.
    2.  **Protocol Whitelisting for Memo Links:**  Specifically for links within memos, strictly whitelist allowed URL protocols to `http` and `https`.  Reject any other protocols (like `javascript:`, `data:`, etc.) within memo links as these are often used for malicious purposes.
    3.  **Domain Blacklisting/Whitelisting for Memo Links (Optional):** Consider domain blacklisting or whitelisting specifically for links within memos, depending on the application's context and risk tolerance. This could be used to block links to known malicious domains or only allow links to trusted domains within memos.
    4.  **Sanitize and Display Memo Links:**  When rendering links from memos, ensure the displayed URL is the sanitized and validated version. Prevent any manipulation or encoding tricks that could bypass sanitization when displaying links within memos.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious Links in Memos (Phishing, Malware Distribution) - Medium to High Severity
    *   Open Redirect via Memos - Medium Severity
*   **Impact:** Medium to High reduction in the risk of users clicking on malicious links embedded *within memos*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely partially implemented with basic URL parsing, but protocol whitelisting and more specific validation for *memo links* are probably missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Protocol whitelisting specifically for memo links, domain blacklisting/whitelisting for memo links (if applicable), and consistent application of sanitization when processing and displaying links *within memos*. Needs implementation in both frontend (for input validation) and backend (for storage and rendering of memo links).

## Mitigation Strategy: [`rel="noopener noreferrer"` for External Links in Memos](./mitigation_strategies/_rel=noopener_noreferrer__for_external_links_in_memos.md)

### 5. `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for External Links in Memos

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for External Links in Memos
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify External Links in Memos:**  During the rendering of memo content, automatically detect links that point to external domains (domains different from the application's domain).
    2.  **Add Attributes to Memo Links:** Programmatically add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes to all identified external links *specifically within memos* during HTML rendering. This should be applied consistently wherever memos are displayed.
    3.  **Verify Implementation for Memo Links:**  Inspect the rendered HTML of memos to ensure that `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes are correctly added to all external links *within memo content*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Tabnabbing from Links in Memos - Medium Severity
    *   Referer Leakage (Privacy) from Links in Memos - Low Severity
*   **Impact:** Medium reduction in tabnabbing risk and low reduction in referer leakage specifically from links within memos.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Potentially missing specifically for memo links. General application might have some link handling, but ensuring this is applied to *memo content* is crucial.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Likely needs implementation in the frontend or backend rendering logic to automatically add these attributes to external links *specifically within memos*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Memos Features](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac__for_memos_features.md)

### 6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Memos Features

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Memos Features
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles for Memos Access:**  Clearly define user roles that interact with Memos functionalities within the application (e.g., "Memo Viewer," "Memo Editor," "Memo Admin"). These roles should specifically govern access to memo-related actions.
    2.  **Assign Permissions to Roles for Memos:**  For each role, define specific permissions related to Memos features. Examples:
        *   "Memo Viewer":  `read` memos.
        *   "Memo Editor": `read`, `create`, `update` memos.
        *   "Memo Admin": `read`, `create`, `update`, `delete` memos, `manage memo sharing`, `manage memo-related user permissions`.
    3.  **Enforce RBAC for Memos Actions:** In the application's code, implement RBAC checks *specifically for all actions related to memos*. Verify user roles and permissions before allowing operations like creating, reading, updating, deleting, or sharing memos.
    4.  **RBAC for Memo API (if applicable):** If Memos exposes an API within your application, enforce RBAC checks on all API endpoints related to memos, ensuring only authorized roles can access memo data and functionalities via the API.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Memos and Memo Data - High Severity
    *   Data Leakage from Memos - High Severity
    *   Unauthorized Modification/Deletion of Memos - Medium to High Severity
*   **Impact:** High reduction in risks related to unauthorized access and data manipulation *within the Memos context*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Potentially partially implemented with general application RBAC, but likely needs more granular RBAC specifically for Memos functionalities and data access.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Detailed RBAC implementation *specifically for Memos features*, permission enforcement in code for memo-related actions, and RBAC for any Memos-related API endpoints. Needs implementation in the backend authorization logic and potentially frontend access control mechanisms related to memos.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Sharing Mechanisms for Memos Content](./mitigation_strategies/secure_sharing_mechanisms_for_memos_content.md)

### 7. Secure Sharing Mechanisms for Memos Content

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Sharing Mechanisms for Memos Content
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Unique, Non-Guessable Identifiers for Memo Shares:** When generating shareable links *for memos*, use unique, long, and cryptographically secure, non-guessable identifiers (e.g., UUIDs generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator). Avoid predictable or sequential identifiers for memo shares.
    2.  **Granular Sharing Permissions for Memos:**  Provide options for granular sharing permissions *specifically for memos* (e.g., "view only memo," "edit memo"). Allow users to define the level of access granted when sharing memos.
    3.  **Expiration Dates for Memo Shares (Recommended):** Implement the ability to set expiration dates for shared memo links. This limits the time window of access to shared memos and reduces the risk of long-term unauthorized access.
    4.  **Revocation of Memo Shares:**  Provide a clear and easy mechanism for memo owners or administrators to revoke previously created shareable links *for memos*, immediately terminating access through those links.
    5.  **Audit Logging of Memo Sharing Actions:** Log all sharing actions *related to memos*, including creation, modification, and revocation of shares, along with user, memo identifier, and timestamp information.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Memos via Shared Links - Medium to High Severity
    *   Data Leakage of Memo Content via Shared Links - Medium to High Severity
*   **Impact:** Medium to High reduction in risks associated with insecure sharing of *memo content*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Potentially partially implemented if Memos has sharing features. However, the security of these features (identifier generation, permission granularity, revocation, expiration) needs to be specifically assessed and strengthened.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implementation of secure, non-guessable identifiers for memo shares, granular sharing permissions *for memos*, expiration dates for memo shares, share revocation mechanisms *for memos*, and audit logging of memo sharing actions. Needs implementation in the backend sharing logic and potentially frontend UI for managing memo sharing settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audit Logging for Memos-Specific Interactions](./mitigation_strategies/audit_logging_for_memos-specific_interactions.md)

### 8. Audit Logging for Memos-Specific Interactions

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Audit Logging for Memos-Specific Interactions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Key Memo Events for Logging:** Determine the specific events related to Memos that are critical for security auditing. Focus on actions directly involving memos, such as:
        *   Memo creation
        *   Memo modification
        *   Memo deletion
        *   Memo access (viewing)
        *   Memo sharing actions (creation, modification, revocation)
        *   Changes to memo-related permissions
    2.  **Log Detailed Information for Memo Events:** For each logged memo event, record comprehensive information:
        *   Timestamp of the event.
        *   User performing the action (if authenticated).
        *   Type of memo event (e.g., "memo created," "memo shared").
        *   Identifier of the memo involved.
        *   Details of the action (e.g., changes made to memo content, sharing permissions granted).
        *   Source IP address (optional, with privacy considerations).
    3.  **Secure Storage for Memo Audit Logs:** Store audit logs related to memos in a secure, centralized location, protected from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.
    4.  **Regular Review and Monitoring of Memo Logs:**  Establish a process for regularly reviewing audit logs *specifically for memo-related activities* to detect suspicious patterns, potential security incidents affecting memos, and policy violations related to memo usage.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Breaches involving Memos (Detection and Investigation) - Medium Severity
    *   Insider Threats related to Memos (Detection and Investigation) - Medium Severity
    *   Unauthorized Access to Memos (Detection and Investigation) - Medium Severity
    *   Non-Repudiation for Memo Actions - Low Severity
*   **Impact:** Medium reduction in the impact of security incidents *related to memos* by enabling detection, investigation, and post-incident analysis of memo-related activities.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Potentially missing or only basic application-level logging. Comprehensive audit logging *specifically for Memos interactions* is likely not implemented by default and needs to be added.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implementation of detailed audit logging for key Memos events, secure log storage *for memo logs*, log review processes focused on *memo activities*, and potentially integration with SIEM systems for automated analysis of memo-related security events. Needs implementation in the backend application logic that handles memo operations.
