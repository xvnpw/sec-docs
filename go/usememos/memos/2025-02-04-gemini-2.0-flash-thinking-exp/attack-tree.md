## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Markdown Injection (Stored XSS) [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious Markdown code within memos.
    *   **Attack Step:**
        *   Attacker crafts a memo containing malicious Markdown, specifically JavaScript code embedded within Markdown formatting.
        *   This memo is stored in the Memos application's database.
        *   When other users view this memo, their browsers render the Markdown.
        *   Due to insufficient sanitization, the malicious JavaScript is executed in the victim's browser context.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   Session Hijacking: Stealing user session cookies to impersonate the victim.
        *   Data Theft: Accessing sensitive data visible to the victim within the application.
        *   Account Takeover: Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
        *   Malware Distribution: Redirecting users to malicious websites or initiating downloads.
    *   **Actionable Insights:**
        *   Implement robust server-side Markdown sanitization using a well-vetted library.
        *   Configure the Markdown parser to strip or encode potentially harmful HTML tags and JavaScript.
        *   Deploy a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent execution of inline scripts and restrict script sources to trusted origins.
        *   Regularly update the Markdown parsing library to patch known vulnerabilities.

*   **Malicious File Upload [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Upload and Execute Server-Side Malicious Files [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Uploading a malicious file (e.g., web shell) and executing it on the server.
        *   **Attack Step:**
            *   Attacker attempts to upload a file designed for server-side execution (e.g., a PHP, Python, or JSP web shell).
            *   Attacker tries to bypass file type restrictions by:
                *   Renaming the file with a permitted extension (e.g., from `shell.php` to `shell.png.php`).
                *   Using double extensions or other bypass techniques.
            *   If successful, the malicious file is stored on the server.
            *   Attacker then accesses the uploaded file directly through a web request, triggering its execution by the web server.
        *   **Potential Impact:**
            *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Gaining complete control over the web server.
            *   Data Breach: Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data from the server.
            *   System Compromise: Using the compromised server as a launchpad for further attacks on internal networks or other systems.
            *   Denial of Service (DoS): Disrupting the application's availability.
        *   **Actionable Insights:**
            *   Implement strict server-side file type validation. Do not rely solely on client-side checks or file extensions.
            *   Use content-based file type detection (magic bytes, MIME type sniffing) to verify the true file type.
            *   Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root to prevent direct execution.
            *   Configure the web server to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directory (e.g., using `.htaccess` in Apache or location blocks in Nginx).
            *   Implement regular security scanning and vulnerability assessments of the server environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Access Controls [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_access_controls__critical_node_.md)

*   **Authorization Bypass - Memo Visibility [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in the logic that controls access to memos based on their visibility settings (private, public, shared).
    *   **Attack Step:**
        *   Attacker identifies or discovers vulnerabilities in the application's code related to memo visibility checks.
        *   This could involve:
            *   Parameter manipulation in web requests to access memos marked as private.
            *   Exploiting logical flaws in the sharing mechanism to gain unauthorized access.
            *   Bypassing access control checks due to incorrect implementation or missing checks in certain code paths.
        *   If successful, the attacker can view, modify, or delete memos they are not authorized to access, including private memos containing sensitive information.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data: Exposure of confidential information stored in private memos.
        *   Data Breach: Potential leakage of sensitive organizational or personal data.
        *   Integrity Compromise: Unauthorized modification or deletion of memos.
        *   Privacy Violation: Breach of user privacy by accessing private communications.
    *   **Actionable Insights:**
        *   Conduct a thorough security review of all code related to memo visibility and sharing logic.
        *   Implement a robust and well-defined access control model (RBAC or ABAC).
        *   Enforce authorization checks consistently at every point where memo data is accessed or modified.
        *   Use automated testing to verify authorization rules for different user roles and memo visibility settings.
        *   Perform penetration testing to identify potential authorization bypass vulnerabilities.

*   **API Authentication/Authorization Bypass (If API is exposed/used by the application) [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication or authorization mechanisms protecting the Memos API.
    *   **Attack Step:**
        *   Attacker targets the Memos API endpoints, attempting to bypass authentication or authorization.
        *   This could involve:
            *   Exploiting weaknesses in the API authentication scheme (e.g., weak or default credentials, insecure token generation).
            *   Bypassing authorization checks by manipulating API requests or exploiting logical flaws in authorization code.
            *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the API framework or libraries used.
        *   If successful, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the API, allowing them to perform actions as any user or administrator, depending on the severity of the bypass.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   Full Application Compromise: API access often grants broad control over the application's functionalities and data.
        *   Data Breach: Accessing, modifying, or deleting all memos and potentially user data.
        *   Account Takeover: Creating, modifying, or deleting user accounts.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Abusing API endpoints to overload the server.
    *   **Actionable Insights:**
        *   Implement strong API authentication using industry-standard protocols like JWT or OAuth 2.0.
        *   Enforce robust authorization checks for every API endpoint and action, based on user roles and permissions.
        *   Validate and sanitize all input to API endpoints to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement API rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and DoS attempts.
        *   Regularly audit and monitor API access and usage for suspicious activity.
