# Threat Model Analysis for usememos/memos

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection via Memos (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)](./threats/malicious_content_injection_via_memos__cross-site_scripting_-_xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a memo containing malicious JavaScript or HTML. When another user views this memo, their browser executes the malicious code. This could be done by embedding `<script>` tags or manipulating HTML attributes within the memo content.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of other users' accounts (session hijacking, cookie theft), redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the Memos interface for other users, or execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim user.
    *   **Affected Component:** Memo Rendering Engine (frontend component responsible for displaying memo content).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and output encoding (HTML escaping) on memo content before rendering. Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is permitted to load resources. Employ a secure Markdown rendering library and keep it updated.

## Threat: [Markdown Rendering Vulnerabilities](./threats/markdown_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a memo using specific Markdown syntax that exploits a vulnerability in the Markdown rendering library used by Memos. This could lead to unexpected behavior, denial of service, or even remote code execution on the server or client-side.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting Memos or on the client's browser, denial of service by crashing the rendering process, or unexpected data manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Markdown Parsing/Rendering Library (backend or frontend component responsible for processing Markdown).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use a well-vetted and actively maintained Markdown rendering library. Regularly update the library to patch known vulnerabilities. Implement sandboxing or other isolation techniques for the rendering process.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Memo Content](./threats/information_disclosure_via_memo_content.md)

*   **Description:**  Users unintentionally or maliciously share sensitive information within memos, and the application's access controls are insufficient to prevent unauthorized access. This could occur through public memos or vulnerabilities in private sharing mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, privacy violations, potential reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Access Control Logic (backend component responsible for managing sharing permissions and user roles).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement granular and robust access control mechanisms for memos. Provide clear and intuitive controls for users to manage the visibility of their memos. Consider features like expiration dates for shared links or more fine-grained permission levels.

## Threat: [Bypass of Sharing Restrictions](./threats/bypass_of_sharing_restrictions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker finds a vulnerability in the logic that enforces sharing permissions, allowing them to access memos that are intended to be private or restricted. This could involve manipulating URLs, exploiting API flaws, or bypassing authentication checks specific to memo sharing.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sharing Logic and Access Control (backend components responsible for managing memo visibility).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement thorough authorization checks at every access point related to memo access. Avoid relying solely on client-side checks. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in sharing mechanisms.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Sharing Settings](./threats/manipulation_of_sharing_settings.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability to modify the sharing settings of other users' memos without their consent. This could involve exploiting API flaws or vulnerabilities in the user interface related to managing memo sharing.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized exposure of private memos, potential for data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sharing Settings Management (backend and frontend components responsible for modifying memo visibility).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication and authorization checks for modifying sharing settings. Log all changes to sharing settings for auditing purposes.

## Threat: [Insecure User Registration/Invitation Process](./threats/insecure_user_registrationinvitation_process.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the user registration or invitation process specific to Memos allow unauthorized individuals to create accounts or gain access to the system. This could involve bypassing email verification or exploiting flaws in invitation token generation within the Memos application.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Memos instance, potential for further malicious activity by the unauthorized user.
    *   **Affected Component:** User Authentication and Registration Module (backend component responsible for managing user accounts).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong email verification for registration. Use secure and unpredictable invitation tokens. Implement rate limiting on registration attempts.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through User Roles](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_user_roles.md)

*   **Description:** If Memos implements different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user), a vulnerability within Memos' role management system could allow a lower-privileged user to gain access to functionalities or data reserved for higher-privileged users.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative functions, ability to modify or delete data belonging to other users, potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System (backend component managing user roles and permissions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement a robust and well-tested RBAC system specific to Memos. Enforce the principle of least privilege. Conduct thorough security audits to identify potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities (If Applicable)](./threats/api_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:** If Memos exposes an API, vulnerabilities in the API endpoints, authentication, or authorization could allow attackers to bypass security controls and access or manipulate memo data without proper authorization. This could include issues like missing authentication, broken authorization, or injection flaws in API parameters specifically related to memo operations.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification or deletion of memos, potential for remote code execution depending on the API functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** API Endpoints and Authentication/Authorization Logic (backend components responsible for handling API requests).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the API (e.g., OAuth 2.0). Validate all API input to prevent injection attacks. Follow secure API development best practices. Rate limit API requests to prevent abuse.
