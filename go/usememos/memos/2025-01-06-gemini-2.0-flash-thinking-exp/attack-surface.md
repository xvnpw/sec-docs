# Attack Surface Analysis for usememos/memos

## Attack Surface: [Memo Content Injection](./attack_surfaces/memo_content_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious code or scripts are injected into memo content and executed when the memo is viewed by other users. This goes beyond basic XSS and includes potential Markdown or client-side template injection.
    *   **How Memos Contributes:** The core functionality of creating and displaying user-generated content (memos) without strict input validation and output encoding.
    *   **Example:** A user crafts a memo containing a malicious `<script>` tag or a specially crafted Markdown link that, when rendered, executes JavaScript to steal cookies or redirect users.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, credential theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side input sanitization and output encoding for all memo content. Utilize a security-focused Markdown parser and keep it updated. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about clicking on links within memos from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Uploads via Attachments](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_uploads_via_attachments.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) through the attachment feature, which can then be executed or used to compromise the server or other users.
    *   **How Memos Contributes:** The functionality allowing users to attach files to their memos without proper validation and security measures.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image. If the server doesn't prevent execution of PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker can access the web shell and execute commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, remote code execution, data breaches, and potential distribution of malware to other users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on content, not just extension. Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location where server-side scripts cannot be executed. Use a dedicated storage service with security features. Implement anti-virus scanning on uploaded files. Rename uploaded files to prevent direct execution.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about downloading and executing attachments from unknown or untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Search Query Injection](./attack_surfaces/search_query_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or commands into search queries, potentially leading to information disclosure or unauthorized actions if the search functionality doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize inputs. This directly relates to searching *within memo content*.
    *   **How Memos Contributes:** The search functionality that allows users to query memo content. If queries are not handled securely, it can become an attack vector when searching through the memo data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a search query containing SQL injection code (if a database is used for search indexing) to extract sensitive data from the memos.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized data access, potential database compromise specifically related to memo data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions related to search within memos. Implement robust input sanitization for search queries. Avoid constructing dynamic SQL queries directly from user input when searching memo content.
        *   **Users:** Be mindful of the terms used in search queries, although the primary responsibility lies with the developers to secure this functionality.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient API Authentication and Authorization (Related to Memo Access)](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_api_authentication_and_authorization__related_to_memo_access_.md)

*   **Description:** Weak or missing authentication and authorization mechanisms on API endpoints allow unauthorized access to memo data or functionality related to memos (e.g., creating, editing, deleting).
    *   **How Memos Contributes:** The design and implementation of the API's security controls specifically concerning access to memo resources.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers an API endpoint to retrieve memo content and can access memos belonging to other users due to missing or flawed authorization checks.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches involving memos, unauthorized modification or deletion of memos, privilege escalation related to memo management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0). Enforce proper authorization checks on all API endpoints that handle memo data to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to. Follow the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Users:** Use strong and unique credentials if API keys are involved. Be aware of the permissions granted to applications accessing Memos through the API.
