## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies in Memos](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies_in_memos.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Enforce Strong Password Policies in Memos

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1 (Development - Memos Backend):** Modify the Memos backend user registration and password reset logic (likely in Go code) to enforce strong password complexity requirements. This includes:
        *   Minimum password length (e.g., 12 characters).
        *   Requirement for a mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
        *   Implement checks against a list of common or weak passwords (consider using a library or external service for this).
    *   **Step 2 (Development - Memos Frontend):** Integrate a password strength estimator library (e.g., zxcvbn via JavaScript) into the Memos frontend during user registration and password changes to provide real-time feedback to users about password strength.
    *   **Step 3 (Documentation - Memos Project):** Update the Memos documentation (likely in Markdown files within the repository) to clearly outline the password policy for users.
    *   **Step 4 (Enforcement - Memos Backend):** Ensure the password policy is strictly enforced on the Memos backend. Reject weak passwords during registration and password changes, even if client-side checks are bypassed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Weak passwords in Memos are easily cracked, leading to unauthorized access to memo data.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (High Severity):** Reused weak passwords can compromise Memos accounts if credentials are leaked from other services.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks (High Severity):** Common passwords are vulnerable to dictionary attacks against Memos user accounts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** High reduction in risk for Memos accounts.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Medium reduction in risk for Memos accounts.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks:** High reduction in risk for Memos accounts.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Unknown:** Requires code review of Memos backend (Go) and frontend (likely React or similar) to assess current password policy implementation. Check user registration and password reset code.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potentially missing strong complexity requirements in Memos backend.
    *   Likely missing frontend password strength estimation in Memos.
    *   Potentially missing backend checks against common password lists in Memos.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in Memos](./mitigation_strategies/implement_multi-factor_authentication__mfa__in_memos.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in Memos

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1 (Development - Memos Backend):** Choose and implement an MFA method within Memos. TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Passwords) is a suitable starting point for a self-hosted application like Memos. Implement server-side logic for MFA (likely in Go).
    *   **Step 2 (Development - Memos Frontend):** Develop a user interface in the Memos frontend (likely React or similar) for users to enable and manage MFA. This includes:
        *   Displaying a QR code or setup key for TOTP enrollment.
        *   Prompting for MFA code during login after password authentication.
    *   **Step 3 (Development - Memos Backend):** Securely store MFA secrets (e.g., TOTP secrets) in the Memos database, ensuring encryption at rest.
    *   **Step 4 (User Interface - Memos Frontend):** Add MFA settings to the user profile page in Memos, allowing users to enable/disable and manage their MFA.
    *   **Step 5 (Documentation - Memos Project):**  Create documentation within the Memos project to guide users on how to enable and use MFA.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Account Takeover in Memos (High Severity):** MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to Memos accounts, even if passwords are compromised.
    *   **Credential Stuffing against Memos (High Severity):** MFA effectively neutralizes credential stuffing attacks targeting Memos.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Account Takeover in Memos:** High reduction in risk.
    *   **Credential Stuffing against Memos:** High reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **No:** Based on current feature set and common practices for similar open-source projects, MFA is likely **not currently implemented** in Memos. Review Memos codebase to confirm.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   MFA is a significant missing security feature in Memos. Backend and frontend implementation is required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation for Memo Content in Memos](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_for_memo_content_in_memos.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Strict Input Validation for Memo Content in Memos

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1 (Development - Memos Backend):**  Identify all backend endpoints in Memos (likely Go code) that handle memo content input (creation, editing).
    *   **Step 2 (Development - Memos Backend):** Implement robust server-side input validation in Memos backend for all memo content fields. This should include:
        *   **Length Limits:** Enforce maximum character limits for memo text and tags in Memos backend.
        *   **Character Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Restrict allowed characters for memo content in Memos backend to prevent injection attacks. Whitelisting is preferred.
        *   **Markdown Sanitization (if Memos uses Markdown):** If Memos renders Markdown, use a robust Markdown sanitization library in the backend (e.g., a Go Markdown library with sanitization capabilities or integrate with a sanitization library). Sanitize Markdown input to remove potentially harmful elements.
    *   **Step 3 (Development - Memos Frontend):** Implement client-side input validation in Memos frontend (likely JavaScript) for user feedback, but **always rely on server-side validation in Memos backend for security**.
    *   **Step 4 (Testing - Memos Project):**  Add unit and integration tests to the Memos project to specifically test input validation logic with various malicious inputs.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Memos (High Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious JavaScript into memos that could affect other Memos users.
    *   **Markdown Injection in Memos (Medium Severity):** Prevents malicious Markdown from being rendered in unintended ways within Memos.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Memos (Medium Severity):** Prevents DoS from excessively long memo inputs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Memos:** High reduction in risk.
    *   **Markdown Injection in Memos:** Medium to High reduction in risk.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Memos:** Low to Medium reduction in risk.

    *   **Step 2 (Development - Memos Frontend):** Implement context-aware output encoding in the Memos frontend when rendering memo content.
        *   **HTML Context:** Use the frontend framework's built-in HTML encoding mechanisms (e.g., React's JSX automatically escapes by default, but verify and ensure proper usage).
        *   **JavaScript Context:** If dynamically inserting memo content into JavaScript code in Memos frontend, use JavaScript encoding functions.
        *   **URL Context:** If including memo content in URLs within Memos frontend, use URL encoding functions.
    *   **Step 3 (Development - Memos Frontend):** Ensure consistent output encoding across the entire Memos frontend, especially for user-generated memo content.
    *   **Step 4 (Testing - Memos Project):** Add frontend integration tests to Memos project to verify that output encoding is correctly applied and prevents XSS when displaying memos.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Memos (High Severity):** Prevents XSS vulnerabilities in Memos even if input validation is bypassed or incomplete.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Memos:** High reduction in risk.
