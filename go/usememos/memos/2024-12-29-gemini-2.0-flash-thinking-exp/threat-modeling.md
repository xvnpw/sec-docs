### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Memos Application

Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the Memos application:

*   **Threat:** Direct File System Access Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the server's file system where Memos stores its data. This could be achieved through server misconfiguration, exploiting other vulnerabilities on the server, or gaining access to server credentials. Once accessed, the attacker can directly read, modify, or delete memo files.
    *   **Impact:** Complete loss of memo data, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information contained within memos, or corruption of the application's data store, leading to application malfunction.
    *   **Affected Component:** File storage module, server configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file system permissions, ensuring only the Memos application user has necessary access.
        *   Isolate the Memos data directory from the web server's document root.
        *   Regularly audit server security configurations.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text; consider encryption at rest.

*   **Threat:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Memo Content
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a memo containing malicious JavaScript code. When another user views this memo, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting them to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf within the Memos application.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement of the application for other users.
    *   **Affected Component:** Markdown rendering function, memo display component.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

        *   Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal attacks.
        *   Use a separate domain or subdomain for serving user-uploaded content.
        *   Consider scanning uploaded files for malware.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Public Links
    *   **Description:** If Memos allows sharing memos via public links, vulnerabilities in the link generation or access control mechanisms could allow unauthorized access to private memos. This could involve predictable link patterns or flaws in permission checks.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information contained within private memos.
    *   **Affected Component:** Public link generation logic, access control module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unpredictable random strings for public link generation.
        *   Implement proper access control checks to ensure only authorized users can generate public links for specific memos.
        *   Consider adding an extra layer of security, like a password for accessing public links.

*   **Threat:** Predictable Public Link Generation
    *   **Description:** The algorithm used to generate public links is predictable, allowing attackers to potentially guess valid links and access memos they shouldn't.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Public link generation logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
