## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses__critical_.md)

**Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses [CRITICAL]:** This high-risk path focuses on bypassing the mechanisms intended to verify the identity and permissions of entities accessing CockroachDB.
    *   **Weak Application-to-CockroachDB Credentials [CRITICAL]:** This critical node highlights the danger of using easily guessable or compromised credentials for the application's connection to CockroachDB.
        *   **Brute-force/Dictionary Attack on CockroachDB User Credentials:** An attacker attempts to guess valid usernames and passwords through repeated automated attempts.
        *   **Default CockroachDB Credentials:**  Attackers exploit the failure to change default usernames and passwords provided by CockroachDB.
        *   **Credentials Stored Insecurely by Application:** The application stores database credentials in a way that is easily accessible to attackers (e.g., plain text in configuration files or code).
    *   **SQL Injection in Application's CockroachDB Connection String:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into parameters used to construct the database connection string.
        *   **Inject Malicious Parameters in Connection String:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles input when building the connection string.
        *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Connection String Parsing:** Targeting flaws in the libraries or methods used to interpret the connection string.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:** This high-risk path involves injecting malicious SQL queries into application inputs to manipulate the database.
    *   **Application-Level SQL Injection [CRITICAL]:** This critical node represents the classic SQL injection vulnerability where user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
        *   **Inject Malicious SQL through Application Input Fields:** Attackers insert malicious SQL code into forms, URLs, or other input fields.
        *   **Exploit Stored Procedures with SQL Injection Flaws:**  Vulnerabilities within stored procedures allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL.
        *   **Blind SQL Injection to Infer Data or Execute Commands:** Attackers infer information or execute commands by observing the application's responses to different injected SQL queries, even without direct error messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on CockroachDB Connections](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_cockroachdb_connections.md)

**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on CockroachDB Connections:** Attackers intercept communication between the application and CockroachDB to eavesdrop or manipulate data.
    *   **Intercept Unencrypted Communication:** If TLS encryption is not enforced, attackers can intercept and read the data exchanged.
    *   **Downgrade Attack on TLS Connection:** Attackers force the connection to use weaker, more vulnerable TLS versions or cipher suites.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Access to CockroachDB Network Ports](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_access_to_cockroachdb_network_ports.md)

**Unauthorized Access to CockroachDB Network Ports:** Attackers gain direct access to CockroachDB services by exploiting open network ports.
    *   **Access CockroachDB Admin UI without Proper Authentication:**  Exploiting misconfigurations or weak credentials to access the CockroachDB administrative interface.
    *   **Direct Access to CockroachDB Nodes on the Network:** Attackers gain network access to CockroachDB nodes, potentially bypassing application security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Internal CockroachDB Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_internal_cockroachdb_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Exploit Internal CockroachDB Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:** This high-risk path involves exploiting security flaws within the CockroachDB software itself.
    *   **Known CockroachDB Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:** This critical node highlights the risk of unpatched vulnerabilities in CockroachDB.
        *   **Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities:** Attackers leverage publicly known exploits for vulnerabilities that have not been patched.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure CockroachDB Configuration Settings](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_cockroachdb_configuration_settings.md)

**Insecure CockroachDB Configuration Settings:**  Attackers exploit misconfigurations in CockroachDB settings.
    *   **Weak Security Settings Enabled:**  Exploiting insecure default settings or intentional misconfigurations that weaken security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deployment Practices](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deployment_practices.md)

**Insecure Deployment Practices:** Attackers leverage insecure ways CockroachDB is deployed.
    *   **Running CockroachDB with Excessive Privileges:**  If CockroachDB processes run with unnecessary high privileges, a successful exploit can have a wider impact.
    *   **Exposed Backup Files or Snapshots:** Attackers gain access to sensitive data by accessing insecurely stored backup files.
