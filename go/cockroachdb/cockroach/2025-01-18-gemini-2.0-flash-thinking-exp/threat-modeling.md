# Threat Model Analysis for cockroachdb/cockroach

## Threat: [Individual Node Compromise](./threats/individual_node_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a single CockroachDB server instance. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in CockroachDB itself, weak CockroachDB user credentials, or by compromising the underlying operating system and then accessing CockroachDB data or processes. Once inside, the attacker might exfiltrate data files, manipulate data directly on disk, or shut down the node.
*   **Impact:** Data breach if encryption at rest is not implemented or keys are compromised. Data corruption if the attacker modifies data files. Denial of service for the affected node, potentially impacting cluster availability if quorum is lost. Exposure of secrets stored on the node (e.g., certificates managed by CockroachDB).
*   **Affected Component:** `Storage Layer` (Pebble), `Gossip Protocol` (potential for disruption), `Security/Authentication Modules`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong authentication for all CockroachDB users.
    *   Utilize encryption at rest to protect data on disk.
    *   Implement strong operating system security practices (regular patching, secure configurations) as a foundational security measure.
    *   Implement network segmentation to limit the blast radius of a compromise.
    *   Deploy intrusion detection and prevention systems.

## Threat: [Network Partitioning Exploitation](./threats/network_partitioning_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intentionally disrupts network connectivity between CockroachDB nodes, creating network partitions. This can lead to loss of quorum and potentially "split-brain" scenarios where partitions operate independently. While the network disruption itself might be external, the *exploitation* of this state to cause data divergence is a direct consequence of CockroachDB's distributed nature.
*   **Impact:** Loss of quorum and cluster unavailability. "Split-brain" scenarios leading to data divergence and potential data loss or inconsistencies. Difficulty in recovering from the partition.
*   **Affected Component:** `Gossip Protocol`, `Consensus (Raft)` implementation, `Networking Layer`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure a robust and redundant network infrastructure.
    *   Implement network monitoring and alerting for connectivity issues.
    *   Configure appropriate replication factors to tolerate node failures and network partitions.
    *   Follow CockroachDB best practices for deployment in distributed environments.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Inter-Node Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_inter-node_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between CockroachDB nodes if TLS encryption for inter-node communication is not enabled or is improperly configured. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on sensitive data or potentially modify data in transit, directly impacting CockroachDB's internal operations.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data exchanged between nodes (e.g., data being replicated, internal communication). Potential for data corruption or manipulation if the attacker can modify the intercepted traffic. Disruption of consensus mechanisms.
*   **Affected Component:** `Networking Layer`, `Gossip Protocol`, `Replication Mechanisms`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory:** Enable TLS encryption for all inter-node communication.
    *   Properly configure and manage certificates used for TLS.
    *   Regularly audit TLS configuration and certificate validity.

## Threat: [Weak or Default CockroachDB User Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_cockroachdb_user_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access directly to the CockroachDB database using default or easily guessable passwords for user accounts. This directly targets CockroachDB's authentication mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation or deletion, denial of service by disrupting database operations.
*   **Affected Component:** `Security/Authentication Modules`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for all CockroachDB users.
    *   Disable or remove default user accounts.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication where possible.
    *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.

## Threat: [Exposure of CockroachDB Administrative Interfaces](./threats/exposure_of_cockroachdb_administrative_interfaces.md)

*   **Description:** The CockroachDB Admin UI or other administrative interfaces are exposed to the public internet or an untrusted network without proper authentication or authorization. This directly targets CockroachDB's management plane.
*   **Impact:** Attackers could gain control of the entire CockroachDB cluster, leading to complete data compromise, denial of service, or manipulation of cluster settings.
*   **Affected Component:** `Admin UI`, `gRPC Endpoints` (for administrative commands).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict access to administrative interfaces to trusted networks only.
    *   Enforce strong authentication for accessing administrative interfaces.
    *   Consider using a VPN or bastion host for accessing administrative interfaces remotely.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in CockroachDB Software](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_cockroachdb_software.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the CockroachDB software itself. This directly targets the CockroachDB codebase.
*   **Impact:** Can range from denial of service to complete cluster compromise, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:** Various components depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep CockroachDB software up-to-date with the latest security patches and releases.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories from Cockroach Labs.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management program to track and address known vulnerabilities.
