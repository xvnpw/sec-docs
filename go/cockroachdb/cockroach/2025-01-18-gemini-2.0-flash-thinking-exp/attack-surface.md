# Attack Surface Analysis for cockroachdb/cockroach

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via CockroachDB's SQL Interface](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_cockroachdb's_sql_interface.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious SQL code into application queries, which is then executed by the CockroachDB database.
    *   **How CockroachDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CockroachDB, like any SQL database, parses and executes SQL queries. If the application doesn't properly sanitize user input before including it in SQL queries, CockroachDB will execute the injected malicious code.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a username from user input and constructs a SQL query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '` + userInput + `'`. If `userInput` is `' OR '1'='1'`, the query becomes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'`, bypassing the intended filtering and potentially returning all user data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification or deletion, potential for privilege escalation within the database (though less direct than in some other database systems).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use parameterized queries (prepared statements): This prevents user input from being interpreted as SQL code.
        *   Implement strict input validation: Sanitize and validate all user-provided data before using it in SQL queries.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege: Grant database users only the necessary permissions.
        *   Regularly review and audit SQL queries: Identify potential injection points.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass on CockroachDB SQL Interface](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass_on_cockroachdb_sql_interface.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the CockroachDB database due to weak or improperly configured authentication or authorization mechanisms.
    *   **How CockroachDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CockroachDB manages user accounts and permissions. If these are not configured securely, it creates an entry point for attackers.
    *   **Example:** Using default or weak passwords for CockroachDB users, failing to implement proper role-based access control (RBAC), or vulnerabilities in the application's authentication logic when connecting to CockroachDB.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies: Require complex passwords and regular password changes.
        *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms: Utilize TLS client certificates for authentication where appropriate.
        *   Utilize CockroachDB's role-based access control (RBAC): Grant users only the necessary privileges.
        *   Securely store database credentials: Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application. Use environment variables or secure vault solutions.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of CockroachDB Admin UI without Proper Authentication](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_cockroachdb_admin_ui_without_proper_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** The CockroachDB Admin UI, which provides insights and control over the cluster, is accessible without proper authentication or authorization.
    *   **How CockroachDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CockroachDB provides this powerful web interface for management. If not secured, it becomes a direct attack vector.
    *   **Example:** The Admin UI is accessible on a public IP address without requiring any login credentials or using default credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Full visibility into the database cluster's health and configuration, potential for malicious manipulation of the cluster, including data deletion or service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the Admin UI:**  Use firewall rules to allow access only from trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
        *   Enable and enforce authentication for the Admin UI:** Configure secure authentication mechanisms.
        *   Avoid exposing the Admin UI to the public internet.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Queries](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_malicious_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted, resource-intensive queries to the CockroachDB database, overwhelming its resources and causing performance degradation or service unavailability.
    *   **How CockroachDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CockroachDB's query execution engine processes all received queries. If not protected, it can be abused.
    *   **Example:** Sending queries with excessive joins, aggregations on large datasets without proper indexing, or repeatedly executing expensive queries.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, impacting application availability and potentially leading to data loss if write operations are interrupted.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement query timeouts:** Limit the execution time for individual queries.
        *   Monitor database performance:** Detect and investigate unusual query patterns.
        *   Optimize database schema and queries:** Ensure efficient query execution.
        *   Implement rate limiting at the application level:** Restrict the number of requests from a single source.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Node Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-node_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between CockroachDB nodes within the cluster is not properly secured, allowing potential eavesdropping or manipulation of data in transit.
    *   **How CockroachDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CockroachDB relies on internal communication between nodes for replication and consensus. If this communication is compromised, the integrity and availability of the database are at risk.
    *   **Example:**  Inter-node communication is not encrypted using TLS, allowing an attacker on the same network to intercept data being replicated between nodes.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, cluster instability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS encryption for inter-node communication:** This is a fundamental security requirement for CockroachDB deployments.
        *   Secure the network infrastructure:** Isolate the CockroachDB cluster on a private network.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Backup and Restore Processes](./attack_surfaces/insecure_backup_and_restore_processes.md)

*   **Description:** Backups of the CockroachDB database are stored or transmitted insecurely, or the restore process itself has vulnerabilities.
    *   **How CockroachDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CockroachDB's backup and restore features, if not handled securely, can become a point of vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** Backups are stored in an unencrypted format on a publicly accessible storage location, or the restore process allows for overwriting critical system files.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data in backups, potential for data corruption or system compromise during restore.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt backups at rest and in transit.
        *   Securely store backup credentials and access keys.
        *   Restrict access to backup storage locations.
        *   Regularly test the backup and restore process.
