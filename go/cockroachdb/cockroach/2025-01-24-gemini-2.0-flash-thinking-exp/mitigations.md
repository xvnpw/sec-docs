# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cockroachdb/cockroach

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Implement Robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/1__implement_robust_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Roles:** Define distinct roles based on job functions and application needs (e.g., `admin`, `developer`, `read-only`, `application_user`).
    2.  **Grant Minimal Privileges:** For each role, grant only the necessary privileges required to perform assigned tasks using CockroachDB's `GRANT` statement. Use specific grants like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on specific tables or databases. Avoid granting `ALL` privileges.
    3.  **Utilize CockroachDB RBAC:** Leverage CockroachDB's `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements to manage role permissions. Use `CREATE ROLE` to define custom roles within CockroachDB.
    4.  **Application User Roles:** Create dedicated database users within CockroachDB for the application itself, granting them only the minimal permissions needed for application functionality. Avoid using administrative users in application code.
    5.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically review role assignments and permissions within CockroachDB using CockroachDB's information schema tables to ensure they still align with the principle of least privilege and business needs. Remove unnecessary permissions and roles using `REVOKE`.
    6.  **Automate Role Management:**  If possible, integrate role management with your application's user management system or use infrastructure-as-code tools to manage RBAC configurations in CockroachDB consistently.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):**  Without CockroachDB RBAC, any user or compromised application component could potentially access sensitive data they shouldn't within the CockroachDB database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):**  Weak CockroachDB RBAC can allow malicious actors to gain higher privileges than intended within the database, leading to broader system compromise.
    *   **Data Modification or Deletion by Unauthorized Users (High Severity):** Lack of CockroachDB RBAC can allow unintended or malicious modification or deletion of critical data within the database.
    *   **Internal Threats (Medium Severity):**  CockroachDB RBAC helps mitigate risks from insider threats by limiting database access based on roles and responsibilities defined within CockroachDB.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** **Significant** reduction in risk. CockroachDB RBAC directly controls who can access what data within the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** **Significant** reduction in risk. Granular roles within CockroachDB limit the scope of potential privilege escalation within the database.
    *   **Data Modification or Deletion by Unauthorized Users:** **Significant** reduction in risk. CockroachDB RBAC controls who can modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Internal Threats:** **Moderate** reduction in risk. CockroachDB RBAC adds a layer of defense against internal misuse of database access.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   RBAC is partially implemented in CockroachDB. We have `admin` and `developer` roles defined. Application uses a dedicated database user with limited privileges for data access within CockroachDB.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Granular roles for different application modules are missing in CockroachDB.  Need to define more specific roles like `reporting_user`, `support_user` with even more restricted permissions within CockroachDB.
    *   Automated role management and audit logging of RBAC changes within CockroachDB are not yet implemented.
    *   Regular audits of role assignments within CockroachDB are not consistently performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Enforce TLS Encryption for All Communication](./mitigation_strategies/2__enforce_tls_encryption_for_all_communication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce TLS Encryption for All Communication

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable TLS on CockroachDB Cluster:** Configure CockroachDB to use TLS for inter-node communication during cluster setup. This typically involves generating and distributing certificates to each node using CockroachDB's certificate management tools (`cockroach cert`).
    2.  **Enable TLS for Client Connections:** Configure CockroachDB to require TLS for all client connections. This is usually done by setting command-line flags (`--certs-dir`) or configuration parameters when starting CockroachDB.
    3.  **Client-Side Configuration:** Ensure your application and any other clients connecting to CockroachDB are configured to use TLS and are provided with the necessary certificates generated by CockroachDB's tools to authenticate with the database.
    4.  **Force TLS Only:** Disable non-TLS ports in CockroachDB configuration to strictly enforce TLS for all communication. This can be done by only exposing the TLS port (`26257` by default) and not the insecure port (`26258`).
    5.  **Regular Certificate Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating TLS certificates for both the CockroachDB cluster and clients to minimize the impact of compromised certificates. Utilize CockroachDB's certificate tools for rotation.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Without CockroachDB TLS, network traffic between clients and CockroachDB, and within the cluster, is vulnerable to eavesdropping, exposing sensitive data in transit to and from CockroachDB.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):**  Lack of CockroachDB TLS allows attackers to intercept and potentially modify communication between clients and CockroachDB, or between nodes in the CockroachDB cluster.
    *   **Data Injection/Tampering (High Severity):** MITM attacks enabled by lack of CockroachDB TLS can lead to data injection or tampering during transmission to or from CockroachDB.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Eavesdropping:** **Significant** reduction in risk. CockroachDB TLS encrypts data in transit, making it unreadable to eavesdroppers targeting CockroachDB communication.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** **Significant** reduction in risk. CockroachDB TLS provides authentication and encryption, making MITM attacks against CockroachDB significantly harder to execute successfully.
    *   **Data Injection/Tampering:** **Significant** reduction in risk. CockroachDB TLS provides integrity checks, making data tampering detectable in CockroachDB communication.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   TLS is enabled for client-server communication with CockroachDB. Application connects to CockroachDB using TLS.
    *   TLS is enabled for inter-node communication within the CockroachDB cluster.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Certificate rotation for CockroachDB certificates is currently a manual process. Need to automate certificate rotation for both client and cluster certificates using CockroachDB's tools or external automation.
    *   Enforcement of TLS-only connections to CockroachDB is not explicitly configured. Need to verify and enforce disabling non-TLS ports in CockroachDB configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Securely Manage and Rotate Certificates and Keys](./mitigation_strategies/3__securely_manage_and_rotate_certificates_and_keys.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Securely Manage and Rotate Certificates and Keys (CockroachDB Specific)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Centralized Key Management (for CockroachDB):** Use a dedicated key management system (KMS) or Hardware Security Module (HSM) to generate, store, and manage CockroachDB TLS certificates and private keys, especially in production. While CockroachDB can manage certificates via files, KMS/HSM provides enhanced security.
    2.  **Automated Certificate Generation (CockroachDB):** Automate the process of generating and signing CockroachDB certificates using tools like `cfssl`, `step-ca`, or cloud provider KMS services, integrating with CockroachDB's certificate requirements.
    3.  **Secure Storage (CockroachDB Keys):** Store CockroachDB private keys securely. Avoid storing them directly in code repositories or on application servers. Use encrypted storage or KMS/HSM. CockroachDB can read certificates from files, ensure these files are securely stored.
    4.  **Regular Rotation Schedule (CockroachDB Certificates):** Establish a regular schedule for rotating CockroachDB TLS certificates (e.g., every year, or more frequently for sensitive environments).
    5.  **Automated Rotation Process (CockroachDB):** Automate the CockroachDB certificate rotation process to minimize downtime and human error. This can involve scripts or tools that automatically generate new certificates, distribute them to CockroachDB nodes and clients, and trigger a rolling restart of the CockroachDB cluster.
    6.  **Revocation Procedures (CockroachDB Certificates):** Have a clear procedure for revoking compromised CockroachDB certificates and distributing revocation lists (CRLs) or using Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) if supported by your certificate authority and CockroachDB setup.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised CockroachDB Certificates/Keys (High Severity):** If CockroachDB certificates or private keys are compromised, attackers can impersonate CockroachDB servers, decrypt CockroachDB communication, and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **Expired CockroachDB Certificates (Medium Severity):** Expired CockroachDB certificates can lead to service disruptions and application downtime when connecting to CockroachDB.
    *   **CockroachDB Key Exposure (High Severity):**  Improper CockroachDB key management can lead to exposure of private keys, allowing attackers to decrypt past and future CockroachDB communications.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised CockroachDB Certificates/Keys:** **Significant** reduction in risk. Secure management and rotation of CockroachDB certificates limits the window of opportunity for attackers if a key is compromised.
    *   **Expired CockroachDB Certificates:** **Significant** reduction in risk. Regular rotation prevents service disruptions due to expired CockroachDB certificates.
    *   **CockroachDB Key Exposure:** **Significant** reduction in risk. Secure storage and management of CockroachDB keys minimizes the risk of key exposure.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   CockroachDB certificates are generated using `cockroach cert create-ca` and `cockroach cert create-client`.
    *   CockroachDB certificates are stored on the server file system, protected by file system permissions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Centralized KMS/HSM is not used for CockroachDB key management.
    *   CockroachDB certificate generation and rotation are manual processes. Automation is needed.
    *   No formal CockroachDB certificate revocation procedure is in place.
    *   Secure storage of CockroachDB private keys needs improvement. Consider using encrypted storage or a KMS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Leverage Audit Logging and Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/4__leverage_audit_logging_and_monitoring.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Leverage CockroachDB Audit Logging and Monitoring

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Audit Logging in CockroachDB:** Enable CockroachDB's audit logging feature using `sql audit` commands or cluster settings. Configure it to log relevant events such as authentication attempts, data access, schema changes, and administrative actions within CockroachDB.
    2.  **Configure Log Destinations for CockroachDB:** Configure CockroachDB audit logs to be written to secure and reliable destinations, such as dedicated log servers, SIEM systems, or cloud logging services. CockroachDB can log to files or cloud storage.
    3.  **Integrate with SIEM:** Integrate CockroachDB audit logs with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for real-time monitoring, alerting, and correlation with other security events related to CockroachDB activity.
    4.  **Define Alerting Rules:** Set up alerts in the SIEM system to detect suspicious activities in CockroachDB audit logs, such as failed login attempts to CockroachDB, unauthorized data access within CockroachDB, or unusual administrative actions in CockroachDB.
    5.  **Regular Log Review:**  Establish a process for regularly reviewing CockroachDB audit logs to identify potential security incidents, policy violations, and performance issues within CockroachDB.
    6.  **Log Retention Policy:** Define and implement a log retention policy for CockroachDB audit logs that complies with regulatory requirements and organizational security policies.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Security Breaches (High Severity):** CockroachDB audit logs provide evidence of security breaches within the database, helping in incident detection, response, and forensic analysis related to CockroachDB.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** CockroachDB audit logs can detect and deter malicious activities by insiders within the database.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium Severity):** CockroachDB audit logs are often required for compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS related to database access and modifications.
    *   **Operational Issues (Low Severity):** CockroachDB audit logs can help diagnose operational problems and performance bottlenecks within the database.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Security Breaches:** **Significant** impact on detection and response for database related breaches. CockroachDB audit logs are crucial for understanding the scope and impact of breaches within the database.
    *   **Insider Threats:** **Moderate** impact. CockroachDB audit logs can deter and detect insider threats within the database, but may not prevent all insider actions.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** **Significant** impact. CockroachDB audit logs are often a key requirement for demonstrating compliance related to database operations.
    *   **Operational Issues:** **Moderate** impact. CockroachDB audit logs can provide valuable insights into operational issues within the database.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic audit logging is enabled in CockroachDB, logging to files on the server.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Integration of CockroachDB audit logs with a SIEM system is missing. Logs are not centrally collected or analyzed.
    *   Alerting rules for suspicious activities in CockroachDB logs are not configured.
    *   Regular log review process for CockroachDB logs is not formally established.
    *   Log retention policy for CockroachDB audit logs needs to be defined and implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [5. Secure Backup and Restore Procedures](./mitigation_strategies/5__secure_backup_and_restore_procedures.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure CockroachDB Backup and Restore Procedures

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Backup Encryption in CockroachDB:** Configure CockroachDB backups to be encrypted at rest using encryption keys managed securely (ideally with KMS/HSM). CockroachDB supports backup encryption using `ENCRYPTION` option in `BACKUP` command.
    2.  **Secure Backup Storage:** Store CockroachDB backups in a secure storage location with access controls. Use cloud storage services with encryption and access management features, or dedicated secure backup servers. Ensure the storage location is secured independently of CockroachDB.
    3.  **Access Control for CockroachDB Backups:** Restrict access to CockroachDB backup storage and backup management tools to only authorized personnel. Implement RBAC for CockroachDB backup operations, potentially using CockroachDB's RBAC to control who can initiate backups.
    4.  **Regular Backup Testing:** Regularly test CockroachDB backup and restore procedures to ensure backups are valid, restorable into CockroachDB, and meet recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs) for the database. Use `RESTORE` command for testing.
    5.  **Offsite Backups:** Store CockroachDB backups offsite or in a geographically separate location to protect against site-wide disasters affecting the CockroachDB cluster location.
    6.  **Backup Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of CockroachDB backups to ensure they haven't been corrupted or tampered with. CockroachDB's `RESTORE` process includes integrity checks, but consider additional verification steps.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Loss from Disaster (High Severity):** Secure CockroachDB backups are essential for recovering from data loss in CockroachDB due to hardware failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events affecting the database.
    *   **Data Breach via Backup Exposure (High Severity):** Unsecured CockroachDB backups can be a target for attackers to gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** CockroachDB backup integrity checks help detect and prevent data corruption issues in backups.
    *   **Unauthorized Backup Access (Medium Severity):**  Lack of access control can allow unauthorized individuals to access or manipulate CockroachDB backups.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Loss from Disaster:** **Significant** reduction in risk of database data loss. CockroachDB backups are the primary mechanism for database data recovery.
    *   **Data Breach via Backup Exposure:** **Significant** reduction in risk of database data breach. Encryption and access control protect CockroachDB backups from unauthorized access.
    *   **Data Corruption:** **Moderate** reduction in risk. Integrity checks help detect corruption in CockroachDB backups, but may not prevent it entirely.
    *   **Unauthorized Backup Access:** **Significant** reduction in risk. Access control limits who can access CockroachDB backups.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Regular CockroachDB backups are performed using `cockroach dump` and stored in cloud storage.
    *   Basic access controls are in place for cloud storage.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CockroachDB backup encryption is not enabled. Backups are stored unencrypted.
    *   Formal CockroachDB backup testing and restore procedures are not regularly performed.
    *   Offsite CockroachDB backups are not explicitly configured (relying on cloud storage redundancy).
    *   Backup integrity checks beyond CockroachDB's built-in checks are not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [6. Regularly Update CockroachDB and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/6__regularly_update_cockroachdb_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update CockroachDB

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish CockroachDB Patch Management Process:** Create a process for regularly monitoring CockroachDB release notes and security advisories for updates and patches specific to CockroachDB.
    2.  **Test Updates in Non-Production:** Before applying CockroachDB updates to production, thoroughly test them in a non-production CockroachDB environment (staging, testing) to identify and resolve any compatibility issues or regressions with your application and CockroachDB.
    3.  **Automated Update Deployment:**  Automate the deployment of CockroachDB updates to CockroachDB clusters to ensure timely patching and reduce manual effort. Use CockroachDB's rolling updates feature to minimize downtime during updates.
    4.  **Dependency Management (CockroachDB Context):** Keep track of CockroachDB dependencies (operating system, libraries, etc. on CockroachDB nodes) and ensure they are also regularly updated with security patches.
    5.  **Vulnerability Scanning (CockroachDB):** Regularly scan CockroachDB instances and underlying infrastructure for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools, focusing on vulnerabilities relevant to CockroachDB and its environment.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known CockroachDB Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated CockroachDB software is vulnerable to known exploits that attackers can leverage to compromise the database system.
    *   **Zero-Day Attacks (Medium Severity):** While CockroachDB updates primarily address known vulnerabilities, staying up-to-date can sometimes mitigate the impact of zero-day attacks by having the latest security features and general hardening in CockroachDB.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known CockroachDB Vulnerabilities:** **Significant** reduction in risk. Patching known CockroachDB vulnerabilities is a critical security measure for the database.
    *   **Zero-Day Attacks:** **Minor** reduction in risk. CockroachDB updates are not a direct defense against zero-day attacks, but a generally secure and updated CockroachDB system is more resilient.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   CockroachDB is updated manually when new versions are released, but not on a strict schedule.
    *   Testing of CockroachDB updates is performed in a staging environment before production deployment.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated CockroachDB update deployment process is not in place. Updates are applied manually.
    *   Formal CockroachDB patch management process and schedule are not defined.
    *   Vulnerability scanning of CockroachDB instances is not regularly performed.
    *   Dependency management and updates for CockroachDB nodes are not systematically tracked.

## Mitigation Strategy: [7. Implement Resource Limits and Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/7__implement_resource_limits_and_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement CockroachDB Resource Limits and Rate Limiting

*   **Description:**
    1.  **CockroachDB Resource Governance:** Utilize CockroachDB's resource governance features (e.g., admission control, query limits, session variables, workload tagging) to limit resource consumption by individual queries and users within CockroachDB.
    2.  **Application-Level Rate Limiting (Database Context):** Implement rate limiting in your application code to control the number of requests sent to CockroachDB from specific users or sources, preventing overload on the database.
    3.  **Connection Limits in CockroachDB:** Configure connection limits in CockroachDB using cluster settings to prevent excessive connections from overwhelming the database.
    4.  **Monitoring CockroachDB Resource Utilization:** Monitor CockroachDB resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, query latency, SQL memory pool) using CockroachDB's monitoring dashboards or Prometheus integration to detect and respond to potential resource exhaustion attacks or performance issues within the database.
    5.  **Alerting on Resource Thresholds (CockroachDB):** Set up alerts to trigger when CockroachDB resource utilization exceeds predefined thresholds, indicating potential problems within the database.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity):** Resource exhaustion attacks can overwhelm CockroachDB, making the database unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Resource Starvation (Medium Severity):**  Uncontrolled resource consumption by one user or application component can starve CockroachDB resources from other users or components, impacting database performance.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):**  Excessive resource usage can lead to overall performance degradation of the CockroachDB cluster.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** **Moderate** reduction in risk of database DoS. CockroachDB resource limits and rate limiting can mitigate some DoS attacks targeting the database, but may not prevent all sophisticated attacks.
    *   **Resource Starvation:** **Significant** reduction in risk of database resource starvation. CockroachDB resource governance directly addresses resource starvation issues within the database.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** **Significant** reduction in risk of database performance degradation. CockroachDB resource limits help maintain stable database performance by preventing resource over-utilization.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic connection limits are configured in CockroachDB.
    *   Application-level rate limiting is partially implemented for some API endpoints accessing CockroachDB.
    *   CockroachDB resource utilization metrics are monitored, but alerting is not fully configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CockroachDB resource governance features (query limits, admission control, workload tagging) are not fully utilized.
    *   More comprehensive application-level rate limiting is needed across all critical API endpoints interacting with CockroachDB.
    *   Alerting on CockroachDB resource utilization thresholds needs to be fully configured and integrated with monitoring systems.
