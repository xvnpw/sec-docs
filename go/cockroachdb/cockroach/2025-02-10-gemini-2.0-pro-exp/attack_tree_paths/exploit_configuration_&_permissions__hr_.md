## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Configuration & Permissions

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the attack path "Exploit Configuration & Permissions -> Insecure Defaults -> Weak/Default Passwords & Overly Permissive Roles" within a CockroachDB deployment.  This analysis aims to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their exploitability, determine potential impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies beyond the high-level descriptions provided in the original attack tree.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to harden the application's security posture against this specific attack vector.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following aspects of a CockroachDB deployment:

*   **Authentication:**  Specifically, vulnerabilities related to weak or default passwords for SQL users (including the `root` user).
*   **Authorization:**  Specifically, vulnerabilities related to overly permissive roles and privileges granted to SQL users.
*   **CockroachDB Configuration:**  How default settings or misconfigurations related to authentication and authorization can be exploited.
*   **Impact on Application Data:**  The potential consequences of successful exploitation, including data breaches, data modification, and denial of service.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Network-level attacks (e.g., MITM, DDoS).
*   Vulnerabilities in the application code itself (e.g., SQL injection, XSS), *except* where they directly interact with CockroachDB's authentication/authorization mechanisms.
*   Physical security of the database servers.
*   Operating system vulnerabilities.
*   Other branches of the attack tree.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Identify specific, actionable vulnerabilities related to weak passwords and overly permissive roles within the context of CockroachDB. This will involve researching CockroachDB's documentation, security best practices, and known common misconfigurations.
2.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  Create realistic scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could exploit each identified vulnerability.  This will include specific commands, tools, and techniques.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Quantify the potential impact of each exploit scenario, considering data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  This will go beyond the "High to Very High" assessment in the original tree and provide more specific examples.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendation Refinement:**  Expand on the provided mitigations, offering detailed, practical steps and configurations that the development team can implement. This will include specific CockroachDB commands and configuration options.
5.  **Detection Strategy:**  Outline how to detect attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities, including specific logging and monitoring configurations.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1. Weak/Default Passwords [HR][CN]

**4.1.1. Vulnerability Identification:**

*   **Default `root` Password:**  Historically, CockroachDB did *not* require a password for the `root` user by default in insecure mode.  While newer versions enforce password setup during initialization, older deployments or misconfigured setups might still have a blank or easily guessable `root` password.  Even in secure mode, an attacker might guess a weak password set during initialization.
*   **Weak Application User Passwords:**  Application-specific SQL users might be created with weak passwords (e.g., "password123", "admin", the application name).  Developers might prioritize ease of use during development and forget to change these passwords before deployment.
*   **Password Reuse:**  The same password might be used for multiple SQL users, or the CockroachDB password might be reused from other services, increasing the risk of compromise.
*   **Lack of Password Complexity Enforcement:**  CockroachDB might not be configured to enforce strong password policies (minimum length, character types, etc.).

**4.1.2. Exploit Scenario Development:**

*   **Scenario 1: Default `root` Access (Insecure Mode):**
    1.  Attacker scans for CockroachDB instances on the default port (26257).
    2.  Attacker attempts to connect using the `cockroach` CLI with the `root` user and no password:  `cockroach sql --url="postgresql://root@<target-ip>:26257?sslmode=disable"`
    3.  If successful, the attacker has full administrative access to the database.

*   **Scenario 2: Brute-Force Attack on Application User:**
    1.  Attacker identifies a valid username (e.g., through reconnaissance or error messages).
    2.  Attacker uses a tool like `hydra` or a custom script to perform a dictionary attack or brute-force attack against the CockroachDB instance, targeting the identified user: `hydra -l <username> -P <password_list> <target-ip> -s 26257 postgres`
    3.  If successful, the attacker gains access with the privileges of the compromised user.

*   **Scenario 3: Credential Stuffing:**
    1.  Attacker obtains a list of leaked credentials (username/password pairs) from a previous data breach.
    2.  Attacker uses a script to attempt to log in to the CockroachDB instance using these credentials, assuming password reuse.

**4.1.3. Impact Assessment:**

*   **`root` Compromise:**  Complete database takeover.  The attacker can read, modify, or delete *all* data, create new users, change configurations, and potentially even shut down the database.  This could lead to a complete data breach, data loss, and denial of service.  Reputational damage would be severe.
*   **Application User Compromise:**  The impact depends on the user's privileges.  If the user has read access to sensitive data, a data breach is likely.  If the user has write access, data modification or deletion is possible.  Even limited access could be used to disrupt the application's functionality.

**4.1.4. Mitigation Recommendation Refinement:**

*   **Mandatory Strong `root` Password:**  Ensure that the `root` user *always* has a strong, randomly generated password.  This should be enforced during initial cluster setup and cannot be bypassed.
*   **Password Policy Enforcement:**  Use CockroachDB's built-in password validation features (if available) or implement custom validation logic in the application to enforce:
    *   Minimum password length (e.g., 12 characters).
    *   Character complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
    *   Password history (prevent reuse of recent passwords).
    *   Regular password expiration (e.g., every 90 days).
*   **Password Hashing:**  CockroachDB uses secure password hashing (bcrypt) by default.  *Never* store passwords in plain text.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  While CockroachDB itself doesn't natively support MFA for SQL users, consider implementing MFA at the application layer or using a third-party authentication proxy that supports MFA for database connections.
*   **Connection Security:**  Always use TLS encryption (`sslmode=verify-full`) for all connections to CockroachDB to prevent eavesdropping on credentials.
* **Disable Insecure Mode:** Never run CockroachDB in insecure mode (`--insecure`) in a production environment.

**4.1.5. Detection Strategy:**

*   **Failed Login Attempts:**  Monitor CockroachDB logs for failed login attempts.  Configure alerting for a high number of failed attempts from a single IP address or targeting a specific user, which could indicate a brute-force or dictionary attack.  CockroachDB logs these events to the `cockroach.log` file (or a configured logging sink).
*   **Successful Logins from Unusual Locations:**  Monitor for successful logins from unexpected IP addresses or geographic locations.
*   **Audit Logs:**  Enable CockroachDB's audit logging feature (if available) to track all SQL commands executed, including authentication attempts.

#### 4.2. Overly Permissive Roles [HR]

**4.2.1. Vulnerability Identification:**

*   **Default `admin` Role Abuse:**  Granting the `admin` role to application users instead of creating more granular roles.  The `admin` role has extensive privileges, making any compromised account a high-value target.
*   **Lack of Least Privilege:**  Users are granted permissions that are not strictly necessary for their tasks.  For example, a user who only needs to read data from a specific table might be granted `SELECT` access to the entire database.
*   **Unnecessary `GRANT OPTION`:**  Users might be granted the `GRANT OPTION`, allowing them to grant their own privileges to other users, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
*   **No Role Hierarchy:**  Not utilizing CockroachDB's role-based access control (RBAC) system effectively.  A well-defined role hierarchy can simplify permission management and reduce the risk of over-provisioning.

**4.2.2. Exploit Scenario Development:**

*   **Scenario 1: `admin` Role Exploitation:**
    1.  Attacker compromises an application user account that has been granted the `admin` role (e.g., through a weak password, as described above).
    2.  The attacker now has full control over the database, similar to compromising the `root` user.

*   **Scenario 2: Privilege Escalation via `GRANT OPTION`:**
    1.  Attacker compromises a user account with limited privileges but also the `GRANT OPTION`.
    2.  The attacker uses the `GRANT` statement to grant themselves additional privileges, potentially escalating to `admin` level access.  Example: `GRANT ALL ON DATABASE mydatabase TO compromised_user;`

*   **Scenario 3: Data Exfiltration due to Excessive Read Permissions:**
    1.  Attacker compromises a user account that has `SELECT` access to more tables than necessary.
    2.  The attacker uses `SELECT` statements to read data from tables they should not have access to, leading to a data breach.

**4.2.3. Impact Assessment:**

*   **`admin` Role Compromise:**  Identical to `root` user compromise – complete database takeover.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  The attacker can gradually increase their privileges, potentially reaching `admin` level access and causing significant damage.
*   **Data Breach:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data due to overly broad read permissions.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Unauthorized modification or deletion of data due to overly broad write permissions.

**4.2.4. Mitigation Recommendation Refinement:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  This is the cornerstone of secure authorization.  Grant *only* the minimum necessary privileges to each user and role.
*   **Custom Roles:**  Create specific roles for each application or user type.  For example:
    *   `read_only_user`:  `SELECT` access to specific tables.
    *   `data_entry_user`:  `INSERT` and `UPDATE` access to specific tables.
    *   `reporting_user`:  `SELECT` access to a specific set of views (not the underlying tables).
*   **Avoid `GRANT OPTION`:**  Do *not* grant the `GRANT OPTION` to users unless absolutely necessary and carefully controlled.
*   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly review user roles and permissions to ensure they are still appropriate and that no unauthorized privileges have been granted.  Use SQL queries like `SHOW GRANTS;` and `SHOW ROLES;` to inspect the current configuration.
*   **Role Hierarchy:**  Use CockroachDB's role membership feature to create a hierarchy of roles.  For example, a `manager` role could inherit the permissions of an `employee` role, plus additional privileges.
*   **Row-Level Security (RLS):** If fine-grained access control is needed, consider using CockroachDB's Row-Level Security feature (if available) to restrict access to specific rows within a table based on user attributes.

**4.2.5. Detection Strategy:**

*   **Audit Logs:**  Enable audit logging to track all `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements, as well as any SQL queries that access sensitive data.  This allows you to detect unauthorized privilege changes and data access attempts.
*   **Regular Permission Reviews:**  Implement a process for regularly reviewing user roles and permissions, ideally automated through scripting.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Monitor for unusual database activity, such as a user accessing tables they don't normally access or executing queries that are outside their typical usage patterns.
