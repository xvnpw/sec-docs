# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cockroachdb/cockroach

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Partitioning and Node Failure Resilience](./mitigation_strategies/network_partitioning_and_node_failure_resilience.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** CockroachDB Cluster Topology and Configuration

**Description:**
1.  **`--locality` Flag:** Use the `--locality` flag when starting *each* CockroachDB node. Example: `cockroach start --locality=region=us-east1,zone=us-east1-a ...`. This is *fundamental* to CockroachDB's awareness of node placement.
2.  **Replication Factor (Cluster-Wide):** Configure the default replication factor during cluster initialization or adjust it later using: `ALTER RANGE default CONFIGURE ZONE USING num_replicas = 3;` (or 5). This sets the *default* for the entire cluster.
3.  **Lease Management (Monitoring):** Use `SHOW TRACE FOR SESSION` to debug and understand lease behavior, particularly if you suspect issues. Monitor lease acquisition times and potential leaseholder problems via CockroachDB's built-in metrics (exposed via HTTP endpoint).
4. **Clock Synchronization (Verification):** While NTP is the *mechanism*, CockroachDB provides metrics to *verify* its effectiveness. Monitor clock skew using CockroachDB's built-in metrics (e.g., `sys.clock-offset.meannanos`).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Node Failure (High Severity):** Correct `--locality` and replication factor ensure data redundancy.
*   **Network Partition (High Severity):** `--locality` helps CockroachDB make intelligent decisions about replica placement to survive partitions.
*   **Split-Brain Scenario (Critical Severity):** CockroachDB's internal consensus mechanisms (using Raft), combined with proper replication, prevent this.
*   **Clock Skew Issues (High Severity):** Monitoring CockroachDB's clock offset metrics helps identify and address synchronization problems that could affect consistency.

**Impact:**
*   **Node Failure:** Risk significantly reduced; cluster operation continues if a majority of replicas are available.
*   **Network Partition:** Risk significantly reduced; the majority partition continues to operate.
*   **Split-Brain Scenario:** Risk effectively eliminated by CockroachDB's design, *provided* the cluster is configured correctly.
*   **Clock Skew Issues:** Risk mitigated by proactive monitoring and addressing any significant deviations.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `--locality` Flag: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Used with region and zone"* ]
*   Replication Factor: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Set to 3"* ]
*   Lease Management (Monitoring): [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Not actively monitored"* ]
*   Clock Synchronization (Verification): [*Placeholder: e.g., "Not actively monitored"*]

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Lease Management (Monitoring): [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Add monitoring for lease-related metrics"* ]
*   Clock Synchronization (Verification): [*Placeholder: e.g., "Add monitoring for clock offset metrics"*]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Locality and Geo-Distribution Optimization](./mitigation_strategies/data_locality_and_geo-distribution_optimization.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** CockroachDB Zone Configurations and Geo-Partitioning

**Description:**
1.  **`--locality` (Again - Critical):** Reinforces the importance of this flag for *all* locality-related features.
2.  **`ALTER ... CONFIGURE ZONE`:** Use this command extensively to control data placement. Examples:
    *   `ALTER TABLE users CONFIGURE ZONE USING constraints = '{'+region=us-east': 1}';`
    *   `ALTER DATABASE my_db CONFIGURE ZONE USING num_replicas = 3, constraints = '{'+region=us-west': 1, '+region=us-east': 2}';`
3.  **Geo-Partitioning (if required):** Use `PARTITION BY LIST` or `PARTITION BY RANGE` in your `CREATE TABLE` statements, *in conjunction with* `ALTER TABLE ... CONFIGURE ZONE` on the partitions. This is a *CockroachDB-specific* schema design technique.
4.  **`AS OF SYSTEM TIME` (Follower Reads):** Use this clause in your SQL queries to enable follower reads (if eventual consistency is acceptable). Example: `SELECT * FROM my_table AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10s';` This is a *direct* CockroachDB SQL feature.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **High Query Latency (Medium Severity):** Zone configurations and follower reads direct queries to closer replicas.
*   **Data Residency Violations (Critical Severity):** Geo-partitioning, controlled by `CONFIGURE ZONE`, ensures compliance.

**Impact:**
*   **High Query Latency:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Data Residency Violations:** Risk eliminated with correct geo-partitioning setup.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `--locality`: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Consistently used"* ]
*   `ALTER ... CONFIGURE ZONE`: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Partially implemented for some tables"* ]
*   Geo-Partitioning: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Not implemented"* ]
*   `AS OF SYSTEM TIME`: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Not used"* ]

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `ALTER ... CONFIGURE ZONE`: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Need comprehensive zone configurations for all tables"* ]
*   Geo-Partitioning: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Evaluate and implement if required by regulations"* ]
*   `AS OF SYSTEM TIME`: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Implement for appropriate read queries"* ]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Cluster Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_cluster_configuration.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** CockroachDB Certificate Management and RBAC

**Description:**
1.  **Certificate Generation:** Use `cockroach cert create-ca`, `cockroach cert create-node`, and `cockroach cert create-client` to generate the necessary TLS certificates. This is *specific* to CockroachDB's secure setup.
2.  **`--certs-dir`:** Start CockroachDB nodes with the `--certs-dir` flag, pointing to the directory containing the certificates. This is *essential* for secure communication.
3.  **RBAC (SQL Commands):** Use CockroachDB's SQL commands for role-based access control:
    *   `CREATE ROLE`
    *   `GRANT <privileges> ON <database/table> TO <role>`
    *   `GRANT <role> TO <user>`
    *   `SHOW GRANTS` (to verify permissions)
4.  **`--enterprise-encryption` (Encryption at Rest):** Use this flag when starting CockroachDB nodes to enable encryption at rest (requires an enterprise license). This is a *CockroachDB-specific* feature.
5. **`--log` (Audit Logging):** Use the `--log` flag with the `sql_audit` channel to enable audit logging. Example: `cockroach start --log='{sinks: {file-groups: {default: {channels: [sql_audit]}}}}'`. This is a *CockroachDB-specific* configuration.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (Critical Severity):** RBAC (using CockroachDB's SQL commands) prevents this.
*   **Data Breach (Critical Severity):** `--enterprise-encryption` protects data at rest. Certificates and `--certs-dir` ensure TLS encryption for data in transit.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** TLS encryption (via certificates) prevents this.
*   **Insider Threats (High Severity):** RBAC limits damage; `--log` with `sql_audit` provides audit trails.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Data Breach:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk eliminated with proper TLS setup.
*   **Insider Threats:** Risk reduced and auditability improved.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Certificate Generation: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Certificates generated"* ]
*   `--certs-dir`: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Used on all nodes"* ]
*   RBAC (SQL Commands): [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Basic roles defined"* ]
*   `--enterprise-encryption`: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Not implemented"* ]
*   `--log` (Audit Logging): [*Placeholder: e.g., "Not implemented"]

**Missing Implementation:**
*   RBAC (SQL Commands): [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Need more granular roles"* ]
*   `--enterprise-encryption`: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Evaluate and implement if required"* ]
*    `--log` (Audit Logging): [*Placeholder: e.g., "Implement and configure"*]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Operational Best Practices (CockroachDB-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/operational_best_practices__cockroachdb-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** CockroachDB Backup, Restore, and Schema Change Tools

**Description:**
1.  **Backup:** Use `cockroach dump` (for logical backups) or `BACKUP` (for cluster-level backups). These are *CockroachDB-specific* commands.
2.  **Restore:** Use `cockroach sql` (with the output of `cockroach dump`) or `RESTORE`. Again, these are *CockroachDB-specific* commands.
3.  **Schema Changes (Online):** Leverage CockroachDB's *built-in* support for online schema changes whenever possible. This is a key feature of CockroachDB.
4. **Upgrades (Rolling):** Follow CockroachDB's documented procedures for rolling upgrades, which are *specific* to its distributed architecture.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Loss (Critical Severity):** `cockroach dump` and `BACKUP` provide the means for recovery.
*   **Downtime (High Severity):** CockroachDB's online schema changes and rolling upgrade capabilities minimize downtime.
*   **Data Corruption (Critical Severity):** Careful use of CockroachDB's schema change mechanisms reduces this risk.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Loss:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Downtime:** Risk reduced.
*   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Backup: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Manual `cockroach dump` used"* ]
*   Restore: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Not regularly tested"* ]
*   Schema Changes (Online): [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Awareness of online changes, but not consistently utilized"* ]
*   Upgrades (Rolling): [*Placeholder: e.g., "Ad-hoc upgrades"*]

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Backup: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Automate and test regularly"* ]
*   Restore: [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Regularly test restore procedures"* ]
*   Schema Changes (Online): [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Fully utilize online schema change capabilities"* ]
*    Upgrades (Rolling): [*Placeholder: e.g., "Formalize rolling upgrade process"*]
