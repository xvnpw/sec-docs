Okay, let's create a design document for CockroachDB, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database designed for consistency, scalability, and survivability.  It aims to provide a database solution that can handle high volumes of transactional data while remaining resilient to failures, even at the datacenter level.  It targets businesses that require strong data consistency and high availability, particularly those operating in cloud-native or geographically distributed environments.

Business Priorities:

*   Data Consistency:  Ensuring ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties for transactions is paramount.  This is a core differentiator from many NoSQL databases.
*   High Availability:  Minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous operation, even in the face of node or datacenter failures.
*   Scalability:  Ability to handle increasing workloads and data volumes by adding more nodes to the cluster.
*   Operational Simplicity:  Reducing the complexity of managing a distributed database.
*   Cloud-Native Compatibility:  Designed to work well in containerized and orchestrated environments (e.g., Kubernetes).
*   Geo-Distribution: Supporting deployments across multiple geographic regions for low latency and data locality.

Business Risks:

*   Data Loss or Corruption:  Any failure that compromises the integrity or availability of data is a critical risk.
*   Service Outage:  Extended periods of unavailability can lead to significant business disruption and financial losses.
*   Performance Degradation:  Slow query performance or high latency can negatively impact user experience and application functionality.
*   Security Breach:  Unauthorized access to data or control of the database could lead to data breaches, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.
*   Operational Complexity: Difficulty in managing, monitoring, and troubleshooting the distributed system could lead to errors and inefficiencies.
*   Cost Overruns: Inefficient resource utilization or unexpected scaling needs could lead to higher-than-anticipated infrastructure costs.

# SECURITY POSTURE

CockroachDB incorporates several built-in security features and supports secure deployment practices.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Network Encryption: TLS encryption for all inter-node communication and client-server communication. (Implemented in Go's `net/http` and `crypto/tls` packages, configured via command-line flags and environment variables).
*   security control: Authentication: Supports multiple authentication methods, including password-based authentication, certificate-based authentication, and integration with external identity providers (e.g., via GSSAPI). (Described in CockroachDB documentation and implemented in the `security` and `server` packages).
*   security control: Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user privileges and restrict access to specific databases, tables, and operations. (Implemented in the `sql` package and controlled via SQL commands like `GRANT` and `REVOKE`).
*   security control: Auditing: Logging of database events, including successful and failed login attempts, schema changes, and data modifications. (Implemented in the `util/log` package and configurable via command-line flags).
*   security control: Data at Rest Encryption: Encryption of data stored on disk. (Implemented using Go's `crypto` libraries and configurable via command-line flags).
*   security control: Input Validation: SQL parsing and query planning to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. (Implemented in the `sql` package).
*   security control: Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Cockroach Labs conducts regular security assessments. (Described in their security documentation).
*   security control: Secure Software Development Practices: Cockroach Labs follows secure coding guidelines and uses static analysis tools. (Inferred from their development process and public statements).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity of Distributed Systems: Managing a distributed database inherently involves complexities that can introduce potential security risks if not properly configured and monitored.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on Underlying Infrastructure: The security of CockroachDB ultimately depends on the security of the underlying infrastructure (e.g., network, operating system, hardware).
*   accepted risk: Potential for Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: Like any software, CockroachDB is susceptible to unknown vulnerabilities that could be exploited before patches are available.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Enhanced Network Segmentation: Implement stricter network policies to isolate CockroachDB nodes from other systems and limit network access to only necessary ports and protocols.
*   security control: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): Deploy IDPS to monitor network traffic and detect malicious activity.
*   security control: Regular Vulnerability Scanning: Conduct regular vulnerability scans of the CockroachDB deployment and underlying infrastructure.
*   security control: Key Management: Use a robust key management system to protect encryption keys.
*   security control: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for all administrative users.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support strong password policies.
    *   Provide options for certificate-based authentication.
    *   Integrate with existing enterprise identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory).
    *   Implement robust session management.

*   Authorization:
    *   Implement fine-grained access control using RBAC.
    *   Support the principle of least privilege.
    *   Allow for granular control over database objects and operations.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities through rigorous input validation and parameterized queries.
    *   Sanitize all user inputs to prevent other types of injection attacks.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms for data in transit and at rest.
    *   Protect encryption keys using a secure key management system.
    *   Regularly review and update cryptographic protocols and algorithms.

## BUILD

CockroachDB's build process is automated and incorporates several security measures. The process generally follows these steps:

1.  Development: Developers write code and submit pull requests to the GitHub repository.
2.  Code Review: Pull requests are reviewed by other developers for correctness, security, and style.
3.  Automated Build (CI): CockroachDB uses Buildkite as its CI system. When a pull request is created or updated, Buildkite automatically triggers a build.
4.  Static Analysis: The build process includes static analysis tools (e.g., linters, static analyzers for Go) to identify potential code quality and security issues.
5.  Unit Tests: Extensive unit tests are run to verify the correctness of individual components.
6.  Integration Tests: Integration tests are run to test the interaction between different components.
7.  Acceptance Tests: Acceptance tests are run to verify the overall functionality of the system.
8.  Artifact Creation: If all tests pass, the build process creates build artifacts, including binaries and container images.
9.  Artifact Storage: Build artifacts are stored in a secure repository.
10. Release Process: Cockroach Labs follows a defined release process to promote builds to different environments (e.g., testing, staging, production).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Online Transaction Processing (OLTP): CockroachDB is primarily designed for OLTP workloads, where data consistency and availability are critical.
*   Data Storage and Retrieval: The core function of the database is to store and retrieve data reliably and efficiently.
*   Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery: CockroachDB's distributed architecture is designed to support business continuity and disaster recovery.

Data Sensitivity:

The data stored in CockroachDB can vary in sensitivity depending on the specific application. It can range from:

*   Non-sensitive data: Publicly available information.
*   Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Names, addresses, email addresses, etc.
*   Protected Health Information (PHI): Medical records and other health-related data.
*   Financial Data: Credit card numbers, bank account details, transaction history.
*   Proprietary Business Data: Trade secrets, intellectual property, confidential business information.

CockroachDB itself does not inherently classify data sensitivity. It is the responsibility of the application and the database administrator to implement appropriate security controls based on the sensitivity of the data being stored.
