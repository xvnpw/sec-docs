# Threat Model Analysis for cockroachdb/cockroach

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via Misconfigured Network Topology](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_misconfigured_network_topology.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access via Misconfigured Network Topology

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfigured network topology (e.g., nodes exposed to public networks, incorrect firewall rules) to directly access CockroachDB nodes and bypass application-level security controls.  They might use network scanning tools to discover exposed nodes and then attempt to connect using default credentials or known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential data modification or deletion, complete database compromise.
    *   **Cockroach Component Affected:**  `kv` (Key-Value store, underlying storage engine), `rpc` (inter-node communication), Network Configuration (iptables, firewalld, cloud provider firewalls).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict network segmentation using firewalls and VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds).
        *   Use CockroachDB's `--locality` flag to control node placement and data replication.
        *   Regularly audit network configurations and firewall rules.
        *   Disable unnecessary network services on CockroachDB nodes.
        *   Use a VPN or other secure connection method for remote access to the cluster.

## Threat: [Data Loss Due to Insufficient Replication Factor](./threats/data_loss_due_to_insufficient_replication_factor.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Loss Due to Insufficient Replication Factor

    *   **Description:** If the replication factor is set too low (e.g., 1 or 2), and multiple nodes fail simultaneously or within a short period, data loss can occur.  An attacker might intentionally target multiple nodes to cause a denial-of-service and trigger data loss if the replication factor is insufficient.
    *   **Impact:** Permanent loss of data, application downtime, potential business disruption.
    *   **Cockroach Component Affected:** `kv` (Key-Value store), Replication Layer, Raft Consensus Protocol.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure a replication factor of at least 3 (higher for critical data).
        *   Monitor cluster health and node availability.
        *   Implement robust backup and recovery procedures (using CockroachDB's `BACKUP` and `RESTORE` commands).
        *   Test disaster recovery scenarios regularly.
        *   Distribute nodes across multiple availability zones or regions.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration from a Compromised Node](./threats/data_exfiltration_from_a_compromised_node.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Exfiltration from a Compromised Node

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains root access to a single CockroachDB node (e.g., through OS-level vulnerabilities, stolen SSH keys). They can then directly access the data stored on that node's disk, bypassing CockroachDB's access controls.
    *   **Impact:**  Leakage of sensitive data stored on the compromised node.
    *   **Cockroach Component Affected:** `storage` (local disk storage), `kv` (Key-Value store), Operating System.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong host-level security (intrusion detection/prevention, regular security patching, hardened OS configurations).
        *   Enable encryption at rest using CockroachDB's Enterprise features or OS-level encryption (e.g., LUKS).
        *   Implement robust access controls and monitoring on each node.
        *   Regularly audit system logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Use strong SSH key management practices.

## Threat: [Data Tampering via MitM Attack on Inter-Node Communication](./threats/data_tampering_via_mitm_attack_on_inter-node_communication.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering via MitM Attack on Inter-Node Communication

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between CockroachDB nodes. If TLS is not enabled or is improperly configured, the attacker can modify data in transit, leading to data corruption or injection of malicious data.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity violation, potential for application malfunction or compromise.
    *   **Cockroach Component Affected:** `rpc` (inter-node communication), Network Layer, TLS Configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS encryption for *all* inter-node communication using the `--certs-dir` flag.
        *   Use strong, unique certificates for each node.
        *   Regularly rotate certificates.
        *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
        *   Validate certificate chains properly.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Database Access via Weak Credentials](./threats/unauthorized_database_access_via_weak_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Database Access via Weak Credentials

    *   **Description:** An attacker uses brute-force or dictionary attacks to guess weak passwords for CockroachDB users, including the `root` user.  They then use these credentials to connect to the database and gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential data modification or deletion, complete database compromise.
    *   **Cockroach Component Affected:** `sql` (SQL layer), Authentication System (`security.user`), `server` (main server process).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Change default passwords immediately after installation.
        *   Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, rotation).
        *   Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible (requires external integration).
        *   Disable the `root` user for application access; create dedicated users with least privilege.
        *   Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Misconfigured Roles](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_misconfigured_roles.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via Misconfigured Roles

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a low-privilege CockroachDB user account.  Due to misconfigured roles and permissions, this user has access to more data or functionality than intended, allowing the attacker to escalate their privileges.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data or database operations beyond the intended scope.
    *   **Cockroach Component Affected:** `sql` (SQL layer), Authorization System (`security.authorization`), Role Management (`GRANT`, `REVOKE`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege: grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   Use CockroachDB's role-based access control (RBAC) features to define granular permissions.
        *   Regularly audit user roles and permissions.
        *   Avoid granting broad privileges like `ALL` or `ADMIN` to application users.
        *   Use specific roles for different application functions.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of complex or unoptimized queries to the CockroachDB cluster, consuming excessive CPU, memory, or disk I/O. This overwhelms the cluster, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:**  Application downtime, denial of service to legitimate users.
    *   **Cockroach Component Affected:** `sql` (SQL layer, query optimizer), `kv` (Key-Value store), `server` (resource management), `admission control` (if enabled).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and connection pooling at the application level.
        *   Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and set appropriate limits (using CockroachDB's monitoring tools and system metrics).
        *   Optimize database schema and queries for performance.  Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze query plans.
        *   Use CockroachDB's built-in overload protection mechanisms (admission control).
        *   Scale the cluster horizontally to handle increased load.
        *   Use circuit breakers in the application to prevent cascading failures.

## Threat: [Unpatched CockroachDB Vulnerabilities](./threats/unpatched_cockroachdb_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Unpatched CockroachDB Vulnerabilities

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an unpatched version of CockroachDB.  This could allow them to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from data leakage to complete system compromise.
    *   **Cockroach Component Affected:** Potentially any component, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for high-severity vulnerabilities), High (for medium-severity vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly monitor CockroachDB's release notes and security advisories.
        *   Apply security patches as soon as they are available.
        *   Test patches in a staging environment before applying them to production.
