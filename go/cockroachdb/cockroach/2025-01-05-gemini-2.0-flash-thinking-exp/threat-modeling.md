# Threat Model Analysis for cockroachdb/cockroach

## Threat: [Majority Node Compromise](./threats/majority_node_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of a majority of CockroachDB nodes within a cluster. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in **CockroachDB itself**, or by compromising credentials used to access the nodes. Once in control, the attacker can manipulate the Raft consensus to commit malicious transactions, alter data arbitrarily, or cause data loss. They might also halt the cluster by disrupting the consensus process.

**Impact:** Complete loss of data integrity, potential for arbitrary data manipulation, data loss, and denial of service affecting the entire application.

**Affected Component:** Raft consensus algorithm, inter-node communication layer, node authentication mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong node authentication (e.g., mutual TLS provided by CockroachDB), enforce strict access controls to the infrastructure, regularly patch **CockroachDB**, utilize intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), implement robust monitoring and alerting for unusual node behavior.

## Threat: [Network Partition Exploitation for Data Inconsistency](./threats/network_partition_exploitation_for_data_inconsistency.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a network partition that isolates a minority of CockroachDB nodes. While the majority partition remains consistent, the attacker might be able to write conflicting data to the isolated minority. When the partition heals, this could lead to data inconsistencies if not handled correctly by the application or if **CockroachDB's** reconciliation mechanisms are bypassed.

**Impact:** Data inconsistencies, potential for data corruption if conflicting writes are not properly resolved, application errors due to inconsistent data.

**Affected Component:**  Network communication layer (as managed by CockroachDB), Raft consensus algorithm (specifically its behavior during network partitions).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust network infrastructure to minimize the likelihood of partitions, monitor for network partitions, understand and configure **CockroachDB's** behavior during partitions (e.g., `kv.raft_log_unreachable_timeout`), design the application to handle potential data conflicts gracefully, consider using stricter quorum configurations (with availability trade-offs within CockroachDB).

## Threat: [Byzantine Fault Introduction via Malicious Node](./threats/byzantine_fault_introduction_via_malicious_node.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises a single CockroachDB node and uses it to introduce Byzantine faults. This means the compromised node behaves arbitrarily and maliciously, potentially sending incorrect or conflicting information to other nodes during the consensus process. This can disrupt the consensus, leading to data inconsistencies or denial of service.

**Impact:** Data corruption, potential denial of service if the faulty node disrupts consensus, difficulty in diagnosing the root cause of issues.

**Affected Component:** Raft consensus algorithm, inter-node communication layer, potentially data storage mechanisms if the attacker manipulates data locally before replication within **CockroachDB**.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong node authentication and authorization within **CockroachDB**, regularly perform integrity checks of node binaries and configurations, implement robust monitoring for unusual node behavior and communication patterns, consider using techniques like verifiable computing if extremely high fault tolerance is required.

## Threat: [Exploiting CockroachDB-Specific SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_cockroachdb-specific_sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries that exploit specific parsing vulnerabilities or features unique to **CockroachDB's** SQL implementation. This could allow them to bypass authorization checks, access sensitive data, or even execute arbitrary code within the database context (though less likely in typical deployments).

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential for privilege escalation within the database.

**Affected Component:** SQL parsing and execution engine within **CockroachDB**.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions, implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side, adhere to the principle of least privilege for database users, regularly update **CockroachDB** to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass within CockroachDB's RBAC](./threats/authorization_bypass_within_cockroachdb's_rbac.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a flaw in **CockroachDB's** role-based access control (RBAC) system. This allows them to gain access to data or perform actions that they are not authorized for, potentially escalating their privileges within the database.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential for privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) module within **CockroachDB**.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**  Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions within **CockroachDB**, follow best practices for RBAC configuration (principle of least privilege), stay updated with **CockroachDB** security patches, consider using external authorization mechanisms if more complex access control is required.

## Threat: [Exposure of Data at Rest due to Misconfigured Encryption](./threats/exposure_of_data_at_rest_due_to_misconfigured_encryption.md)

**Description:** **CockroachDB** offers encryption at rest. If this feature is not properly configured or if the encryption keys are not managed securely, an attacker who gains access to the underlying storage (e.g., through a compromised server or storage system) can potentially decrypt and access sensitive data.

**Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** Storage engine, encryption at rest functionality within **CockroachDB**.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Enable and properly configure encryption at rest within **CockroachDB**, use strong encryption algorithms, manage encryption keys securely (consider using Hardware Security Modules - HSMs or key management services), regularly audit encryption configurations.

## Threat: [Key Management Vulnerabilities for Encryption](./threats/key_management_vulnerabilities_for_encryption.md)

**Description:** Weaknesses in the management of encryption keys used for data at rest or inter-node communication within **CockroachDB** can allow an attacker to compromise these keys. This could involve storing keys insecurely, using weak key derivation functions, or lacking proper access controls to the key storage.

**Impact:** Decryption of sensitive data, compromise of inter-node communication security.

**Affected Component:** Key management system (external or internal to **CockroachDB**), encryption modules within **CockroachDB**.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement secure key generation, storage, and rotation practices, use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or dedicated key management services, enforce strict access controls to encryption keys, regularly audit key management procedures.

## Threat: [Backup Vulnerabilities](./threats/backup_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Backups of the **CockroachDB** database contain sensitive data. If these backups are not adequately secured (e.g., lack encryption, weak access controls on backup storage *managed by CockroachDB's backup features*), an attacker who gains access to the backups can compromise the data.

**Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information from past states of the database.

**Affected Component:** Backup and restore functionality within **CockroachDB**.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Encrypt backups at rest (using **CockroachDB's** backup encryption features), control access to backup storage locations, regularly test backup restoration procedures, securely transfer backups if stored off-site.
