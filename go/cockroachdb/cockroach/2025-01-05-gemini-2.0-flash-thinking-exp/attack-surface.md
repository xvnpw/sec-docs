# Attack Surface Analysis for cockroachdb/cockroach

## Attack Surface: [SQL Interface Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/sql_interface_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of weaknesses in how CockroachDB parses and executes SQL queries received through the PostgreSQL wire protocol.
    *   **How CockroachDB Contributes:** CockroachDB implements the PostgreSQL wire protocol, and vulnerabilities in this implementation or in its specific SQL extensions could be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted SQL query could bypass authorization checks or trigger a buffer overflow in the query processing engine.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, denial of service, or potentially even remote code execution on the database server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements in application code to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Enforce strict input validation on data received from users before constructing SQL queries.
        *   Regularly update CockroachDB to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege for database users.
        *   Monitor database logs for suspicious query patterns.

## Attack Surface: [gRPC API Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/grpc_api_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:**  Abuse of the gRPC interface used for internal cluster communication and potentially exposed for external management tasks.
    *   **How CockroachDB Contributes:** CockroachDB heavily relies on gRPC for inter-node communication and exposes certain administrative functionalities through gRPC. Vulnerabilities in these services or their authentication mechanisms can be exploited.
    *   **Example:**  A malicious actor could exploit an unauthenticated or poorly authenticated gRPC endpoint to gain access to internal cluster state or trigger administrative actions.
    *   **Impact:** Cluster instability, data corruption, unauthorized access to sensitive cluster information, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution on cluster nodes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for all gRPC endpoints.
        *   Minimize the exposure of gRPC endpoints to external networks.
        *   Regularly audit and update gRPC dependencies.
        *   Implement rate limiting and input validation on gRPC requests.
        *   Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure inter-node communication.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Node Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-node_communication.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from insecure communication between the nodes within the CockroachDB cluster.
    *   **How CockroachDB Contributes:** CockroachDB relies on internal communication for replication, consensus, and other critical functions. If this communication is not properly secured, it becomes an attack vector.
    *   **Example:**  If inter-node communication is not encrypted, an attacker on the network could eavesdrop on sensitive data being replicated between nodes.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, cluster instability, or the ability for a compromised node to further compromise the cluster.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always enable TLS encryption for inter-node communication.
        *   Use strong certificates for node authentication.
        *   Restrict network access to the ports used for inter-node communication.
        *   Regularly rotate certificates used for inter-node communication.

## Attack Surface: [Backup and Restore Process Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/backup_and_restore_process_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Weaknesses in how CockroachDB handles backups and restores, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
    *   **How CockroachDB Contributes:** CockroachDB's specific backup and restore mechanisms can introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented securely.
    *   **Example:** Backups stored without encryption could be accessed by unauthorized individuals if the storage location is compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored in backups, potential data corruption during the restore process, or denial of service if backups are maliciously manipulated.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always encrypt backups using strong encryption algorithms.
        *   Secure the storage location of backups with appropriate access controls.
        *   Regularly test the backup and restore process to ensure its integrity.
        *   Consider using secure cloud storage options for backups with built-in encryption and access controls.
