## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authenticationauthorization_bypass.md)

**High-Risk Path: Authentication/Authorization Bypass**

* **Exploit Default Credentials (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attacker attempts to log in using commonly known default usernames and passwords.
    * This is possible if the application deployment process or initial setup inadvertently leaves default credentials active.
* **Exploit Authentication Vulnerability (e.g., CVE) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attacker leverages a known vulnerability in CockroachDB's authentication mechanism.
    * This could involve exploiting flaws in password hashing, session management, or other authentication processes.
    * Successful exploitation could grant the attacker access without valid credentials.
* **Exploit Weak Password Policy (if configurable) (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * If CockroachDB allows for configuring password policies and a weak policy is in place, attackers can more easily brute-force or guess passwords.
    * This increases the likelihood of gaining unauthorized access through password compromise.
* **Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Authentication Handshake (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attacker intercepts the communication between the client and the CockroachDB server during the authentication process.
    * By intercepting and potentially manipulating the handshake, the attacker could steal credentials or bypass authentication altogether.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known CockroachDB Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_cockroachdb_vulnerabilities.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Known CockroachDB Vulnerabilities**

* **Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attacker exploits a vulnerability in CockroachDB that allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the database.
    * This is a critical vulnerability as it grants the attacker complete control over the server and the data it holds.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inter-Node Communication Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inter-node_communication_vulnerabilities.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Inter-Node Communication Vulnerabilities**

* **Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Inter-Node Communication (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attacker intercepts communication between different nodes within the CockroachDB cluster.
    * By intercepting and potentially manipulating this traffic, the attacker could:
        * Steal sensitive data being exchanged between nodes.
        * Disrupt the consensus mechanism, leading to data inconsistencies or service disruption.
        * Potentially inject malicious data or commands into the cluster.
* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Raft Consensus Protocol Implementation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attacker exploits flaws in CockroachDB's implementation of the Raft consensus protocol.
    * This could allow the attacker to:
        * Disrupt the leader election process, causing the cluster to become unstable.
        * Manipulate the log replication process, leading to data inconsistencies or loss.
        * Potentially gain control over the cluster's decision-making process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Backup and Restore Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_backup_and_restore_mechanisms.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Backup and Restore Mechanisms**

* **Access Insecurely Stored Backups (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attacker gains unauthorized access to backup files of the CockroachDB database.
    * This is possible if backups are stored in a location with weak access controls, are not encrypted, or are stored on compromised infrastructure.
    * Access to backups allows the attacker to retrieve all the data stored in the database at the time of the backup.

## Attack Tree Path: [Indirect Application Compromise via CockroachDB Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/indirect_application_compromise_via_cockroachdb_manipulation.md)

**High-Risk Path: Indirect Application Compromise via CockroachDB Manipulation**

* **High-Risk Path: Data Manipulation leading to Application Logic Errors**
    * **Manipulate Data to Bypass Application-Level Security Checks (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Attacker modifies data within the CockroachDB database in a way that circumvents security checks implemented at the application level.
        * This could involve altering user roles, permissions, or other security-related data to gain unauthorized access or privileges within the application.
