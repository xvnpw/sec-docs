# Threat Model Analysis for cockroachdb/cockroach

## Threat: [Inter-node Communication Eavesdropping](./threats/inter-node_communication_eavesdropping.md)

Description: An attacker with network access intercepts unencrypted communication between CockroachDB nodes. They can use network sniffing tools to capture data packets and extract sensitive information like user data, queries, and internal cluster metadata transmitted within the cluster.
Impact: Loss of data confidentiality. Sensitive data transmitted within the cluster is exposed to the attacker, leading to data breaches and regulatory compliance violations.
CockroachDB Component Affected: Inter-node communication channels, Network layer.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Enable TLS encryption for inter-node communication.
- Use strong certificates and proper certificate management.
- Restrict network access to the CockroachDB cluster to authorized networks only.
- Implement network segmentation to isolate the CockroachDB cluster.

## Threat: [Backup and Restore Data Exposure](./threats/backup_and_restore_data_exposure.md)

Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to CockroachDB backups stored in insecure locations or intercepts backups during transfer. They can extract sensitive data from the backups.
Impact: Loss of data confidentiality. Sensitive data in backups is exposed, leading to data breaches and regulatory compliance violations.
CockroachDB Component Affected: Backup and Restore functionality, Storage layer, Backup storage locations.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Encrypt backups at rest and in transit.
- Store backups in secure locations with strong access controls.
- Implement secure backup and restore procedures with authentication and authorization.
- Consider using CockroachDB's built-in backup encryption features.

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Node Compromise and Replication Issues](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_node_compromise_and_replication_issues.md)

Description: An attacker compromises a CockroachDB node and exploits vulnerabilities in replication or consensus mechanisms. They inject malicious data or disrupt replication, leading to data corruption or inconsistencies across the cluster.
Impact: Loss of data integrity and potentially availability. Data corruption can lead to application malfunction, data loss, and business disruption.
CockroachDB Component Affected: Replication System, Consensus Algorithm (Raft), Node communication.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Harden CockroachDB nodes and operating systems.
- Implement strong node authentication and authorization.
- Regularly patch and update CockroachDB and underlying systems.
- Implement robust monitoring of cluster health and replication status.
- Regularly test backup and restore procedures to ensure data integrity.

## Threat: [Data Manipulation through SQL Injection (Integrity Impact)](./threats/data_manipulation_through_sql_injection__integrity_impact_.md)

Description: An attacker successfully executes SQL injection attacks to modify or delete data within the CockroachDB database. While SQL Injection is a general threat, it is listed here due to its direct impact on the CockroachDB data layer.
Impact: Loss of data integrity. Data is modified or deleted, leading to application malfunction, data loss, and business disruption.
CockroachDB Component Affected: SQL Parser, Query Execution Engine, Application interaction with CockroachDB.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions.
- Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side.
- Follow secure coding practices for SQL queries.
- Regularly perform security code reviews and penetration testing.
- Implement least privilege principles for database users.

## Threat: [Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) targeting CockroachDB Cluster](./threats/distributed_denial_of_service__ddos__targeting_cockroachdb_cluster.md)

Description: Attackers launch a DDoS attack against the CockroachDB cluster, overwhelming nodes and network infrastructure with malicious traffic, making the database unavailable to legitimate users. While DDoS is a general threat, targeting the distributed nature of CockroachDB is a specific concern.
Impact: Loss of availability. Database becomes unavailable, leading to application downtime and business disruption.
CockroachDB Component Affected: Network layer, Node resources (CPU, Memory, Network).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Implement DDoS mitigation techniques at the network and application levels (e.g., firewalls, rate limiting, traffic filtering).
- Configure rate limiting and connection limits within CockroachDB.
- Ensure sufficient resource provisioning for the cluster.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion on CockroachDB Nodes](./threats/resource_exhaustion_on_cockroachdb_nodes.md)

Description: Attackers exhaust resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network) on CockroachDB nodes through malicious queries or excessive load, leading to performance degradation and denial of service.
Impact: Loss of availability or degraded performance. Slow query response times, connection timeouts, and application downtime.
CockroachDB Component Affected: Node resources (CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network), Query Execution Engine.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Implement resource limits and quotas within CockroachDB.
- Monitor resource utilization on nodes and set up alerts.
- Implement query optimization and rate limiting.

## Threat: [Weak CockroachDB User Authentication](./threats/weak_cockroachdb_user_authentication.md)

Description: Attackers exploit weak passwords, default credentials, or insecure authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to CockroachDB.
Impact: Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Unauthorized access can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
CockroachDB Component Affected: Authentication System, User Management.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Enforce strong password policies.
- Disable or change default credentials.
- Utilize secure authentication mechanisms (password hashing, external authentication providers).

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass and Privilege Escalation within CockroachDB](./threats/authorization_bypass_and_privilege_escalation_within_cockroachdb.md)

Description: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in CockroachDB's RBAC or authorization logic to bypass authorization checks or escalate their privileges, gaining unauthorized access to data or administrative functions.
Impact: Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Unauthorized access and control over the database.
CockroachDB Component Affected: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Authorization System.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Regularly update CockroachDB to the latest versions.
- Thoroughly test and validate authorization configurations.
- Follow least privilege principles when assigning roles.

## Threat: [Failure to Apply Security Patches and Updates](./threats/failure_to_apply_security_patches_and_updates.md)

Description: Not applying security patches leaves CockroachDB vulnerable to known security vulnerabilities, which attackers can exploit.
Impact: Vulnerability to known exploits, potentially leading to loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, depending on the exploited vulnerability.
CockroachDB Component Affected: All CockroachDB components, Software Update process.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies: 
- Establish a robust patch management process.
- Regularly monitor for security advisories and release notes.
- Test and apply security patches promptly.
