**Description:**

*   **SQL Client (psql, Application):** Represents any application, tool, or user interface that interacts with CockroachDB using a standard SQL driver (e.g., JDBC, Go, Python).
*   **SQL Gateway Node (Any Node):**  Any CockroachDB node can act as a SQL gateway. It serves as the entry point for client connections, handling SQL parsing, query planning, optimization, and routing queries to the appropriate data ranges. This distributed gateway architecture enhances availability and scalability.
*   **Range Replicas (Node 1, 2, 3):** CockroachDB divides data into logical units called "ranges." Each range is replicated across multiple nodes (typically 3 or 5) for fault tolerance and high availability. These replicas participate in the Raft consensus protocol to ensure data consistency and durability.
*   **RocksDB Instance (Node 1, 2, 3):** Each CockroachDB node utilizes a local instance of RocksDB, a high-performance embedded key-value store, for persistent storage of its range replicas. RocksDB provides efficient storage and retrieval of data on disk.

**Component Descriptions:**

*   **SQL Layer:** Responsible for processing SQL queries.
    *   **SQL Parser:**  Analyzes and validates incoming SQL queries, converting them into an internal representation for further processing.
    *   **Query Planner & Optimizer:**  Develops efficient execution plans for SQL queries, considering data distribution, indexes, and cost-based optimization techniques to minimize query latency.
    *   **Transaction Manager:**  Manages distributed transactions across multiple ranges and nodes, ensuring ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and serializable isolation using distributed consensus.
*   **Distribution Layer:** Manages data distribution, replication, and consistency across the cluster.
    *   **Range Leaseholder:**  For each range, one replica is elected as the leaseholder. The leaseholder is responsible for coordinating write operations and ensuring linearizability for that range.
    *   **Raft Consensus Engine:** Implements the Raft consensus algorithm to replicate data and transaction logs across replicas within a range. Raft ensures strong consistency and fault tolerance by maintaining a replicated log of operations.
    *   **Replication Manager:**  Manages range replication, automatic rebalancing of ranges across nodes, and data recovery in case of node failures. It ensures the desired replication factor is maintained and data is evenly distributed.
    *   **Gossip Network:**  A peer-to-peer communication protocol used for cluster-wide information dissemination. Nodes use gossip to share cluster topology information, node status, range locations, load balancing data, and other metadata. It enables automatic discovery and decentralized cluster management.
*   **Storage Layer:** Provides persistent data storage.
    *   **RocksDB KV Store:**  A high-performance, persistent key-value store embedded within each CockroachDB node. RocksDB stores the actual data for each range replica on local disk, optimized for fast read and write operations.
*   **Networking & Communication:** Handles communication within the cluster and with clients.
    *   **gRPC Server (Inter-node & Client):**  Utilizes gRPC for efficient and high-performance communication. It serves both inter-node communication within the cluster (for Raft, gossip, replication) and client-node communication for SQL protocol and other internal APIs.
    *   **HTTP Server (Admin UI & API):**  Provides an HTTP-based interface for the web-based Admin UI, allowing users to monitor cluster status, manage configurations, and perform administrative tasks. It also exposes an administrative API for programmatic cluster management and monitoring.

## 6. Data Flow

### 6.1. Write Path (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)

1.  **SQL Client sends a write request to a SQL Gateway Node.** Any node can serve as a gateway.
2.  **SQL Gateway Node receives the request, parses the SQL query, and plans the execution.** It identifies the ranges affected by the write operation.
3.  **Transaction Manager on the Gateway Node initiates a distributed transaction.** It coordinates the transaction across potentially multiple ranges and nodes.
4.  **For each affected range, the write operation is routed to the Range Leaseholder.** The Gateway Node uses gossip information to locate the leaseholder for each range.
5.  **Range Leaseholder receives the write request and proposes it to other replicas in the range via the Raft consensus protocol.** This involves appending the write operation to the Raft log.
6.  **Raft Consensus Engine ensures that a quorum of replicas (majority) agree on the proposed write operation.** Once a quorum is reached, the write is considered committed in the Raft log.
7.  **Each replica in the range, including the leaseholder and followers, applies the committed write operation from the Raft log to its local RocksDB instance.** This ensures data consistency across all replicas.
8.  **After successfully applying the write to its RocksDB instance, the Range Leaseholder responds to the SQL Gateway Node, confirming the success of the write operation.**
9.  **SQL Gateway Node, upon receiving confirmation from all involved Range Leaseholders, responds to the SQL Client, indicating the successful completion of the write request.**

### 6.2. Read Path (e.g., `SELECT`)

1.  **SQL Client sends a read request to a SQL Gateway Node.**
2.  **SQL Gateway Node receives the request, parses the SQL query, and plans the execution.** It identifies the ranges containing the requested data.
3.  **The read operation is routed to a replica of the range containing the requested data.** For consistent reads (the default), the request is typically routed to the Range Leaseholder to ensure reading the most up-to-date data. For less critical read operations, follower replicas can be used to distribute read load.
4.  **The chosen replica retrieves the requested data from its local RocksDB instance.**
5.  **The replica returns the data to the SQL Gateway Node.**
6.  **SQL Gateway Node aggregates the data (if necessary, for queries spanning multiple ranges) and responds to the SQL Client with the requested data.**
