# Attack Surface Analysis for cockroachdb/cockroach

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in application code that improperly handles user input when constructing SQL queries. Attackers inject malicious SQL code to manipulate database operations.
*   **CockroachDB Contribution:** CockroachDB's PostgreSQL wire-compatibility makes it susceptible to SQL injection if applications using it don't sanitize inputs.
*   **Example:** An application uses unsanitized user input in a `WHERE` clause. An attacker injects `' OR 1=1 --` to bypass filtering and access unauthorized data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification/deletion, potential denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements).
    *   Input Validation and Sanitization.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege for database users.
    *   Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass on Admin UI](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass_on_admin_ui.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing authentication on the CockroachDB Admin UI, granting unauthorized access to cluster management.
*   **CockroachDB Contribution:** CockroachDB provides the Admin UI. Weak default credentials or misconfigurations expose it to bypass.
*   **Example:** Default `root` password is used, and Admin UI is exposed. Attackers use default credentials to gain full cluster control.
*   **Impact:** Full cluster compromise, data breach, denial of service, configuration manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strong Authentication for Admin UI (strong passwords, MFA).
    *   Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Network Segmentation.
    *   Securely configure or disable external Admin UI exposure.
    *   Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Inter-Node Communication](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_inter-node_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Interception of communication between CockroachDB nodes, potentially leading to data theft or manipulation.
*   **CockroachDB Contribution:** CockroachDB uses gRPC for inter-node communication. Lack of TLS enforcement makes it vulnerable.
*   **Example:** TLS is not enabled for inter-node communication. Attackers on the network intercept and read or modify data exchanged between nodes.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, cluster instability, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce TLS for Inter-Node Communication (Mandatory).**
    *   Consider Mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication.
    *   Secure Network Infrastructure.
    *   Regular Security Audits of TLS configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation via Cluster Management APIs/Tools](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_via_cluster_management_apistools.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in CockroachDB management tools to gain unauthorized administrative privileges.
*   **CockroachDB Contribution:** CockroachDB provides CLI tools and APIs for management. Vulnerabilities can lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Example:** A user with limited privileges exploits a flaw in `cockroach` CLI to gain `admin` access.
*   **Impact:** Full cluster compromise, data breach, denial of service, configuration manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Principle of Least Privilege.
    *   Regular Security Updates for CockroachDB and tools.
    *   Input Validation in management tools/APIs.
    *   Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing.
