## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via CockroachDB](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_cockroachdb.md)

This is the ultimate attacker goal. Success at this level means the application's security has been breached through the database layer.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access CockroachDB Unauthorized](./attack_tree_paths/access_cockroachdb_unauthorized.md)

Gaining unauthorized access to CockroachDB is a critical step for many attacks. It bypasses the intended security perimeter around the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_bypass.md)

Circumventing CockroachDB's authentication mechanisms allows attackers to connect to the database without valid credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authorization_bypass.md)

Bypassing CockroachDB's authorization controls allows attackers to perform actions they are not permitted to, even if they are authenticated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Network-Based Access Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/network-based_access_exploitation.md)

Exploiting network vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain access to CockroachDB from unauthorized locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CockroachDB Vulnerabilities Directly](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cockroachdb_vulnerabilities_directly.md)

Directly exploiting vulnerabilities within CockroachDB software itself, bypassing application-level controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) CockroachDB](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__cockroachdb.md)

Disrupting the availability of CockroachDB, leading to application downtime and service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Manipulation & Integrity Compromise](./attack_tree_paths/data_manipulation_&_integrity_compromise.md)

Altering, deleting, or exfiltrating data within CockroachDB, compromising data integrity and confidentiality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak or Default CockroachDB Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_or_default_cockroachdb_credentials.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to use default credentials (if mistakenly left in place) or brute-force weak passwords to gain unauthorized access to CockroachDB.
**Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies, disable default accounts, implement account lockout mechanisms, and use multi-factor authentication if possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application-Level Authentication Bypass Leading to CockroachDB Access](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application-level_authentication_bypass_leading_to_cockroachdb_access.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application's authentication logic (e.g., SQL Injection, logic flaws) to bypass application security and directly interact with CockroachDB without proper authentication.
**Mitigation:** Implement secure coding practices, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, conduct thorough security testing and code reviews of application authentication mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application-Level Authorization Bypass Leading to Elevated DB Privileges](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application-level_authorization_bypass_leading_to_elevated_db_privileges.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application's authorization logic to gain elevated privileges within CockroachDB, allowing them to access or modify data they should not be able to.
**Mitigation:** Implement robust application-level authorization checks, follow the principle of least privilege, conduct thorough security testing and code reviews of application authorization mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Network-Based Access Exploitation - Exploit Unsecured CockroachDB Ports/Services](./attack_tree_paths/network-based_access_exploitation_-_exploit_unsecured_cockroachdb_portsservices.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers scan for and identify exposed CockroachDB ports (e.g., 26257, 8080) that are accessible from unauthorized networks. They then attempt to connect to these ports, potentially gaining direct access to CockroachDB services.
**Mitigation:** Implement strong network segmentation and firewalls to restrict access to CockroachDB ports only from authorized sources (application servers, admin machines). Regularly audit firewall rules and network configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Network-Based Access Exploitation - Internal Network Compromise Leading to CockroachDB Access](./attack_tree_paths/network-based_access_exploitation_-_internal_network_compromise_leading_to_cockroachdb_access.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise the internal network where CockroachDB is located. Once inside the internal network, they can potentially access CockroachDB directly, bypassing external network security controls.
**Mitigation:** Implement robust internal network security measures, including network segmentation, intrusion detection systems, and strong access controls within the internal network.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known CockroachDB Vulnerabilities (CVEs) - Code Execution/DoS/Data Breach](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_cockroachdb_vulnerabilities__cves__-_code_executiondosdata_breach.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers research publicly disclosed CVEs for the specific version of CockroachDB being used. They then develop or obtain exploits for these CVEs and execute them to achieve code execution, denial of service, or data breaches on the CockroachDB instance.
**Mitigation:** Maintain a rigorous patching and update schedule for CockroachDB. Subscribe to security advisories and promptly apply patches for identified vulnerabilities. Implement vulnerability scanning and intrusion detection systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (CockroachDB Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__cockroachdb_specific_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify SQL injection vulnerabilities in application queries that target CockroachDB. They craft SQL injection payloads, potentially leveraging CockroachDB-specific SQL dialect features, to bypass security measures and achieve data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service.
**Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization at the application level. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) CockroachDB - Resource Exhaustion DoS (Query-Based, Connection Exhaustion)](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__cockroachdb_-_resource_exhaustion_dos__query-based__connection_exhaustion_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers flood CockroachDB with complex or resource-intensive SQL queries or open a large number of connections to exhaust database resources (CPU, memory, connections), leading to performance degradation or service disruption.
**Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting and connection limits in CockroachDB. Optimize application queries to be efficient. Monitor database performance and resource usage. Implement input validation to prevent application-level vulnerabilities that could be exploited for query-based DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) CockroachDB - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Targeting CockroachDB Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__cockroachdb_-_distributed_denial_of_service__ddos__targeting_cockroachdb_inf_016f5bcc.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against the network infrastructure hosting the CockroachDB cluster, overwhelming network bandwidth or CockroachDB nodes with malicious traffic, leading to service unavailability.
**Mitigation:** Implement network-level DDoS protection mechanisms, such as cloud-based DDoS mitigation services. Ensure sufficient network bandwidth and infrastructure capacity to handle legitimate traffic spikes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Manipulation & Integrity Compromise - Data Modification, Deletion, Exfiltration via SQL Injection or Unauthorized Access](./attack_tree_paths/data_manipulation_&_integrity_compromise_-_data_modification__deletion__exfiltration_via_sql_injecti_61f38936.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage SQL injection vulnerabilities or unauthorized access gained through access control exploits to modify, delete, or exfiltrate sensitive data stored in CockroachDB.
**Mitigation:** Implement all mitigations mentioned above for SQL injection and access control vulnerabilities. Additionally, implement data encryption at rest and in transit, regular data backups, data integrity checks, and monitoring for suspicious data access and modification patterns.
