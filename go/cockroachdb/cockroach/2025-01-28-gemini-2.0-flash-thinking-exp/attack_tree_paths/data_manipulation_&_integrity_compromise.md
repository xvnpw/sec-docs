### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Altering, deleting, or exfiltrating data within CockroachDB

This section provides a deep dive into the attack path "Altering, deleting, or exfiltrating data within CockroachDB, compromising data integrity and confidentiality."

#### 4.1. Potential Attack Vectors

Several attack vectors could lead to data manipulation, deletion, or exfiltration in CockroachDB. These can be broadly categorized as follows:

* **SQL Injection:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in application code that constructs SQL queries dynamically without proper input sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, potentially bypassing intended logic and directly manipulating database operations.
    * **Sub-Vectors:**
        * **Classic SQL Injection:** Injecting SQL code through user input fields in web forms or API requests.
        * **Second-Order SQL Injection:**  Injected code is stored in the database and executed later when retrieved and used in another query.
        * **Blind SQL Injection:**  Inferring information about the database structure and data by observing the application's response to different injected payloads, even without direct error messages.

* **Compromised Credentials:** Gaining unauthorized access to valid CockroachDB user credentials (usernames and passwords, API keys, certificates). This could be achieved through:
    * **Phishing:** Tricking legitimate users into revealing their credentials.
    * **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attempting to guess passwords through automated trials.
    * **Credential Stuffing:** Using stolen credentials from other breaches that might be reused.
    * **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent actions by authorized users.
    * **Stolen Credentials from other systems:** Compromising related systems and leveraging reused credentials.

* **Exploiting CockroachDB Vulnerabilities:** Discovering and exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the CockroachDB software itself. This is less likely with up-to-date and patched versions but remains a potential risk.
    * **Sub-Vectors:**
        * **Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs):** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities for which patches may be available but not yet applied.
        * **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities before patches are available.

* **Logical Access Control Bypass:** Circumventing intended access control mechanisms within the application or CockroachDB to gain unauthorized access to data.
    * **Sub-Vectors:**
        * **Application Logic Flaws:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's authorization logic to bypass access checks.
        * **CockroachDB RBAC Misconfiguration:** Misconfiguring Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in CockroachDB, granting excessive privileges or failing to restrict access appropriately.
        * **API Endpoint Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting insecure API endpoints that lack proper authentication or authorization, allowing unauthorized data access.

* **Backup and Restore Manipulation:** Compromising backup processes or manipulating backup files to alter or exfiltrate data.
    * **Sub-Vectors:**
        * **Compromised Backup Storage:** Gaining unauthorized access to backup storage locations.
        * **Backup File Manipulation:** Altering backup files to inject malicious data or extract sensitive information.

        * **Memory Dumping:** Accessing server memory to extract sensitive data in memory.

#### 4.2. Technical Details and Impact of Attack Vectors

For each attack vector, we will detail the technical execution and potential impact:

**4.2.1. SQL Injection:**

* **Technical Details:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries and injects them into application inputs. If the application does not properly sanitize or parameterize these inputs, the injected SQL code is executed directly by CockroachDB. This can allow attackers to:
    * **Bypass authentication and authorization:** Gain access without valid credentials.
    * **Read sensitive data:** `SELECT` data from tables they should not have access to.
    * **Modify data:** `UPDATE` or `INSERT` data to alter existing records or add new malicious entries.
    * **Delete data:** `DELETE` data, causing data loss and integrity compromise.
    * **Execute administrative commands (in some cases, depending on privileges):** Potentially gain further control over the database system.

* **Impact:**
    * **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data like user credentials, personal information, financial records.
    * **Integrity Compromise:** Data modification or deletion leading to inaccurate or unreliable information, impacting business operations and decision-making.
    * **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust and damage to brand reputation due to data breaches.
    * **Financial Loss:** Fines, legal liabilities, business disruption, and recovery costs.

**4.2.2. Compromised Credentials:**

* **Technical Details:** Once an attacker obtains valid CockroachDB credentials, they can authenticate as a legitimate user. The impact depends on the privileges associated with the compromised account.  With sufficient privileges, an attacker can:
    * **Directly access CockroachDB:** Using SQL clients or APIs to connect and interact with the database.
    * **Perform any actions authorized for that user:** This could include reading, modifying, deleting, or even administering the database, depending on the role assigned to the compromised user.

* **Impact:**
    * **Confidentiality Breach:** Access to data based on the compromised user's privileges.
    * **Integrity Compromise:** Data manipulation or deletion based on the compromised user's privileges.
    * **Availability Impact (indirect):**  If administrative credentials are compromised, attackers could potentially disrupt database operations.

**4.2.3. Exploiting CockroachDB Vulnerabilities:**

* **Technical Details:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in CockroachDB software requires in-depth knowledge of the specific vulnerability. Successful exploitation could lead to:
    * **Direct database access bypass:** Gaining access without proper authentication.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Executing arbitrary code on the CockroachDB server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    * **Data exfiltration or manipulation:** Leveraging the vulnerability to directly access or modify data.

* **Impact:**
    * **Confidentiality Breach:**  Potentially full access to all data within CockroachDB.
    * **Integrity Compromise:**  Unrestricted ability to modify or delete data.
    * **Availability Impact:**  Potential for DoS or complete system takeover, leading to service disruption.
    * **System Compromise:**  RCE vulnerabilities can lead to compromise of the underlying server infrastructure.

**4.2.4. Logical Access Control Bypass:**

* **Technical Details:** Attackers exploit flaws in application logic or CockroachDB configuration to bypass intended access controls. This could involve:
    * **Manipulating application parameters:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles user roles or permissions.
    * **Directly accessing CockroachDB APIs or interfaces:** Bypassing application-level security and interacting directly with the database.
    * **Exploiting misconfigured RBAC rules:**  Taking advantage of overly permissive or incorrectly configured roles in CockroachDB.

* **Impact:**
    * **Confidentiality Breach:** Access to data that should be restricted based on intended access controls.
    * **Integrity Compromise:**  Potential to manipulate data if access control bypass grants write permissions.

**4.2.5. Backup and Restore Manipulation:**

* **Technical Details:** Compromising backups can be achieved by:
    * **Accessing unsecured backup storage:** If backups are stored in publicly accessible locations or without proper access controls.
    * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in backup/restore processes:**  If the backup or restore process itself has security flaws.
    * **Manipulating backup files directly:**  If backup files are not encrypted or integrity-protected, attackers could modify them to inject malicious data or extract sensitive information.

* **Impact:**
    * **Confidentiality Breach:**  Exfiltration of sensitive data from backup files.
    * **Integrity Compromise:**  Restoring from a compromised backup can overwrite legitimate data with malicious or altered data.
    * **Availability Impact (indirect):**  Disrupting restore processes or corrupting backups can hinder disaster recovery efforts.

**4.2.6. Physical Access to Servers:**

* **Technical Details:** Physical access to servers hosting CockroachDB bypasses most logical security controls. Attackers with physical access can:
    * **Directly access storage devices:** Copy data files from hard drives or SSDs.
    * **Boot from alternative media:** Bypass operating system security and access data.
    * **Perform memory dumps:** Capture sensitive data residing in server memory.

* **Impact:**
    * **Confidentiality Breach:** Full access to all data stored on the server.
    * **Integrity Compromise:** Ability to modify data files directly.
    * **Availability Impact:**  Potential to damage or destroy server hardware, leading to service disruption.
