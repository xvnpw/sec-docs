Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving Harbor:

*   **Threat:** Weak Default Administrator Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in to the Harbor administrative interface using default or easily guessable credentials (e.g., `admin/Harbor12345`). If successful, they gain full control over the Harbor instance.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Harbor instance, allowing the attacker to manage users, repositories, and potentially inject malicious images or exfiltrate sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Core` (Authentication Service)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change the default administrator password upon initial deployment.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all user accounts.
        *   Consider disabling the default administrator account and creating dedicated administrator accounts with strong passwords.

*   **Threat:** API Key Compromise Leading to Unauthorized Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker could obtain a valid Harbor API key through various means (e.g., phishing, insider threat, exposed configuration). With a compromised API key, they can bypass standard authentication and perform actions authorized for that key.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the permissions associated with the compromised API key, the attacker could push/pull images, manage repositories, delete resources, or access sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Core` (API Gateway, Authentication Service)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store and manage API keys. Avoid embedding them directly in code or configuration files.
        *   Implement API key rotation policies.
        *   Restrict API key permissions to the minimum necessary (least privilege principle).
        *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Image Injection via Weak Repository Permissions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit overly permissive repository access controls *within Harbor* to push malicious container images into a Harbor repository. These images could contain malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities that could compromise systems pulling these images.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious software into the application deployment pipeline, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Registry` (Image Storage, Access Control)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement granular access control policies for repositories *within Harbor*, restricting push access to authorized users and services only.
        *   Utilize vulnerability scanning tools integrated with Harbor to automatically scan pushed images for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Enable content trust and image signing to verify the authenticity and integrity of images.

*   **Threat:** Image Tampering Through Registry Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the Harbor Registry component to directly modify existing container images stored within the registry. This could involve injecting malicious layers or altering existing layers.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised container images leading to the deployment of malicious software, potentially bypassing vulnerability scans if the tampering occurs after the scan.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Registry` (Image Storage)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Harbor instance and its components, especially the Registry, updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strong access controls to the underlying storage where container images are stored.
        *   Enable content trust and image signing to detect unauthorized modifications.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Replication Endpoint Leading to Malicious Image Introduction
    *   **Description:** If a remote Harbor instance or another registry configured as a replication endpoint *within Harbor* is compromised, malicious images could be replicated into the local Harbor instance without proper verification.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious container images into the local Harbor registry, potentially leading to the deployment of compromised applications.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Replication` (Replication Service)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure all replication endpoints with strong authentication and authorization *within Harbor's configuration*.
        *   Verify the integrity and trustworthiness of remote registries before configuring them as replication targets.
        *   Enable content trust on both the source and destination registries to ensure only signed images are replicated.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Publicly Accessible Repositories
    *   **Description:** If repositories intended to be private are inadvertently configured as public *within Harbor*, sensitive container images and their layers could be accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of proprietary code, intellectual property, or sensitive data embedded within container images.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Core` (Access Control), `Registry` (Image Access)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly review repository visibility settings *within Harbor* and ensure they align with intended access controls.
        *   Implement clear policies and procedures for managing repository visibility.
        *   Educate users on the importance of correctly configuring repository permissions.

*   **Threat:** Content Trust Bypass due to Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Harbor's content trust implementation to push unsigned or falsely signed images, even when content trust is enabled.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of untrusted or malicious images despite the intended security measures provided by content trust.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Notary` (Content Trust Integration), `Core` (Image Verification)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Harbor and its integrated Notary component updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure proper configuration of content trust policies and enforcement mechanisms.
        *   Monitor Notary logs for suspicious activity related to signing and verification.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Notary Signing Keys
    *   **Description:** If the private keys used for signing container images within the Notary service (integrated with Harbor) are compromised, an attacker could sign and push malicious images, effectively bypassing content trust verification.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of malicious images that appear to be trusted due to the attacker's ability to sign them with the compromised keys.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Notary` (Signing Service)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store and manage Notary signing keys, preferably using hardware security modules (HSMs).
        *   Implement strict access controls to the systems and storage where Notary keys are managed.
        *   Implement key rotation policies for Notary signing keys.
