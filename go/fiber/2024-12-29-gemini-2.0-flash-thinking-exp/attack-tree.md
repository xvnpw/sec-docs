## Threat Model: Fiber Application - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** To compromise the Fiber application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Fiber framework itself.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Fiber Application **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * Path Traversal via Misconfigured Router
            * Send crafted request with ".." sequences in the path
    * Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Body Parsing Mechanisms **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Billion Laughs/XML Bomb (if XML parsing is used)
            * Send maliciously crafted XML to consume excessive resources
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** JSON/Form Data Overload
            * Send deeply nested or excessively large JSON/form data
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Insecure Deserialization (if custom deserialization is used with Fiber's body parsing) **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * Send malicious serialized data to execute arbitrary code
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Templating Engine Vulnerabilities (if used with Fiber) **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * Inject malicious code into template input to achieve remote code execution
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Underlying `fasthttp` Specifics (Less Directly Fiber, but relevant)
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Request Smuggling due to `fasthttp` parsing differences
            * Craft requests that are interpreted differently by proxies and the Fiber application

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Compromise Fiber Application (CRITICAL NODE):**

* This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the ultimate compromise of the application. All subsequent attack vectors aim to achieve this goal.

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**

* **Path Traversal via Misconfigured Router:**
    * Fiber's router relies on accurate path matching. If not configured carefully, attackers might use ".." sequences in the URL to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Implement strict path validation and sanitization. Avoid directly mapping file system paths to routes. Use Fiber's built-in routing features securely.

**Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**

* While not a high-risk *path* in its entirety, middleware is a critical node because it often handles security-sensitive operations. Bypassing or exploiting flaws in middleware can have significant consequences.

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Body Parsing Mechanisms (CRITICAL NODE):**

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Billion Laughs/XML Bomb (if XML parsing is used):**
    * If the application parses XML data, attackers can send maliciously crafted XML that expands exponentially, consuming excessive resources.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Avoid parsing untrusted XML data if possible. If necessary, use secure XML parsing libraries with appropriate safeguards against entity expansion.
* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] JSON/Form Data Overload:**
    * Sending deeply nested or excessively large JSON or form data can lead to resource exhaustion.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Implement limits on the depth and size of JSON and form data.
* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Deserialization (if custom deserialization is used with Fiber's body parsing) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * If the application uses custom deserialization logic with Fiber's body parsing, attackers might send malicious serialized data to execute arbitrary code.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Avoid custom deserialization of untrusted data if possible. If necessary, use secure deserialization libraries and carefully sanitize input.

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Templating Engine Vulnerabilities (if used with Fiber) (CRITICAL NODE):**

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * If the application uses a templating engine and allows user-controlled input to be directly embedded in templates, attackers can inject malicious code that is executed on the server.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Avoid directly embedding user input into templates. Use parameterized templates or escape user input properly.

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Underlying `fasthttp` Specifics (Less Directly Fiber, but relevant):**

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Request Smuggling due to `fasthttp` parsing differences:**
    * Differences in how `fasthttp` parses HTTP requests compared to other proxies or servers could lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Ensure consistent HTTP parsing behavior across the entire infrastructure. Be aware of potential discrepancies between `fasthttp` and other components.
