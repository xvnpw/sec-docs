*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Parameter Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate route parameters that are used to construct file paths (e.g., for serving static files or accessing local resources). They might inject sequences like `../` to navigate the file system and access unauthorized files. This exploits how Fiber handles and uses route parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, configuration data, or even executable code on the server. This could lead to data breaches, service disruption, or remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Fiber Component:** Routing, Parameter Handling (`c.Params`, `c.Query`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all route parameters used in file path construction.
        *   Use allow-lists to define acceptable characters and patterns for file names.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths.
        *   Utilize secure file serving mechanisms provided by Fiber or other libraries that prevent path traversal.
        *   Implement proper access controls on the file system.

*   **Threat:** Middleware Bypass due to Configuration Errors
    *   **Description:** Incorrect configuration or ordering of middleware using Fiber's `app.Use` or `app.Group` can lead to security middleware being bypassed, allowing requests to reach handlers without proper security checks. This is a direct issue with how Fiber's middleware system is configured.
    *   **Impact:** Circumventing authentication, authorization, input validation, or other security measures implemented in middleware.
    *   **Affected Fiber Component:** Middleware (`app.Use`, `app.Group`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure middleware is correctly ordered and configured to enforce security policies.
        *   Thoroughly test middleware execution flow to verify that all security middleware is being applied as intended.
        *   Use a consistent and well-defined middleware structure.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Fiber's Core Framework
    *   **Description:** Although less frequent, vulnerabilities can exist within the Fiber framework itself. These could be bugs in the routing logic, request handling, or other core functionalities.
    *   **Impact:** Can range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Fiber Component:** Core Fiber library code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest Fiber releases and security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to Fiber.
        *   Contribute to the Fiber community by reporting any potential vulnerabilities you discover.
