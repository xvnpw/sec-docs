### High and Critical Go-Zero Threats

*   **Threat:** Unprotected API Endpoint
    *   **Description:** An attacker could directly access an API endpoint that was intended to be protected by authentication or authorization middleware provided by Go-Zero. This might happen due to misconfiguration or a lack of proper middleware application within the `go-zero/rest` router. The attacker could send malicious requests or access sensitive data without proper credentials, bypassing the intended security controls of the framework.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-zero/rest` (specifically the router and middleware handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all relevant API endpoints have appropriate authentication and authorization middleware applied using Go-Zero's provided mechanisms.
        *   Thoroughly review route configurations and middleware chains defined within the `go-zero/rest` framework.
        *   Implement unit and integration tests specifically targeting the functionality of Go-Zero's authentication and authorization middleware.

*   **Threat:** Rate Limiting Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker could bypass the rate limiting mechanisms provided by Go-Zero's `rest` package, allowing them to send an excessive number of requests. This could lead to denial of service (DoS) for legitimate users or resource exhaustion on the server. The bypass might involve manipulating headers or exploiting vulnerabilities in Go-Zero's rate limiting implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion, financial loss due to downtime.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-zero/rest` (specifically the rate limiting middleware).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure rate limiting parameters within Go-Zero based on expected traffic and resource capacity.
        *   Implement robust rate limiting logic using Go-Zero's provided middleware, considering various factors (IP address, user ID, etc.).
        *   Test rate limiting mechanisms under stress to identify potential bypasses within the Go-Zero framework.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Inter-Service Communication (RPC)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could eavesdrop on or tamper with communication between microservices if the RPC connections established using Go-Zero's `rpc` framework are not encrypted. This could involve intercepting sensitive data being exchanged or injecting malicious messages into the gRPC stream managed by Go-Zero.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to internal services.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-zero/rpc` (specifically the gRPC client and server connections managed by the framework).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always enable TLS/SSL for gRPC connections** between microservices when using Go-Zero's `rpc` framework.
        *   Properly configure and manage certificates used by Go-Zero's gRPC implementation.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication between services utilizing Go-Zero's RPC capabilities.

*   **Threat:** Deserialization Vulnerability in Custom RPC Codec
    *   **Description:** If developers implement custom codecs for RPC communication within Go-Zero's `rpc` framework (instead of relying solely on Protocol Buffers), vulnerabilities in the deserialization logic could allow an attacker to send malicious payloads that execute arbitrary code on the receiving service. This exploits the flexibility offered by Go-Zero to use custom serialization methods.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-zero/rpc` (specifically custom codec implementations within the framework).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid implementing custom codecs unless absolutely necessary** when using Go-Zero's RPC.
        *   If custom codecs are required within Go-Zero, ensure they are thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities, especially concerning deserialization.
        *   Use well-vetted and secure deserialization libraries if custom codecs are unavoidable in your Go-Zero application.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Generated Code
    *   **Description:** While less likely, vulnerabilities could exist in the code generated by Go-Zero's `goctl` tool. An attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities if they are present in the generated API handlers or RPC stubs, which are core components of services built with Go-Zero.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, could range from information disclosure to remote code execution within services built using Go-Zero.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-zero/tools/goctl` (the code generation tool).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Go-Zero and its tools updated** to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the code generation logic.
        *   Review the generated code for potential security flaws as part of the development process for Go-Zero applications.
        *   Report any suspected vulnerabilities in `goctl` to the Go-Zero maintainers.
