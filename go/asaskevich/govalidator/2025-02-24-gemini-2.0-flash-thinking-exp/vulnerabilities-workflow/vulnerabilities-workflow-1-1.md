Okay, I understand the instructions.

Based on the provided text:

```
## Vulnerability List

There are no identified vulnerabilities in the project based on the provided files that meet the specified criteria (rank at least high, not DoS, not due to explicit insecure code patterns by developers using the library, not only missing documentation).

It's important to note that a more comprehensive analysis might reveal vulnerabilities in other parts of the project or with a larger set of files, especially considering the complexity of regular expressions and input validation in general. However, based on the provided files, and considering the constraints for inclusion in this list, no such vulnerabilities are apparent.

Further analysis could include:
- Deep dive into all regular expressions for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities with complex inputs.
- Security audit of all validation functions for logic errors and edge cases, especially when handling unicode and international characters.
- Fuzzing the validation functions with various inputs to identify unexpected behavior or crashes.
- Checking for potential bypasses in sanitization functions like `SafeFileName` and `NormalizeEmail`.

However, based on static analysis of the provided files, no high or critical vulnerabilities are identified that meet the given criteria for this report.
```

The text explicitly states that **no vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria were found**.

Therefore, according to your instructions to update the list and return it in markdown format, and given that the provided "list" itself states there are no vulnerabilities meeting the criteria, the updated list will remain empty in terms of actual vulnerabilities.

Here is the markdown formatted response reflecting this:

## Vulnerability List

Based on the analysis conducted and the specified criteria for inclusion (rank at least high, not DoS, not due to developer misuse of the library, not solely missing documentation), no vulnerabilities have been identified in the project that meet these requirements.

Therefore, there are currently no vulnerabilities to list according to the requested format.

It is recommended to conduct further analysis as suggested previously to explore potential vulnerabilities that may not have been identified in the initial assessment, including:

- Deep dive into all regular expressions for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities with complex inputs.
- Security audit of all validation functions for logic errors and edge cases, especially when handling unicode and international characters.
- Fuzzing the validation functions with various inputs to identify unexpected behavior or crashes.
- Checking for potential bypasses in sanitization functions like `SafeFileName` and `NormalizeEmail`.

This list will be updated if further analysis reveals vulnerabilities that meet the specified inclusion criteria.
