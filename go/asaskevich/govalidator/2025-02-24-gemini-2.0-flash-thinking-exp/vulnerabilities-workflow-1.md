## Combined Vulnerability List

This document combines identified vulnerabilities from multiple lists into a single, deduplicated list.

### Vulnerability: Filename Sanitization Bypass in `SafeFileName`

* Description:
    1. The `SafeFileName` function in `utils.go` aims to sanitize input strings to produce safe filenames.
    2. The function uses regular expressions to replace or remove characters considered unsafe in filenames.
    3. However, the current implementation of `SafeFileName` might not effectively sanitize filenames against all types of potentially harmful characters, specifically certain Unicode control characters like bidirectional override characters (e.g., RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE - \u202E).
    4. An attacker could craft a filename containing these characters.
    5. When `SafeFileName` is used to sanitize this crafted filename, it may fail to remove or neutralize the harmful characters.
    6. An application using the `govalidator` library and relying on `SafeFileName` for security purposes might then inadvertently use the unsanitized filename.
    7. This could lead to filename spoofing or other unexpected behavior depending on how the filename is used by the application.

* Impact:
    - Filename spoofing: An attacker could create files with names that visually mimic other filenames, potentially leading to users executing unintended files or being tricked into downloading or interacting with malicious content.
    - Depending on the application's use of filenames, other security issues could arise from unexpected or unsanitized filenames.
    - The vulnerability is ranked as high because filename spoofing can be a significant phishing and social engineering vector, and bypasses intended security sanitization.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The `SafeFileName` function uses regular expressions to remove separators (`[ &_=+:]`) and illegal characters (`[^[:alnum:]-.]`).
    - It also handles double dashes (`--`) by replacing them with a single dash (`-`).
    - These mitigations are implemented in the `SafeFileName` function in `/code/utils.go`.

* Missing mitigations:
    - The current regular expressions do not specifically target or remove Unicode bidirectional override characters or other potentially harmful Unicode control characters.
    - Missing mitigation is a more comprehensive sanitization approach that considers a wider range of potentially unsafe Unicode characters in filenames.

* Preconditions:
    - An application uses the `govalidator` library, specifically the `SafeFileName` function, to sanitize filenames.
    - The application relies on `SafeFileName` to prevent filename-based vulnerabilities.
    - An attacker can control or influence the input string that is passed to `SafeFileName`.

* Source code analysis:
    1. **File**: `/code/utils.go`
    2. **Function**: `SafeFileName(str string) string`
    3. **Code Snippet**:
    ```go
    func SafeFileName(str string) string {
        name := strings.ToLower(str)
        name = path.Clean(path.Base(name))
        name = strings.Trim(name, " ")
        separators, err := regexp.Compile(`[ &_=+:]`)
        if err == nil {
            name = separators.ReplaceAllString(name, "-")
        }
        legal, err := regexp.Compile(`[^[:alnum:]-.]`)
        if err == nil {
            name = legal.ReplaceAllString(name, "")
        }
        for strings.Contains(name, "--") {
            name = strings.Replace(name, "--", "-", -1)
        }
        return name
    }
    ```
    4. **Vulnerability Point**: The regular expression `[^[:alnum:]-.]` is intended to remove illegal characters. However, it focuses on ASCII alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and dots. It does not explicitly address Unicode control characters, such as bidirectional override characters.
    5. **Example**: Input string "test\u202Etxt.abc" contains the Unicode RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE character (\u202E). When this string is processed by `SafeFileName`, the regex `[^[:alnum:]-.]` will not match and remove \u202E because `[:alnum:]` and the negated set `[^...]` might not cover or explicitly exclude this specific Unicode control character. The resulting filename might still contain \u202E, leading to potential spoofing issues.

* Security test case:
    1. **Test Environment**: Set up a Go development environment and include the `govalidator` library.
    2. **Test Code**: Write a Go test program that calls the `SafeFileName` function with a malicious input string containing a Unicode bidirectional override character.
    ```go
    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "github.com/asaskevich/govalidator/v11"
    )

    func main() {
        maliciousFilename := "test\u202Etxt.abc"
        safeFilename := govalidator.SafeFileName(maliciousFilename)
        fmt.Printf("Original Filename: %s\n", maliciousFilename)
        fmt.Printf("Sanitized Filename: %s\n", safeFilename)
        if govalidator.Contains(safeFilename, "\u202E") {
            fmt.Println("Vulnerability Found: Sanitized filename still contains Unicode bidirectional override character.")
        } else {
            fmt.Println("Sanitization Successful: Unicode bidirectional override character removed.")
        }
    }
    ```
    3. **Run Test**: Execute the Go test program.
    4. **Expected Result**: The test should output that the "Sanitized Filename" still contains the Unicode bidirectional override character (\u202E), indicating a vulnerability. The output should show that `safeFilename` contains `\u202E`. For example, when running the test, the output might be similar to:
    ```text
    Original Filename: test‏txt.abc
    Sanitized Filename: test‏txt.abc
    Vulnerability Found: Sanitized filename still contains Unicode bidirectional override character.
    ```
    5. **Verification**: Manually inspect the "Sanitized Filename" output to confirm if the Unicode bidirectional override character is still present. If it is, the vulnerability is confirmed.
