## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Colly - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** To compromise the application utilizing the `gocolly/colly` library by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the library's functionality or its interaction with the application.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

Compromise Application Using Colly
* (+) Exploit Colly's Request Handling <Critical Node>
    * (*) Manipulate Target URL <Critical Node>
        * (-) Inject Malicious Parameters <High-Risk Path>
        * (-) Redirect to Malicious Site <High-Risk Path>
* (+) Exploit Colly's Response Handling <Critical Node>
    * (*) Inject Malicious Content via Scraped Data <Critical Node>
        * (-) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Output <High-Risk Path>
        * (-) SQL Injection via Unsanitized Data in Database Queries <High-Risk Path>
    * (*) Exploit Redirect Handling
        * (-) Open Redirect leading to Phishing or Malware <High-Risk Path>
* (+) Exploit Colly's Configuration and Setup <Critical Node>
    * (*) Exploit Callbacks and Event Handlers
        * (-) Inject Malicious Code in Callback Functions <High-Risk Path>

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Exploit Colly's Request Handling:**
    * This represents a broad category of attacks where the attacker manipulates how Colly makes requests to target websites. Success here can lead to various downstream compromises.
* **Manipulate Target URL:**
    * This critical node focuses on the attacker's ability to influence the URLs that Colly requests. This is a fundamental step in many web attacks.
* **Exploit Colly's Response Handling:**
    * This encompasses attacks that leverage how Colly processes the responses received from target websites. This is a crucial area as it directly relates to the data the application uses.
* **Inject Malicious Content via Scraped Data:**
    * This critical node highlights the danger of using data scraped by Colly without proper sanitization. It's a common entry point for injection attacks.
* **Exploit Colly's Configuration and Setup:**
    * This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from insecure configuration or setup of the Colly library itself, potentially weakening overall security.

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Manipulate Target URL -> Inject Malicious Parameters:**
    * An attacker modifies the parameters within the URL requested by Colly.
    * This can lead to unintended actions on the target server, such as data modification or deletion, or triggering vulnerabilities in the target application.
    * The likelihood is medium as it depends on the target application's handling of URL parameters.
    * The impact is medium, potentially causing data breaches or unintended functionality.
* **Manipulate Target URL -> Redirect to Malicious Site:**
    * An attacker manipulates the URL requested by Colly to redirect to a website they control.
    * This can be used for phishing attacks, where users are tricked into providing credentials or sensitive information on the malicious site, or for distributing malware.
    * The likelihood is medium as it depends on the target application's handling of redirects.
    * The impact is high due to the potential for user compromise.
* **Exploit Colly's Response Handling -> Inject Malicious Content via Scraped Data -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Output:**
    * Colly scrapes data containing malicious scripts.
    * The application then displays this scraped data to users without proper encoding or sanitization.
    * This allows the malicious script to execute in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks.
    * The likelihood is medium as it's a common vulnerability if output encoding is neglected.
    * The impact is medium, potentially leading to client-side compromise.
* **Exploit Colly's Response Handling -> Inject Malicious Content via Scraped Data -> SQL Injection via Unsanitized Data in Database Queries:**
    * Colly scrapes data containing malicious SQL code.
    * The application uses this scraped data directly in database queries without proper parameterization or sanitization.
    * This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or even complete database compromise.
    * The likelihood is low if parameterized queries are used, but the impact is high.
* **Exploit Colly's Response Handling -> Exploit Redirect Handling -> Open Redirect leading to Phishing or Malware:**
    * Colly follows a redirect to a URL controlled by the attacker.
    * The application then uses this attacker-controlled URL in a way that redirects users.
    * This can be exploited to redirect users to phishing sites or sites hosting malware.
    * The likelihood is medium as it depends on the application's handling of redirect URLs.
    * The impact is high due to the potential for user compromise.
* **Exploit Colly's Configuration and Setup -> Exploit Callbacks and Event Handlers -> Inject Malicious Code in Callback Functions:**
    * The application defines callback functions for Colly's events.
    * An attacker finds a way to inject malicious code into these callback functions, potentially through manipulating configuration or exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application sets up Colly.
    * When Colly triggers the event, the malicious code is executed within the application's context, potentially leading to full application compromise.
    * The likelihood is low as it typically requires application developer error.
    * The impact is critical, potentially leading to full application compromise.
