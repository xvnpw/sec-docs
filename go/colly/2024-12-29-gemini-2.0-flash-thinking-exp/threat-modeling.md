*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the target URLs provided to the `colly` collector. They might inject internal network addresses or URLs of other internal services into the scraping targets. The `colly` instance, acting on behalf of the application, would then make requests to these unintended targets.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal services not meant to be publicly accessible, potential data breaches from internal systems, ability to perform actions on internal services, denial of service against internal infrastructure.
    *   **Colly Component Affected:**
        *   Module: `collector`
        *   Function: `Visit`, `Request`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize all target URLs before passing them to `colly`.
        *   Implement an allow-list of permitted domains or IP ranges for scraping targets.
        *   Consider using a network segmentation strategy to isolate the `colly` instance.
        *   Monitor outbound requests made by the `colly` instance for suspicious activity.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Crawling
    *   **Description:** An attacker could provide a large number of target URLs or URLs that lead to crawling traps (e.g., dynamically generated pages with infinite links) to the `colly` collector. This would cause the `colly` instance to generate a massive number of requests, potentially overwhelming the target website or the application's resources.
    *   **Impact:** Disruption of service for the target website, potential blacklisting of the application's IP address by the target, excessive resource consumption on the application server.
    *   **Colly Component Affected:**
        *   Module: `collector`
        *   Function: `Visit`, `OnHTML`, `OnXML`, `OnResponse` (through repeated calls)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the number of requests `colly` can make per second or per minute.
        *   Set a maximum crawl depth to prevent infinite loops.
        *   Set a maximum number of pages to visit.
        *   Respect `robots.txt` directives.
        *   Implement timeouts for requests.
        *   Monitor the application's crawling activity and resource usage.
