# Attack Surface Analysis for letsencrypt/boulder

## Attack Surface: [ACME Protocol Implementation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/acme_protocol_implementation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in Boulder's implementation of the ACME protocol can allow attackers to bypass authorization checks or disrupt certificate issuance. This directly stems from vulnerabilities within Boulder's code handling ACME interactions.
    *   **How Boulder Contributes:** Boulder *is* the ACME server in this context. Any weakness in its ACME logic is a direct contribution to this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A bug in Boulder's processing of the `new-authorization` request could allow an attacker to bypass domain ownership verification and obtain a certificate for an arbitrary domain.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized certificate issuance, potential domain takeover, denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rigorous code reviews and security audits specifically targeting Boulder's ACME implementation.
        *   Extensive fuzzing and penetration testing of Boulder's ACME endpoints.
        *   Rapid adoption of security patches and updates released by the Boulder project.
        *   Strict adherence to secure coding practices during Boulder development.

## Attack Surface: [DNS Challenge Validation Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/dns_challenge_validation_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable flaws in Boulder's logic for validating DNS challenges (`dns-01`) can allow attackers to falsely prove control over a domain. This is a direct consequence of how Boulder performs DNS lookups and verifications.
    *   **How Boulder Contributes:** Boulder's code is responsible for the DNS resolution and verification steps in the `dns-01` challenge. Vulnerabilities here are inherent to Boulder's implementation.
    *   **Example:** Boulder might be susceptible to race conditions in DNS propagation checks, allowing an attacker to temporarily inject a valid TXT record and obtain a certificate before the record propagates widely and is legitimately verified.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized certificate issuance, potential domain takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust and secure DNS validation logic within Boulder, following industry best practices.
        *   Utilize multiple, independent DNS resolvers for validation to mitigate resolver-specific vulnerabilities or manipulation.
        *   Implement and enforce DNSSEC validation to ensure the integrity of DNS responses.
        *   Introduce sufficient delays and retries in the validation process to account for DNS propagation variability.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Challenge Validation Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/http_challenge_validation_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Boulder's logic for validating HTTP challenges (`http-01`) can allow attackers to manipulate the validation process and obtain certificates without legitimate control. This is directly related to how Boulder makes and interprets HTTP requests.
    *   **How Boulder Contributes:** Boulder's code handles the HTTP requests to the target domain for the `http-01` challenge. Flaws in how these requests are made or how responses are interpreted are direct contributions.
    *   **Example:** Boulder might not correctly handle certain types of HTTP redirects or might be vulnerable to attacks where the validation file is served from an unintended location due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities on the target server.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized certificate issuance, potential for exploiting vulnerabilities on the target web server if Boulder's validation probes are manipulated.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a secure HTTP client within Boulder, ensuring proper handling of redirects, headers, and error conditions.
        *   Thoroughly validate the content of the challenge file retrieved by Boulder to prevent injection of malicious content.
        *   Consider enforcing HTTPS for validation probes to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks during the validation process.

## Attack Surface: [Database Compromise Impacting Certificate Data](./attack_surfaces/database_compromise_impacting_certificate_data.md)

*   **Description:** If the database used by Boulder is compromised, sensitive information managed by Boulder, such as account details and issuance logs, becomes accessible. While the database itself has its own attack surface, Boulder's interaction with it is a key factor here.
    *   **How Boulder Contributes:** Boulder is responsible for storing and retrieving sensitive data from the database. Vulnerabilities in Boulder's database interactions (e.g., insecure queries) or insufficient protection of the data within Boulder's architecture contribute to this risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploiting a vulnerability in Boulder's code could gain unauthorized access to the database and extract information about issued certificates or user accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive certificate and account information, potential for impersonation and domain takeover if private keys were improperly stored (though this is a separate security concern best addressed by HSMs).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the database infrastructure with strong authentication, authorization, and network controls.
        *   Implement encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit within the database used by Boulder.
        *   Regularly patch and update the database software.
        *   Employ parameterized queries or ORM techniques within Boulder's code to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for Boulder's database access.

## Attack Surface: [Internal API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/internal_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Boulder's internal APIs, used for communication between its components, can allow attackers with access to the internal network to manipulate the system. These vulnerabilities are inherent to Boulder's internal architecture and implementation.
    *   **How Boulder Contributes:** Boulder's design relies on these internal APIs. Flaws in their authentication, authorization, or data handling are direct contributions to the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gaining access to the internal network could exploit an unauthenticated or poorly secured internal API endpoint to trigger certificate issuance or revocation, bypassing normal ACME controls.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized certificate issuance or revocation, denial of service, compromise of internal system integrity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all internal APIs within Boulder.
        *   Enforce network segmentation to restrict access to internal APIs.
        *   Regularly audit and penetration test Boulder's internal APIs for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing and maintaining Boulder's internal API endpoints.
