## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Boulder Certificate Issuance Process](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_boulder_certificate_issuance_process.md)

This path focuses on attackers tricking Boulder into issuing unauthorized certificates.
*   **Critical Node: Obtain Unauthorized Certificate for Application Domain:**  The primary goal here is to get a valid certificate for the application's main domain without proper authorization.
    *   **High-Risk Path Component: Abuse Domain Takeover to Pass Challenges:** If an attacker can compromise the domain's DNS records (e.g., through registrar compromise), they can manipulate the DNS challenges to obtain a certificate.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerability in ACME Client Implementation Interacting with Boulder:**  Flaws in the ACME client used by the application could be exploited to send malicious requests to Boulder, bypassing validation checks.
*   **Obtain Unauthorized Certificate for Subdomain or Related Domain:**  Attackers might target subdomains or related domains for phishing or other malicious activities.
    *   **High-Risk Path Component: Leverage Existing Compromise of Related Infrastructure:** If an attacker has already compromised systems related to the domain (like DNS servers), they can use this access to pass Boulder's domain validation challenges for subdomains.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Boulder Certificate Revocation Process](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_boulder_certificate_revocation_process.md)

This path centers on attackers causing disruption by maliciously revoking valid certificates.
*   **Initiate Unauthorized Certificate Revocation:** The goal is to trigger the revocation of legitimate certificates without proper authorization.
    *   **Critical Node: Compromise Account Authorized to Revoke Certificates:** If an attacker gains access to the API keys or credentials that are authorized to revoke certificates, they can directly initiate malicious revocations.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Boulder's Internal Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_boulder's_internal_functionality.md)

This path involves exploiting weaknesses within Boulder's codebase or configuration.
*   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Boulder's Codebase:**
    *   **Critical Node: Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (e.g., Buffer Overflows):** These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Boulder server, leading to a complete compromise of the certificate authority.
*   **Exploit Configuration Errors in Boulder Deployment:**
    *   **Insecure Permissions on Configuration Files:**  If configuration files have overly permissive access rights, attackers might be able to read sensitive information or modify configurations to their advantage.
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration:** Configuration files might inadvertently contain sensitive data like database credentials or API keys, which attackers could exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Boulder's Interaction with External Systems](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_boulder's_interaction_with_external_systems.md)

This path focuses on compromising systems that Boulder interacts with.
*   **Critical Node: Compromise Boulder's Database:**  Gaining unauthorized access to Boulder's database could allow attackers to read sensitive information about certificates and potentially manipulate certificate data.
*   **Critical Node: Compromise Boulder's Interaction with HSM or Key Management Systems:**  This is a highly critical area. If the communication between Boulder and the Hardware Security Module (HSM) is compromised, attackers could potentially steal or manipulate the private keys used to sign certificates, leading to a complete breakdown of trust.
