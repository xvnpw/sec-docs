# Threat Model Analysis for letsencrypt/boulder

## Threat: [Unauthorized Certificate Revocation](./threats/unauthorized_certificate_revocation.md)

* **Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within Boulder's API or authentication mechanisms to directly request revocation of legitimate certificates.
    * **How:** This could involve exploiting API endpoints related to revocation without proper authorization or bypassing authentication checks within Boulder itself.
* **Impact:**
    * **Description:** Legitimate TLS certificates for the application's domains are revoked, causing browsers to display security warnings and potentially disrupting service availability. This can damage the application's reputation and user trust.
* **Boulder Component Affected:**
    * **Description:** Affects the **Registrar** component (responsible for managing accounts) and the **Authority** component (which handles revocation requests).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust authentication and authorization within Boulder for all API endpoints related to certificate management, including revocation.
    * Securely manage and protect Boulder's internal authentication credentials.
    * Implement audit logging for certificate management actions within Boulder.
    * Rate limit revocation requests to mitigate potential abuse.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Boulder's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_boulder's_dependencies.md)

* **Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries and dependencies used by the Boulder software.
    * **How:** This could involve exploiting flaws in the operating system, programming language runtime, or third-party libraries used by Boulder.
* **Impact:**
    * **Description:** Compromise of the Boulder instance, potentially leading to unauthorized certificate issuance, revocation, or data breaches within the CA infrastructure.
* **Boulder Component Affected:**
    * **Description:** Affects various components depending on the specific vulnerability, but generally pertains to the underlying infrastructure and libraries.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Keep the Boulder instance and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * Regularly scan the Boulder instance for vulnerabilities.
    * Follow security best practices for the underlying operating system and environment where Boulder is deployed.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Boulder (Self-Hosted)](./threats/misconfiguration_of_boulder__self-hosted_.md)

* **Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits misconfigurations in a self-hosted Boulder instance to gain unauthorized access or manipulate certificate issuance.
    * **How:** This could involve weak authentication, exposed management interfaces, or insecure network settings within the Boulder deployment.
* **Impact:**
    * **Description:**  Compromise of the self-hosted Boulder instance, potentially allowing the attacker to issue or revoke certificates arbitrarily.
* **Boulder Component Affected:**
    * **Description:** Affects various components depending on the misconfiguration, including the **ACME Server**, **Registrar**, and administrative interfaces.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Follow the official Boulder documentation for secure deployment and configuration.
    * Implement strong authentication and authorization for all administrative interfaces within Boulder.
    * Restrict network access to the Boulder instance.
    * Regularly review and audit the Boulder configuration.

## Threat: [Compromise of Boulder's Signing Key (Let's Encrypt Infrastructure)](./threats/compromise_of_boulder's_signing_key__let's_encrypt_infrastructure_.md)

* **Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains access to Let's Encrypt's private key used to sign certificates.
    * **How:** This is a highly sophisticated attack targeting Let's Encrypt's infrastructure.
* **Impact:**
    * **Description:**  The attacker could issue completely fraudulent certificates that would be trusted by browsers, leading to widespread impersonation and security breaches across the internet.
* **Boulder Component Affected:**
    * **Description:** Primarily affects the **Authority** component, specifically the secure storage and management of the root and intermediate signing keys.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * This is primarily the responsibility of the Let's Encrypt team. Relying applications benefit from their robust security practices, including HSMs, strict access controls, and regular security audits.

## Threat: [Boulder API Vulnerabilities](./threats/boulder_api_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits undiscovered vulnerabilities within Boulder's ACME API itself.
    * **How:** This could involve sending specially crafted requests to the API to bypass security checks, gain unauthorized access, or cause unexpected behavior.
* **Impact:**
    * **Description:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to unauthorized certificate issuance, revocation, data breaches, or denial of service against the Boulder instance.
* **Boulder Component Affected:**
    * **Description:** Affects the **ACME Server** component, which handles and processes API requests.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Stay informed about security advisories and updates related to Boulder.
    * If self-hosting, promptly apply security patches released by the Boulder development team.
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the application when interacting with the Boulder API (though the primary responsibility lies with Boulder itself).
    * Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests to the Boulder API (if self-hosting).
