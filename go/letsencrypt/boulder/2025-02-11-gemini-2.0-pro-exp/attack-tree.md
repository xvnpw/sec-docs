## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise of CA Private Key](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_of_ca_private_key.md)

**Description:** This is the most critical node. If the attacker gains access to the CA's private key, they can issue certificates for *any* domain, completely undermining the trust model.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Physical Access to HSM:** Gaining physical access to the Hardware Security Module (HSM) where the private key is stored. This would likely require bypassing physical security measures.
            *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (due to physical security).
            *   **Impact:** Critical (complete compromise).
            *   **Effort:** Very High (requires physical intrusion, specialized tools).
            *   **Skill Level:** Expert (physical security, hardware exploitation).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (physical intrusion may not be immediately detected).
        *   **Software Vulnerability in HSM:** Exploiting a vulnerability in the HSM's firmware or software to extract the private key.  This is extremely difficult but not impossible.
            *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (HSMs are designed to be highly secure).
            *   **Impact:** Critical (complete compromise).
            *   **Effort:** Very High (requires deep understanding of HSM internals).
            *   **Skill Level:** Expert (hardware security, vulnerability research).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (often requires vendor-specific detection).
        *   **Compromise of Key Management System:** If the key management system used to handle the CA private key is compromised (e.g., through weak credentials, software vulnerabilities, or insider threat), the attacker could gain access to the key.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (assuming reasonable key management practices).
            *   **Impact:** Critical (complete compromise).
            *   **Effort:** High (requires compromising a separate, secured system).
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced (system administration, potentially exploit development).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (depends on logging and intrusion detection systems).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Boulder Software](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_boulder_software.md)

**Description:**  Boulder, like any software, could have vulnerabilities.  These could be in the core application logic, dependencies, or interactions with the database.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Injection Vulnerabilities (SQLi, Command Injection):**  If user-supplied input is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious code into SQL queries or shell commands.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (common vulnerability type, but Boulder is likely well-tested).
            *   **Impact:** High (could lead to data exfiltration, code execution).
            *   **Effort:** Moderate (standard attack techniques, but requires finding a vulnerable input).
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (knowledge of SQL injection, command injection).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (web application firewalls and intrusion detection systems can often detect these).
        *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:**  Flaws in the authentication or authorization mechanisms could allow an attacker to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized privileges.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (core functionality, likely well-tested).
            *   **Impact:** High (could allow issuing certificates or modifying data).
            *   **Effort:** High (requires finding a logic flaw in the authentication/authorization flow).
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced (deep understanding of authentication protocols and Boulder's implementation).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (unusual access patterns might be detected).
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  A vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is the most severe type of vulnerability.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (less common in well-written Go code, but still possible).
            *   **Impact:** Critical (complete system compromise).
            *   **Effort:** High (requires finding and exploiting a complex vulnerability).
            *   **Skill Level:** Expert (vulnerability research, exploit development).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (unusual system behavior might be detected).
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting a vulnerability to make the CA service unavailable. This could involve flooding the server with requests or exploiting a bug that causes the service to crash.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (DoS vulnerabilities can be subtle).
            *   **Impact:** High (disrupts certificate issuance).
            *   **Effort:** Low (many tools available for DoS attacks).
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (understanding of network protocols and DoS techniques).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (performance degradation and service unavailability are obvious).

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise of Supporting Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_of_supporting_infrastructure.md)

**Description:**  Boulder relies on other systems (database, network, etc.). Compromising these systems can indirectly impact Boulder.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Database Compromise (e.g., MySQL):**  Gaining access to the database could allow an attacker to modify account data, issue certificates, or disrupt service.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (databases are common targets).
            *   **Impact:** High (data modification, potential certificate issuance).
            *   **Effort:** Moderate (requires exploiting database vulnerabilities or weak credentials).
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (database security, SQL injection).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (database monitoring and intrusion detection).
        *   **Compromise of DNS Infrastructure:**  If an attacker can control the DNS records for the domain being validated, they can potentially redirect validation requests to a server they control.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (DNS infrastructure is generally well-protected).
            *   **Impact:** High (allows for fraudulent certificate issuance).
            *   **Effort:** High (requires compromising DNS servers or registrars).
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced (network security, DNS hijacking techniques).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (DNS monitoring and anomaly detection).
        *   **Compromise of Network Infrastructure:**  Gaining access to routers, switches, or firewalls could allow an attacker to intercept traffic, modify data, or launch denial-of-service attacks.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (network infrastructure is usually well-secured).
            *   **Impact:** High (can affect all aspects of the system).
            *   **Effort:** High (requires network penetration skills).
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced (network security, penetration testing).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires network intrusion detection systems).
