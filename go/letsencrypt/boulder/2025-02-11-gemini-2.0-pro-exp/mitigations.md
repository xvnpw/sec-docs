# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for letsencrypt/boulder

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Rate Limiting Configuration (Boulder-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_rate_limiting_configuration__boulder-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Usage Patterns:** Analyze expected legitimate usage. Determine the expected number of new accounts, authorizations, and certificates per unit of time.
    2.  **Configure `rate-limits.json`:** Modify the `config/rate-limits.json` file within the Boulder installation.
    3.  **Set Account Limits:** Define limits for `newAccount` in `rate-limits.json`, specifying the maximum number of new accounts per IP and per time interval.  Example: `{"key": "newAccount:ip:<IP>", "limit": 5, "window": "1h"}`.
    4.  **Set Authorization Limits:** Define limits for `newAuthz` in `rate-limits.json`, specifying limits per account and per IP. Example: `{"key": "newAuthz:account:<ACCOUNT_ID>", "limit": 10, "window": "1h"}`.
    5.  **Set Certificate Limits:** Define limits for `newOrder` and `finalizeOrder` in `rate-limits.json`. Consider limits per account, per domain, and per IP. Example: `{"key": "newOrder:account:<ACCOUNT_ID>:domain:<DOMAIN>", "limit": 2, "window": "24h"}`.
    6.  **Set Pending Authorization Limits:** Use `authz` limits in `rate-limits.json` to control pending authorizations.
    7.  **Set Failed Validation Limits:** Use a combination of `newAuthz` limits and potentially custom logic within Boulder (requiring code modification) to limit failed validation attempts. This might involve modifying database interactions.
    8.  **Test Thoroughly:** Test with legitimate and simulated abusive traffic.
    9.  **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously monitor rate limit logs (Boulder provides these) and adjust the limits in `rate-limits.json` as needed.

    *   **Account Enumeration:** Reduced.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic rate limits are configured in `config/rate-limits.json`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Fine-grained limits per domain.
    *   Automated adjustment of rate limits.
    *   Specific limits on failed validation attempts (beyond basic `newAuthz` limits) likely require code modifications within Boulder.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Validation Configuration (Boulder-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_validation_configuration__boulder-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Challenge Types:** Determine which ACME challenge types are necessary.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Challenges:** In `config/boulder.json`, set the `enabled` flag to `false` for any unneeded challenge types.
    3.  **Configure Challenge Timeouts:** In `config/boulder.json`, configure short, reasonable timeouts for challenges (e.g., `dns01ChallengeTimeout`, `http01ChallengeTimeout`).
    4. **Test Thoroughly:** Test each enabled challenge type; ensure disabled types are rejected.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Challenge Spoofing (High Severity):**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** (Mitigated indirectly by reducing the attack surface)
    *   **DNS Hijacking (High Severity):** (Mitigated indirectly by reducing the attack surface)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Challenge Spoofing:** Significantly reduced.
    *   **MITM Attacks:** Reduced (indirectly).
    *   **DNS Hijacking:** Reduced (indirectly).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Only DNS-01 challenges are enabled in `config/boulder.json`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive testing of all challenge timeout configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CAA Enforcement (Boulder-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/caa_enforcement__boulder-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Boulder:** In `config/boulder.json`, ensure CAA checking is enabled (`caaEnforcementEnabled: true`).
    2.  **Test CAA Enforcement:** Attempt to issue certificates for domains with and without appropriate CAA records.
    3.  **Monitor CAA-Related Logs:** Review Boulder's logs for CAA-related errors.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Certificate Issuance (High Severity):**

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Certificate Issuance:** Significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   CAA enforcement is enabled in `config/boulder.json`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive testing of CAA enforcement.
    *   Automated monitoring of CAA-related logs (this might require custom scripting or SIEM integration, but the *log generation* is Boulder's responsibility).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Boulder Code and Dependency Updates](./mitigation_strategies/boulder_code_and_dependency_updates.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Establish a Schedule:** Define a regular schedule for checking for Boulder updates.
    2. **Monitor Boulder Releases:**  Actively monitor the Boulder GitHub repository (https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder) for new releases and security advisories.
    3. **Review Changelogs:** Carefully review the changelogs for new releases to identify security-related fixes.
    4. **Update Boulder:**  Update the Boulder installation to the latest stable release, following the official upgrade instructions.
    5. **Test After Updates:** Thoroughly test the Boulder instance after updating to ensure that the updates haven't introduced any regressions.
    6. **Dependency Audits (within Boulder's context):** While *managing* dependencies is a broader DevOps task, *reviewing* the impact of dependency vulnerabilities on Boulder's code is a Boulder-specific concern.  This involves understanding how Boulder uses its dependencies.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Boulder (High Severity):**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (High Severity):** (Indirectly, by understanding how Boulder *uses* those dependencies)

* **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduced.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Ad-hoc updates are performed when critical vulnerabilities are announced.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal schedule for checking for Boulder updates.
    *   A documented process for reviewing changelogs and assessing the impact of updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Detailed Logging and Auditing (Boulder's Logging Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/detailed_logging_and_auditing__boulder's_logging_configuration_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Verbose Logging:** Configure Boulder (via its configuration files) to log all relevant events, including successful and failed operations, errors, and warnings.  Ensure sufficient detail is captured.
    2.  **Structured Logging:** Configure Boulder to use structured logging (e.g., JSON format) if possible.  This makes logs easier to parse.
    3. **Review Log Configuration:** Examine Boulder's logging configuration to ensure all relevant events are being logged. This may involve understanding Boulder's internal logging mechanisms.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Undetected Attacks (High Severity):**
    *   **Difficult Incident Response (High Severity):**
    *   **Lack of Visibility (Medium Severity):**

* **Impact:**
    *   **Undetected Attacks:** Reduced (by providing the *data* for detection).
    *   **Difficult Incident Response:** Improved (by providing the *data* for investigation).
    *   **Lack of Visibility:** Improved (by providing detailed logs).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic logging is enabled.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Structured logging may not be fully utilized.
    *   A thorough review of the logging configuration to ensure all relevant events are captured may be needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration (Boulder Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/hardware_security_module__hsm__integration__boulder_configuration_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Boulder:** Modify Boulder's configuration (`config/boulder.json`) to use the HSM for key storage and cryptographic operations.  This involves specifying the PKCS#11 library path and slot/token information.
    2.  **Test HSM Integration:** Thoroughly test Boulder with the HSM.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Private Key Compromise (Critical Severity):**

* **Impact:**
    *   **Private Key Compromise:** Significantly reduced.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   All Boulder-specific configuration for HSM integration is missing.
