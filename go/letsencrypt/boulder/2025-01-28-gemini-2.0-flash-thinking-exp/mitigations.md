# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for letsencrypt/boulder

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Boulder Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_boulder_updates.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Subscribe to Security Mailing Lists/Watch Repositories:**  Monitor the official Let's Encrypt Boulder security channels, specifically their GitHub repository for release announcements and security advisories related to Boulder itself.
2.  **Establish Update Check Cadence:** Define a regular schedule to check for new Boulder releases and security patches *from the Boulder project*.
3.  **Review Boulder Release Notes:** When a new version of Boulder is released, carefully review the release notes and changelogs, focusing on security fixes, vulnerability patches, and security-related changes *within Boulder*.
4.  **Test Boulder in Staging Environment:** Before applying updates to production, deploy and test the new Boulder version in a staging environment that mirrors your production setup. This allows you to identify issues specific to *Boulder's update* in your environment.
5.  **Apply Boulder Updates to Production:** Once testing is successful, schedule and apply the Boulder updates to your production Boulder environment. Ensure all *Boulder components* are updated consistently.
6.  **Verification and Monitoring:** After updating Boulder, verify that all *Boulder components* are functioning correctly and monitor logs for any errors or unexpected behavior *related to the Boulder update*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Boulder (High Severity):**  Outdated Boulder software is susceptible to publicly known vulnerabilities *in the Boulder ACME server implementation* that attackers can exploit.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks targeting unpatched Boulder vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Unpatched vulnerabilities *within Boulder* can be exploited to launch DoS attacks against the Boulder infrastructure.

**Impact:**
*   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Boulder: **High Risk Reduction** -  Promptly patching Boulder vulnerabilities significantly reduces the attack surface *of the Boulder ACME server*.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks targeting unpatched Boulder vulnerabilities: **Medium Risk Reduction** - Boulder patches often address vulnerabilities that could be exploited for DoS, making the *Boulder system* more resilient.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   We have a monthly calendar reminder to check for Boulder updates on the GitHub repository.
*   Boulder updates are tested in our staging environment before production deployment.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   We are not currently subscribed to a dedicated security mailing list for Boulder (if one exists). We should investigate and subscribe.
*   The Boulder update process is manual. We could explore automating the update process for staging environments to improve efficiency and ensure timely patching of *Boulder*.
