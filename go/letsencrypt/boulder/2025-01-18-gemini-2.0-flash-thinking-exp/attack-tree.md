## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Boulder Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_boulder_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has gained unauthorized access or control over the application by exploiting Boulder.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Unauthorized Certificates (HIGH-RISK PATH START) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_unauthorized_certificates__high-risk_path_start___critical_node_.md)

This is a primary and direct way to compromise an application relying on TLS certificates. If an attacker can obtain a valid certificate for a domain they don't control, they can impersonate the legitimate owner.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Domain Control Validation (DCV) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_domain_control_validation__dcv___critical_node_.md)

DCV is the core mechanism preventing unauthorized certificate issuance. Successfully bypassing it is a critical step in obtaining unauthorized certificates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ACME Protocol Flaws (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_acme_protocol_flaws__high-risk_path_.md)

The ACME protocol defines how certificate issuance requests and validations are handled. Flaws in its implementation can allow attackers to circumvent security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Specific Challenge Types (HTTP-01, DNS-01) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_specific_challenge_types__http-01__dns-01___high-risk_path_.md)

These are the most common methods for proving domain control. Exploiting weaknesses in their handling is a direct route to bypassing DCV.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in HTTP-01 Challenge Handling (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_http-01_challenge_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

**Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Vulnerabilities:** An attacker might manipulate the `.well-known/acme-challenge` file after Boulder checks its presence but before it validates its content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in DNS-01 Challenge Handling (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_dns-01_challenge_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

**DNS Rebinding Attacks:** An attacker might manipulate DNS records after Boulder resolves them but before it validates the TXT record, potentially proving control of a domain they don't own.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Existing Account Credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH START) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_existing_account_credentials__high-risk_path_start___critical_node_.md)

If an attacker gains access to a legitimate account within Boulder, they can issue certificates for domains associated with that account, bypassing the need to exploit DCV directly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Boulder's Account Management Features (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_boulder's_account_management_features__high-risk_path_.md)

Weaknesses in how Boulder manages user accounts can be exploited to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Password Policies (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_password_policies__high-risk_path_.md)

If Boulder allows users to set weak passwords, attackers can use brute-force or dictionary attacks to guess credentials.
        * **Brute-force or Dictionary Attacks:**  Systematically trying different password combinations until the correct one is found.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_multi-factor_authentication__high-risk_path_.md)

Without MFA, if an attacker obtains a user's password (through phishing, data breaches, etc.), they can directly access the account.
        * **Gain Access with Stolen Credentials:** Using compromised usernames and passwords to log into a Boulder account.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Certificate Issuance and Management (HIGH-RISK PATH START) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_certificate_issuance_and_management__high-risk_path_start___critical_node_.md)

While not directly leading to unauthorized certificates, disrupting Boulder's ability to issue and manage certificates can have a significant impact on applications relying on it, leading to service outages and security warnings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on Boulder (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_on_boulder__high-risk_path_start_.md)

Overwhelming Boulder with requests can make it unavailable for legitimate users, preventing certificate issuance and renewal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion__high-risk_path_.md)

Flooding Boulder with requests to consume its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), making it unable to respond to legitimate requests.
        * **Send a Large Number of Invalid or Malformed Requests:**  Submitting a high volume of requests that are designed to consume resources or trigger errors in Boulder.
