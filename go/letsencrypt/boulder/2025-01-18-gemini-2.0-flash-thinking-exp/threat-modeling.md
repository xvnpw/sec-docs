# Threat Model Analysis for letsencrypt/boulder

## Threat: [ACME Protocol Vulnerabilities](./threats/acme_protocol_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a flaw in Boulder's implementation of the ACME protocol. This could involve crafting malicious ACME messages to bypass validation checks or trigger unexpected behavior. For example, an attacker might manipulate challenge responses to prove control over a domain they don't own.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to obtain valid TLS certificates for domains they do not control. This can lead to phishing attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and domain impersonation, severely damaging the reputation and security of the affected domains and users.
*   **Affected Component:** `acme` package (specifically challenge handlers, state machine, and message parsing logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Boulder updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Thoroughly review Boulder's release notes and security advisories.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the ACME handling logic.
    *   Consider fuzzing Boulder's ACME implementation to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Domain Validation Bypass](./threats/domain_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker finds a way to circumvent Boulder's domain control validation mechanisms. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in DNS propagation checks, HTTP/TLS challenge responses, or other validation methods. For instance, an attacker might manipulate DNS records temporarily or exploit race conditions in the validation process.
*   **Impact:**  Similar to ACME protocol vulnerabilities, successful bypass allows attackers to obtain certificates for unauthorized domains, leading to phishing, MITM attacks, and domain impersonation.
*   **Affected Component:** `acme` package (specifically the validation logic for different challenge types like `http-01`, `dns-01`, `tls-alpn-01`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement multiple independent validation checks.
    *   Enforce strict adherence to ACME specifications.
    *   Monitor DNS records for unexpected changes during validation.
    *   Implement timeouts and retries for validation attempts to mitigate race conditions.

## Threat: [Revocation Request Forgery](./threats/revocation_request_forgery.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker successfully crafts and submits a fraudulent certificate revocation request for a legitimate certificate. This could be achieved by exploiting weaknesses in the revocation request authentication or authorization process within Boulder.
*   **Impact:** Legitimate certificates are revoked, causing denial of service for the services relying on those certificates. This can lead to website downtime and loss of trust.
*   **Affected Component:** `ca` package (specifically the revocation handling logic and authentication mechanisms for revocation requests).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for revocation requests, potentially requiring proof of control over the private key.
    *   Log and monitor revocation requests for suspicious activity.
    *   Consider implementing a delay or confirmation step for revocation requests.

## Threat: [Private Key Compromise](./threats/private_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** The private key used by Boulder to sign certificates is compromised. This could occur due to insecure key storage practices within the Boulder deployment, insider threats with access to the key, or successful attacks targeting the systems hosting Boulder's key material.
*   **Impact:** Catastrophic. An attacker with the signing key can issue arbitrary certificates for any domain, completely undermining the trust in the entire certificate ecosystem.
*   **Affected Component:** Key management system (potentially involving HSM integration or software-based key storage within Boulder's operational environment).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store the private key in a Hardware Security Module (HSM) with strong access controls.
    *   Implement strict access controls to the systems hosting Boulder.
    *   Regularly audit access to the private key and related systems.
    *   Implement strong encryption for the private key if stored in software.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Boulder's Core Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_boulder's_core_code.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within the Boulder codebase itself, such as buffer overflows, injection flaws, or logic errors. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to Boulder's internal state, manipulate data, or cause denial of service of the CA functionality.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of potential impacts, from data breaches and unauthorized access to complete system compromise of the CA, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability within the Boulder codebase.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Boulder updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Participate in or monitor Boulder's security disclosure process.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Boulder deployment.
    *   Follow secure coding practices during any custom development or modifications to Boulder.

## Threat: [Database Compromise](./threats/database_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** The database used by Boulder to store certificate information, account details, and other critical data is compromised due to vulnerabilities in Boulder's interaction with the database or weaknesses in database access controls. This could be due to SQL injection vulnerabilities in Boulder's code, weak database credentials used by Boulder, or insufficient authorization checks within Boulder's database access layer.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers could gain access to sensitive information, including private keys (if accessible through the database), certificate details, and user accounts. They could also manipulate the database to issue or revoke certificates maliciously.
*   **Affected Component:** Database interaction layer within Boulder and potentially the underlying database system configuration as it relates to Boulder's access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the database with strong authentication and authorization specifically for Boulder's access.
    *   Implement encryption at rest and in transit for database connections used by Boulder.
    *   Regularly patch and update the database system.
    *   Follow secure coding practices to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities in Boulder's database interactions.
    *   Implement strict access controls to the database server, limiting access for Boulder to only necessary operations.
