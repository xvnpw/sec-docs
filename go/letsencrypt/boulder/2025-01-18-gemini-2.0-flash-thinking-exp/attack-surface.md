## Attack Surface: [Domain Validation Bypass via ACME Challenges](./attack_surfaces/domain_validation_bypass_via_acme_challenges.md)

* **Description:** Domain Validation Bypass via ACME Challenges
    * **How Boulder Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Boulder's core function is to verify domain ownership through ACME challenges (HTTP-01, DNS-01, TLS-ALPN-01). Vulnerabilities in these challenge mechanisms can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the HTTP-01 challenge verification by manipulating DNS records or web server configurations to falsely prove control of a domain.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized certificate issuance for domains the attacker does not control, enabling phishing attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and domain impersonation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Adhere strictly to ACME protocol specifications and best practices.
        * Implement multiple validation methods and consider requiring more than one for high-value domains.
        * Regularly audit and test the implementation of challenge verification mechanisms.
        * Ensure proper handling of edge cases and potential race conditions in challenge processing.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Replay Attacks](./attack_surfaces/authorization_replay_attacks.md)

* **Description:** Authorization Replay Attacks
    * **How Boulder Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Boulder grants authorizations for certificate issuance based on successful challenge completion. If these authorizations are not properly invalidated or have overly long lifespans, they can be reused.
    * **Example:** An attacker successfully completes a challenge for a domain. They then reuse the authorization at a later time, potentially after losing control of the domain, to obtain a new certificate.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized certificate issuance, potentially for domains no longer under the requester's control.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement short expiration times for authorizations.
        * Ensure proper invalidation of authorizations after certificate issuance or failure.
        * Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent the reuse of authorizations.

## Attack Surface: [Private Key Exposure (Internal)](./attack_surfaces/private_key_exposure__internal_.md)

* **Description:** Private Key Exposure (Internal)
    * **How Boulder Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Boulder holds the private keys used to sign certificates. Compromise of these keys would be catastrophic.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the server or storage where Boulder's signing keys are located, potentially through a vulnerability in the operating system or a misconfiguration.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the CA, ability to issue fraudulent certificates for any domain, undermining trust in the entire system.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Employ Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for secure key generation and storage.
        * Implement strict access controls and auditing for key management systems.
        * Follow best practices for key lifecycle management, including secure key rotation.
        * Encrypt private keys at rest and in transit.

## Attack Surface: [Internal API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/internal_api_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Internal API Vulnerabilities
    * **How Boulder Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Boulder exposes internal APIs for management and operation. Vulnerabilities in these APIs can be exploited for unauthorized access or control.
    * **Example:** An attacker discovers an authentication bypass vulnerability in an internal API endpoint, allowing them to perform administrative actions without proper credentials.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to modify CA configurations, potential for complete compromise of the CA.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for all internal APIs.
        * Regularly audit and penetration test internal APIs for vulnerabilities.
        * Follow secure coding practices when developing and maintaining internal APIs.
        * Limit access to internal APIs to only authorized personnel and systems.
