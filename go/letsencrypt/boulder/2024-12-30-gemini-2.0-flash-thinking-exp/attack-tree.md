Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Let's Encrypt Boulder - High-Risk Sub-Tree

Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized control or cause significant disruption to an application that relies on certificates issued by a Let's Encrypt Boulder instance.

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

High-Risk Path 1: Obtain Valid Certificate for Unauthorized Domain/Subdomain -> Compromise Existing Domain Infrastructure

*   **Goal:** Obtain a valid certificate for a domain the attacker does not legitimately control.
*   **Critical Node:** Bypass Domain Ownership Validation - This is the central point where the attacker circumvents Boulder's intended security mechanism.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Gain Control of DNS Records:**
        *   Exploit vulnerabilities in DNS provider's infrastructure: Attackers target weaknesses in the DNS provider's systems to directly manipulate DNS records. This requires knowledge of specific vulnerabilities and potentially significant effort.
        *   Compromise DNS registrar account: Attackers use techniques like phishing, credential stuffing, or social engineering to gain access to the domain's registrar account, allowing them to modify DNS records. This is often a lower-effort attack compared to exploiting infrastructure vulnerabilities.
    *   **Gain Control of Web Server:**
        *   Exploit vulnerabilities in the web server hosting the domain: Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to gain control. This requires identifying and exploiting these flaws.
        *   Obtain credentials for the web server: Attackers use techniques like brute-forcing, password guessing, or phishing to obtain valid credentials for the web server, granting them access.

High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Boulder's Certificate Issuance Process -> Certificate Revocation Issues

*   **Goal:** Successfully use a compromised certificate despite it being revoked.
*   **Critical Node:** Bypassing Revocation Checks - This is the point where the application fails to enforce the revocation status of a certificate.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Application does not properly check certificate revocation status (OCSP, CRL):** The application is not configured or implemented to verify the revocation status of certificates it encounters. This is a common oversight in application development.
    *   **Attacker uses a revoked certificate without detection:** Because the application doesn't check revocation status, the attacker can continue using a compromised certificate even after it has been revoked by the issuing CA.

High-Risk Path 3: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Boulder's Certificate Issuance Process -> Vulnerabilities in Boulder's Dependencies

*   **Goal:** Compromise Boulder's functionality by exploiting vulnerabilities in its underlying libraries.
*   **Critical Node:** Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Libraries - This is the point where a known security flaw in a dependency is leveraged to attack Boulder.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Identify outdated or vulnerable libraries used by Boulder:** Attackers use vulnerability scanners or public databases to identify outdated or vulnerable libraries that Boulder depends on. This information is often publicly available.
    *   **Exploit those vulnerabilities to compromise Boulder's functionality:** Attackers leverage the identified vulnerabilities to execute malicious code, gain unauthorized access, or disrupt Boulder's operations. The specific exploit depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency.

Critical Nodes Breakdown:

*   **Bypass Domain Ownership Validation:** This node represents a fundamental weakness in the certificate issuance process. If an attacker can bypass this, they can obtain certificates for any domain.
*   **Compromise Existing Domain Infrastructure:** While not a direct Boulder vulnerability, it's a critical step in a high-risk path. Gaining control of the domain's infrastructure allows attackers to manipulate validation challenges.
*   **Bypassing Revocation Checks:** This node represents a failure in the application's security implementation, allowing the continued use of compromised certificates.
*   **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Libraries:** This node highlights the risk of using third-party libraries and the importance of keeping them updated. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can directly compromise Boulder's security.
