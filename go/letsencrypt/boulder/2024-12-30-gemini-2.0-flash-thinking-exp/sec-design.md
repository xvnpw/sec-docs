## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced architectural design of the Boulder project, the ACME Certificate Authority (CA) server developed by Let's Encrypt. This revised document aims to provide a more granular understanding of the system's components, their interactions, and the overall architecture, specifically tailored for subsequent threat modeling activities.

This design is based on the publicly available source code repository: [https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder).

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of the Boulder project are:

* **Automated Certificate Management:** Implement the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol (RFC 8555) to automate the process of obtaining and renewing TLS/SSL certificates.
* **Scalability and Reliability:** Design a system capable of handling a large volume of certificate requests and maintaining high availability with minimal downtime.
* **Security:** Ensure the security and integrity of the certificate issuance process, the private keys involved, and the confidentiality of user data.
* **Compliance:** Adhere to relevant industry standards and best practices for certificate authorities, including those defined by the CA/Browser Forum.
* **Open Source:** Provide a transparent and auditable implementation of an ACME CA, fostering community trust and scrutiny.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

Boulder employs a microservices-oriented architecture, with well-defined components responsible for specific functionalities. These components communicate via APIs and rely on a shared database for persistent storage.

* **Key Components:**
    * **`va` (Validation Authority):**  The component responsible for executing and verifying domain control validation (DCV) challenges.
    * **`pebble` (ACME Server):** The central ACME protocol endpoint, responsible for handling client requests, managing state, and orchestrating the certificate issuance lifecycle.
    * **`ra` (Registration Authority):** Manages ACME account registration, key management, and associated account metadata.
    * **`caa-responder`:**  Handles Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) record lookups to ensure certificate issuance complies with domain owner policies.
    * **`signer`:**  Performs the critical cryptographic signing operations for issuing certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and OCSP responses.
    * **`ocsp-responder`:** Provides Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses, allowing clients to check the revocation status of certificates in real-time.
    * **Database:** A persistent storage layer for accounts, authorizations, orders, certificates, and revocation information.
    * **Metrics and Monitoring:** Components responsible for collecting, aggregating, and exposing system metrics for operational monitoring and alerting.

* **External Interactions:**
    * **ACME Clients:** Software agents running on web servers or other systems that interact with Boulder via the ACME protocol to request and manage certificates.
    * **DNS Servers:** Used by `va` for DNS-based validation and by `caa-responder` for CAA record lookups.
    * **Certificate Transparency (CT) Logs:** Publicly auditable append-only logs where issued certificates are submitted for transparency and accountability.

## 4. Component Details

This section provides a more detailed description of each key component within the Boulder architecture, focusing on aspects relevant to security and threat modeling.
