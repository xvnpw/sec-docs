### High and Critical Boulder Threats

Here are the high and critical threats directly involving the Boulder Certificate Authority (CA) software:

**ACME Server Threats:**

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Account Creation leading to Certificate Spam
    *   **Description:** An attacker could automate the creation of a large number of ACME accounts by bypassing rate limits or exploiting weaknesses in the account creation process. This could be done by repeatedly sending account creation requests or exploiting vulnerabilities in the registration endpoint.
    *   **Impact:** Resource exhaustion on the Boulder server, potential for abuse of issued certificates, and difficulty in managing legitimate accounts.
    *   **Affected Component:** `acme/api/newAccount` endpoint, account registration logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust rate limiting on account creation, CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to prevent automated registrations, monitor for suspicious account creation patterns.

*   **Threat:** ACME Account Takeover via Weak Password Recovery
    *   **Description:** If the password recovery mechanism for ACME accounts is weak (e.g., predictable security questions, insecure password reset links), an attacker could gain control of legitimate accounts. They might try to guess security questions or intercept password reset emails.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to issue certificates for domains associated with the compromised account, potentially leading to impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** `acme/api/recoverAccount` endpoint, account management logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong password recovery mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication, secure password reset flows), enforce strong password policies.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in ACME Challenge Handling (e.g., DNS-01 Rebinding)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate DNS records during a DNS-01 challenge to trick Boulder into validating their control over a domain they don't own. This involves making the DNS record point to the attacker's server during the validation window.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized certificate issuance for arbitrary domains.
    *   **Affected Component:** `acme/handler/challenge`, DNS-01 challenge validation logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust DNS validation checks, including multiple lookups from different vantage points, consider using alternative challenge types (e.g., HTTP-01).

*   **Threat:** Replay Attacks on ACME Requests
    *   **Description:** An attacker could intercept valid ACME requests (e.g., new order, finalize) and replay them to perform unauthorized actions. This could involve capturing network traffic and resending requests.
    *   **Impact:** Unintended certificate issuance, modification of account details, or other unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `acme/handler`, request processing logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement nonce-based protection for ACME requests, enforce request idempotency where applicable, use secure communication channels (HTTPS).

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion on ACME Endpoints
    *   **Description:** An attacker could flood Boulder's ACME endpoints with a large number of requests (e.g., new order, challenge requests) to overwhelm the server and make it unavailable for legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Inability for users to obtain or renew certificates, disrupting services relying on those certificates.
    *   **Affected Component:** All `acme/api/*` endpoints, request processing infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting on all ACME endpoints, use load balancing and auto-scaling infrastructure, implement request filtering and anomaly detection.

**CA Core Threats:**

*   **Threat:** Private Key Compromise due to Vulnerabilities in Key Generation/Storage
    *   **Description:** If there are vulnerabilities in Boulder's key generation or storage mechanisms, an attacker could potentially gain access to the CA's private key. This could involve exploiting software bugs or weaknesses in the hardware security module (HSM) integration.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the CA, allowing the attacker to issue arbitrary trusted certificates.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ca/signer`, key management module, HSM integration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Use robust and well-audited key generation and storage mechanisms (e.g., HSMs), implement strict access controls to key material, regularly audit key management practices.

*   **Threat:** Certificate Revocation Failures due to Logic Errors
    *   **Description:** Bugs in Boulder's certificate revocation logic could prevent legitimate revocations from being processed or propagated correctly. This could involve errors in the revocation processing workflow or issues with generating and distributing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised certificates might remain trusted for longer than intended, allowing attackers to continue exploiting them.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ca/revoke`, revocation processing logic, CRL/OCSP generation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Thoroughly test revocation workflows, implement monitoring for revocation failures, ensure proper generation and distribution of CRLs and OCSP responses.

**Database Threats:**

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Database Interactions
    *   **Description:** If Boulder's code that interacts with the database (e.g., for storing accounts, authorizations, certificates) is vulnerable to SQL injection, an attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could be achieved by injecting malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, modification of sensitive data, potential for complete database compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data access layer, any module interacting with the database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions, implement input sanitization and validation, follow secure coding practices.
