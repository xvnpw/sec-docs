# Attack Surface Analysis for nsqio/nsq

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Message Injection](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_message_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious messages into NSQ topics.
*   **How NSQ Contributes:** NSQ's core function is message passing. Without proper application-level controls, it inherently allows any connected client to publish messages.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a message containing a specially crafted payload designed to exploit a vulnerability in a consuming application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) in consuming applications.
    *   Data corruption or modification.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) of consuming applications.
    *   Information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Application-Level Authentication & Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization *within the application logic*. Producers should include authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs) in messages. Consumers *must* validate these tokens. This is the *primary* defense, and is application-level, but is *required* due to NSQ's design.
    *   **Input Validation:** Consumers *must* rigorously validate and sanitize *all* data received from NSQ. This is application-level, but *required* due to NSQ's design.
    *   **Message Schema Validation:** Define and enforce a strict message schema. This is application-level, but *required* due to NSQ's design.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate NSQ.
    *   **TLS Encryption:** Use TLS.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) against `nsqd`](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__against__nsqd_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm `nsqd` with connections, messages, or slow requests.
*   **How NSQ Contributes:** `nsqd` is a network service that accepts connections and processes messages. It has finite resources.
*   **Example:**
    *   Connection Flood.
    *   Message Flood.
    *   Slowloris.
    *   Large Message Attack.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Inability for producers to publish messages.
    *   Inability for consumers to receive messages.
    *   System instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting.
    *   **Connection Limits:** Use `nsqd`'s `--max-connections`.
    *   **Message Size Limits:** Use `nsqd`'s `--max-msg-size`.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor `nsqd`'s resource usage.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate `nsqd`.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Control access to `nsqd`'s TCP port.
    *   **DDoS Protection:** Consider a DDoS mitigation service.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd` HTTP Interfaces](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to__nsqd__and__nsqlookupd__http_interfaces.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to the administrative HTTP interfaces.
*   **How NSQ Contributes:** `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd` expose HTTP interfaces for monitoring and administration.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses the `/stats` endpoint without authentication. Or, an attacker uses an exposed `nsqlookupd` endpoint to deregister a legitimate `nsqd`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure.
    *   Denial of Service.
    *   Configuration manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Restrictions:** Restrict access using `--http-address` and firewall rules.
    *   **Authentication (Proxy):** Implement authentication using a reverse proxy.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Endpoints:** Disable or block unneeded endpoints.
    *   **TLS Encryption:** Use TLS.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to `nsqadmin`](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to__nsqadmin_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to the `nsqadmin` web UI.
*   **How NSQ Contributes:** `nsqadmin` provides a centralized web interface for managing the NSQ cluster.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses `nsqadmin` without authentication and deletes a topic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure.
    *   Denial of Service.
    *   Data loss.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication:** *Require* authentication for access.
    *   **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF protection.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Run `nsqadmin` on a restricted network.
    *   **TLS Encryption:** Use TLS.
    *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Without TLS)](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__without_tls_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers intercept and potentially modify communication between NSQ components.
*   **How NSQ Contributes:** NSQ relies on network communication. Without encryption, this communication is vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker captures messages, exposing sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure.
    *   Message tampering.
    *   Disruption of message flow.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **TLS Encryption:** Use TLS for *all* communication within the NSQ cluster.
    *   **Certificate Verification:** Ensure proper TLS certificate verification.
