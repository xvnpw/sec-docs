## Attack Tree Path: [1. DoS via NSQ [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__dos_via_nsq__high_risk_.md)

*   **Goal:** Render the application unavailable by overwhelming the NSQ infrastructure.
*   **Sub-Goal: Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Attack Vector: Flood Topics [HIGH RISK]**
        *   *Description:* Create an excessive number of topics, exceeding the system's or application's capacity to handle them. NSQ does not enforce limits on topic creation by default.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation:* Implement application-level limits on topic creation. Monitor topic counts.
    *   **Attack Vector: Flood Channels [HIGH RISK]**
        *   *Description:* Create an excessive number of channels within topics, similar to topic flooding. NSQ does not enforce limits on channel creation by default.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation:* Implement application-level limits on channel creation. Monitor channel counts.
    *   **Attack Vector: Slow Consumers [HIGH RISK]**
        *   *Description:* Intentionally slow down message consumption, causing a backlog of messages in NSQD and potentially leading to resource exhaustion (memory, disk).
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation:* Monitor consumer lag. Implement timeouts and error handling for slow consumers. Use `nsqadmin`. Consider auto-scaling.
    *   **Attack Vector: Flood with Large Messages [HIGH RISK]**
        *   *Description:* Send messages that are excessively large, consuming network bandwidth and memory on `nsqd` instances.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium (if no size limits) / Low (if size limits are enforced)
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation:* Enforce maximum message size limits using the `--max-msg-size` flag on `nsqd`.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Message Tampering [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__message_tampering__high_risk_.md)

*   **Goal:** Modify or inject messages to disrupt application logic or exfiltrate data.
*   **Sub-Goal: Modify Messages [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Intercept and alter the content of messages in transit.  Highly effective if TLS is not used.
    *   *Likelihood:* Low (with TLS) / High (without TLS)
    *   *Impact:* Very High
    *   *Effort:* Low (without TLS) / High (with TLS)
    *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate (without TLS) / Expert (with TLS)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard (without TLS or message signing) / Very Hard (with TLS and message signing)
    *   *Mitigation:* **Always use TLS encryption** for all NSQ connections.
*   **Sub-Goal: Inject Malicious Payloads [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Send messages with crafted content designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the consumer application (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
    *   *Impact:* Very High
    *   *Effort:* Medium to High
    *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate to Advanced
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard
    *   *Mitigation:* Thoroughly validate and sanitize all message data in the consumer application. Treat message content as untrusted input.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. NSQLookupd Exploit](./attack_tree_paths/3__nsqlookupd_exploit.md)

*    **Goal:** Compromise `nsqlookupd` to disrupt service discovery or redirect clients.
*   **Sub-Goal: Spoof Lookupd [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Run a rogue `nsqlookupd` instance that provides incorrect information (e.g., addresses of malicious `nsqd` nodes) to clients.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
    *   *Impact:* High
    *   *Effort:* Low
    *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
    *   *Mitigation:* Use TLS. Configure clients to connect to specific, trusted `nsqlookupd` instances.
*   **Sub-Goal: Return Fake NSQD Addresses [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Compromise a legitimate `nsqlookupd` instance to return the addresses of malicious `nsqd` nodes.
    *   *Likelihood:* Low
    *   *Impact:* Very High
    *   *Effort:* High
    *   *Skill Level:* Advanced
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard
    *   *Mitigation:* Use TLS. Restrict network access to `nsqlookupd`. Monitor logs.
