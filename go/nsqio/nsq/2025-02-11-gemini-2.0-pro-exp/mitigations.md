# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nsqio/nsq

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Segmentation and Firewall Rules (NSQ Components)](./mitigation_strategies/network_segmentation_and_firewall_rules__nsq_components_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Network Segmentation and Firewall Rules (NSQ Components)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify NSQ Components:** List all `nsqd`, `nsqlookupd`, and `nsqadmin` instances.
    2.  **Private Subnet:** Place all NSQ components within a dedicated, private subnet.
    3.  **Configure Firewall Rules:** Create strict firewall rules that:
        *   **Allow:** Inbound connections to `nsqd` *only* from authorized producer/consumer IPs/subnets on the NSQ port (default: 4150 TCP, 4151 HTTPS).
        *   **Allow:** Inbound connections to `nsqlookupd` *only* from `nsqd` instances and authorized consumer IPs/subnets (default: 4160 TCP, 4161 HTTPS).
        *   **Allow:** Inbound connections to `nsqadmin` *only* from a very limited set of trusted administrative IPs/subnets (default: 4171).  Ideally, use a jump box.
        *   **Deny:** All other inbound traffic to the NSQ subnet.
        *   **Allow:** Outbound traffic from `nsqd` to `nsqlookupd` and vice-versa.
        *   **Allow:** Outbound traffic from producers/consumers to the appropriate `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd` instances.
        *   **Deny:** All other outbound traffic.
    4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update firewall rules.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to NSQ Components (High Severity):** Prevents direct connections from unauthorized networks.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Limits the attack surface.
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Reduces eavesdropping risk (when combined with TLS).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High reduction.
    *   **DoS:** Medium reduction.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** High reduction (with TLS).

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Partially. `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd` are in a private subnet, but firewall rules are too broad. `nsqadmin` is accessible from the internal network.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Refine firewall rules to allow access only from specific IPs/subnets.
    *   Restrict `nsqadmin` access to a jump box or very limited IPs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TLS Encryption and mTLS Authentication (NSQ Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/tls_encryption_and_mtls_authentication__nsq_configuration_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: TLS Encryption and mTLS Authentication (NSQ Configuration)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Certificates:** Create a CA or use an existing internal CA. Generate server certificates for each `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd` instance, signed by the CA. Generate client certificates for authorized producers and consumers, also signed by the CA.
    2.  **Configure `nsqd`:** Configure `nsqd` instances with:
        *   `--tls-cert`: Path to the server certificate.
        *   `--tls-key`: Path to the server's private key.
        *   `--tls-client-auth-policy`: Set to `requireverify` to enforce client certificate authentication.
        *   `--tls-root-ca-file`: Path to the CA certificate.
    3.  **Configure `nsqlookupd`:** Configure `nsqlookupd` instances similarly to `nsqd`.
    4.  **Disable Plaintext:** Ensure plaintext connections are disabled (no fallback).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to NSQ Components (High Severity):** mTLS prevents unauthorized connections.
    *   **Message Tampering/Injection (High Severity):** TLS prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** TLS protects confidentiality.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High reduction.
    *   **Message Tampering/Injection:** High reduction.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** High reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   TLS is enabled, but mTLS is *not* implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Generate and distribute client certificates.
    *   Configure `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd` to require client certificate verification (`--tls-client-auth-policy=requireverify`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection and Message Size Limits (nsqd)](./mitigation_strategies/connection_and_message_size_limits__nsqd_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Connection and Message Size Limits (nsqd)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Capacity:** Determine appropriate limits based on your system's resources and expected load.
    2.  **Configure `nsqd`:**
        *   `--max-connections`: Set a reasonable maximum number of concurrent connections to `nsqd`.
        *   `--max-msg-size`: Set a maximum message size (in bytes) to prevent excessively large messages.
    3. **Monitor:** Regularly monitor connection counts and message sizes to ensure the limits are effective and adjust as needed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents resource exhaustion due to excessive connections or large messages.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Medium reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   `--max-msg-size` is set, but `--max-connections` is not explicitly configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `--max-connections` should be configured on all `nsqd` instances.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict `nsqadmin` Access](./mitigation_strategies/restrict__nsqadmin__access.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Restrict `nsqadmin` Access**
* **Description:**
    1.  **Limited Network Access:** Configure firewall rules to allow access to `nsqadmin` *only* from a very limited set of trusted administrative IPs or a jump box.
    2.  **On-Demand Operation (Ideal):** If possible, run `nsqadmin` only when needed, and not continuously on production servers.
    3. **Reverse Proxy with Authentication (If Continuous Access is Required):** Place `nsqadmin` behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) that handles authentication (basic auth, OAuth, etc.).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to `nsqadmin` (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from accessing the web UI.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of exposing message data through `nsqadmin`.

*   **Impact:**
    *    **Unauthorized Access:** High Reduction
    *    **Information Disclosure:** Medium Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   `nsqadmin` is running continuously and is accessible from the internal network.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Restrict network access to `nsqadmin`.
    *   Consider running `nsqadmin` on-demand or behind a reverse proxy with authentication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates and Dependency Management (NSQ Binaries)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_and_dependency_management__nsq_binaries_.md)

**5. Mitigation Strategy:  Regular Updates and Dependency Management (NSQ Binaries)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check for new releases of NSQ (both `nsqd`, `nsqlookupd`, and `nsqadmin`).
    2.  **Apply Updates Promptly:**  Apply security patches and updates as soon as they are available.
    3.  **Dependency Scanning (If Building from Source):** If you build NSQ from source, use vulnerability scanning tools to identify and address any vulnerabilities in its dependencies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in NSQ Codebase (High Severity):**  Addresses known security flaws in NSQ itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in NSQ Codebase:** High reduction (if updates are applied promptly).

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Updates are applied periodically, but not immediately upon release.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a more proactive update process to apply security patches as soon as they are available.
