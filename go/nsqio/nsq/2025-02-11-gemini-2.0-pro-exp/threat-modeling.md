# Threat Model Analysis for nsqio/nsq

## Threat: [Rogue `nsqd` Instance](./threats/rogue__nsqd__instance.md)

*   **Threat:** Rogue `nsqd` Instance
    *   **Description:** An attacker introduces a malicious `nsqd` instance into the network. Producers, through `nsqlookupd` discovery, connect to this rogue instance and send messages to it.  The attacker controls this instance.
    *   **Impact:** Message loss (messages never reach intended consumers), message interception (attacker gains access to sensitive data), and potential for further attacks by manipulating the rogue `nsqd`.
    *   **Affected Component:** `nsqd`, `nsqlookupd` (discovery process)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use TLS with server-side certificates for *all* `nsqd` instances.  Clients (producers and consumers) *must* be configured to verify the `nsqd` certificate against a trusted CA.  This is crucial.
        *   Statically configure `nsqlookupd` addresses in clients, bypassing dynamic discovery if feasible and appropriate for the deployment. This reduces the attack surface.
        *   Implement monitoring to detect unexpected `nsqd` instances joining the cluster (e.g., using `nsqadmin` API or custom scripts).  Alert on any new, unknown instances.

## Threat: [Rogue `nsqlookupd` Instance](./threats/rogue__nsqlookupd__instance.md)

*   **Threat:** Rogue `nsqlookupd` Instance
    *   **Description:** An attacker introduces a malicious `nsqlookupd` instance. Clients querying this rogue instance are directed to attacker-controlled `nsqd` instances.
    *   **Impact:** Producers and consumers connect to malicious `nsqd` instances, leading to message loss, interception, or manipulation.  This can completely disrupt the messaging system.
    *   **Affected Component:** `nsqlookupd`, `nsqd` (indirectly, through misdirection)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use TLS with server-side certificates for *all* `nsqlookupd` instances. Clients *must* be configured to verify the `nsqlookupd` certificate.
        *   Statically configure `nsqlookupd` addresses in clients. This is the most reliable way to prevent this attack.
        *   Network segmentation: Isolate `nsqlookupd` instances on a secure, dedicated network segment.
        *   Implement monitoring to detect unexpected `nsqlookupd` instances.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Message Production](./threats/unauthorized_message_production.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Message Production
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains network access and connects directly to an `nsqd` instance, bypassing application-level authentication. They publish messages to a topic, injecting malicious data or commands.
    *   **Impact:** The application processes fraudulent messages, leading to data corruption, incorrect state, execution of unintended actions, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `nsqd` (TCP listener, message handling logic)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a *mandatory* authentication proxy service *before* `nsqd`. This proxy validates credentials (API keys, JWTs, etc.) before forwarding messages.  This is the preferred solution.
        *   Use TLS with client-side certificates. Configure `nsqd` to *require* client certificates and verify them against a trusted CA.
        *   Network segmentation: Restrict network access to `nsqd` to only authorized producer IPs/networks using firewalls or network policies.

## Threat: [Message Tampering in Transit](./threats/message_tampering_in_transit.md)

*   **Threat:** Message Tampering in Transit
    *   **Description:** An attacker with network access intercepts messages between producers, `nsqd`, and consumers. They modify the message content before forwarding.
    *   **Impact:** The application processes corrupted or manipulated data, leading to incorrect results, state corruption, or execution of unintended actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network communication between all NSQ components (producers, `nsqd`, `nsqlookupd`, consumers)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS encryption for *all* communication between NSQ components and clients. This is the primary and most effective defense.
        *   Implement message-level integrity checks (HMAC, digital signatures) within the message payload. Consumers verify these checks before processing.

## Threat: [Message Eavesdropping](./threats/message_eavesdropping.md)

*   **Threat:** Message Eavesdropping
    *   **Description:** An attacker with network access passively listens to communication between NSQ components and clients, capturing message contents.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data contained within messages.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network communication between all NSQ components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if messages contain sensitive data)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS encryption for *all* NSQ communication. This is essential.

## Threat: [Message Flooding (DoS)](./threats/message_flooding__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Message Flooding (DoS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large volume of messages to an `nsqd` instance, exceeding its capacity.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for legitimate messages; `nsqd` becomes unresponsive or crashes.
    *   **Affected Component:** `nsqd` (message handling, queue management)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on message producers (at the application level or using a proxy).
        *   Configure appropriate message size limits (`--max-msg-size`) in `nsqd`.
        *   Use `nsqd`'s `--max-msg-timeout` to prevent messages from lingering indefinitely.
        *   Monitor `nsqd` resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and set alerts.
        *   Deploy multiple `nsqd` instances for horizontal scaling and load balancing.

## Threat: [Connection Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/connection_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Connection Exhaustion (DoS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker opens many connections to `nsqd` or `nsqlookupd`, exhausting their connection limits.
    *   **Impact:** Legitimate clients cannot connect to NSQ, disrupting the messaging system.
    *   **Affected Component:** `nsqd` (TCP listener), `nsqlookupd` (TCP listener)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure appropriate connection limits (`--max-connections`) in `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd`.
        *   Use a firewall to limit the number of connections from a single IP address or network.
        *   Monitor connection counts and set alerts for unusual activity.

## Threat: [NSQ Code Vulnerability (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/nsq_code_vulnerability__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Threat:** NSQ Code Vulnerability (Elevation of Privilege)
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in the NSQ codebase (e.g., buffer overflow, code injection) to gain control of an NSQ process.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for complete system compromise, data breach, or further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially any NSQ component (`nsqd`, `nsqlookupd`, `nsqadmin`, or supporting libraries)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep NSQ *up to date* with the latest releases and security patches. This is paramount.
        *   Run NSQ components with the *least necessary privileges* (avoid running as root).
        *   Use containerization (Docker) to isolate NSQ processes and limit access to the host system. Use minimal base images.
        *   Implement robust system monitoring and intrusion detection.

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering](./threats/configuration_file_tampering.md)

* **Threat:** Configuration File Tampering
    * **Description:** An attacker gains access to the server hosting NSQ components and modifies the configuration files (e.g., `nsqd.conf`, `nsqlookupd.conf`).
    * **Impact:** Changes to critical settings (message timeouts, data paths, security settings) can disrupt service, lead to data loss, or disable security features.
    * **Affected Component:** Configuration files of `nsqd`, `nsqlookupd`, and `nsqadmin`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control access to the servers hosting NSQ components. Use strong passwords, SSH keys, and multi-factor authentication.
        *   Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) to detect unauthorized changes to configuration files.
        *   Use configuration management tools (Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to manage and enforce the desired configuration state.
        *   Regularly back up configuration files to a secure location.
