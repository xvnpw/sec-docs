# Attack Surface Analysis for nsqio/nsq

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated TCP Access to `nsqd`](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_tcp_access_to__nsqd_.md)

*   **Description:** `nsqd` listens on a TCP port by default without requiring authentication.
*   **How NSQ Contributes:** The default configuration of `nsqd` exposes this port without mandatory authentication mechanisms.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network can connect to the `nsqd` port and publish arbitrary messages to existing topics or subscribe to topics and consume messages. They could also issue administrative commands if those endpoints are not further restricted.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Message injection leading to data corruption or application malfunction.
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive information in messages.
    *   Denial of service by flooding topics with messages or exhausting resources.
    *   Potential for unauthorized administrative actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate `nsqd` instances within a private network, restricting access from untrusted networks.
    *   **TLS Encryption with Client Authentication:** Enable TLS encryption and require client certificates for connections to `nsqd`. This provides both encryption and authentication.
    *   **Disable or Restrict Administrative Endpoints:** If not needed, disable or restrict access to administrative HTTP endpoints on `nsqd` using network firewalls or access control lists.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated HTTP API of `nsqd`](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_http_api_of__nsqd_.md)

*   **Description:** `nsqd` provides an HTTP API for administrative tasks and monitoring that is, by default, unauthenticated.
*   **How NSQ Contributes:**  `nsqd` inherently exposes this API without requiring authentication in its default configuration.
*   **Example:** An attacker gaining network access to the `nsqd` HTTP port can view topic and channel information, pause/unpause channels, empty queues, or even delete topics and channels, potentially disrupting message flow and causing data loss.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure about the NSQ cluster's state and message flow.
    *   Disruption of message processing by pausing or emptying queues.
    *   Data loss through deletion of topics and channels.
    *   Potential for denial of service by manipulating the broker's state.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  As above, isolate `nsqd` instances.
    *   **Reverse Proxy with Authentication:** Place `nsqd` behind a reverse proxy that enforces authentication before allowing access to the HTTP API.
    *   **Restrict Access via Firewall:**  Use firewall rules to limit access to the `nsqd` HTTP port to only authorized IP addresses or networks.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Web UI (`nsqadmin`)](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_web_ui___nsqadmin__.md)

*   **Description:** `nsqadmin`, the web UI for monitoring and managing NSQ, typically lacks built-in authentication by default.
*   **How NSQ Contributes:**  `nsqadmin` is designed for convenience and monitoring, and its default configuration often lacks robust authentication.
*   **Example:** If `nsqadmin` is exposed without authentication, anyone with network access can view cluster statistics, manage topics and channels, and potentially perform destructive actions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure about the NSQ cluster and message flow.
    *   Unauthorized modification or deletion of topics and channels.
    *   Disruption of message processing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Reverse Proxy with Authentication:**  The recommended approach is to place `nsqadmin` behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) that handles authentication (e.g., basic auth, OAuth).
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict access to the `nsqadmin` port to authorized administrators only.

## Attack Surface: [Message Injection and Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/message_injection_and_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** If `nsqd` is not properly secured, attackers can inject malicious messages into topics or potentially manipulate messages in transit.
*   **How NSQ Contributes:** The lack of default authentication and encryption allows for unauthorized message publishing and eavesdropping.
*   **Example:** An attacker could inject messages with harmful payloads that exploit vulnerabilities in message consumers or introduce incorrect data into the system. If TLS is not used, they could intercept and modify messages in transit.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data corruption or integrity issues in consuming applications.
    *   Execution of malicious code or unintended actions by consumers.
    *   Compromise of sensitive information if messages are intercepted.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS Encryption:** Encrypt communication between producers, `nsqd`, and consumers to prevent message interception and tampering.
    *   **Implement Authentication and Authorization:**  Verify the identity of message publishers.
