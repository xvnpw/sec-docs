# Attack Tree Analysis for nsqio/nsq

Objective: To compromise the application utilizing NSQ by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within NSQ itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* **Compromise Application via NSQ** (CRITICAL NODE)
    * **Disrupt Application Functionality** (HIGH-RISK PATH)
        * **Denial of Service on nsqd** (CRITICAL NODE)
        * **Denial of Service on nsqlookupd** (CRITICAL NODE)
    * **Gain Unauthorized Access/Information** (HIGH-RISK PATH)
        * **Eavesdrop on Message Traffic** (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)
        * **Inject Malicious Messages** (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)
        * **Access Sensitive Information via Messages** (HIGH-RISK PATH)
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via NSQ](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_nsq.md)

**Compromise Application via NSQ** (CRITICAL NODE)

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Application Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_application_functionality.md)

**Disrupt Application Functionality** (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    * **Denial of Service on nsqd** (CRITICAL NODE)
    * **Denial of Service on nsqlookupd** (CRITICAL NODE)

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service on nsqd](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_on_nsqd.md)

**Denial of Service on nsqd** (CRITICAL NODE)
    * Connection Exhaustion: Attacker opens a large number of connections to nsqd, exhausting its connection limit and preventing legitimate clients from connecting.
    * Resource Exhaustion: Attacker sends extremely large messages or a high volume of messages rapidly, overwhelming nsqd's CPU, memory, and disk I/O, leading to performance degradation or crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service on nsqlookupd](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_on_nsqlookupd.md)

**Denial of Service on nsqlookupd** (CRITICAL NODE)
    * Connection Exhaustion: Similar to nsqd, attacker exhausts nsqlookupd's connection limit.
    * Resource Exhaustion: Attacker registers a massive number of fake topics and channels, consuming nsqlookupd's memory and potentially causing it to slow down or crash, disrupting topic discovery.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access/Information](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_accessinformation.md)

**Gain Unauthorized Access/Information** (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    * **Eavesdrop on Message Traffic** (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)
    * **Inject Malicious Messages** (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)
    * **Access Sensitive Information via Messages** (HIGH-RISK PATH)

## Attack Tree Path: [Eavesdrop on Message Traffic](./attack_tree_paths/eavesdrop_on_message_traffic.md)

**Eavesdrop on Message Traffic** (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)
    * Sniff unencrypted TCP traffic: Attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and nsqd, reading message content due to the default lack of encryption in NSQ.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Messages](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_messages.md)

**Inject Malicious Messages** (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)
    * Publish messages to legitimate topics: Attacker, without authentication, publishes messages to topics the application is consuming from, potentially injecting malicious data or commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Information via Messages](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_information_via_messages.md)

**Access Sensitive Information via Messages** (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    * Exploit lack of encryption: If messages contain sensitive data and are not encrypted by the application, the attacker can read this data through eavesdropping.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application via NSQ](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_via_nsq.md)

* Compromise Application via NSQ:
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful exploitation of NSQ to negatively impact the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Denial of Service on nsqd](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_denial_of_service_on_nsqd.md)

* Denial of Service on nsqd:
    * Represents a critical point of failure. If nsqd is unavailable, the application's ability to process messages is severely impaired or completely halted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Denial of Service on nsqlookupd](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_denial_of_service_on_nsqlookupd.md)

* Denial of Service on nsqlookupd:
    * Represents a critical point of failure for service discovery. If nsqlookupd is unavailable, new consumers cannot discover topics, and the system's ability to scale and adapt is compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Eavesdrop on Message Traffic](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_eavesdrop_on_message_traffic.md)

* Eavesdrop on Message Traffic:
    * A critical point where the confidentiality of messages is breached, potentially exposing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Malicious Messages](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_messages.md)

* Inject Malicious Messages:
    * A critical point where the integrity and reliability of the message stream are compromised, potentially leading to application malfunction or data corruption.
