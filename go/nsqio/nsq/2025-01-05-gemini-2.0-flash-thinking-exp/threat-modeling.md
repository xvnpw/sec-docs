# Threat Model Analysis for nsqio/nsq

## Threat: [Malicious Message Injection](./threats/malicious_message_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a lack of authentication or authorization on producers to directly send crafted, malicious messages to an NSQ topic or channel.

**Impact:** Consumer applications might crash, behave unexpectedly, process incorrect data leading to data corruption, or execute malicious code if the message payload is not properly sanitized. This can lead to service disruption, data integrity issues, and potentially security breaches in downstream systems.

**Affected Component:** `nsqd` (receives the message).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for producers to prevent unauthorized message publishing.
* Use TLS encryption for communication between producers and `nsqd` to prevent eavesdropping and tampering (though this doesn't prevent a legitimate, but compromised, producer from sending malicious messages).

## Threat: [Message Tampering in Transit](./threats/message_tampering_in_transit.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts messages in transit between producers and `nsqd`, or between `nsqd` and consumers, and modifies the message content before it reaches its destination. This is possible if TLS encryption is not enabled.

**Impact:** Consumers might process incorrect or manipulated data, leading to flawed application logic, data corruption, or unintended actions. This can have significant business consequences depending on the sensitivity of the data.

**Affected Component:** Network communication channels facilitated by `nsqd`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce TLS encryption for all communication between NSQ components (producers, `nsqd`, consumers, `nsqlookupd`, `nsqadmin`).

## Threat: [Unauthorized Message Consumption / Information Disclosure](./threats/unauthorized_message_consumption__information_disclosure.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to an NSQ channel and consumes messages intended for other consumers. This could be due to misconfigured access controls within `nsqd` or a vulnerability in `nsqd` itself.

**Impact:** Sensitive information contained in the messages could be exposed to unauthorized parties, leading to data breaches, privacy violations, or competitive disadvantage.

**Affected Component:** `nsqd` (serving the messages).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper authorization mechanisms within `nsqd` (if available through configuration or extensions) to control which consumers can access specific channels.
* Use TLS encryption to protect message content in transit.

## Threat: [`nsqd` Denial of Service (DoS) via Message Flooding](./threats/_nsqd__denial_of_service__dos__via_message_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods an `nsqd` instance with a large volume of messages, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and preventing it from processing legitimate messages.

**Impact:** Service disruption, message processing delays, and potential unavailability of the application relying on NSQ.

**Affected Component:** `nsqd` (specifically the message ingestion and processing components).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on producers (this might need to be done outside of NSQ itself, at the application level, as NSQ doesn't have built-in per-producer rate limiting).
* Configure resource limits for `nsqd` (e.g., maximum message size, queue sizes).
* Monitor `nsqd` resource utilization and set up alerts for abnormal behavior.

## Threat: [Rogue `nsqd` Instance Registration with `nsqlookupd`](./threats/rogue__nsqd__instance_registration_with__nsqlookupd_.md)

**Description:** An attacker deploys a malicious `nsqd` instance and registers it with `nsqlookupd`. Legitimate consumers might then discover and connect to this rogue instance, potentially leading to message interception or injection.

**Impact:** Consumers might receive malicious or incorrect messages, and messages intended for legitimate brokers could be intercepted by the attacker.

**Affected Component:** `nsqlookupd` (the registration service).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement authentication and authorization for `nsqd` instances registering with `nsqlookupd`.
* Use TLS encryption for communication between `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd`.

## Threat: [Tampering with `nsqlookupd` Data](./threats/tampering_with__nsqlookupd__data.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to `nsqlookupd` and modifies the list of registered `nsqd` instances, redirecting consumer traffic to malicious brokers or causing denial of service by removing legitimate brokers.

**Impact:** Consumers might connect to incorrect or malicious `nsqd` instances, leading to message interception, injection, or service disruption.

**Affected Component:** `nsqlookupd` (data storage and management).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing and modifying `nsqlookupd` data.
* Use TLS encryption for communication with `nsqlookupd`.
* Restrict network access to `nsqlookupd`.
