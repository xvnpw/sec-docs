# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nsqio/nsq

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS Encryption for NSQ Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tls_encryption_for_nsq_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate TLS Certificates:** Obtain or generate TLS certificates and keys for `nsqd`, `nsqlookupd`, and client applications. Consider using a Certificate Authority (CA) for production environments.
    2.  **Configure `nsqd` for TLS:**
        *   Set the `-tls-cert` and `-tls-key` flags when starting `nsqd` to specify the paths to the server certificate and key files.
        *   Enable TLS for inter-node communication by setting `-tls-required=true` and `-tls-min-version=tls1.2` (or higher) for stronger security.
    3.  **Configure `nsqlookupd` for TLS:**
        *   Similarly, set the `-tls-cert` and `-tls-key` flags for `nsqlookupd`.
        *   Enable TLS for client connections to `nsqlookupd` if needed.
    4.  **Configure Client Applications for TLS:**
        *   When initializing NSQ client libraries (producers and consumers), configure them to use TLS connections. This typically involves setting options like `tls_cert`, `tls_key`, and `tls_root_cas` (for verifying server certificates).
        *   For mTLS, configure client certificates and keys as well.
    5.  **Verify TLS Configuration:** Test connections between components and clients to ensure TLS is correctly enabled and working as expected.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):**  Unencrypted communication allows attackers to intercept and read sensitive data transmitted between NSQ components and applications.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Without encryption and proper authentication, attackers can intercept and potentially modify communication.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping:** **High Reduction.** TLS encryption renders intercepted data unreadable.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** **Medium to High Reduction.** TLS encryption makes MitM attacks significantly harder.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   TLS encryption is currently implemented for **internal communication between `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd`**.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **TLS encryption is NOT yet enforced for client connections (producers and consumers).**
    *   **Mutual TLS (mTLS) is NOT implemented.**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Authentication for NSQ HTTP API](./mitigation_strategies/implement_authentication_for_nsq_http_api.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable HTTP Basic Authentication:**
        *   For `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd`, configure the `-http-client-options` flag with `auth-required=true`. This enables basic authentication for all HTTP API endpoints.
        *   Set up a user and password for authentication.
    2.  **Configure Client Applications/Scripts:**
        *   When using the NSQ HTTP API, ensure clients include the `Authorization` header with basic authentication credentials.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Administrative Endpoints (High Severity):** Without authentication, anyone with network access can perform administrative actions.
    *   **Configuration Tampering (Medium Severity):**  Unauthorized access can lead to malicious modification of NSQ configurations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Administrative Endpoints:** **High Reduction.** Basic authentication prevents unauthorized access.
    *   **Configuration Tampering:** **Medium Reduction.** Authentication reduces the risk of unauthorized configuration changes.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **HTTP Basic Authentication is enabled for `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd` HTTP APIs in the staging environment.**

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **HTTP Basic Authentication is NOT enabled in the production environment.**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Resource Limits for `nsqd`](./mitigation_strategies/set_resource_limits_for__nsqd_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Resource Requirements:** Analyze the resource requirements (CPU, memory, file descriptors) of `nsqd`.
    2.  **Configure OS-Level Resource Limits:**
        *   Use operating system tools like `ulimit` and cgroups to set resource limits for the `nsqd` process.
        *   Configure limits in systemd service files or process management scripts used to start `nsqd`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion in NSQ (High Severity):**  Uncontrolled resource consumption by `nsqd` can lead to performance degradation and outages.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Resource Starvation (Medium Severity):** If `nsqd` consumes excessive resources, it can starve other services.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion in NSQ:** **Medium to High Reduction.** Resource limits prevent `nsqd` from consuming unbounded resources.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Resource Starvation:** **Medium Reduction.** Resource limits help isolate `nsqd` resource consumption.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Basic `ulimit` settings are applied to the `nsqd` process in production for file descriptors.**

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Cgroup-based resource limits (CPU, memory) are NOT configured for `nsqd` in production.**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Queue Depth and Message Backpressure](./mitigation_strategies/control_queue_depth_and_message_backpressure.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Consumer Performance:** Monitor the processing rate and latency of consumer applications.
    2.  **Implement Consumer Backpressure Mechanisms:**
        *   Utilize NSQ's built-in features for message requeuing and delayed requeuing to handle temporary consumer slowdowns.
    3.  **Implement Dead Letter Queues (DLQs):**
        *   Configure Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) for topics to handle messages that cannot be processed after multiple retries.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion in NSQ due to Unbounded Queue Growth (High Severity):** If consumers cannot keep up, queues can grow indefinitely, leading to memory exhaustion.
    *   **Message Loss due to Queue Overflow (Medium Severity):** In extreme cases, messages might be lost or dropped.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion in NSQ due to Unbounded Queue Growth:** **Medium to High Reduction.** Backpressure and queue management prevent uncontrolled queue growth.
    *   **Message Loss due to Queue Overflow:** **Medium Reduction.** DLQs and proper queue management help prevent message loss.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Consumers use acknowledgements (ACKs) to signal successful message processing.**
    *   **Basic retry mechanisms are in place for consumers to requeue messages on processing failures.**

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) are NOT configured for topics.**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Exposed Ports and Services](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_exposed_ports_and_services.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Necessary Ports:** Determine the minimum set of ports required for NSQ to function.
    2.  **Firewall Configuration:** Configure firewalls to restrict access to NSQ ports only from authorized networks or hosts.
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary Features/Plugins:** Disable any unnecessary features or plugins in `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **External Attack Surface (Medium Severity):** Exposing unnecessary ports and services increases the attack surface.
    *   **Unauthorized Access from External Networks (Medium Severity):**  If NSQ ports are accessible from untrusted networks, attackers could attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **External Attack Surface:** **Medium Reduction.** Minimizing exposed ports and services reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Unauthorized Access from External Networks:** **Medium Reduction.** Firewall rules restrict access from untrusted networks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Firewall rules are in place to restrict access to NSQ ports from external networks.**

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Detailed review and minimization of exposed ports and services is not regularly performed.**
    *   **Unnecessary features or plugins in `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd` have not been explicitly disabled.**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Comprehensive Logging for NSQ Components](./mitigation_strategies/enable_comprehensive_logging_for_nsq_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Detailed Logging:** Configure `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd` to log detailed information about events, errors, access attempts, and configuration changes.
    2.  **Log Security-Relevant Events:** Ensure that logs capture security-relevant events such as authentication failures and connection attempts.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Delayed Threat Detection (Medium Severity):** Insufficient logging can hinder the ability to detect security incidents.
    *   **Limited Incident Response Capabilities (Medium Severity):** Lack of detailed logs makes it difficult to investigate security incidents.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Delayed Threat Detection:** **Medium Reduction.** Comprehensive logging enables faster detection of security incidents.
    *   **Limited Incident Response Capabilities:** **Medium Reduction.** Detailed logs provide valuable information for incident investigation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Basic logging is enabled for `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd` and logs are written to files.**

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Logging verbosity is not set to a detailed level to capture all security-relevant events.**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor NSQ Metrics for Anomalies](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_nsq_metrics_for_anomalies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Key Metrics:** Determine key NSQ metrics that are relevant for security monitoring, such as queue depth, message rates, error rates, and connection counts.
    2.  **Implement Metrics Collection:** Use NSQ's built-in metrics endpoints or monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus exporter for NSQ) to collect these metrics.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Undetected Security Incidents (Medium Severity):** Without monitoring, security incidents might go unnoticed.
    *   **Performance Degradation and Service Disruptions (Medium Severity):**  Unmonitored performance issues can lead to service degradation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Undetected Security Incidents:** **Medium Reduction.** Monitoring and alerting enable proactive detection of security incidents.
    *   **Performance Degradation and Service Disruptions:** **Medium Reduction.** Monitoring helps identify performance issues early.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Basic monitoring of `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd` metrics is implemented using Prometheus and Grafana in the staging environment.**

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Monitoring is NOT fully implemented in the production environment.**
