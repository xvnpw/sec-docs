## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit nsqd Vulnerabilities <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_nsqd_vulnerabilities_mark_high-risk_path_mark.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks targeting the core `nsqd` service. Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the message broker and the applications relying on it.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Authentication Bypass <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__authentication_bypass_mark_high-risk_path_mark.md)

Attackers attempt to circumvent the authentication mechanisms protecting `nsqd`. This could involve exploiting flaws in the authentication logic or using default or weak credentials.
    *   **Identify Weak or Default Credentials <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>:**
        *   Attackers scan for default configurations or known weak credentials that might be in use for `nsqd`. If successful, they gain unauthorized access without needing to exploit any vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Resource Exhaustion (DoS) <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__resource_exhaustion__dos__mark_high-risk_path_mark.md)

Attackers aim to overwhelm `nsqd` with requests or data, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Send Large Volume of Messages <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>:**
        *   Attackers flood `nsqd` with a massive number of messages, consuming excessive CPU, memory, and disk I/O resources, leading to service degradation or failure.
    *   **Connection Exhaustion <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>:**
        *   Attackers open a large number of connections to `nsqd`, exceeding its connection limits and preventing legitimate clients from connecting.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Data Injection/Manipulation <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__data_injectionmanipulation_mark_high-risk_path_mark.md)

Attackers aim to insert malicious or manipulate existing messages within the NSQ system.
    *   **Bypass Authentication or Authorization <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>:**
        *   As described above, bypassing authentication is a prerequisite for unauthorized data manipulation.
    *   **Inject Malicious Messages <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>:**
        *   Once authenticated (or if authentication is bypassed), attackers publish messages with malicious content. This content could exploit vulnerabilities in the consuming application, leading to code execution, data corruption, or other malicious outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit nsqlookupd Vulnerabilities <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_nsqlookupd_vulnerabilities_mark_high-risk_path_mark.md)

This category focuses on attacks targeting the `nsqlookupd` service, which is responsible for service discovery. Compromising `nsqlookupd` can disrupt message routing and potentially redirect traffic to malicious nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Data Poisoning <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__data_poisoning_mark_high-risk_path_mark.md)

Attackers aim to manipulate the information stored in `nsqlookupd` about available `nsqd` instances.
    *   **Register Malicious nsqd Instances <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>:**
        *   Attackers register fake or compromised `nsqd` instances with `nsqlookupd`. This can be done if the registration process lacks proper authentication or validation.
    *   **Redirect Consumers to Malicious Nodes <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>:**
        *   Once malicious `nsqd` instances are registered, `nsqlookupd` will provide their addresses to consumers, effectively redirecting message traffic to the attacker's controlled nodes. This allows for message interception, modification, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Message Flow](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_message_flow.md)

This category encompasses attacks that interfere with the intended flow of messages within the NSQ system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Topic/Channel Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/topicchannel_manipulation.md)

Attackers aim to alter the structure of topics and channels, disrupting message delivery and potentially causing data loss or application malfunction.
    *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to nsqd <mark>(High-Risk Path)</mark>:**
        *   Achieving unauthorized access to `nsqd` (as described in the "Exploit nsqd Vulnerabilities" section) is a prerequisite for manipulating topics and channels. Once access is gained, attackers can create, delete, or modify topics and channels, disrupting the intended message routing and processing.
