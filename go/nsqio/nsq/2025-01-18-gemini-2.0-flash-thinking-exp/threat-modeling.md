# Threat Model Analysis for nsqio/nsq

## Threat: [Unencrypted Communication (Eavesdropping)](./threats/unencrypted_communication__eavesdropping_.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between `nsqd`, `nsqlookupd`, or client applications to read the content of messages. This can be done passively by sniffing network traffic.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data contained within messages.

**Affected Component:** Network communication between `nsqd`, `nsqlookupd`, and client applications.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement TLS encryption for all communication channels between NSQ components and client applications.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between NSQ components or clients and actively modifies messages in transit before forwarding them to the intended recipient. This requires the attacker to be positioned within the network path.

**Impact:** Data integrity compromise, potential for malicious message injection leading to unintended application behavior or data corruption.

**Affected Component:** Network communication between `nsqd`, `nsqlookupd`, and client applications.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Enforce TLS encryption with mutual authentication to verify the identity of both communicating parties.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access via Exposed Ports](./threats/unauthorized_access_via_exposed_ports.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains direct access to `nsqd` or `nsqlookupd` ports if they are exposed to the public internet or an untrusted network without proper access controls. This allows them to interact with the services directly.

**Impact:** Unauthorized message publishing or consumption, potential for data manipulation, denial of service by overwhelming the service with requests.

**Affected Component:** `nsqd` (listening ports), `nsqlookupd` (listening ports).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Restrict access to `nsqd` and `nsqlookupd` ports using firewalls and network segmentation. Only allow access from trusted networks or specific IP addresses.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Message Publishing](./threats/unauthorized_message_publishing.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains the ability to publish messages to NSQ topics without proper authorization. This could be due to a lack of authentication within NSQ or its extensions.

**Impact:** Spamming of consumers, injection of malicious data into the system, disruption of normal application functionality.

**Affected Component:** `nsqd` (topic handling).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement application-level authentication and authorization mechanisms before allowing clients to publish messages. Consider using NSQ features like channels and access control lists (if available through extensions or custom solutions) to manage publishing permissions.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Message Consumption](./threats/unauthorized_message_consumption.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains the ability to consume messages from NSQ topics they are not authorized to access. This could be due to a lack of authentication within NSQ or its extensions.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized parties.

**Affected Component:** `nsqd` (topic and channel handling).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement application-level authentication and authorization mechanisms before allowing clients to subscribe to topics or channels. Use NSQ features like channels and access control lists (if available through extensions or custom solutions) to manage subscription permissions.

## Threat: [Message Queue Exhaustion Attack](./threats/message_queue_exhaustion_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods NSQ topics with a large number of messages, potentially overwhelming the queue and impacting the performance or availability of consuming applications.

**Impact:** Denial of service for consumers, potential data loss if queues overflow and messages are discarded.

**Affected Component:** `nsqd` (topic and channel queues).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting on producers to control the rate at which messages are published. Monitor queue sizes and configure appropriate queue limits.

## Threat: [`nsqd` Resource Exhaustion](./threats/_nsqd__resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a large number of connections or requests directly to `nsqd`, potentially exhausting its resources (CPU, memory, network) and causing a denial of service.

**Impact:** Service disruption, inability for legitimate producers and consumers to interact with `nsqd`.

**Affected Component:** `nsqd` (connection handling, request processing).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement connection limits and rate limiting on `nsqd`. Monitor `nsqd` resource usage and configure appropriate resource limits.

## Threat: [`nsqlookupd` Disruption](./threats/_nsqlookupd__disruption.md)

**Description:** An attacker makes `nsqlookupd` unavailable, preventing consumers from discovering available `nsqd` instances. This can be achieved through various means, such as overwhelming it with requests or exploiting vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Service disruption as consumers cannot find `nsqd` instances to connect to.

**Affected Component:** `nsqlookupd`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Deploy multiple `nsqlookupd` instances for redundancy. Implement rate limiting and access controls to protect `nsqlookupd`.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in NSQ Components](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_nsq_components.md)

**Description:** Undiscovered or unpatched security vulnerabilities exist within the `nsqd` or `nsqlookupd` codebase. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or compromise the integrity of the system.

**Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts, including complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `nsqd`, `nsqlookupd` (various modules and functions depending on the vulnerability).

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:** Stay updated with the latest NSQ releases and security patches. Subscribe to security advisories and monitor for reported vulnerabilities.
