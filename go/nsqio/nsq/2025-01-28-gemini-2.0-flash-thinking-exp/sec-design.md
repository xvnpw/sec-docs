# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, NSQ, aims to provide a real-time distributed messaging platform. It is designed to operate at scale, handling high volumes of messages and enabling asynchronous communication between different parts of a distributed system.

Business priorities and goals:
- Enable real-time data processing and distribution.
- Decouple services in a distributed architecture, improving system resilience and scalability.
- Provide a reliable message delivery system, ensuring no message loss.
- Offer a performant messaging solution capable of handling high throughput and low latency.
- Simplify the development of applications that require asynchronous communication.

Most important business risks:
- Data loss or message corruption leading to incomplete or incorrect data processing.
- System unavailability or performance degradation impacting real-time applications and dependent services.
- Unauthorized access to message queues potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
- Operational complexity in managing and monitoring a distributed messaging system.
- Lack of security features could expose sensitive data transmitted through the message queue.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: TLS support for encrypting communication channels between nsq components and clients. Implemented in code and configurable during deployment.
- security control: Authentication and authorization mechanisms are not built-in features of NSQ. Security is expected to be handled at the application level or through network security measures. Described in documentation as a design choice for performance reasons.
- security control: Input validation is expected to be performed by message producers and consumers. NSQ itself performs minimal validation on message payloads. Implicitly described in documentation by focusing on message delivery and not content inspection.
- accepted risk: Lack of built-in authentication and authorization. NSQ relies on external mechanisms for access control.
- accepted risk: Minimal input validation at the NSQ level. Message content security is the responsibility of the application.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement network segmentation to isolate NSQ components and restrict access to authorized networks.
- security control: Integrate with an external authentication and authorization service (e.g., OAuth 2.0, LDAP) to manage access to NSQ topics and channels.
- security control: Implement rate limiting and traffic shaping to protect against denial-of-service attacks.
- security control: Regularly audit and monitor NSQ infrastructure and logs for security events.
- security control: Implement security scanning in the build process to identify vulnerabilities in NSQ dependencies and configurations.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
  - Requirement: Securely authenticate clients (producers, consumers, admin tools) connecting to NSQ components.
  - Requirement: Support mutual TLS authentication for enhanced security of communication channels.
- Authorization:
  - Requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization to control access to topics and channels based on user roles or application identities.
  - Requirement: Enforce least privilege principle for access control to NSQ resources.
- Input validation:
  - Requirement: Validate message payloads at the application level to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
  - Requirement: Sanitize inputs to nsqadmin web interface to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Use TLS encryption for all communication channels between NSQ components and clients to protect data in transit.
  - Requirement: Consider encryption of sensitive data within message payloads at the application level if required.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer writes code, commits changes, and pushes to the GitHub repository.
2. GitHub repository triggers the CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions) via webhook on code changes.
3. CI/CD system initiates a build pipeline.
4. Build Environment is provisioned within the CI/CD pipeline.
5. Build process compiles the code, runs unit tests, and builds artifacts (e.g., binaries, container images).
6. Security Checks are performed in the build pipeline:
   - Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) is performed on the code to identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - Vulnerability scanning is performed on dependencies to identify known vulnerabilities.
   - Linting and code formatting checks are performed to ensure code quality and consistency.
7. Build Artifacts and Container Images are created and pushed to the Artifact Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Cloud Registry).
8. Deployment process pulls the artifacts/images from the Artifact Registry and deploys them to the Deployment Environment (e.g., Kubernetes).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes:
- Real-time data ingestion and processing for applications relying on immediate message delivery.
- Asynchronous communication between microservices enabling core application functionalities.
- Event-driven architectures that depend on timely message distribution for system responsiveness.

Data we are trying to protect:
- Messages transmitted through NSQ.
- Sensitivity of data depends on the application using NSQ. Messages could contain:
  - Business transaction data (potentially sensitive).
  - Application logs and events (less sensitive).
  - User activity data (potentially sensitive).
  - System metrics (less sensitive).

Data sensitivity:
- Variable, depends on the application and topic.
- Assume messages can contain PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or confidential business data in some use cases.
- Need to consider data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the typical sensitivity of data being transmitted through NSQ in the intended use case?
- Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that need to be considered?
- What are the performance and scalability requirements for NSQ?
- What is the expected deployment environment (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)?
- Are there existing authentication and authorization infrastructure that NSQ needs to integrate with?
- What are the monitoring and logging requirements for NSQ?

Assumptions:
- NSQ will be deployed in a cloud environment using Kubernetes.
- Messages transmitted through NSQ may contain sensitive data, requiring encryption in transit.
- Security is a significant concern, and implementing recommended security controls is a priority.
- The organization has some existing security infrastructure and practices in place.
- Performance is a key requirement for NSQ, but not at the expense of essential security measures.
