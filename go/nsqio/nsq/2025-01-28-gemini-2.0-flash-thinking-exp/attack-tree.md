This is the attacker's ultimate objective. Success means compromising the application's data confidentiality, integrity, or availability through vulnerabilities or misconfigurations related to NSQ.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.2] Exploit Insecure NSQ Configuration/Deployment](./attack_tree_paths/_1_2__exploit_insecure_nsq_configurationdeployment.md)
