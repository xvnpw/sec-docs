# Attack Surface Analysis for nsqio/nsq

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Network Communication](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_network_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Data transmitted between NSQ components and clients is sent in plaintext without encryption, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.
*   **NSQ Contribution:** NSQ, by default, does not enforce encryption and requires explicit configuration to enable TLS/SSL.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between a producer and nsqd, reading sensitive data within the message payload.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data leakage, potential compliance violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS/SSL:** Configure TLS/SSL encryption for all NSQ communication channels (nsqd to clients, nsqd to nsqlookupd, nsqadmin access).
    *   **Use Strong Cipher Suites:** Ensure strong and up-to-date cipher suites are configured for TLS/SSL.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate NSQ components within a trusted network segment.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to NSQ Components](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_nsq_components.md)

*   **Description:** NSQ components are accessible without authentication, allowing unauthorized interaction and control.
*   **NSQ Contribution:** Historically, NSQ lacked built-in authentication by default. While client certificate authentication is now available, it requires explicit configuration.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains network access to nsqd and uses the HTTP API to delete topics, pause channels, or retrieve sensitive metrics, causing disruption or information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation, denial of service, information disclosure, potential cluster compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Client Certificate Authentication:** Enable and enforce client certificate authentication for clients connecting to nsqd.
    *   **Secure nsqadmin Access:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for nsqadmin. Restrict access to internal networks.
    *   **Network Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Use firewalls and network ACLs to restrict access to NSQ ports to authorized networks.

## Attack Surface: [Message Payload Injection](./attack_surfaces/message_payload_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious data injected into message payloads published to NSQ can be processed by consumers, leading to vulnerabilities in consuming applications.
*   **NSQ Contribution:** NSQ is message-agnostic and does not validate message content, making it a conduit for potentially malicious payloads.
*   **Example:** A producer injects a message with a command injection payload. A vulnerable consumer application, upon processing this message, executes the injected command.
*   **Impact:** Command injection, SQL injection, cross-site scripting in consumers, application logic bypass, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Producers):** Producers must rigorously validate and sanitize data before publishing it to NSQ.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Consumers):** Consumers must also validate and sanitize message payloads received from NSQ before processing them, treating them as untrusted input.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure nsqadmin Exposure](./attack_surfaces/insecure_nsqadmin_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** nsqadmin is exposed to public networks without proper authentication, allowing unauthorized access to NSQ cluster monitoring and management.
*   **NSQ Contribution:** nsqadmin is a component of NSQ providing administrative access, and default configurations might not secure it for public exposure.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses a publicly exposed nsqadmin instance and gains insights into message flow, cluster status, and potentially performs administrative actions.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized cluster management, denial of service, potential compromise of the NSQ cluster.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict nsqadmin Access:** Never expose nsqadmin directly to the public internet. Restrict access to internal management networks only.
    *   **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization (nsqadmin):** Use strong authentication for nsqadmin. Consider a reverse proxy or NSQ's built-in HTTP basic auth if suitable.
    *   **Regular Security Audits (nsqadmin):** Regularly audit nsqadmin configurations and access logs.
