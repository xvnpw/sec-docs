## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Mattermost [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_mattermost__critical_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has gained unauthorized access to sensitive application data or functionality by exploiting weaknesses in the integrated Mattermost server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mattermost Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mattermost_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This involves directly targeting security flaws within the Mattermost server software. Successful exploitation can grant attackers significant control over the Mattermost instance and potentially the application it serves.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Mattermost Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_mattermost_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (often with assigned CVE numbers) that exist in specific versions of Mattermost. Exploit code or detailed steps for exploitation are often readily available.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities__cves___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify the specific version of Mattermost being used by the application. They then search for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting that version. Using available exploit code or following documented steps, they attempt to trigger the vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code. This could involve sending crafted requests to the Mattermost server, manipulating specific input fields, or exploiting flaws in data processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Messages [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_messages__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into messages sent within Mattermost. When other users view these messages, the malicious script executes in their browser within the context of the application. This can allow attackers to steal session cookies, capture user input, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform actions on behalf of the victim user within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Link Manipulation & Phishing](./attack_tree_paths/link_manipulation_&_phishing.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers craft deceptive links within Mattermost messages that appear legitimate but redirect users to phishing websites designed to steal credentials or other sensitive information. Alternatively, links might lead to the download of malware or trigger other malicious actions. The credibility of communication within Mattermost can make these attacks more effective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Account Compromise [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/account_compromise__critical_.md)

This involves gaining unauthorized access to a legitimate user's Mattermost account. This can be achieved through various means:
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers attempt to guess user passwords by trying numerous combinations.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Attackers use lists of usernames and passwords leaked from other breaches, hoping users have reused their credentials.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Attackers trick users into revealing their credentials through phishing emails, deceptive messages, or impersonation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious Files](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers upload files containing malicious code (e.g., executables, scripts) to Mattermost. If the application or other users interact with these files without proper security measures, the malicious code can be executed, leading to system compromise or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mattermost Integrations [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mattermost_integrations__critical_.md)

This involves targeting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the way Mattermost integrates with other systems or services. Integrations often have privileged access or the ability to trigger actions within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Webhooks [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_webhooks__critical_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Incoming Webhooks [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_incoming_webhooks__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to the configuration or secrets associated with incoming webhooks. This allows them to send crafted messages or data to Mattermost as if they were legitimate external services. These malicious payloads can be designed to trigger actions within the application, manipulate data, or even execute commands if the application doesn't properly validate webhook data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Plugin Exploitation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/plugin_exploitation__critical_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Plugins [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_installed_plugins__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Third-party Mattermost plugins can contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers identify and exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute code on the server, or compromise user data. This often involves sending specially crafted requests to the plugin's endpoints or exploiting flaws in how the plugin handles data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Mattermost Infrastructure [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_mattermost_infrastructure__critical_.md)

This involves directly attacking the servers, databases, or network infrastructure hosting the Mattermost instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Database Exploitation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/database_exploitation__critical_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters that are used in database queries. If the application doesn't properly sanitize user input, this malicious code can be executed by the database, allowing attackers to bypass security controls, access sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server Exploitation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/server_exploitation__critical_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Operating System Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/operating_system_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the operating system running the Mattermost server. This can allow them to gain unauthorized access to the server, execute arbitrary commands, install malware, or escalate privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Configurations [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_configurations__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage misconfigurations in the Mattermost server setup, operating system settings, or network configurations. This could include weak passwords, default credentials, open ports, insecure file permissions, or missing security patches. These misconfigurations can provide attackers with easy entry points or opportunities for exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering via Mattermost](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_via_mattermost.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers use the Mattermost platform to manipulate users into performing actions that compromise the application's security. This can involve tricking users into revealing credentials, clicking malicious links, or providing sensitive information. The trusted nature of internal communication channels can make these attacks more effective.
