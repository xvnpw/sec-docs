# Attack Surface Analysis for mattermost/mattermost-server

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in User-Generated Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_user-generated_content.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into content viewed by other users.
*   **How Mattermost-server contributes to the attack surface:** Mattermost allows users to post rich text messages, use markdown, and embed links, providing opportunities for injecting malicious scripts if not properly sanitized by the server during rendering.
*   **Example:** A user posts a message containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which executes when another user's browser renders the message served by Mattermost.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content rendered in the UI by the Mattermost server.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers served by the Mattermost server to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   Regularly update Mattermost server to benefit from security patches addressing XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) for Sensitive Actions](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__for_sensitive_actions.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the Mattermost server.
*   **How Mattermost-server contributes to the attack surface:**  Mattermost has various actions that can be performed via HTTP requests handled by the server, such as creating channels, modifying settings, or managing integrations. If these server-side actions lack proper CSRF protection, they are vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a user a link to a malicious website. When the user clicks it while logged into Mattermost, the website makes a request to the Mattermost server to silently create a new channel controlled by the attacker.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of settings, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing requests handled by the Mattermost server.
        *   Utilize the `Origin` and `Referer` headers for additional validation on the server-side.
        *   Ensure proper session management and invalidation on the server.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how the Mattermost API authenticates users and authorizes access to resources managed by the server.
*   **How Mattermost-server contributes to the attack surface:** Mattermost exposes a comprehensive API for various functionalities. Flaws in the server-side implementation of authentication (verifying identity) or authorization (granting access to specific resources) can lead to unauthorized access.
*   **Example:** An API endpoint intended for administrators is accessible to regular users due to a missing authorization check in the Mattermost server's code.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0) within the Mattermost server.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege when designing API authorization logic in the server.
        *   Thoroughly test all API endpoints for authorization vulnerabilities during server development.
        *   Regularly review and audit API access controls within the Mattermost server codebase.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within third-party or custom-developed Mattermost plugins that run within the Mattermost server environment.
*   **How Mattermost-server contributes to the attack surface:** Mattermost's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality by executing code within the server's context. Vulnerabilities in these plugins can directly compromise the server.
*   **Example:** A plugin has an SQL injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to access or modify the Mattermost database through the plugin running on the server.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the plugin's functionality and the severity of the vulnerability, including data breaches, privilege escalation, and denial of service of the Mattermost server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (of plugins):**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing Mattermost plugins.
        *   Thoroughly test plugins for vulnerabilities before deployment on the Mattermost server.
        *   Keep plugin dependencies up to date to prevent known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Administrators (of Mattermost):**
        *   Carefully evaluate and vet plugins before installation on the Mattermost server.
        *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor plugin activity for suspicious behavior on the server.
        *   Consider restricting plugin installation permissions to trusted administrators.
