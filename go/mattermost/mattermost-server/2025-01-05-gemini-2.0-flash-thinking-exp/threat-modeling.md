# Threat Model Analysis for mattermost/mattermost-server

## Threat: [Insufficient Rate Limiting on Login Attempts](./threats/insufficient_rate_limiting_on_login_attempts.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could automate multiple login attempts using various credentials to try and guess valid user accounts or passwords. This is often done by exploiting the Mattermost Server's authentication endpoint without sufficient protection against rapid requests.
*   **Impact:** Successful brute-force attacks can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially allowing attackers to read private messages, impersonate users, or perform administrative actions if an admin account is compromised.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust rate limiting within the Mattermost Server's authentication module to restrict the number of login attempts from a single IP address within a specific timeframe.
    *   Consider implementing account lockout mechanisms within the Mattermost Server after a certain number of failed login attempts.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking via Mattermost WebSockets](./threats/session_hijacking_via_mattermost_websockets.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to intercept or manipulate the WebSocket connection between a Mattermost client (web, desktop, or mobile) and the server. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how the Mattermost Server handles WebSocket connections, potentially allowing an attacker to take over a legitimate user's session.
*   **Impact:** The attacker could perform actions as the hijacked user, including reading and sending messages, modifying settings, and potentially gaining access to sensitive information.
*   **Affected Component:** WebSocket Handling Module
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all connections to the Mattermost server to encrypt communication and prevent eavesdropping. This is a fundamental configuration of the Mattermost Server.
    *   Implement proper WebSocket security measures within the Mattermost Server, such as secure headers and origin validation.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Mattermost's Permission Model for Privilege Escalation](./threats/exploitation_of_mattermost's_permission_model_for_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, with limited privileges, could exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the Mattermost Server's permission model to gain access to resources or perform actions they are not authorized for. This might involve manipulating API calls or exploiting loopholes in the role-based access control implemented in the server.
*   **Impact:** Successful privilege escalation could allow an attacker to access private channels, modify team settings, delete data, or even gain administrative control of the Mattermost instance.
*   **Affected Component:** Permission Management Module, API Endpoints
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly review and audit Mattermost's permission settings and roles as configured within the server.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles to users and integrations within Mattermost.
    *   Keep the Mattermost server updated to patch known vulnerabilities in the permission model.
    *   Implement thorough input validation and authorization checks on all API endpoints within the Mattermost Server.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Message Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_message_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious messages containing JavaScript code that, when rendered by the Mattermost Server and viewed by other users, executes in their browser. This could be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the Mattermost Server sanitizes or escapes user-generated content.
*   **Impact:** Successful XSS attacks can allow attackers to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the Mattermost interface, or perform actions on behalf of the victim user.
*   **Affected Component:** Message Rendering Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding techniques within the Mattermost Server's message rendering engine to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
    *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers configured within the Mattermost Server to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
    *   Regularly update the Mattermost server to benefit from security patches addressing XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Mattermost Plugins](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_mattermost_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party or custom Mattermost plugins might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, insecure API usage) within their code that could be exploited by attackers if the plugin is installed on the server.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the Mattermost server, data breaches, unauthorized access to information, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Plugin Framework, Specific Plugin Code
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install plugins from trusted sources as defined and managed within the Mattermost Server.
    *   Thoroughly review the code of custom plugins or plugins from less reputable sources before installation on the Mattermost Server.
    *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities within the Mattermost Server's plugin management interface.
    *   Implement a process for security testing and vulnerability scanning of plugins before deployment on the Mattermost Server.

## Threat: [Exposure of Mattermost Admin Console](./threats/exposure_of_mattermost_admin_console.md)

*   **Description:** If the Mattermost admin console, a component of the Mattermost Server, is not properly secured and accessible to unauthorized individuals, attackers could gain administrative control over the entire Mattermost instance.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Mattermost server, including access to all data, user accounts, and settings.
*   **Affected Component:** Admin Console Interface, Authentication Module
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict access to the admin console to a limited number of authorized administrators as configured within the Mattermost Server.
    *   Enforce strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for admin accounts within the Mattermost Server's user management.
    *   Ensure the admin console is not publicly accessible without proper authentication, configurable within the Mattermost Server's settings.
    *   Regularly review and audit admin user accounts and permissions within the Mattermost Server.
