**Security Implications of Key Components:**

Here's a breakdown of the security implications for each key component:

**1. API Layer:**

*   **Security Implications:**
    *   **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:** Vulnerabilities in the Authentication and Authorization Middleware could allow unauthorized access to API endpoints and sensitive data.
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Lack of proper input validation in REST and GraphQL API Handlers can lead to SQL injection, command injection, and other injection attacks.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Improper handling of user-supplied data in API responses could lead to stored or reflected XSS vulnerabilities, especially if the API is used to serve content to the web client.
    *   **Rate Limiting Issues:**  Insufficiently configured or bypassed Rate Limiting Middleware could lead to denial-of-service attacks or brute-force attacks against authentication endpoints.
    *   **Data Exposure:**  Overly permissive API endpoints or insufficient output encoding could lead to the exposure of sensitive information.
    *   **GraphQL Specific Issues:**  Complex GraphQL queries could be used for denial-of-service or to extract excessive amounts of data if not properly secured.

*   **Tailored Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on all API endpoints, including whitelisting allowed characters and formats. Utilize server-side validation and consider using a dedicated validation library.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Ensure all database interactions within API handlers use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
