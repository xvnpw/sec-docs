Okay, let's create a design document for the Mattermost server project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Mattermost is an open-source, self-hosted, Slack-alternative, workplace messaging solution.  It's designed for organizations that require high levels of control over their communication data, often due to compliance, security, or privacy concerns.  The core business value proposition is providing a secure and customizable communication platform.

Business Priorities:

*   Data Security and Privacy:  Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user communications and data. This is paramount, as Mattermost is often used in environments with sensitive information.
*   Compliance:  Meeting the requirements of various regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, FINRA) depending on the customer's industry and location.
*   Customization and Extensibility:  Allowing organizations to tailor the platform to their specific needs through plugins, integrations, and API access.
*   Scalability and Reliability:  Supporting large user bases and high message volumes with minimal downtime.
*   Self-Hosting and Control:  Giving organizations complete control over their data and infrastructure.
*   Open Source: Allowing community to contribute, review and use the code.

Business Risks:

*   Data Breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive communication data, potentially leading to legal and reputational damage.
*   Compliance Violations:  Failure to meet regulatory requirements, resulting in fines and legal penalties.
*   Service Disruptions:  Outages or performance issues that hinder communication and productivity.
*   Malicious Insiders:  Employees or contractors with authorized access who misuse their privileges.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of third-party libraries or dependencies used in Mattermost.
*   Vulnerabilities in Customizations:  Poorly written plugins or integrations that introduce security flaws.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the GitHub repository and general knowledge of Mattermost):

*   security control: Authentication: Supports various authentication methods, including email/password, multi-factor authentication (MFA), SAML, OAuth 2.0, and GitLab SSO. (Implemented in the server code and configuration options).
*   security control: Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions and access to channels, teams, and features. (Implemented in the server code and database schema).
*   security control: Transport Layer Security (TLS): Encourages (and often requires) the use of TLS for encrypting communication between clients and the server, and between the server and other services (e.g., database). (Configurable via server settings).
*   security control: Data at Rest Encryption: Supports encryption of data at rest, depending on the underlying database and storage configuration. (Dependent on database and infrastructure setup).
*   security control: Auditing: Provides audit logs of user activity and system events. (Implemented in the server code and logging mechanisms).
*   security control: Regular Security Updates: Mattermost releases regular security updates and patches to address vulnerabilities. (Part of the release process).
*   security control: Security Reviews: Undergoes internal and external security reviews and penetration testing. (Mentioned in security documentation).
*   security control: Plugin System Security: Includes measures to mitigate risks associated with third-party plugins, such as sandboxing and permission controls. (Implemented in the plugin architecture).
*   security control: Rate Limiting: Implements rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks. (Implemented in the server code).
*   security control: Input Validation: Implements input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. (Implemented throughout the codebase).
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): Uses CSP to mitigate XSS and other code injection attacks. (Implemented in HTTP response headers).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Components: Mattermost, like any complex software, relies on numerous third-party libraries and dependencies. While efforts are made to vet these components, there's an inherent risk of vulnerabilities in these dependencies.
*   accepted risk: Self-Hosting Responsibility:  Since Mattermost is primarily self-hosted, the security of the underlying infrastructure (servers, network, operating systems) is the responsibility of the deploying organization.  Misconfigurations or unpatched systems can expose Mattermost to risks.
*   accepted risk: Plugin Ecosystem Risks: While the plugin system has security controls, there's still a risk that a malicious or poorly written plugin could compromise the system.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust vulnerability management program, including regular penetration testing and dynamic application security testing (DAST).
*   Enhance supply chain security measures, including software composition analysis (SCA) and software bill of materials (SBOM) generation.
*   Provide more granular control over plugin permissions and capabilities.
*   Implement a comprehensive secrets management solution.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for strong password policies (length, complexity, history).
    *   Enforcement of MFA for all users, or at least for privileged accounts.
    *   Secure session management (e.g., session timeouts, secure cookies).
    *   Protection against brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained permission model to control access to specific resources and actions.
    *   Regular review and auditing of user roles and permissions.
    *   Principle of least privilege should be applied throughout the system.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user inputs on both the client-side and server-side.
    *   Use of whitelisting rather than blacklisting where possible.
    *   Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, CSRF).

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    *   Regular review of cryptographic configurations to ensure they remain up-to-date.

## BUILD

The Mattermost build process involves several stages, from code compilation to creating deployable artifacts.  GitHub Actions is used for CI/CD.

```mermaid
graph LR
    developer["Developer"] -- "Pushes code" --> github["GitHub Repository"]
    github -- "Triggers workflow" --> buildserver["GitHub Actions Runner"]
    buildserver -- "Compiles code" --> build["Build Process"]
    build -- "Runs linters" --> linters["Linters (e.g., Go linter)"]
    build -- "Runs unit tests" --> unittests["Unit Tests"]
    build -- "Runs SAST" --> sast["SAST Tools (e.g., GoSec)"]
    build -- "Creates Docker image" --> dockerimage["Docker Image"]
    dockerimage -- "Pushes to registry" --> registry["Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub)"]
    build -- "Creates release artifacts" --> artifacts["Release Artifacts (e.g., binaries)"]

```
Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Linters: Static analysis tools that check for code style and potential errors.
*   Unit Tests: Automated tests that verify the functionality of individual components.
*   SAST Tools: Static Application Security Testing tools (e.g., GoSec) that scan the codebase for security vulnerabilities.
*   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Tools to identify and analyze third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities (not explicitly shown in the diagram, but should be part of the process).
*   Signed Commits: Developers should sign their commits to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the code.
*   Secure Build Environment: The build server (GitHub Actions Runner) should be configured securely, with limited access and regular security updates.
*   Artifact Signing: Release artifacts (e.g., binaries, Docker images) should be signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
