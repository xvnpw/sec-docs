# Attack Surface Analysis for mattermost/mattermost-server

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass / Account Takeover](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass__account_takeover.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's account or bypasses authentication mechanisms entirely.
    *   **Mattermost Contribution:**  `mattermost-server` implements its own user management, authentication (including password handling, session management, and optional MFA), and authorization logic.  It handles direct integrations with external authentication providers (LDAP, SAML, GitLab, etc.) *within the server code*.
    *   **Example:**  A vulnerability in the SAML integration code *within `mattermost-server`* allows an attacker to forge a SAML assertion and bypass authentication.  A flaw in the password reset logic *implemented in `mattermost-server`* allows account takeover.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of user accounts, access to private messages and files, potential for impersonation, and lateral movement within the system.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all authentication-related endpoints *within the server*.  Use secure password hashing algorithms.  Implement secure session management with proper expiration and invalidation *within the server's logic*.  Thoroughly test and audit all authentication flows, including integrations with external providers, *focusing on the server-side handling*.  Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.  Follow secure coding practices for handling secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Server-Side Handling](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__-_server-side_handling.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious JavaScript, but the vulnerability lies in how `mattermost-server` processes and *delivers* content.
    *   **Mattermost Contribution:**  `mattermost-server` is responsible for processing and rendering user-generated content (messages, channel names, etc.) *before* sending it to the client.  If the server-side sanitization is flawed, XSS is possible.  This includes handling Markdown parsing and any server-side transformations.
    *   **Example:**  `mattermost-server` fails to properly escape user input *before* storing it in the database or *before* sending it to other clients.  A vulnerable Markdown parsing library *used by the server* allows XSS.
    *   **Impact:**  Session hijacking, theft of sensitive information, defacement (though primarily client-side, the root cause is server-side).
    *   **Risk Severity:**  High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Implement strict output encoding and context-aware escaping of all user-generated content *on the server-side* before storing it or sending it to clients.  Sanitize input on the server-side, *regardless* of any client-side sanitization.  Regularly update and audit any libraries used for Markdown parsing or HTML rendering *that are part of the server*.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious SQL code into database queries executed by `mattermost-server`.
    *   **Mattermost Contribution:**  `mattermost-server` directly interacts with the database (PostgreSQL or MySQL) to store and retrieve all data.  *All* database interactions are handled by the server code.
    *   **Example:**  A crafted search query or username, processed by `mattermost-server`, contains SQL code that bypasses authentication or extracts data.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete database compromise, data breaches, data modification, denial of service, and potential for remote code execution on the database server.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for *all* database interactions *within the server code*.  *Never* construct SQL queries by concatenating user input directly *within the server*.  Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all data used in database queries *handled by the server*.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker tricks `mattermost-server` into making requests to unintended destinations.
    *   **Mattermost Contribution:**  `mattermost-server` handles integrations with external services (webhooks, slash commands, OAuth) and may fetch resources based on user input.  The *server* makes these requests.
    *   **Example:**  A webhook configuration, processed by `mattermost-server`, is manipulated to point to an internal service, exposing sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**  Access to internal network resources, data exfiltration, denial of service, and potential for remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all URLs and data used to make external requests *within the server code*.  Use a whitelist of allowed domains.  Avoid making requests to internal resources based on user input *processed by the server*.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities - Server-Side Handling](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities_-_server-side_handling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file that exploits vulnerabilities *in the server's handling* of the file.
    *   **Mattermost Contribution:** `mattermost-server` is responsible for receiving, validating, storing, and potentially serving uploaded files.  The vulnerability lies in *how the server handles* these operations.
    *   **Example:** `mattermost-server` fails to properly validate the file type (based on content, not extension) and allows a PHP file to be uploaded and executed.  The server's file storage logic has a path traversal vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Strict File Type Validation (Server-Side):** Validate file types based on *content*, not extensions, *within the server code*.
            *   **File Name Sanitization (Server-Side):** Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal *on the server*.
            *   **Storage Location (Server Configuration):** Store files outside the web root, a configuration managed by the server.
            *   **Execution Prevention (Server Configuration):** Configure the web server (often in conjunction with `mattermost-server` deployment) to prevent execution.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin-Related Vulnerabilities - Server-Side Enforcement](./attack_surfaces/plugin-related_vulnerabilities_-_server-side_enforcement.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious or vulnerable plugin introduces security risks, and `mattermost-server` fails to mitigate them.
    *   **Mattermost Contribution:** `mattermost-server` provides the plugin architecture and is responsible for loading, executing, and managing plugins.  The *server* must enforce security restrictions on plugins.
    *   **Example:** A plugin bypasses the server's intended permission model and accesses sensitive data or APIs.  The server fails to properly sandbox a plugin, allowing it to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but can include data breaches, denial of service, or complete system compromise *due to the server's failure to control the plugin*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Plugin Sandboxing (Server-Side):** Implement robust sandboxing *within the server* to isolate plugins.
            *   **Permission Model (Server-Side):** Enforce a strict permission model *on the server* to limit plugin access.
            *   **Code Signing (Server-Side Verification):** Require and *verify* digital signatures on plugins *on the server*.
