# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mattermost/mattermost-server

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict System Console Permission Control](./mitigation_strategies/strict_system_console_permission_control.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Strict System Console Permission Control**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Core Admins:** Determine the minimum number of users needing full System Console access.
    2.  **Create Custom Roles:** Within the Mattermost System Console ("Permissions" -> "Roles"), create custom roles with granular permissions. Examples:
        *   "Integration Manager": Manage integrations, but *not* system settings or users.
        *   "Team Administrator": Manage a specific team, *not* others or system settings.
        *   "Channel Moderator": Moderate channels, *not* create them or manage users.
    3.  **Assign Roles:** Assign users to these custom roles instead of full System Administrator. Regularly review assignments.
    4.  **Revoke Unnecessary Permissions:** Review existing System Administrators' permissions; revoke any not strictly needed.
    5.  **Document:** Maintain clear documentation of permissions and assignments.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized System Configuration Changes (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized users from altering critical settings, leading to data exposure or disruption.
    *   **Malicious Plugin/Integration Installation (Severity: High):** Limits compromised accounts or malicious insiders from installing harmful plugins/integrations.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Reduces the chance of attackers escalating from lower-level accounts to System Administrator.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration (Severity: Medium):** Reduces unintentional changes by users lacking full understanding.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized System Configuration Changes:** Risk significantly reduced (80-90%).
    *   **Malicious Plugin/Integration Installation:** Risk significantly reduced (70-80%).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (70-80%).
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Risk moderately reduced (50-60%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. Basic System Administrator role exists, but custom roles are underutilized. Some users have excessive permissions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Creation and use of granular custom roles.
    *   Regular review/audit of System Console permissions.
    *   Formal documentation of assignments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_multi-factor_authentication__mfa_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable MFA:** In the System Console, go to "Authentication" -> "MFA".
    2.  **Choose Method:** Select a supported MFA method (e.g., TOTP apps like Google Authenticator).
    3.  **Enforce MFA:** Set "Enforce Multi-factor Authentication" to "true". This makes MFA *mandatory* for all users.
    4.  **User Education:** Provide instructions on setting up and using MFA.
    5.  **Monitor Usage:** Regularly check that users have MFA enabled and are using it.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Account Takeover via Password Compromise (Severity: High):** Reduces risk even if passwords are obtained.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Makes brute-force much harder; attackers need both password and MFA token.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (Severity: High):** Protects against using stolen credentials from other breaches.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Account Takeover via Password Compromise:** Risk drastically reduced (95-99%).
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (90-95%).
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Risk drastically reduced (95-99%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   MFA is enabled, but *not* enforced. Some users have it, others don't.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Mandatory MFA enforcement for all accounts.
    *   Comprehensive user education/onboarding.
    *   Regular monitoring of MFA usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict File Uploads](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_file_uploads.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Restrict File Uploads**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **System Console Settings:** Go to "Files" -> "Storage" in the System Console.
    2.  **Maximum File Size:** Set a reasonable "Maximum File Size" (e.g., 20MB, 50MB), based on user needs.
    3.  **Allowed File Types:** *Crucially*, use a *whitelist*. *Only* list explicitly allowed extensions (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.txt`). *Do not* use a blacklist.
    4.  **Antivirus Integration (If Available):** If using a supported antivirus, configure the integration to scan uploads.
    5.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review settings.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malware Upload (Severity: High):** Prevents uploading malicious files (executables, scripts) that could compromise the server or users.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Large Files (Severity: Medium):** Limits file sizes, preventing server overload.
    *   **Storage Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Prevents running out of storage due to large uploads.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: Medium):** Restricting types can hinder exfiltration of certain data (though not a primary defense).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malware Upload:** Risk significantly reduced (80-90%, depending on whitelist and antivirus).
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Large Files:** Risk significantly reduced (70-80%).
    *   **Storage Exhaustion:** Risk moderately reduced (50-60%).
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk slightly reduced (20-30%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A maximum file size limit exists, but is high (100MB).
    *   A *blacklist* of file types is used (less secure).
    *   No antivirus integration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Strict *whitelist* of allowed file types.
    *   Reduction of maximum file size.
    *   Antivirus integration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Management and Approval Process](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_management_and_approval_process.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Plugin Management and Approval Process**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Plugin Repository:** Curate a list of approved plugins (Mattermost Marketplace and internally vetted).
    2.  **Security Review Process:** Before approval, review:
        *   **Source Code Review (if available):** Check for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Permission Analysis:** Review requested permissions.
        *   **Reputation Check:** Research developer and community reputation.
        *   **Testing:** Test in a staging environment before production.
    3.  **Plugin Whitelisting (Optional but Recommended):** Configure Mattermost to *only* allow approved plugins. Strongest protection.  This is done via the `PluginSettings` -> `AllowedPaths` in the `config.json` file, or via the `MM_PLUGINSETTINGS_ALLOWEDPATHS` environment variable.  It's a *direct* Mattermost server configuration.
    4.  **Regular Updates:** Update plugins to patch vulnerabilities.
    5.  **Disable Unused Plugins:** Remove unneeded plugins to reduce attack surface.  This is done directly within the Mattermost System Console.
    6.  **Documentation:** Document the process and list approved/installed plugins.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Plugin Installation (Severity: High):** Prevents installing malicious plugins.
    *   **Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation (Severity: High):** Reduces risk from outdated/poorly written plugins.
    *   **Data Breaches via Plugins (Severity: High):** Limits plugin access to sensitive data.
    *   **System Instability (Severity: Medium):** Prevents poorly written plugins from causing issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Plugin Installation:** Risk significantly reduced (80-90% with whitelist).
    *   **Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation:** Risk significantly reduced (70-80% with updates).
    *   **Data Breaches via Plugins:** Risk significantly reduced (60-70%).
    *   **System Instability:** Risk moderately reduced (50-60%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No formal approval process.
    *   Plugins installed from Marketplace without thorough review.
    *   Updates not consistently applied.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal approval process and curated list.
    *   Plugin whitelisting (if feasible).
    *   Regular review/update process.
    *   Documentation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Rate Limiting (Within Mattermost)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_rate_limiting__within_mattermost_.md)

**5. Mitigation Strategy: Configure Rate Limiting (Within Mattermost)**

* **Description:**
    1.  **Access `config.json`:**  Locate and edit the `config.json` file for your Mattermost server.  Alternatively, use environment variables.
    2.  **`RateLimitSettings`:**  Within the `RateLimitSettings` section, configure the following:
        *   `Enable`: Set to `true` to enable rate limiting.
        *   `PerSec`:  The maximum number of requests per second per IP address.  Start with a conservative value (e.g., 5-10) and adjust as needed.
        *   `MaxBurst`: The maximum number of requests allowed in a burst, above the `PerSec` limit.
        *   `MemoryStoreSize`: The number of requests to track in memory.
        *   `VaryByRemoteAddr`: Set to `true` to rate limit based on IP address.
        *   `VaryByHeader`:  Optionally, rate limit based on specific headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For` if behind a proxy).  Use with caution.
    3.  **Restart Mattermost:** Restart the Mattermost server for the changes to take effect.
    4. **Monitor and Adjust:** Monitor server logs and performance to fine-tune the rate limiting settings.  Too strict settings can impact legitimate users.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: Medium):**  Makes it much more difficult for attackers to guess passwords by repeatedly trying different combinations.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (Severity: Medium):**  Helps prevent the server from being overwhelmed by a flood of requests.
    *   **API Abuse (Severity: Medium):**  Limits the rate at which attackers can exploit API vulnerabilities or scrape data.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., 70-80%).
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Risk moderately reduced (e.g., 30-50%).  This is a *partial* mitigation; a dedicated WAF or DDoS protection service is still recommended for robust DoS protection.
    *   **API Abuse:** Risk moderately reduced (e.g., 40-60%).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Rate limiting is likely *not* configured or is set to very permissive defaults.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Proper configuration of `RateLimitSettings` in `config.json` (or via environment variables).
    *   Monitoring and adjustment of rate limiting settings based on observed traffic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Detailed Logging and Auditing](./mitigation_strategies/enable_detailed_logging_and_auditing.md)

**6. Mitigation Strategy: Enable Detailed Logging and Auditing**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **System Console Settings:** Navigate to "Environment" -> "Logging" in the System Console.
    2.  **Enable File Output:** Set "Output logs to file" to "true".
    3.  **File Log Level:** Set "File Log Level" to "DEBUG" for maximum detail, or "INFO" for a less verbose but still informative level.  "ERROR" is generally insufficient for security auditing.
    4.  **Enable Console Output (Optional):** You can also enable console output for real-time monitoring, but file output is crucial for long-term retention.
    5.  **Enable JSON Output (Recommended):** Set "Enable JSON Output" to "true".  This makes logs easier to parse and analyze by log management tools.
    6.  **Log Rotation:** Configure log rotation settings (file size, number of files) to prevent logs from consuming excessive disk space. This is often handled *outside* of Mattermost, at the OS level, but Mattermost has some basic settings.
    7. **Audit Logs:** Ensure audit logging is enabled. This is usually on by default, but verify. Audit logs track important events like user logins, permission changes, and configuration changes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Incident Detection (Severity: High):** Detailed logs are essential for detecting suspicious activity and security incidents.
    *   **Forensic Analysis (Severity: High):** Logs provide crucial evidence for investigating security breaches and understanding the scope of an attack.
    *   **Compliance (Severity: Medium):** Many compliance regulations require detailed logging and auditing.
    *   **Troubleshooting (Severity: Low):** Logs can also help diagnose and troubleshoot non-security-related issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Incident Detection:** Significantly improved ability to detect incidents.
    *   **Forensic Analysis:** Enables thorough investigation of security events.
    *   **Compliance:** Helps meet regulatory requirements.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Improves ability to diagnose problems.
    *   *Note: Logging itself doesn't *prevent* threats, but it's crucial for detection, response, and recovery.*

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic logging is likely enabled, but the level of detail may be insufficient.
    *   JSON output may not be enabled.
    *   Log rotation may not be properly configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Setting "File Log Level" to "DEBUG" or "INFO".
    *   Enabling JSON output.
    *   Configuring robust log rotation.
    *   Regular review of logs for suspicious activity.
