# Deep Analysis: File Upload Vulnerabilities (Server-Side Handling) in Mattermost

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, assess, and propose mitigations for vulnerabilities related to how the `mattermost-server` component handles file uploads.  We aim to prevent attackers from leveraging file uploads to achieve remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, or other malicious outcomes.  This analysis goes beyond superficial checks and delves into the server-side processing logic.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the **server-side** aspects of file upload handling within the `mattermost-server` codebase and its immediate deployment environment.  This includes:

*   **Code Analysis:** Examining the Go code in `mattermost-server` responsible for:
    *   Receiving file upload requests (HTTP handlers).
    *   Validating file metadata (size, type, name).
    *   Processing file content (scanning, transformation).
    *   Storing files (filesystem interaction, database updates).
    *   Serving files (if applicable).
*   **Configuration Analysis:** Reviewing server configurations related to file uploads, including:
    *   Maximum file size limits.
    *   Allowed file types (MIME types).
    *   File storage paths.
    *   Web server configurations (e.g., Nginx, Apache) that interact with file uploads.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Identifying and assessing the security of third-party libraries used by `mattermost-server` for file handling (e.g., image processing libraries).
* **Exclusion:** This analysis *excludes* client-side validation (JavaScript in the web client), as client-side checks can be bypassed.  It also excludes vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or database, except where `mattermost-server`'s configuration directly contributes to those vulnerabilities.

## 3. Methodology

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Static Code Analysis (SAST):**  Using automated tools (e.g., GoSec, Semgrep) and manual code review to identify potential vulnerabilities in the `mattermost-server` Go code.  We will focus on:
    *   Input validation weaknesses (lack of, or bypassable, file type checks).
    *   Path traversal vulnerabilities in file storage logic.
    *   Unsafe use of file handling functions.
    *   Command injection vulnerabilities related to file processing.
    *   Race conditions in file handling.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (DAST):**  Performing penetration testing against a running Mattermost instance, specifically targeting the file upload functionality.  This will involve:
    *   Attempting to upload files with malicious extensions (e.g., `.php`, `.jsp`, `.exe`, `.sh`).
    *   Uploading files with manipulated MIME types.
    *   Uploading very large files to test for denial-of-service vulnerabilities.
    *   Uploading files with specially crafted names to test for path traversal.
    *   Uploading files that exploit known vulnerabilities in image processing libraries (e.g., ImageMagick vulnerabilities).
*   **Configuration Review:**  Examining the Mattermost server configuration files (e.g., `config.json`) and the web server configuration (e.g., Nginx `sites-available`) to identify misconfigurations that could exacerbate file upload vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Using tools like `go list -m all` and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, Snyk) to identify and assess the security of third-party libraries used for file handling.
* **Threat Modeling:** Creating threat models to identify potential attack scenarios and prioritize vulnerabilities.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

This section details the specific areas of concern within the `mattermost-server` and its configuration, along with potential attack vectors and mitigation strategies.

### 4.1. File Type Validation

*   **Vulnerability:**  Insufficient or bypassable file type validation.  Relying solely on file extensions or client-provided MIME types is inadequate.  An attacker can rename a `.php` file to `.jpg` or manipulate the `Content-Type` header.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a PHP web shell) disguised as a legitimate file type (e.g., an image).  If the server only checks the extension or the `Content-Type` header, it will accept the file.
*   **Code Analysis Focus:**
    *   Identify the functions responsible for handling file uploads (e.g., `UploadFile` in `api4/upload.go`, `CreateUploadSession` and related functions).
    *   Examine how the `mattermost-server` determines the file type.  Look for uses of `filepath.Ext` (which is unreliable) and `http.DetectContentType` (which is better, but still can be tricked).
    *   Check if the server uses a whitelist of allowed MIME types and how strictly it enforces this whitelist.
    *   Look for any logic that might allow an attacker to bypass the file type checks (e.g., conditional statements, edge cases).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Content-Based Type Detection:** Use a robust library to determine the file type based on its *content*, not its extension or the client-provided MIME type.  The `http.DetectContentType` function in Go's standard library is a good starting point, but it should be supplemented with additional checks, especially for complex file types. Consider using a dedicated library like `filetype` for more accurate detection.
    *   **Whitelist, Not Blacklist:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed MIME types and reject any file that doesn't match.  Avoid using blacklists, as attackers can often find ways to bypass them.
    *   **Magic Number Validation:** For specific file types, validate the "magic number" (the first few bytes of the file) to ensure it matches the expected file type.
    *   **Double Extension Check:** Be wary of files with double extensions (e.g., `image.jpg.php`).
    *   **Server-Side Enforcement:**  Ensure that file type validation is performed *exclusively* on the server-side.

### 4.2. File Name Sanitization

*   **Vulnerability:**  Path traversal vulnerabilities due to insufficient sanitization of file names.  An attacker can use characters like `../` or null bytes (`%00`) to manipulate the file path and write files to arbitrary locations on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker uploads a file with a name like `../../../etc/passwd` or `image.jpg%00.php`.  If the server doesn't properly sanitize the file name, it might write the file to a sensitive location or execute it as a PHP script.
*   **Code Analysis Focus:**
    *   Identify the functions responsible for constructing the file path (e.g., functions that combine the upload directory with the file name).
    *   Look for any uses of user-provided input (the file name) without proper sanitization.
    *   Check for the use of functions like `filepath.Join` (which is generally safe) and `filepath.Clean` (which helps prevent path traversal).
    *   Look for any custom path manipulation logic that might be vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Sanitize File Names:**  Remove or replace any potentially dangerous characters from the file name, including `../`, `/`, `\`, null bytes (`%00`), and control characters.  Use a regular expression to allow only a safe set of characters (e.g., alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods).
    *   **Use a Safe File Name Generation Strategy:**  Consider generating unique file names on the server-side (e.g., using UUIDs) instead of relying on the user-provided file name. This eliminates the risk of path traversal entirely.
    *   **`filepath.Clean`:** Use Go's `filepath.Clean` function to normalize the file path and remove redundant `.` and `..` elements.  However, `filepath.Clean` alone is not sufficient; it must be combined with proper sanitization.
    * **Confine to Upload Directory:** Ensure that even with a manipulated filename, the file *cannot* be written outside of the designated upload directory. This can be achieved through careful path construction and validation.

### 4.3. File Storage and Execution Prevention

*   **Vulnerability:**  Storing uploaded files in a location where they can be executed by the web server (e.g., within the web root) or where they can overwrite critical system files.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker uploads a PHP script and then accesses it directly through the web server, causing it to be executed.  Alternatively, an attacker overwrites a critical configuration file.
*   **Code Analysis Focus:**
    *   Identify the configuration settings that determine the file storage location (e.g., `FileSettings.Directory` in `config.json`).
    *   Examine how the server interacts with the filesystem (e.g., using functions from the `os` package).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Store Files Outside the Web Root:**  Configure Mattermost to store uploaded files in a directory that is *not* accessible directly through the web server.  This prevents attackers from executing uploaded scripts.
    *   **Dedicated Storage:** Consider using a separate, dedicated storage service (e.g., AWS S3, MinIO) for uploaded files. This isolates the files from the main application server and provides additional security benefits.
    *   **Web Server Configuration:**  Configure the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to *deny* execution of scripts in the upload directory.  For example, in Nginx, you can use a `location` block to disable PHP processing for the upload directory:
        ```nginx
        location /uploads {
            location ~ \.php$ {
                deny all;
            }
        }
        ```
    *   **File Permissions:**  Set appropriate file permissions on the upload directory and the uploaded files to prevent unauthorized access and execution.  The web server user should only have read and write access to the upload directory, and the files should not have execute permissions.
    * **Chroot Jail (Advanced):** In highly sensitive environments, consider running the file handling component of Mattermost within a chroot jail to further restrict its access to the filesystem.

### 4.4. Denial of Service (DoS)

*   **Vulnerability:**  The server is vulnerable to DoS attacks through file uploads.  Attackers can upload very large files, numerous small files, or files that consume excessive resources during processing.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker uploads a multi-gigabyte file, exhausting server disk space or memory.  Alternatively, an attacker uploads thousands of small files, overwhelming the server's file handling capabilities.
*   **Code Analysis Focus:**
    *   Identify the configuration settings that limit the maximum file size (e.g., `FileSettings.MaxFileSize` in `config.json`).
    *   Check for any resource limits or quotas on file uploads.
    *   Examine how the server handles large files (e.g., does it read the entire file into memory at once?).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Maximum File Size Limit:**  Enforce a strict maximum file size limit on the server-side.  This limit should be appropriate for the expected use case and the server's resources.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from uploading too many files in a short period.  This can be done at the application level (within `mattermost-server`) or at the web server level (using Nginx's `limit_req` module, for example).
    *   **Resource Quotas:**  Consider implementing resource quotas to limit the total amount of disk space or memory that can be used for file uploads.
    *   **Streaming Uploads:**  For very large files, consider using a streaming upload approach, where the file is processed in chunks rather than being read entirely into memory at once.
    * **Timeout:** Implement the timeout for upload process.

### 4.5. Dependency Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:**  Third-party libraries used by `mattermost-server` for file handling (e.g., image processing libraries) may have known vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in ImageMagick (a common image processing library) to achieve remote code execution.
*   **Code Analysis Focus:**
    *   Identify all third-party libraries used for file handling.  Use `go list -m all` to list all dependencies.
    *   Check the versions of these libraries against vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, Snyk).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Regularly update all third-party libraries to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.  Use a dependency management tool (like Go modules) to manage dependencies and track updates.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use a vulnerability scanner (e.g., Snyk, Trivy) to automatically scan your dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):**  Consider running file processing tasks (e.g., image resizing) in a separate, sandboxed process to limit the impact of any vulnerabilities in the processing libraries.

### 4.6. Malicious File Content

* **Vulnerability:** Even if the file type is correctly identified and the file is stored safely, the *content* of the file might still be malicious. For example, a seemingly harmless image might contain an exploit, or a text file might contain a malicious script.
* **Attack Vector:** An attacker uploads a PDF with embedded JavaScript that executes when the PDF is viewed, or an SVG image with embedded JavaScript that executes in the browser.
* **Code Analysis Focus:**
    * Identify any code that processes or displays the content of uploaded files.
    * Look for potential vulnerabilities in how the server handles different file formats.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) in the Mattermost web application to prevent the execution of inline scripts and other potentially malicious content.
    * **File Scanning:** Integrate with an antivirus or malware scanning solution to scan uploaded files for known threats. This can be done asynchronously (after the file is uploaded) to avoid blocking the upload process.
    * **Sandboxing (for Preview):** If Mattermost provides previews of uploaded files (e.g., image thumbnails), generate these previews in a sandboxed environment to prevent exploits from affecting the main server.
    * **Disable Script Execution in Uploaded Files:** Configure the web server to serve uploaded files with headers that prevent script execution (e.g., `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`).
    * **Input Sanitization (for Display):** If the content of uploaded files is displayed within the Mattermost UI (e.g., text files), sanitize the content to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations
