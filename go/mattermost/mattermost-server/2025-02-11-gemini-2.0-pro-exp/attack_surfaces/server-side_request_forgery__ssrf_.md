# Deep Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Mattermost Server

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability within the Mattermost server (`mattermost-server` component).  The goal is to identify specific areas of concern, assess the potential impact, and provide actionable recommendations for developers to mitigate this risk.  We will focus on understanding *how* Mattermost's features and architecture might be exploited to perform SSRF attacks.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the `mattermost-server` component and its handling of outbound requests.  We will consider the following areas:

*   **Incoming Webhooks:**  How Mattermost processes and executes requests triggered by incoming webhooks.
*   **Outgoing Webhooks:**  How Mattermost constructs and sends requests to external services based on configured outgoing webhooks.
*   **Slash Commands:**  How Mattermost handles external requests initiated by slash commands.
*   **OAuth 2.0 Flows:**  How Mattermost interacts with external identity providers during OAuth authentication and authorization.
*   **Plugin Integrations:**  How plugins, which can extend Mattermost's functionality, might introduce SSRF vulnerabilities.  This includes both built-in and custom plugins.
*   **Embedded Content (e.g., Link Previews):** How Mattermost fetches and displays previews for URLs posted in messages.
*   **File Uploads/Downloads from External Sources:** How Mattermost handles fetching files from URLs provided by users.
* **Any feature that uses user supplied URL.**

We will *not* cover client-side vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting) except where they might indirectly contribute to an SSRF attack on the server.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the `mattermost-server` codebase (Go) to identify areas where external requests are made.  We will focus on functions that handle URLs, network connections, and HTTP requests.  Specific attention will be paid to input validation and sanitization practices.  We will use search terms like `http.Client`, `net/url`, `http.NewRequest`, `ioutil.ReadAll`, and related functions.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  We will simulate various SSRF attack scenarios using a test environment.  This will involve crafting malicious payloads for webhooks, slash commands, and other input vectors.  We will monitor network traffic and server logs to observe the behavior of the application.
3.  **Documentation Review:**  We will review Mattermost's official documentation, including API documentation, plugin development guides, and configuration guides, to understand how external integrations are intended to be used and secured.
4.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attacker motivations and capabilities to identify the most likely and impactful SSRF attack scenarios.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Specific Areas of Concern and Examples

Based on the Mattermost architecture and features, the following areas are particularly vulnerable to SSRF:

*   **Incoming Webhooks:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  A malicious actor could create a webhook that, when triggered, causes the Mattermost server to make a request to an internal IP address or service (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin`, `http://localhost:22`, `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` (AWS metadata)).
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the `app/webhook.go` and related files, specifically functions that handle incoming webhook requests and process the payload. Look for insufficient validation of the target URL.
    *   **Example Exploit:**  A webhook payload might contain a manipulated `text` field that includes a URL to an internal service.  If Mattermost unfurls this URL to generate a preview, it could trigger an SSRF.

*   **Outgoing Webhooks:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  An attacker could configure an outgoing webhook with a malicious target URL.  When a trigger word is used in a channel, Mattermost would send a request to the attacker-controlled server, potentially leaking sensitive information (e.g., channel ID, user ID, message content) or making requests to internal services.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine `app/webhook.go` and related files, focusing on functions that handle outgoing webhook configuration and execution.  Look for insufficient validation of the target URL *before* storing it and *before* making the request.
    *   **Example Exploit:**  An attacker sets the outgoing webhook URL to `http://internal-service:8080/sensitive-data`.

*   **Slash Commands:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Similar to outgoing webhooks, a slash command could be configured to send requests to a malicious or internal URL.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine `app/slashcommands.go` and related files.  Look for how the command's target URL is validated and used.
    *   **Example Exploit:**  A slash command configured to fetch data from a URL could be manipulated to target an internal service: `/fetch-data http://localhost:9200` (Elasticsearch).

*   **OAuth 2.0 Flows:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  While less direct, an attacker might manipulate the redirect URI or other parameters during the OAuth flow to cause the Mattermost server to make requests to unintended destinations.  This could be used to leak authorization codes or access tokens.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine `app/oauth.go` and related files.  Pay close attention to how redirect URIs are handled and validated.
    *   **Example Exploit:**  An attacker might try to modify the `redirect_uri` parameter to point to an internal service or an attacker-controlled server.

*   **Plugin Integrations:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Plugins, especially custom-built ones, can introduce SSRF vulnerabilities if they make external requests without proper input validation.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  This is more challenging, as it requires reviewing the code of individual plugins.  However, Mattermost should provide guidelines and security best practices for plugin developers to minimize this risk.  Focus on any plugin that interacts with external APIs or services.
    *   **Example Exploit:**  A plugin designed to fetch data from a user-provided URL could be exploited if it doesn't validate the URL properly.

*   **Link Previews:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  When a user posts a URL in a message, Mattermost may attempt to fetch the content of that URL to generate a preview.  This is a prime target for SSRF.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine `app/url_preview.go` (or similar files) and look for how URLs are extracted from messages and how requests are made to fetch preview data.  Check for restrictions on allowed protocols, domains, and IP addresses.
    *   **Example Exploit:**  A user posts a message containing `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/` to attempt to retrieve AWS credentials.

* **File Uploads/Downloads from External Sources:**
    * **Vulnerability:** If Mattermost allows users to upload files by providing a URL, the server might be tricked into fetching a file from an internal or malicious location.
    * **Code Review Focus:** Examine `app/file.go` (or similar) and look for functions related to fetching files from URLs. Check for validation of the URL before fetching.
    * **Example Exploit:** A user provides a URL like `file:///etc/passwd` or `http://localhost:8080/admin` as the source for a file upload.

### 4.2. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The following mitigation strategies should be implemented by Mattermost developers:

1.  **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Whitelist Approach):**
    *   **URLs:**  Validate *all* URLs used to make external requests.  This should be done using a *whitelist* of allowed domains and protocols (e.g., `https://`).  Reject any URL that doesn't match the whitelist.  Do *not* rely on blacklists, as they are easily bypassed.
    *   **IP Addresses:**  Explicitly deny requests to private IP address ranges (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `169.254.0.0/16`).  Also, deny requests to `localhost` and any variations (e.g., `0.0.0.0`).
    *   **DNS Resolution:**  Before making a request, resolve the hostname to an IP address and check if the IP address is within the allowed ranges.  This prevents attackers from using DNS rebinding techniques.
    *   **URL Parsing:**  Use a robust URL parsing library (like Go's `net/url`) to ensure that the URL is well-formed and to extract its components (scheme, host, path, etc.) reliably.  Avoid manual string manipulation.

2.  **Network-Level Restrictions:**
    *   **Outbound Firewall Rules:**  Configure the server's firewall to only allow outbound connections to specific, trusted hosts and ports.  Block all other outbound traffic.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Mattermost server from sensitive internal resources using network segmentation.  This limits the impact of a successful SSRF attack.

3.  **Least Privilege:**
    *   **Service Accounts:**  Run the Mattermost server with a dedicated service account that has minimal privileges.  This account should not have access to sensitive data or internal systems.

4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   While primarily a client-side defense, CSP can provide an additional layer of protection by restricting the sources from which the Mattermost server can fetch resources.  This can help mitigate SSRF attacks that rely on embedding malicious content.

5.  **Plugin Security:**
    *   **Guidelines and Best Practices:**  Provide clear guidelines and security best practices for plugin developers, emphasizing the importance of input validation and secure network communication.
    *   **Code Review:**  Consider implementing a code review process for plugins, especially those that handle external requests.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  Explore techniques for sandboxing plugins to limit their access to the server's resources.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address SSRF vulnerabilities.

7.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious network activity, such as requests to internal IP addresses or unusual outbound traffic patterns.

8. **Disable Unused Features:**
    * If link previews, or other features that make outbound requests, are not essential, consider disabling them to reduce the attack surface.

9. **Timeouts and Rate Limiting:**
    * Implement timeouts for external requests to prevent the server from hanging indefinitely if a malicious server doesn't respond. Implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from making a large number of requests in a short period.
