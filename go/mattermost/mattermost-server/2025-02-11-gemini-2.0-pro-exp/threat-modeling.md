# Threat Model Analysis for mattermost/mattermost-server

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Execution](./threats/malicious_plugin_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads or convinces an administrator to install a malicious plugin. The plugin contains code to steal data, modify messages, escalate privileges, create backdoors, or launch attacks against other systems. The attacker might disguise the plugin as a legitimate one or exploit a vulnerability in the plugin upload/installation process.
    *   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data exfiltration, data modification, denial of service, lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** `plugin` package, specifically functions related to plugin loading, activation, and API handling (e.g., `Activate()`, `OnActivate()`, `RegisterCommand()`, and any functions exposed via the plugin API).  Also, the `app` layer's plugin management functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Plugin Vetting:** Implement a rigorous review process for all plugins before installation, including code analysis and security testing.
        *   **Plugin Sandboxing:** Run plugins in isolated environments (e.g., containers, VMs) to limit their access to the core server and data.
        *   **Permission Control:** Implement a granular permission system for plugins, restricting their access to specific APIs and data.
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Require plugins to be digitally signed by trusted developers.
        *   **Plugin Marketplace:** Curate a list of approved plugins from trusted sources.
        *   **Disable Unused Plugins:** Regularly review and disable any plugins that are not actively used.
        *   **Runtime Monitoring:** Monitor plugin behavior for suspicious activity, such as excessive resource consumption or unusual network connections.

## Threat: [Exploitation of a Vulnerable Plugin](./threats/exploitation_of_a_vulnerable_plugin.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of a Vulnerable Plugin
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a legitimately installed plugin.  This could be a vulnerability like cross-site scripting (XSS) within the plugin's UI, SQL injection in a plugin's database interaction, or a command injection vulnerability. The attacker leverages the plugin's vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, server compromise, denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable plugin and its associated code.  Potentially the `plugin` package if the vulnerability allows escaping the plugin's intended scope.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Plugin Updates:**  Promptly apply security updates for all installed plugins.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan plugins for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Audits:**  Conduct security audits of critical plugins, especially those developed in-house or by third parties.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Ensure plugins properly validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure plugins operate with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Logic Flaw in User Authentication](./threats/logic_flaw_in_user_authentication.md)

*   **Threat:** Logic Flaw in User Authentication
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw in Mattermost's authentication logic to bypass authentication, impersonate other users, or escalate privileges. This could involve flaws in session management, password reset mechanisms, or multi-factor authentication implementation. For example, a flaw in how session tokens are validated or invalidated.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to data, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `app` layer authentication functions (e.g., `AuthenticateUser`, `CreateUser`, `UpdateUserPassword`, `LoginById`), `model` layer user and session structures, and potentially the `api4` layer handling authentication requests.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Code Review:**  Conduct rigorous code reviews of authentication-related code.
        *   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform penetration testing specifically targeting authentication mechanisms.
        *   **Secure Session Management:**  Use strong session identifiers, implement proper session expiration and invalidation, and protect against session fixation attacks.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all users.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Threat: [Improper Access Control in Channel Management](./threats/improper_access_control_in_channel_management.md)

*   **Threat:** Improper Access Control in Channel Management
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw in how Mattermost enforces channel permissions.  This could allow them to join private channels they shouldn't have access to, read messages in those channels, or modify channel settings.  For example, a flaw in the logic that checks user membership before granting access to channel data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** `app` layer channel management functions (e.g., `CreateChannel`, `GetChannel`, `JoinChannel`, `UpdateChannel`), `model` layer channel and channel member structures, and the `api4` layer handling channel-related requests.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control Enforcement:**  Ensure that channel permissions are rigorously enforced at all levels (API, application logic, database).
        *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly audit channel memberships and permissions.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary access to channels.
        *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review code related to channel access control.

## Threat: [Unpatched Mattermost Server Vulnerability](./threats/unpatched_mattermost_server_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Unpatched Mattermost Server Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** The Mattermost server is running an outdated version with known security vulnerabilities. An attacker exploits one of these publicly known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or compromise the server.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially ranging from data breach to complete server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially any component of the Mattermost server, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a known exploit exists) to High (if a vulnerability is known but no exploit is readily available)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Patch Management Process:** Implement a robust patch management process to ensure that security updates are applied promptly.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the Mattermost server for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Weak File Storage Permissions](./threats/weak_file_storage_permissions.md)

* **Threat:** Weak File Storage Permissions
    * **Description:** If using local file storage, an attacker with access to the server's filesystem (e.g., through another compromised service or a misconfigured SSH) could directly access files uploaded to Mattermost if the file permissions are too permissive. If using cloud storage (S3, MinIO), misconfigured access policies could allow unauthorized access.
    * **Impact:** Data breach of uploaded files.
    * **Affected Component:** `filesstore` package (if using local storage), configuration of cloud storage provider (if using cloud storage).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Least Privilege (Local Storage):** Ensure the Mattermost process runs with the least privileged user account possible, and that file permissions on the storage directory are restricted to that user.
        * **Secure Cloud Storage Configuration:** Follow best practices for securing cloud storage buckets (e.g., AWS S3, MinIO), including using IAM roles, access control lists, and encryption.
        * **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit file storage permissions and cloud storage configurations.

## Threat: [Data Retention Policy Violation via Direct Database Access](./threats/data_retention_policy_violation_via_direct_database_access.md)

* **Threat:** Data Retention Policy Violation via Direct Database Access
    * **Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the Mattermost database (e.g., through a compromised database account or a SQL injection vulnerability in a plugin). They can then bypass Mattermost's data retention policies and access or exfiltrate data that should have been deleted.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, violation of data retention policies, potential legal and compliance issues.
    * **Affected Component:** The database (PostgreSQL or MySQL) and the database access credentials.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Database Security:** Implement strong database security measures, including strong passwords, access controls, and regular security audits.
        * **SQL Injection Prevention:** Ensure that all database queries are properly parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
        * **Database Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege (Database):** Grant the Mattermost database user only the minimum necessary privileges.
        * **Regular Database Backups and Audits:** Regularly back up the database and audit database activity for suspicious behavior.
