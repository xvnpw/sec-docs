## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_multi-factor_authentication__mfa_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Enable MFA Providers in Mattermost System Console:** Access the Mattermost System Console as an administrator. Navigate to "Authentication" -> "MFA/SSO". Enable the desired MFA provider by toggling "Enable Multi-factor Authentication" to `true`. This primarily enables TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) MFA. For other providers like SAML/SSO, configure those settings accordingly in the same section.
    *   **Step 2: Configure MFA Enforcement Policy:**  Within the "MFA/SSO" settings, define the MFA enforcement policy. Options include:
        *   "Optional": Users can choose to enable MFA in their profile.
        *   "Required for all users": MFA is mandatory for all users upon next login.
        *   "Required for certain roles/groups" (Enterprise Edition): Enforce MFA for specific user roles or groups.
    *   **Step 3: User Enrollment Guidance:** Provide clear instructions to users on how to enable MFA in their Mattermost profile settings. This typically involves navigating to "Settings" -> "Security" -> "Multi-factor Authentication" and following the on-screen prompts to scan a QR code with an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy) or set up WebAuthn.
    *   **Step 4: Monitor MFA Enrollment Status (System Console):** Regularly check the Mattermost System Console or user management tools (if available) to monitor MFA enrollment rates and identify users who haven't enabled MFA when it's required.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):**  Compromise of user accounts due to credential theft (phishing, password reuse, breaches). MFA adds a crucial second layer of security beyond just passwords, making account takeover significantly harder even if passwords are compromised.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Automated attempts to guess passwords. MFA renders password guessing attacks largely ineffective as attackers would need to bypass the second factor as well.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Account Takeover: Significantly Reduces
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: Significantly Reduces

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Unknown - Needs Verification. Check the Mattermost System Console under "Authentication" -> "MFA/SSO". Verify if "Enable Multi-factor Authentication" is set to `true` and what enforcement policy is configured ("Optional", "Required for all users", or "Required for certain roles/groups").

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If "Enable Multi-factor Authentication" is set to `false` in the System Console, MFA is completely disabled.
    *   If MFA enforcement is set to "Optional" and not actively encouraged or mandated for users, especially those with administrative privileges or access to sensitive information.
    *   If MFA is not enforced for all user roles or groups that require enhanced security (in Enterprise Edition).
    *   Lack of clear user documentation and communication promoting MFA adoption.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting for Login Attempts (Mattermost Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_for_login_attempts__mattermost_configuration_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Rate Limiting for Login Attempts (Mattermost Configuration)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Access Rate Limiting Settings in Mattermost System Console:** Log in to the Mattermost System Console as an administrator and navigate to "Security" -> "Rate Limiting".
    *   **Step 2: Configure Login Rate Limits:** Locate the settings related to login attempts.  Specifically, configure:
        *   "Maximum Login Attempts per Minute": Set the maximum number of failed login attempts allowed from a single IP address within a minute.
        *   "Login Attempt Window Duration": Define the time window (in seconds or minutes) for tracking login attempts.
        *   "Vary Rate Limiting By Header": Consider enabling this option to vary rate limiting based on specific HTTP headers if needed for more granular control.
    *   **Step 3: Enable Rate Limiting:** Ensure the "Enable Rate Limiting" toggle at the top of the "Rate Limiting" page is set to `true` to activate the configured rate limits.
    *   **Step 4: Monitor Mattermost Logs:** Regularly review Mattermost server logs (especially error logs) for rate limiting events. Look for log entries indicating blocked login attempts due to rate limiting. This helps in identifying potential brute-force attacks and fine-tuning the rate limiting settings.
    *   **Step 5: Adjust Rate Limits as Needed:** Based on log analysis and observed traffic patterns, adjust the "Maximum Login Attempts per Minute" and "Login Attempt Window Duration" values to optimize security without unduly impacting legitimate users.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Automated, rapid attempts to guess user passwords. Rate limiting significantly slows down brute-force attacks by limiting the number of login attempts from a single source within a given timeframe.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity - Login Endpoint Focused):**  Simple DoS attacks targeting the login endpoint by overwhelming it with login requests. Rate limiting can help mitigate these types of attacks by preventing a single source from flooding the login service.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: Moderately Reduces
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: Minimally Reduces (specifically for login endpoint DoS)

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Unknown - Needs Verification. Check the Mattermost System Console under "Security" -> "Rate Limiting". Verify if "Enable Rate Limiting" is set to `true` and examine the configured values for "Maximum Login Attempts per Minute" and "Login Attempt Window Duration".

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If "Enable Rate Limiting" is set to `false` in the System Console, rate limiting is completely disabled, leaving the login endpoint vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
    *   If rate limiting is enabled, but the configured values for "Maximum Login Attempts per Minute" are too high, rendering the rate limiting ineffective against determined attackers.
    *   If rate limiting is not specifically configured for login attempts, even if general rate limiting is enabled (though Mattermost typically includes login attempts in default rate limiting).


## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Mattermost Server (Patching)](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_mattermost_server__patching_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Regularly Update Mattermost Server (Patching)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Monitor Mattermost Security Announcements:** Subscribe to the Mattermost Security Mailing List or regularly check the Mattermost Security Updates page on their official website. This is crucial for staying informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities and available security patches.
    *   **Step 2: Establish a Regular Patching Schedule:** Define a consistent schedule for applying Mattermost server updates. For critical security updates, aim to apply them as soon as possible after release, ideally within days. For less critical updates, a monthly patching cycle is recommended.
    *   **Step 3: Utilize Mattermost Release Channels:** Understand and utilize Mattermost's release channels (Stable, Beta, etc.). For production environments, always use the "Stable" channel.  Test beta or release candidate versions in a staging environment before production deployment.
    *   **Step 4: Test Updates in a Staging Environment:** Before applying any Mattermost server update to the production environment, thoroughly test it in a dedicated staging or testing environment that mirrors the production setup. This helps identify potential compatibility issues, regressions, or unexpected behavior before impacting live users.
    *   **Step 5: Follow Mattermost Upgrade Guides:** When upgrading Mattermost, always refer to the official Mattermost upgrade guides and release notes for specific instructions, database migration steps, and any breaking changes.
    *   **Step 6: Document the Update Process and Rollback Plan:** Document the entire Mattermost server update process, including pre-update checks, update steps, post-update verification, and a clear rollback plan in case of issues during or after the update.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Attackers actively exploit publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities in older, unpatched versions of Mattermost Server. Regular updates and patching are the primary defense against this threat.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity - Reduced Exposure Window):** While updates cannot prevent zero-day attacks (attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities), staying up-to-date minimizes the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities before a patch becomes available.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: Significantly Reduces
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: Moderately Reduces (Exposure Window)

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Unknown - Needs Verification. Check the server maintenance procedures and documentation. Determine if there is a documented schedule for Mattermost server updates. Inquire with the operations or DevOps team about their patching practices and if they monitor Mattermost security announcements.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If there is no established schedule for regularly updating the Mattermost server.
    *   If updates are applied infrequently or with significant delays after security releases.
    *   If updates are applied directly to production without prior testing in a staging environment.
    *   If the update process is not documented, and there is no clear rollback plan.
    *   If the team is not actively monitoring Mattermost security announcements for vulnerability disclosures.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Webhook Configuration and Validation (Mattermost Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_webhook_configuration_and_validation__mattermost_feature_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Secure Webhook Configuration and Validation (Mattermost Feature)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Generate Strong, Random Webhook Secrets (Mattermost UI):** When creating incoming or outgoing webhooks within Mattermost (via Integrations settings in team or channel settings), Mattermost automatically generates a unique, random webhook URL. Treat this URL as a secret key.
    *   **Step 2: Securely Store and Manage Webhook URLs:** Store webhook URLs securely. Avoid embedding them directly in public code, client-side JavaScript, or insecure configuration files. Use environment variables, secrets management systems, or secure configuration management practices to handle webhook URLs.
    *   **Step 3: Implement Input Validation in Webhook Integrations (External Application/Script):** In the external application or script that *receives* webhook data from Mattermost, rigorously validate all incoming data from the webhook payload. Sanitize and validate data types, formats, and expected values. This is crucial to prevent injection vulnerabilities in your webhook receiver logic.
    *   **Step 4: Implement Input Validation in Mattermost Custom Commands/Outgoing Webhooks (Mattermost Server-Side):** If you are developing custom commands or outgoing webhooks that process user input *within* Mattermost server-side code (e.g., plugins), ensure you perform thorough input validation on any user-provided data before processing it or using it in commands or API calls.
    *   **Step 5: Rate Limit Webhook Usage (Consider External Rate Limiting):** While Mattermost itself might have some internal rate limiting for webhook processing, consider implementing rate limiting on your external webhook receiver application or infrastructure to protect against abuse or DoS attacks targeting your webhook endpoints.
    *   **Step 6: Regularly Review and Audit Webhook Integrations (Mattermost UI):** Periodically review the list of configured incoming and outgoing webhooks in Mattermost (via Integrations settings).  Remove any unused or outdated webhooks. Audit the permissions and channels associated with each webhook to ensure they are still necessary and configured according to the principle of least privilege.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Webhook URL Guessing/Exposure (Medium Severity):** If webhook URLs are predictable or accidentally exposed, attackers could send malicious payloads. Strong, random URLs mitigate guessing.
    *   **Webhook Injection Attacks (High Severity):**  If webhook receiver applications or Mattermost custom integrations lack input validation, attackers can inject malicious data through webhook payloads, leading to vulnerabilities like command injection, XSS (if webhook data is displayed in Mattermost), or data manipulation.
    *   **Webhook Abuse/DoS (Medium Severity):**  Malicious actors or compromised systems could flood webhook endpoints with requests, potentially causing denial of service or resource exhaustion. Rate limiting helps mitigate this.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Webhook URL Guessing/Exposure: Moderately Reduces
    *   Webhook Injection Attacks: Significantly Reduces
    *   Webhook Abuse/DoS: Moderately Reduces

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Unknown - Needs Verification. Check the documentation and procedures for creating and managing Mattermost webhooks. Review any custom integrations or webhook receiver applications for input validation practices. Check if there are any guidelines for secure storage and management of webhook URLs.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If there are no guidelines or procedures for secure webhook URL management and storage.
    *   If webhook receiver applications or Mattermost custom integrations lack robust input validation for webhook payloads.
    *   If there is no rate limiting in place for webhook endpoints (either in Mattermost itself or in external webhook receivers).
    *   If there is no regular review process for configured webhooks to remove unused ones and audit permissions.
