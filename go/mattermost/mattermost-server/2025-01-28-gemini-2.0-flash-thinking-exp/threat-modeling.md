    *   Regularly scan Mattermost for and patch XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or content within Mattermost.

## Threat: [Command injection via slash commands](./threats/command_injection_via_slash_commands.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious slash command that, when executed by a user in Mattermost, allows them to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the Mattermost server or backend systems. This is possible if slash command processing within Mattermost is not properly sanitized and validated.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Mattermost server, full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Slash command processing module, Command execution, Backend integrations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all input to slash commands within Mattermost.
    *   Avoid executing shell commands directly based on user input in Mattermost slash command processing.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when slash commands interact with databases or external systems.
    *   Implement strict input validation and whitelisting for allowed characters and commands in Mattermost slash command handling.
    *   Regularly audit and review slash command implementations in Mattermost for security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Mattermost server code](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerability_in_mattermost_server_code.md)

*   **Description:** A critical vulnerability exists in the Mattermost server application code itself that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could be exploited remotely without authentication, or through authenticated access depending on the vulnerability. Exploitation would directly target flaws in Mattermost's codebase.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service, complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Mattermost instance.
*   **Affected Component:** Core Mattermost server application code, potentially various modules depending on the vulnerability.
