# Attack Surface Analysis for mattermost/mattermost-server

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into the Mattermost web application, executed in users' browsers.
*   **Mattermost-Server Contribution:** Mattermost Server processes and renders user-generated content (messages, usernames, channel names, custom emojis, etc.). Insufficient sanitization by the server before rendering this content leads to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A user crafts a message containing malicious JavaScript. When another user views this message through the Mattermost web interface, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or redirecting them to a malicious site.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement of the Mattermost interface, phishing attacks targeting Mattermost users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding within the Mattermost Server codebase for all user-generated content displayed in the web interface.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers configured by Mattermost Server to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
        *   Regularly update Mattermost Server to benefit from security patches addressing XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Conduct security code reviews and penetration testing specifically targeting XSS vulnerabilities in Mattermost Server's content handling.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious SQL code into database queries executed by Mattermost Server, allowing attackers to manipulate the database.
*   **Mattermost-Server Contribution:** Mattermost Server interacts with a database (PostgreSQL or MySQL) to store all persistent data. If database queries within the Mattermost Server codebase are not properly parameterized when handling user input or internal data, SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input in a search query or user profile update that is processed by Mattermost Server and injects SQL code into the database query. This code could be used to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data from the database (user credentials, messages), or even modify or delete data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, denial of service, potential for complete server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements** within the Mattermost Server codebase when interacting with the database. This prevents user input from being interpreted as SQL code.
        *   Implement input validation within Mattermost Server to ensure data conforms to expected formats and lengths before being used in database queries.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege for database user accounts used by Mattermost Server, configured during Mattermost Server setup.
        *   Regularly update Mattermost Server and database software to patch known vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws.
        *   Perform database security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting SQL injection vulnerabilities in Mattermost Server's database interactions.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing Mattermost Server's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Mattermost-Server Contribution:** Mattermost Server implements and manages various authentication methods (username/password, LDAP/AD, SAML, OAuth). Vulnerabilities in the implementation of these methods or in the core authentication logic within Mattermost Server can lead to bypasses.
*   **Example:** A flaw in the session management logic within Mattermost Server allows an attacker to hijack another user's session without knowing their credentials. Or, a vulnerability in the SAML integration within Mattermost Server allows bypassing SAML authentication and directly accessing Mattermost.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, channels, and sensitive data. Potential for data breaches, data modification, and abuse of system functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust and secure authentication mechanisms within Mattermost Server, adhering to security best practices.
        *   Thoroughly test authentication logic within Mattermost Server for vulnerabilities, including edge cases and error handling.
        *   Regularly review and update authentication libraries and integrations used by Mattermost Server.
        *   Enforce strong password policies and consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) within Mattermost Server configuration.
        *   Implement account lockout mechanisms within Mattermost Server to mitigate brute-force attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass (Privilege Escalation)](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass__privilege_escalation_.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining access to resources or functionalities within Mattermost Server that a user is not authorized to access, often by exploiting flaws in the authorization logic.
*   **Mattermost-Server Contribution:** Mattermost Server implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage permissions for channels, teams, and system administration. Vulnerabilities in the permission checks or RBAC implementation within Mattermost Server can lead to authorization bypasses.
*   **Example:** A regular user exploits a vulnerability in Mattermost Server to gain administrator privileges, allowing them to access system settings, modify user accounts, or access private channels they shouldn't have access to. Or, a user in one team gains unauthorized access to channels in another team due to a flaw in Mattermost Server's team/channel permission logic.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of system settings, potential for privilege escalation to system administrator level, disruption of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement a robust and well-defined authorization model within Mattermost Server, following the principle of least privilege.
        *   Thoroughly test authorization logic within Mattermost Server for vulnerabilities, ensuring that permission checks are consistently applied across all functionalities.
        *   Regularly review and audit the RBAC implementation within Mattermost Server to ensure it aligns with security policies.
        *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization within Mattermost Server to prevent manipulation of authorization parameters.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from misconfigured Mattermost Server settings or default configurations.
*   **Mattermost-Server Contribution:** Mattermost Server has numerous configuration options defined in its configuration files and system console. Incorrect settings directly managed within Mattermost Server can weaken security.
*   **Example:** Using default database credentials during Mattermost Server setup, exposing the admin panel to the public internet through Mattermost Server configuration, disabling security features like rate limiting within Mattermost Server settings, or using insecure TLS configurations managed by Mattermost Server.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the misconfiguration, including unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service, and server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Administrators:**
        *   **Change all default passwords** for database and administrator accounts immediately after Mattermost Server installation and setup.
        *   **Secure the Mattermost System Console** by restricting access based on network configuration and administrator authentication, configured within Mattermost Server.
        *   **Follow security hardening guidelines** provided in the Mattermost documentation, specifically for server configuration.
        *   **Regularly review and audit Mattermost Server configurations** to ensure they are secure and aligned with best practices.
        *   **Enable and properly configure security features** like rate limiting, TLS, and Content Security Policy within Mattermost Server settings.
