# Attack Surface Analysis for mattermost/mattermost-server

## Attack Surface: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into data stored on the server, which are then executed in the browsers of other users when they view that data.

**How Mattermost-Server Contributes:** Mattermost allows users to input and store rich text content in various areas like channel posts, comments, user profiles (custom status, about me), and potentially through plugin-rendered content. If input sanitization is insufficient, malicious scripts can be stored.

**Example:** A user crafts a message containing a `<script>` tag that steals session cookies and posts it in a channel. When other users view this message, their cookies are sent to the attacker.

**Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content before storing it in the database and when rendering it in the UI. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. Regularly update Mattermost to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker tricks a logged-in user into unknowingly performing actions on the Mattermost server on their behalf.

**How Mattermost-Server Contributes:** Mattermost has various state-changing actions (e.g., creating channels, inviting users, changing settings) that can be triggered via HTTP requests. If these requests lack proper CSRF protection, attackers can craft malicious links or embed forms on external sites to trigger these actions when a logged-in user visits them.

**Example:** An attacker sends a user a link that, when clicked, silently adds the attacker to a private channel on the user's Mattermost instance.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, potentially leading to data breaches, account compromise, or manipulation of the platform.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement anti-CSRF tokens (Synchronizer Token Pattern) for all state-changing requests. Ensure proper validation of the `Origin` or `Referer` headers. Utilize the built-in CSRF protection mechanisms provided by the framework.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) via API](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__via_api.md)

**Description:** An attacker can access or manipulate resources by directly guessing or manipulating the resource identifier (e.g., user ID, channel ID) in API requests without proper authorization checks.

**How Mattermost-Server Contributes:** Mattermost's REST API exposes numerous endpoints that operate on specific resources identified by IDs. If authorization checks are insufficient or rely solely on the presence of an ID without verifying the user's right to access that resource, IDOR vulnerabilities can arise.

**Example:** An attacker changes the channel ID in an API request to retrieve messages from a private channel they are not a member of.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of resources, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust authorization checks on all API endpoints. Never rely solely on the presence of an ID. Verify that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access or modify the requested resource. Use non-sequential, unpredictable resource identifiers (UUIDs).

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Integrations (Webhooks/Slash Commands)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_integrations__webhooksslash_commands_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can induce the Mattermost server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external URLs, potentially exposing internal services or performing actions on behalf of the server.

**How Mattermost-Server Contributes:** Mattermost's webhook and slash command integrations allow users to trigger server-side requests to external services based on user-provided URLs. If input validation and sanitization of these URLs are insufficient, attackers can manipulate them to target internal resources or external services.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious webhook payload that causes the Mattermost server to make a request to an internal administration panel, potentially leading to unauthorized configuration changes.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, port scanning of internal networks, potential for further exploitation of internal services, denial-of-service attacks on external services.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for URLs used in integrations. Use allow-lists of allowed domains or protocols. Consider using a dedicated service or library for making external requests with built-in SSRF protection. Implement proper authentication and authorization for outgoing requests.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security flaws within third-party plugins can introduce vulnerabilities into the Mattermost instance.

**How Mattermost-Server Contributes:** Mattermost's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality, but it also introduces the risk of vulnerabilities in the plugins themselves. These plugins run within the Mattermost server environment and can interact with its data and APIs.

**Example:** A poorly coded plugin might be vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to compromise the Mattermost database. Another plugin might have an XSS vulnerability that affects users interacting with its UI elements.

**Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the plugin vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, denial-of-service, and cross-site scripting.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement a robust plugin security review process. Provide clear guidelines and security best practices for plugin developers. Implement sandboxing or isolation mechanisms for plugins. Regularly update the Mattermost server and plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Flaws in API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_flaws_in_api_endpoints.md)

**Description:** Weaknesses in the authentication or authorization mechanisms for Mattermost's API endpoints allow unauthorized access or manipulation of data.

**How Mattermost-Server Contributes:** Mattermost relies heavily on its REST API for various functionalities. Flaws in how users are authenticated or how their permissions are checked for specific API calls can lead to significant security issues.

**Example:** An API endpoint intended for administrators to manage users lacks proper authentication, allowing any authenticated user to perform administrative actions. Another endpoint might not correctly verify user permissions before allowing access to sensitive data.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation, account takeover.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., secure session management, OAuth 2.0). Enforce the principle of least privilege by granting only necessary permissions. Implement robust authorization checks on all API endpoints, verifying user roles and permissions before granting access. Regularly review and audit API access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Rate Limiting Issues on Authentication Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/rate_limiting_issues_on_authentication_endpoints.md)

**Description:** Lack of proper rate limiting on authentication-related endpoints allows attackers to perform brute-force attacks to guess user credentials.

**How Mattermost-Server Contributes:** Mattermost's login and password reset functionalities are potential targets for brute-force attacks. Without adequate rate limiting, attackers can repeatedly attempt to log in with different credentials until they find a valid combination.

**Example:** An attacker uses automated tools to repeatedly try different passwords for a known username on the Mattermost login page.

**Impact:** Account compromise, unauthorized access to the platform.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints (login, password reset, etc.) to limit the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a specific timeframe. Consider implementing account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts.
