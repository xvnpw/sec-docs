# Threat Model Analysis for mattermost/mattermost-server

## Threat: [Mattermost Session Hijacking](./threats/mattermost_session_hijacking.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within Mattermost's session management to intercept or steal a valid user's session token. This could be due to flaws in token generation, storage, or handling. With the stolen token, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user.

**Impact:** The attacker gains full access to the victim's Mattermost account, allowing them to read and send messages, modify settings, and potentially perform administrative actions if the hijacked account has those privileges.

**Affected Component:** Session Management Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce HTTPS for all Mattermost traffic to encrypt session tokens in transit.
* Implement secure session token generation and management practices within Mattermost.
* Set appropriate session timeout values.
* Consider using HTTP Only and Secure flags for session cookies.

## Threat: [Mattermost Authentication Bypass](./threats/mattermost_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Mattermost's authentication logic to gain access without providing valid credentials. This could involve flaws in how different authentication methods (e.g., local, SSO) are handled within the Mattermost codebase.

**Impact:** Complete unauthorized access to the Mattermost instance, potentially allowing the attacker to access all channels, data, and administrative functions.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module, potentially SSO Integration Modules

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Mattermost Server updated to the latest version to patch known authentication vulnerabilities.
* Thoroughly test any custom authentication integrations within Mattermost.
* Follow Mattermost's security best practices for authentication configuration.

## Threat: [Mattermost Sensitive Data Exposure](./threats/mattermost_sensitive_data_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within Mattermost to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within Mattermost, such as private messages, user profiles, or configuration settings. This could involve flaws in access controls or data retrieval mechanisms within the Mattermost codebase.

**Impact:** Compromise of confidential information, potential regulatory violations (e.g., GDPR), reputational damage, and loss of user trust.

**Affected Component:** Data Storage Layer, Access Control Mechanisms

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure proper access controls are configured within Mattermost to restrict access to sensitive data.
* Encrypt data at rest in the Mattermost database and file storage.
* Regularly review and audit access permissions within Mattermost.

## Threat: [Mattermost Insecure File Handling](./threats/mattermost_insecure_file_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file to Mattermost that exploits vulnerabilities in how the server processes or stores files. This could lead to remote code execution on the server or the serving of malware to other users due to flaws in Mattermost's file handling logic.

**Impact:** Server compromise, malware distribution, potential data breaches, and disruption of service.

**Affected Component:** File Upload Handler, File Storage Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust file validation and sanitization on upload within Mattermost.
* Store uploaded files in a secure location with appropriate access controls enforced by Mattermost.
* Regularly scan uploaded files for malware.

## Threat: [Mattermost Malicious Plugin Exploitation](./threats/mattermost_malicious_plugin_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker installs or exploits a vulnerable or malicious Mattermost plugin. This plugin, leveraging the Mattermost Plugin API, could contain backdoors, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious actions with the privileges of the Mattermost server.

**Impact:** Server compromise, data breaches, and potential disruption of service.

**Affected Component:** Plugin Framework, Plugin API

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only install plugins from trusted sources.
* Thoroughly review the code of any custom or third-party plugins before installation.
* Implement a process for vetting and approving plugins.
* Regularly update plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Restrict plugin installation permissions to authorized administrators within Mattermost.

## Threat: [Mattermost Exposed Administrative Interface](./threats/mattermost_exposed_administrative_interface.md)

**Description:** The Mattermost administrative interface is accessible without proper authentication or from the public internet due to misconfiguration within Mattermost or the surrounding infrastructure.

**Impact:** Attackers could gain full control of the Mattermost instance, including user management, settings modification, and potentially access to sensitive data.

**Affected Component:** Administrative Interface

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict access to the administrative interface to authorized users and networks.
* Enforce strong authentication for the administrative interface within Mattermost.

## Threat: [Mattermost Unpatched Vulnerabilities](./threats/mattermost_unpatched_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The Mattermost server is running an outdated version with known security vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed and patched in newer versions of Mattermost Server.

**Impact:** Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities within the Mattermost codebase to compromise the server and its data.

**Affected Component:** All Components

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Establish a regular schedule for applying security updates to Mattermost Server.
* Subscribe to Mattermost security advisories to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
* Test updates in a non-production environment before deploying them to production.
