This document provides a detailed architectural design of the Mattermost server, an open-source, self-hosted team communication platform. This document is intended to serve as a foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's components, interactions, and data flows. This revision aims to provide more clarity and detail based on initial feedback.

### 2. Purpose

The primary purpose of this document is to outline the architecture of the Mattermost server in sufficient detail to facilitate effective threat modeling. It aims to identify key components, data flows, and trust boundaries within the system. This document will be used by security professionals to identify potential vulnerabilities and design appropriate security controls.

### 3. Scope

This document focuses on the core components and functionalities of the Mattermost server. It includes:

*   User interactions via standard clients (web, desktop, and mobile).
*   Core server functionalities encompassing message handling, channel management, and user management.
*   Database interactions for persistent data storage.
*   Push notification services for mobile client updates.
*   File storage mechanisms for user-uploaded content.
*   Authentication and authorization processes for secure access.
*   Key integration points, such as email and webhooks.

This document does not cover:

*   In-depth details of specific client implementations (web, desktop, mobile), although their interaction patterns with the server are described.
*   Specific deployment infrastructure configurations (e.g., particular cloud provider setups, containerization strategies).
*   Granular configuration options available within the Mattermost server.
*   Detailed architectures of specific plugins or individual plugin designs.

### 4. High-Level Architecture

The Mattermost server employs a client-server architecture. Clients (web, desktop, mobile) communicate with the server using RESTful APIs over HTTPS and establish persistent connections via WebSockets over TLS. The server is responsible for core business logic, data persistence, and communication with external services.

    *   Used for sending email notifications.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Sending emails for password resets, email invitations, and other notifications.
    *   **Communication:** Mattermost server sends emails via the SMTP protocol.
    *   **Security Considerations:** Requires secure configuration to prevent unauthorized email sending and potential spoofing.

*   **Integration Services (Webhooks/Slash Commands):**
    *   Enable interaction with external applications and services.
    *   **Incoming Webhooks:** Allow external systems to post messages into Mattermost channels via HTTP POST requests.
        *   **Security Considerations:** Requires validation of incoming requests to prevent unauthorized posting.
    *   **Outgoing Webhooks:** Triggered by messages in Mattermost, sending data to external systems via HTTP POST requests.
        *   **Security Considerations:** Sensitive data might be transmitted, requires secure communication (HTTPS) and potentially authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Slash Commands:** Allow users to trigger actions in external systems by typing commands in Mattermost.
        *   **Security Considerations:** Requires careful authorization and input validation to prevent abuse.

### 6. Data Flow

Here are some key data flows within the Mattermost server:

*   **User Login:**
    1. Client application sends login credentials (username/password or OAuth token) to the Mattermost server via an HTTPS POST request to the `/api/v4/users/login` endpoint.
    2. Mattermost server authenticates the user against the stored credentials in the database.
    3. Upon successful authentication, the server creates a session and returns a session token to the client in the HTTP response.
    4. Subsequent requests from the client include the session token in the `Authorization` header for authorization.

*   **Sending a Message:**
    1. Client application sends a message content to the Mattermost server via a WebSocket connection or an HTTPS POST request to the `/api/v4/posts` endpoint.
    2. Mattermost server authenticates and authorizes the request based on the user's session and channel permissions.
    3. Server stores the message content, sender information, and timestamp in the `Posts` table in the database.
    4. Server pushes the new message data to relevant clients connected to the channel via WebSocket.
    5. If push notifications are enabled and the recipient is offline, the server sends a notification request to APNs/FCM containing relevant message details.

*   **Uploading a File:**
    1. Client application initiates a file upload to the Mattermost server via an HTTPS POST request to the `/api/v4/files` endpoint.
    2. Mattermost server authenticates and authorizes the request.
    3. Server stores the file in the configured file storage backend (e.g., writes to local disk or uploads to S3).
    4. Server stores metadata about the uploaded file (e.g., filename, size, storage location) in the `FileInfo` table in the database.
    5. A message containing a link or attachment information referencing the uploaded file can then be sent.

*   **Receiving a Push Notification:**
    1. Mattermost server sends a push notification request to APNs/FCM, including the device token and notification payload.
    2. APNs/FCM delivers the notification to the user's mobile device.
    3. User interacts with the notification, potentially opening the Mattermost mobile app.
    4. The mobile app connects to the Mattermost server via HTTPS/WSS to retrieve new messages and updates.

### 7. Security Considerations (For Threat Modeling)

This section outlines security considerations relevant for threat modeling:

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
