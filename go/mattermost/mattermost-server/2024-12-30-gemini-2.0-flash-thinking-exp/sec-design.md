        A["'User types message'"]
    end
    subgraph "Mattermost Server Environment"
        B["'Web Browser encrypts message (TLS)'"] --> C
        C["'Web Server (Nginx) receives encrypted request'"] --> D
        D["'Web Server decrypts request (TLS)'"] --> E
        E["'Mattermost Server API endpoint (authentication/authorization)'"] --> F
        F["'Message processing & validation (sanitization)'"] --> G
        G["'Database storage (encrypted at rest?)'"] --> H
        H["'WebSocket service (secure connection)'"] --> I
        I["'Push Notification Service (if needed, secure API call)'"] --> J
    end
    subgraph "Other Users (Web App)"
        K["'Receive encrypted message via WebSocket'"] --> L
        L["'Web Browser decrypts message'"]
    end
    subgraph "Mobile App Users"
        M["'Receive push notification (potentially containing message snippet)'"]
    end

    A --> B
    E --> F
    F --> G
    G --> H
    G --> I
    G --> J
    I --> K
    J --> M
```

**Detailed Message Flow with Security Considerations:**

1. **User Action:** A user types a message in the Mattermost Web Application.
2. **Client-Side Encryption:** The web browser encrypts the message using TLS before sending it.
3. **Web Server Reception:** The Web Server (e.g., Nginx) receives the encrypted HTTPS request.
4. **Web Server Decryption:** The Web Server decrypts the request.
5. **API Endpoint Handling:** The Mattermost Server API endpoint receives the request and performs authentication and authorization checks to verify the user's identity and permissions.
6. **Message Processing and Validation:** The server processes the message, validating its content and sanitizing it to prevent XSS or other injection attacks.
7. **Data Persistence:** The message is stored in the database, potentially encrypted at rest.
8. **Real-time Notification:** The Mattermost Server sends the new message to relevant connected clients via a secure WebSocket connection (encrypted).
9. **Push Notification (Optional):** If users are offline, the server sends a request to the Push Notification Service via a secure API call. The content of the notification needs careful consideration to avoid information leakage.
10. **Client Update:** Other users' web applications receive the encrypted message via the WebSocket connection and decrypt it in the browser. Mobile applications receive push notifications.
