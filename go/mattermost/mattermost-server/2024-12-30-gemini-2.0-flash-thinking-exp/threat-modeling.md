### High and Critical Mattermost Server Threats

This list contains high and critical security threats directly involving the Mattermost Server component.

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass via API Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a Mattermost API endpoint (e.g., related to password reset or session creation) to bypass the normal authentication process. They might craft malicious requests or manipulate parameters to gain access without valid credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially leading to data breaches, impersonation, and malicious actions within the Mattermost instance.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Authentication API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v4/users/login`, `/api/v4/users/password/reset`), Session management middleware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all API endpoints.
        *   **Developers:** Enforce proper authentication and authorization checks before granting access to sensitive resources.
        *   **Developers:** Regularly audit and penetration test API endpoints for authentication vulnerabilities.
        *   **Developers:** Follow secure coding practices to prevent common authentication flaws.
        *   **Developers:** Keep Mattermost Server updated to the latest version with security patches.

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation through Role Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker, possibly with a low-privileged account, exploits a flaw in Mattermost's role-based access control (RBAC) system. They might manipulate API requests or exploit vulnerabilities in permission checks to elevate their privileges to those of a system administrator or other high-privilege roles.
    *   **Impact:**  Full control over the Mattermost instance, including the ability to access all data, modify configurations, create/delete users, and potentially compromise the underlying server.
    *   **Affected Component:** RBAC module, Permission checking functions, User and role management API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v4/users/{user_id}/roles`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict and well-defined role hierarchies and permissions.
        *   **Developers:** Ensure all actions are properly authorized based on the user's role.
        *   **Developers:** Regularly audit and review the RBAC implementation for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Developers:** Implement safeguards against direct manipulation of role assignments through API calls.
        *   **Administrators:** Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles to users.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Insecure API Endpoint
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a Mattermost API endpoint that allows them to retrieve sensitive information without proper authorization. This could involve accessing user data, channel content, or server configuration details by crafting specific requests or exploiting missing access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential information, potentially leading to privacy violations, reputational damage, and further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v4/users`, `/api/v4/channels`, `/api/v4/teams`), Data retrieval functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement proper authorization checks on all API endpoints to ensure only authorized users can access specific data.
        *   **Developers:** Avoid exposing sensitive information in API responses unless absolutely necessary.
        *   **Developers:** Implement rate limiting and other security measures to prevent excessive API requests.
        *   **Developers:** Regularly review API endpoints for potential information disclosure vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through Webhooks/Integrations
    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages Mattermost's webhook or integration functionality to force the Mattermost server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external systems. This could be achieved by manipulating webhook URLs or integration configurations.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of internal services, potential for further attacks on internal infrastructure, and exfiltration of sensitive data from internal systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Webhook processing module, Integration framework, Outgoing webhook handlers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of URLs used in webhooks and integrations.
        *   **Developers:** Restrict the network access of the Mattermost server to only necessary external resources.
        *   **Developers:** Implement allow-listing of allowed destination URLs for outgoing requests.
        *   **Administrators:** Carefully review and approve all webhook and integration configurations.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Installation
    *   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (e.g., system administrator) installs a malicious plugin that contains backdoors, malware, or exploits vulnerabilities in the Mattermost server or connected systems.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Mattermost server and potentially the underlying infrastructure, data theft, and disruption of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin management module, Plugin API, Server core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Administrators:**  Restrict plugin installation privileges to trusted administrators only.
        *   **Administrators:**  Thoroughly vet and review all plugins before installation, even those from the official marketplace.
        *   **Administrators:**  Implement code signing and verification for plugins.
        *   **Developers:**  Implement strong security measures within the plugin framework to limit the capabilities of plugins.

*   **Threat:** Insecure File Storage and Retrieval
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how Mattermost stores and retrieves uploaded files. This could involve accessing files without proper authorization, manipulating file metadata, or exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities to access files outside of designated storage locations.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data breaches, and manipulation of file content.
    *   **Affected Component:** File storage module, File upload/download API endpoints, Access control mechanisms for files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement secure file storage mechanisms with proper access controls.
        *   **Developers:** Prevent direct access to file storage directories from the web.
        *   **Developers:** Sanitize file names and prevent path traversal vulnerabilities during file upload and retrieval.
        *   **Developers:** Implement integrity checks for stored files.
