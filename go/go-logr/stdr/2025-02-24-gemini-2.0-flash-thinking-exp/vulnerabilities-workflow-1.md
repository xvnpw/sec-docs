## Combined Vulnerability List

Initial analysis of the project files did not reveal any high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance of the application. However, further investigation identified a potential vulnerability in a CI script, which, while not directly part of the application runtime, could pose a risk to the development and build process.

### Vulnerability: Git Checkout Option Injection in CI Script (`_tools/apidiff.sh`)

- **Description**:
  The CI helper script `_tools/apidiff.sh` uses user-provided input as a Git reference without proper sanitization. Specifically, the script accepts a branch or tag value via the `-r` parameter and uses it in a `git checkout` command:
  ```bash
  git -C "${clone}" co "${ref}"
  ```
  The script lacks validation to ensure that the provided reference (`${ref}`) does not start with a hyphen. Consequently, if an attacker can control the `-r` parameter (e.g., through a malicious branch name in a pull request), they could inject Git options like `--detach` or `-f`. Git would then interpret these values as command options instead of branch names, potentially altering the intended behavior of the `git checkout` command within the CI workflow.

- **Impact**:
  Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
  - **Manipulate CI Pipeline Behavior**: By injecting Git options, an attacker can alter the checkout process, potentially leading to unintended states like a detached HEAD. This can disrupt the intended flow of the CI pipeline, causing tests to run in an incorrect context or preventing them from running altogether.
  - **Circumvent API Difference Tests**: By altering the checkout, an attacker might be able to bypass or manipulate the API difference tests, leading to undetected regressions or vulnerabilities being introduced.
  - **Expose Sensitive Information**: Modified Git commands could potentially output sensitive build or repository information, depending on the injected options and the CI environment setup.
  - **Compromise Build Integrity**: Changes to the checkout process could lead to builds being generated from unintended code states, compromising the integrity of the final build artifacts.
  While this vulnerability is not a direct path to remote code execution on a publicly facing application instance, it presents a significant risk to the development pipeline's integrity and reliability.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
  - **Double Quotes**: The script uses double quotes around the `${ref}` variable (`"${ref}"`). This prevents shell word splitting and pathname expansion, but it does not prevent Git from interpreting arguments starting with a hyphen as options.
  - **`getopts` for Argument Parsing**: The script utilizes `getopts` for parsing command-line arguments, which enforces a structured approach to option handling in the script. However, `getopts` itself does not provide input validation against malicious option injection in the context of Git commands.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - **Input Validation**: Implement validation for the `-r` parameter to reject any input that begins with a hyphen (`-`). This would prevent the injection of Git options through this parameter.
  - **End-of-Options Delimiter (`--`)**: Modify the `git checkout` command to include the end-of-options delimiter `--` before the `${ref}` variable. This ensures that Git treats everything following `--` as literal arguments (branch/tag names) and not as command-line options. The corrected command would be:
    ```bash
    git -C "${clone}" co -- "${ref}"
    ```

- **Preconditions**:
  - **Control over `-r` Parameter**: An attacker must be able to influence or control the value passed to the `-r` parameter of the `_tools/apidiff.sh` script. In the context of the provided GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/apidiff.yaml`), this parameter is indirectly derived from `github.base_ref`.
  - **CI Accepts External Contributions**: The CI environment must be configured to process pull requests or other events that could be initiated or influenced by external contributors, where branch names or base references might be under their control.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
  1. **Input Handling with `getopts`**:
     The script uses `getopts` to parse command-line arguments, including the `-r` option:
     ```bash
     while getopts "r:" opt; do
         case "$opt" in
             r) ref="$OPTARG" ;;
             *) usage; exit 1 ;;
         esac
     done
     ```
     This section reads the value provided with the `-r` option and stores it in the `ref` variable.

  2. **Git Checkout Command**:
     Later in the script, the `ref` variable is used in the `git checkout` command:
     ```bash
     if [[ -n "${ref}" ]]; then
         git -C "${clone}" co "${ref}"
     fi
     ```
     The `${ref}` variable is correctly quoted to prevent word splitting. However, the lack of the `--` delimiter before `${ref}` means that Git will still interpret any argument starting with a hyphen as a potential option.

  3. **Vulnerability Trigger**:
     If an attacker provides a value for `-r` that starts with a hyphen (e.g., `--detach`), the executed command becomes something like:
     ```bash
     git -C /tmp/clone co "--detach"
     ```
     Git interprets `--detach` as the `--detach` option, not as a branch name, leading to unintended behavior.

  4. **Visualization**:

         C -- No --> E{Continue script};
         D --> F{Git checkout with "${ref}"};
         F --> G[Script continues];

             I --> J[git co "master"];

         end

         subgraph Exploit Flow
             L[Attacker provides: -r "--detach"] --> M{${ref} = "--detach"};
             M --> N[git co "--detach"];
             N --> O[Git interprets "--detach" as option];
             O --> P[Unintended Git behavior (e.g., detached HEAD)];
         end
     ```

- **Security Test Case**:
  1. **Setup**:
     - Fork the repository.
     - Set up a test CI environment or utilize the existing GitHub Actions workflow of your fork.
     - Ensure you have control over triggering CI workflows, for instance, by creating and pushing branches and opening pull requests.

  2. **Test Steps**:
     - Create a new branch in your forked repository with a name that starts with a hyphen. For example, name the branch `--test-exploit`.
     - Push this branch to your fork (`git push origin --test-exploit`).
     - Open a pull request from your `--test-exploit` branch to the main branch of your fork. This should trigger the CI workflow defined in `.github/workflows/apidiff.yaml`.
     - Monitor the logs of the triggered CI workflow, specifically looking at the output of the `_tools/apidiff.sh` script, especially the Git checkout step.

  3. **Validation**:
     - Examine the CI logs for the Git checkout command execution.
     - **Successful Exploitation**: If the Git command output indicates unexpected behavior, such as error messages related to option parsing, help messages from Git, or if the checkout results in a detached HEAD state (which can be indicated in Git output), it confirms that the hyphenated branch name was misinterpreted as a Git option.
     - **Expected Behavior (without exploit)**: In a normal, non-vulnerable scenario, Git would attempt to checkout a branch named `--test-exploit` (which likely doesn't exist, but it would try to treat it as a branch name, not an option).

  4. **Post-Test & Remediation Verification**:
     - After confirming the vulnerability, implement the proposed mitigations: add input validation to reject hyphen-starting `-r` values and use `--` before `${ref}` in the `git checkout` command.
     - Repeat the test case with the mitigated script. Verify that the CI workflow now either rejects the hyphenated input or correctly attempts to checkout a branch named `--test-exploit` without misinterpreting it as an option, indicating the vulnerability is resolved.

By implementing the suggested missing mitigations, specifically input validation and using the `--` delimiter, the Git Checkout Option Injection vulnerability in the `_tools/apidiff.sh` script can be effectively resolved, enhancing the security and reliability of the CI pipeline.
