**Vulnerability List**

There are no vulnerabilities found in the project files that meet the specified criteria (vulnerability rank at least high, introduced by the project, valid and not mitigated, and exploitable by an external attacker on a publicly available instance).

After reviewing the provided code, specifically the `stdr.go` file and the `apidiff.sh` script, no high-rank vulnerabilities were identified that could be triggered by an external attacker on a public instance of an application using this library.

The `apidiff.sh` script is a development tool for API compatibility checks and is not intended for public exposure. While it uses `mktemp` and `git clone`, the usage context within the provided files does not indicate a direct vulnerability exploitable by an external attacker in a running application.

The `stdr.go` library itself is a logging wrapper and does not introduce any obvious high-risk vulnerabilities. It relies on Go's standard logging library, and the code appears to be well-structured and secure in its design. The formatting of log messages is handled by the `funcr.Formatter` from the `go-logr/funcr` library, which is designed to prevent format string vulnerabilities.

Therefore, based on the provided project files, there are no vulnerabilities to report according to the given criteria.
