# Attack Surface Analysis for labstack/echo

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection (Various Types - Exploiting Echo's Input Handling)](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection__various_types_-_exploiting_echo's_input_handling_.md)

*Description:* Attackers manipulate input parameters (URL path, query string, form data, headers) to inject malicious code or data. This leverages Echo's mechanisms for accessing these parameters.
*Echo Contribution:* Echo provides convenient methods to access and bind request parameters (`Param`, `QueryParam`, `FormValue`, `Bind`).  The framework *facilitates* access to these potentially malicious inputs, making proper validation by the developer absolutely critical.  Echo does *not* automatically sanitize or validate these inputs.
*Example:*
    *   **SQL Injection (via `Param`):** `e.GET("/users/:id", func(c echo.Context) error { id := c.Param("id"); // ... use 'id' directly in a SQL query ... })`  Echo extracts the `:id` parameter, and if the developer doesn't sanitize it, an attacker can inject SQL.
    *   **Command Injection (via `FormValue`):** `e.POST("/run", func(c echo.Context) error { cmd := c.FormValue("command"); // ... execute 'cmd' directly ... })` Echo retrieves the `command` from the form data; lack of sanitization allows command injection.
    *   **XSS (via `c.Render` and unescaped parameters):** `e.GET("/greet/:name", func(c echo.Context) error { name := c.Param("name"); return c.Render(http://StatusOK, "greet.html", map[string]interface{}{"name": name}) })` Echo renders the template, but if `greet.html` doesn't escape `name` (e.g., using `{{ .name | html }}`), XSS is possible.
*Impact:* Data breaches, data modification/deletion, server compromise, client-side code execution (XSS).
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** (SQLi, Command Injection) / **High** (XSS, other injections).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Input Validation (with Echo's `Bind`):** Use a validation library *in conjunction with* Echo's `Bind` to enforce strict rules on *all* parameters.  This is the primary defense.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** For database interactions, *always* use parameterized queries. This is *not* directly related to Echo, but is crucial in preventing SQLi when using data obtained *through* Echo.
    *   **Output Encoding (using Echo's template functions):** When using Echo's `c.Render`, *always* use the appropriate escaping functions (e.g., `{{ . | html }}`) to prevent XSS. This *directly* uses Echo's features for mitigation.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Route Matching/Exposure (Due to Echo's Routing)](./attack_surfaces/unintended_route_matchingexposure__due_to_echo's_routing_.md)

*Description:* Poorly defined routes in Echo, especially those using wildcards or regular expressions, can lead to unintended matches, exposing internal functionality.
*Echo Contribution:* This vulnerability is *entirely* due to Echo's routing system and how the developer configures it.  The flexibility of Echo's routing is a double-edged sword.
*Example:* `e.GET("/admin/*", adminHandler)` might unintentionally match `/admin/../../sensitive/file`.  The wildcard (`*`) in Echo's route definition is the direct cause.
*Impact:* Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, bypassing authentication.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Route Definitions:** Define routes as specifically as possible within Echo. Avoid overly broad wildcards in Echo's route definitions.
    *   **Route Testing:** Thoroughly test all possible route combinations *within Echo's context* to ensure they match as intended.
    *   **Explicit Method Handling:** Always specify the allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) for each route *in Echo*.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization (using Echo Middleware):** Apply authentication and authorization middleware *using Echo's middleware system* to all routes requiring protection.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Middleware (Specifically Echo's Middleware)](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_middleware__specifically_echo's_middleware_.md)

*Description:* Incorrect configuration of Echo's middleware, particularly CORS and authentication/authorization middleware, creates vulnerabilities.
*Echo Contribution:* This vulnerability stems *directly* from how the developer uses and configures Echo's middleware system. The framework provides the tools, but incorrect usage leads to problems.
*Example:*
    *   **CORS Misconfiguration (using `middleware.CORSWithConfig`):** `e.Use(middleware.CORSWithConfig(middleware.CORSConfig{AllowOrigins: []string{"*"}, ...}))` This Echo-specific configuration allows requests from any origin.
    *   **Auth Middleware Bypass:** If Echo's authentication middleware is not applied to all relevant routes *within Echo*, an attacker can bypass it.
    *   **Incorrect Middleware Order:** Applying Echo's logging middleware *before* Echo's authentication middleware.
*Impact:* Cross-origin attacks, unauthorized access, information disclosure.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Restrictive CORS (using Echo's CORS config):** Configure Echo's CORS middleware with the most restrictive settings. Avoid wildcards for `AllowOrigins`.
    *   **Comprehensive Middleware Coverage (using Echo's grouping):** Use Echo's group-level middleware to ensure consistent application of security middleware.
    *   **Correct Middleware Order (within Echo's setup):** Carefully plan and document the order of middleware *within Echo's configuration*.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads (Using Echo's `FormFile`)](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads__using_echo's__formfile__.md)

*Description:* If file uploads are allowed, failing to properly validate files obtained through Echo can lead to server compromise.
*Echo Contribution:* Echo provides the `FormFile` function to access uploaded files. This function is the *entry point* for the vulnerability; the framework provides the mechanism to receive the potentially malicious file.
*Example:* An attacker uploads a shell script, and the application, using `c.FormFile("file")` in Echo, saves it without proper validation.
*Impact:* Server compromise, remote code execution.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **File Type/Size/Content Validation:** Validate files obtained via `c.FormFile` *before* saving them. This validation is *not* built into Echo; it's the developer's responsibility.
    *   **Secure Storage:** Store files outside the web root (not directly related to Echo, but crucial).
    *   **Unique Filenames:** Generate unique filenames (not directly related to Echo, but a best practice).
