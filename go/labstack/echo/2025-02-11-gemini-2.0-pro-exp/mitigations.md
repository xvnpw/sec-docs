## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Middleware Ordering and Auditing (Echo-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_middleware_ordering_and_auditing__echo-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Middleware Ordering and Auditing (Echo-Specific)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Define a Standard Order (Echo-Specific):** Create documentation that explicitly defines the order in which Echo middleware should be applied using `e.Use()`. This order *must* prioritize security-critical middleware that interacts with Echo's `Context` or request/response handling.  Example order (prioritizing Echo-specific concerns):
            *   Authentication (using Echo's context for user data)
            *   Authorization (using Echo's context and routing information)
            *   CORS (using Echo's built-in CORS middleware)
            *   Request ID (for tracing within Echo's request lifecycle)
            *   Input Validation (specifically validating data bound using Echo's `c.Bind()`, `c.Param()`, etc.)
            *   Rate Limiting (if using an Echo-specific rate limiting middleware)
        2.  **Enforce the Order (Echo-Specific):** In the main application setup where the Echo instance (`e := echo.New()`) is created, apply middleware using `e.Use()` in the *exact* order specified. Avoid adding middleware within individual route handlers.
        3.  **Regular Audits (Echo-Specific):** Regularly review the `e.Use()` calls to ensure the defined order is maintained. Check for any middleware that might be bypassing security checks due to incorrect placement. Audit any custom middleware that interacts with the `echo.Context`.
        4.  **Document `Skipper` Logic (Echo-Specific):** If any middleware uses the `Skipper` function (a feature specific to Echo middleware), document the conditions under which the middleware is skipped *very* clearly. This is crucial because `Skipper` can bypass middleware execution.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Authentication Bypass (Severity: Critical):** Incorrect order could allow requests to bypass authentication checks implemented *within* Echo middleware.
        *   **Authorization Bypass (Severity: Critical):** Similar to above, but for authorization checks within Echo middleware.
        *   **CORS Misconfiguration (Severity: High):** Incorrect placement or configuration of Echo's *built-in* CORS middleware.
        *   **Middleware-Specific Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable):** Exploits targeting flaws in custom Echo middleware or how it interacts with `echo.Context`.
        *   **`Skipper` Abuse (Severity: High):** Malicious or unintentional misuse of the `Skipper` function to bypass security middleware.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (assuming the middleware itself is robust).
        *   **CORS Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced from High to Low (assuming correct configuration of Echo's CORS middleware).
        *   **Middleware-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **`Skipper` Abuse:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Middleware order is generally followed, but there's no formal document. Audits are sporadic. `Skipper` is used in `AuthMiddleware`, but the logic isn't well-documented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formal documentation of middleware order (specifically for `e.Use()`).
        *   Regular, scheduled audits of `e.Use()` calls.
        *   Comprehensive documentation of `Skipper` logic in `AuthMiddleware`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Context Immutability and Validation (Echo-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/context_immutability_and_validation__echo-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Context Immutability and Validation (Echo-Specific)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Read-Only Context (Preferential, Echo-Specific):** Within Echo request handlers, treat the `echo.Context` as read-only whenever possible. Access data using `c.Get()`, but avoid `c.Set()` unless absolutely necessary. This minimizes unintended side effects within Echo's request handling.
        2.  **Justified Modifications (Echo-Specific):** If a handler *must* modify the `echo.Context` (e.g., to store data for subsequent *Echo* middleware), document the reason clearly. Explain *why* `c.Set()` is necessary.
        3.  **Validation of Changes (Echo-Specific):** If *Echo* middleware modifies the `echo.Context`, add validation logic *within that middleware* to ensure the changes are safe and don't introduce vulnerabilities *within Echo's processing*.
        4.  **Strongly-Typed Keys (Echo-Specific):** When using `c.Set()` and `c.Get()` with the `echo.Context`, define constants for the keys (e.g., `const UserIDKey = "user_id"`). This prevents key collisions that could lead to unexpected behavior *within Echo*.
        5. **Avoid Sensitive Data in Context:** Never store sensitive data directly in the `echo.Context`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Context Manipulation Attacks (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious data into the `echo.Context`, which could be used to bypass security checks *within Echo's middleware chain* or influence Echo's behavior.
        *   **Data Leakage (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of accidentally exposing sensitive data stored in the `echo.Context`.
        *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Medium):** Prevents bugs caused by unintended `echo.Context` modifications.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Context Manipulation Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Handlers generally avoid modifying the context, but there's no strict enforcement. Strongly-typed keys are not consistently used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formal code review guidelines to enforce read-only `echo.Context` usage.
        *   Validation logic within Echo middleware that modifies the context.
        *   Consistent use of strongly-typed keys for `c.Set()` and `c.Get()`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Route Definitions and Parameter Validation (Echo-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_route_definitions_and_parameter_validation__echo-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Route Definitions and Parameter Validation (Echo-Specific)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Specific Routes (Echo-Specific):** Define routes using `e.GET()`, `e.POST()`, etc., as precisely as possible. Avoid overly broad wildcards or regular expressions in the route paths.
        2.  **Parameter Binding and Validation (Echo-Specific):** Use Echo's built-in parameter binding features:
            *   `c.Param("id")`: To extract route parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`).
            *   `c.QueryParam("sort")`: To extract query parameters (e.g., `/users?sort=asc`).
            *   `c.FormValue("name")`: To extract form data.
            *   `c.Bind(&user)`: To bind request data (JSON, XML, form) to a struct.
            *   *Immediately* after using any of these, validate the extracted data. Check type, format, and range.  Leverage Echo's validator integration if possible.
        3.  **Avoid Route Overlap (Echo-Specific):** Carefully review the route definitions (all calls to `e.GET()`, `e.POST()`, etc.) to ensure there are no overlapping routes.
        4.  **Regular Expression Review (Echo-Specific, if used):** If regular expressions are used in Echo route definitions, review them for ReDoS vulnerabilities.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Route Hijacking (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from accessing unintended Echo handlers by manipulating route parameters.
        *   **Injection Attacks (Severity: High):** Parameter validation (using Echo's binding features) prevents injection attacks that might be attempted through route parameters, query parameters, or form data *processed by Echo*.
        *   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (Severity: Medium):** Mitigates ReDoS if regular expressions are used in *Echo route definitions*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Route Hijacking:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Low (in conjunction with general input validation).
        *   **ReDoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Parameter binding is used, but validation is inconsistent. Route overlap checks are not formally performed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Consistent and comprehensive parameter validation *immediately* after using Echo's binding functions.
        *   Formal route review process.
        *   Review of regular expressions used in Echo routes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling (Echo-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling__echo-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Error Handling (Echo-Specific)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Custom Error Handler (Echo-Specific, Production):** Create a custom error handler using `e.HTTPErrorHandler`. This handler should:
            *   Log the full error details (including stack traces, and importantly, the `echo.Context`).
            *   Return a generic error message to the client, *without* revealing any internal details from the `echo.Context` or Echo's internal state.
                ```go
                func customHTTPErrorHandler(err error, c echo.Context) {
                    // ... (same code as before, but emphasize logging the c echo.Context) ...
                    log.Printf("Echo Context: %+v", c) // Log the entire context for debugging
                    // ... (rest of the error handling logic) ...
                }
                ```
        2.  **Environment-Specific Configuration (Echo-Specific):** Use environment variables to determine whether to use the custom `e.HTTPErrorHandler` (production) or Echo's default handler (development).
        3.  **Review `HTTPError` Usage (Echo-Specific):** Review all instances where `echo.NewHTTPError()` is used. Ensure that the error messages and status codes do not leak sensitive information *that might be specific to Echo's internal workings*.
        4. **Consistent Error Format:** Ensure all error responses have a consistent format.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Prevents attackers from gaining information about the application's internal workings, *specifically information related to Echo's request handling, middleware, or routing*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. A custom handler exists, but it doesn't consistently log the full `echo.Context`, and messages sometimes include internal details.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Comprehensive logging of the `echo.Context` in the custom error handler.
        *   Thorough review of all `echo.NewHTTPError()` usage.
        *   Consistent error response format.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure File Upload Handling (If using Echo's features)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_file_upload_handling__if_using_echo's_features_.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure File Upload Handling (If using Echo's features)
    * **Description:**
        1.  **Limit File Size (Echo-Specific):** Use `e.Use(middleware.BodyLimit("2M"))` to limit the maximum size of requests, including file uploads. This is an Echo-provided middleware.
        2.  **Validate File Type and Size (Echo-Specific):**
            *   Use `c.FormFile("file")` (an Echo function) to retrieve the uploaded file from the `echo.Context`.
            *   Validate file type using magic numbers (as described previously), *after* retrieving the file using `c.FormFile()`.
        3. Secure Storage and Malware Scanning (as described previously, but these are general security practices, not Echo-specific).
        4. Avoid Direct Execution (General security practice).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **File Upload Vulnerabilities (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from uploading malicious files. The use of `c.FormFile()` is the Echo-specific aspect.
        *   **Directory Traversal (Severity: High):** Secure storage practices (not Echo-specific).
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Preventing upload of HTML/JS files (partially related to using `c.FormFile()` for retrieval).

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **File Upload Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
        *   **Directory Traversal:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Low (in the context of file uploads).

    *   **Currently Implemented:** None. File uploads are not currently handled.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** All aspects of secure file upload handling, including the Echo-specific parts (`middleware.BodyLimit` and `c.FormFile`).
