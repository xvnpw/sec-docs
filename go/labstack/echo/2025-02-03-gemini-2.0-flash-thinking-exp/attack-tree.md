## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Echo Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_echo_application__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing significant damage to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Route Parameter Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious payloads into route parameters.
        *   **Examples:** SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal via manipulated route parameters.
        *   **Exploitation Steps:**
            *   Identify routes that use parameters in backend operations (database queries, file system access, etc.).
            *   Craft requests with malicious payloads in route parameters (e.g., `'/users/{id}'` with `id` as `'1; DROP TABLE users;'`).
            *   Application processes the parameter without proper sanitization, leading to unintended code execution or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerable Default Middleware Configuration (if applicable) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting insecure default configurations of middleware components.
        *   **Examples:** Overly permissive CORS policies, weak security headers, default credentials in middleware.
        *   **Exploitation Steps:**
            *   Identify default middleware used by the application (if any).
            *   Check for known insecure default configurations (e.g., CORS allowing `*` origin).
            *   Exploit the misconfiguration (e.g., CORS bypass to perform cross-site requests).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Header Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Injecting malicious content into HTTP request headers.
        *   **Examples:** SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery), Open Redirect, HTTP Response Splitting (less common in modern frameworks but theoretically possible).
        *   **Exploitation Steps:**
            *   Identify application code that uses request headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`, `Host`, `Referer`) in backend requests, redirects, or logging without sanitization.
            *   Craft requests with malicious payloads in headers (e.g., `Host: attacker.com` for Open Redirect).
            *   Application processes the injected header in a vulnerable manner, leading to SSRF, redirect, or other header-based attacks.
    *   **Parameter Pollution [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Sending requests with duplicate parameters (query string or form data) to cause unexpected behavior.
        *   **Examples:** Logic bypasses, authentication bypasses, data manipulation due to parameter precedence confusion.
        *   **Exploitation Steps:**
            *   Analyze application logic to understand how it handles request parameters, especially duplicate parameters.
            *   Craft requests with duplicate parameters (e.g., `'/api/resource?id=1&id=2'`).
            *   Application misinterprets or mishandles the duplicate parameters, leading to unintended behavior or security flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Response Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_response_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Verbose Error Responses [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting overly detailed error messages exposed in responses.
        *   **Examples:** Information leakage (path disclosure, internal configuration details, database schema), aiding reconnaissance for further attacks.
        *   **Exploitation Steps:**
            *   Trigger application errors (e.g., invalid input, resource not found).
            *   Analyze error responses for sensitive information (file paths, stack traces, configuration details).
            *   Use leaked information to plan and execute further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code-Level Vulnerabilities in Application Logic (Facilitated by Echo) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code-level_vulnerabilities_in_application_logic__facilitated_by_echo___critical_node___high-_fd5d8411.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure Use of Echo Features [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Developers misusing Echo framework features in a way that introduces vulnerabilities.
        *   **Examples:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) due to insecure template rendering, Path Traversal due to unsafe file serving using Echo's static file handlers.
        *   **Exploitation Steps:**
            *   Identify areas where the application uses Echo features like template rendering or static file serving.
            *   Test for vulnerabilities by injecting payloads specific to the misused feature (e.g., template injection payloads in template parameters, path traversal payloads in file paths).
            *   Exploit the resulting vulnerabilities (e.g., execute arbitrary code via SSTI, access unauthorized files via Path Traversal).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (Indirectly related to Echo) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__indirectly_related_to_echo___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerable Echo Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in libraries that Echo framework depends on (directly or transitively).
        *   **Examples:** Vulnerabilities in underlying HTTP libraries, JSON parsing libraries, or other dependencies used by Echo.
        *   **Exploitation Steps:**
            *   Identify dependencies of the Echo framework and their versions.
            *   Check for known vulnerabilities in these dependencies using vulnerability databases or scanners.
            *   If vulnerabilities exist and are exploitable in the application's context, craft exploits to leverage them.
    *   **Vulnerable Application Dependencies (Used with Echo) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in libraries that the application uses alongside Echo.
        *   **Examples:** Vulnerabilities in database drivers, ORM libraries, utility libraries, or any other dependencies used in the application.
        *   **Exploitation Steps:**
            *   Identify application dependencies and their versions.
            *   Check for known vulnerabilities in these dependencies.
            *   If vulnerabilities exist and are exploitable in the application's context, craft exploits to leverage them.
