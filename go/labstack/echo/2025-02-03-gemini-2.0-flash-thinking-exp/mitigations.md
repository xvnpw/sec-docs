## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation using Echo's Bind and Validate](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_using_echo's_bind_and_validate.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation using Echo's Bind and Validate.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Leverage Echo's `Bind` Functionality:** Utilize Echo's `c.Bind()` function within route handlers to automatically parse and map request data (from request body, query parameters, or path parameters) into Go structs.
    2.  **Employ Validation Libraries with Struct Tags:** Integrate a Go validation library (like `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10`) and use struct tags within your request structs to define validation rules directly.  Echo's `Bind` seamlessly works with these tags.
    3.  **Check for Binding Errors:** After calling `c.Bind()`, check for returned errors. An error indicates validation failure. Echo's `Bind` will return an error if validation fails based on the struct tags.
    4.  **Return 400 Bad Request on Validation Failure:**  If `c.Bind()` returns an error, return a 400 Bad Request HTTP status code to the client, indicating invalid input. Customize the error response using `echo.NewHTTPError` for better control.
    5.  **Apply Validation to All Input Points in Echo Handlers:** Ensure `c.Bind()` and validation are used for all relevant input sources within your Echo route handlers (path parameters via `c.Param`, query parameters via `c.QueryParam`, headers via `c.Request().Header`, and request bodies via `c.Bind`).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** SQL Injection, Command Injection, LDAP Injection, etc. - By validating input formats and constraints *within Echo handlers*, you prevent attackers from injecting malicious code through input fields processed by your application logic.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):** Input validation in Echo handlers can help reduce reflected XSS by preventing the injection of malicious scripts through input fields that are processed and potentially reflected in responses generated by Echo.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Ensures data processed by Echo handlers conforms to expected formats and constraints, preventing application logic errors and database inconsistencies.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low to Medium Severity):** By rejecting invalid inputs early in Echo handlers, you can prevent the application from processing potentially large or malicious payloads.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** High Risk Reduction. Directly reduces the likelihood of successful injection attacks handled by Echo routes.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Medium Risk Reduction. Reduces reflected XSS vulnerabilities in Echo-served content.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** High Risk Reduction. Improves data quality within Echo application flow.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Low to Medium Risk Reduction. Offers some protection against input-based DoS attempts handled by Echo.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  [Describe if input validation using Echo's `Bind` is currently implemented in your project. Specify which Echo endpoints or data inputs are validated using `c.Bind()` and validation libraries. For example: "Partially implemented. Input validation using `c.Bind()` and `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10` is implemented for user registration and login endpoints handled by Echo. Request body validation is in place for POST requests to `/api/users` and `/api/auth/login` routes defined in Echo."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe areas where input validation using Echo's `Bind` is missing. For example: "Input validation using `c.Bind()` is missing for API endpoints related to product management (`/api/products`, `/api/products/{id}`) defined in Echo. Query parameters are not consistently validated across all Echo endpoints. Path parameter validation within Echo routes is basic and could be improved with regex constraints using custom validation logic."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proper Output Encoding for Template Rendering in Echo](./mitigation_strategies/proper_output_encoding_for_template_rendering_in_echo.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Proper Output Encoding for Template Rendering in Echo.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Echo's Template Rendering:** If using Echo's built-in template rendering (`c.Render()`) or integrating with template engines via Echo, ensure proper output encoding.
    2.  **Automatic Escaping with `html/template` (Default):** Echo's default template engine (`html/template`) provides automatic HTML escaping. Leverage this by using `c.Render()` with `.html` templates.
    3.  **Context-Aware Escaping in Templates:**  When designing templates used with `c.Render()`, understand the context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL) and ensure the template engine's escaping is context-aware.
    4.  **Explicitly Escape User Data in Templates:** When rendering user-provided data within Echo templates, rely on the automatic escaping provided by `html/template` or use explicit escaping functions if needed for specific contexts.
    5.  **Review Echo Templates for Injection Points:** Regularly review templates rendered via `c.Render()` to identify potential XSS injection points and confirm correct escaping is applied within Echo's template rendering process.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts into web pages served by Echo through template vulnerabilities. Output encoding ensures that user-provided data is treated as data, not executable code, when rendered in HTML by Echo.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High Risk Reduction. Effectively mitigates XSS vulnerabilities arising from template rendering within Echo applications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Describe if output encoding is currently implemented in Echo template rendering. Specify if `c.Render()` is used with `.html` templates and if auto-escaping is relied upon. For example: "Implemented. Using Echo's `c.Render()` with `.html` templates, leveraging the default auto-escaping of `html/template`. Templates are located in the `templates/` directory and rendered by Echo."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe areas where output encoding in Echo templates might be missing or needs review. For example: "Need to review templates in the admin panel section rendered by Echo to ensure consistent escaping. Check for any custom template functions used within Echo templates that might bypass auto-escaping and assess the risk."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Error Handling Middleware in Echo](./mitigation_strategies/custom_error_handling_middleware_in_echo.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Custom Error Handling Middleware in Echo.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Echo Middleware Function:** Implement a custom error handling middleware function specifically for your Echo application. This middleware will be registered using `e.Use()`.
    2.  **Intercept Errors in Echo Middleware:** Within the middleware, use `next(c)` to call the next handler in the chain. If `next(c)` returns an error, intercept it. This allows you to handle errors that occur within Echo route handlers or other middleware.
    3.  **Log Detailed Errors (Securely):** In the middleware, log comprehensive error information, including the error, Echo request context (`c`), and stack trace. Use a secure logging mechanism and ensure logs are not publicly accessible.
    4.  **Return Generic Error Responses via Echo Context:** Use `c.JSON()` or `c.String()` within the middleware to return generic, user-friendly error responses to clients via Echo's context. Avoid exposing sensitive details in production responses served by Echo.
    5.  **Use `echo.HTTPError` for Controlled Errors in Echo Handlers:** In your Echo route handlers, use `echo.NewHTTPError()` to create controlled errors with specific HTTP status codes and messages. These errors will be caught by your custom error handling middleware and can be processed accordingly within the Echo error handling flow.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from gaining insights into the Echo application's internals through detailed error messages served by Echo.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration (Low Severity):** Reduces the risk of accidentally exposing sensitive information in error responses generated by Echo.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium Risk Reduction. Significantly reduces information leakage through Echo's error responses.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration:** Low Risk Reduction. Improves secure configuration of error handling within the Echo application.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Describe if custom error handling middleware is implemented in your Echo application. Specify where the middleware is defined, how it's registered with `e.Use()`, and how errors are logged within the Echo middleware. For example: "Implemented. Custom error handling middleware is defined in `middleware/error_handler.go` and registered globally using `e.Use()` in `main.go`. Errors are logged using `logrus` to a dedicated log file from within the Echo middleware."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe any areas where error handling in your Echo application might be insufficient or needs improvement. For example: "Need to review error responses for specific API endpoints served by Echo to ensure no sensitive data is leaked through the custom middleware. Consider implementing different logging levels for development and production environments within the Echo error handler middleware."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Headers Middleware in Echo](./mitigation_strategies/security_headers_middleware_in_echo.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Security Headers Middleware in Echo.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Echo Security Headers Middleware:** Select an Echo middleware library or implement a custom middleware to set security-related HTTP headers in Echo responses. Libraries like `github.com/labstack/echo/middleware` can be used or you can create a custom middleware function and register it with `e.Use()`.
    2.  **Set Headers in Echo Middleware:** In the middleware function, use `c.Response().Header().Set()` to set the following security headers for all responses served by Echo:
        *   `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
        *   `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`
        *   `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
        *   `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`
        *   `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`
        *   `Referrer-Policy`
        *   `Permissions-Policy`
    3.  **Configure CSP for Echo Application:** Carefully configure the `Content-Security-Policy` header to be appropriate for your specific Echo application and the resources it loads.
    4.  **Register Middleware Globally in Echo:** Register the security headers middleware globally using `e.Use()` in your Echo application to apply it to all routes handled by Echo.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity):** CSP and `X-XSS-Protection` headers set by Echo middleware help mitigate XSS attacks in Echo applications.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):** `X-Frame-Options` header set by Echo middleware prevents clickjacking attacks on Echo applications.
    *   **MIME-Sniffing Vulnerabilities (Low Severity):** `X-Content-Type-Options` header set by Echo middleware prevents MIME-sniffing attacks in Echo applications.
    *   **Protocol Downgrade Attacks (Medium Severity):** HSTS header set by Echo middleware enforces HTTPS for Echo applications.
    *   **Information Leakage (Low Severity):** `Referrer-Policy` header set by Echo middleware controls referrer information for requests originating from Echo applications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Medium to High Risk Reduction (CSP is highly effective).
    *   **Clickjacking:** Medium Risk Reduction.
    *   **MIME-Sniffing Vulnerabilities:** Low Risk Reduction.
    *   **Protocol Downgrade Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction.
    *   **Information Leakage:** Low Risk Reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Describe if security headers middleware is implemented in your Echo application. Specify which middleware is used, how it's registered with `e.Use()`, and which headers are currently set by the Echo middleware. For example: "Partially implemented. Using a custom middleware in `middleware/security_headers.go` registered with `e.Use()` in `main.go`. Currently setting `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `HSTS` via Echo middleware."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe which security headers are missing or need improvement in your Echo application's middleware. For example: "CSP is not yet implemented in the Echo security headers middleware and needs to be configured. `Referrer-Policy` and `Permissions-Policy` are not set by the Echo middleware. HSTS configuration in the Echo middleware needs to be reviewed and potentially include `includeSubDomains` and `preload`."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Middleware in Echo](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_middleware_in_echo.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting Middleware in Echo.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Echo Rate Limiting Middleware:** Select an Echo rate limiting middleware library or implement a custom one. Libraries like `github.com/labstack/echo/middleware` or external rate limiting packages can be used and registered with `e.Use()`.
    2.  **Configure Rate Limits for Echo Routes:** Define rate limits specifically for your Echo application's routes based on resource capacity and expected traffic. Configure limits per IP address, user authentication (if applicable in your Echo app), or specific Echo API endpoints.
    3.  **Choose Storage for Echo Middleware:** Select a storage mechanism for rate limit counters used by your Echo middleware. Options include in-memory, Redis, etc.
    4.  **Implement Middleware Logic for Echo:** The middleware registered with `e.Use()` should:
        *   Identify the request origin within the Echo context (`c`).
        *   Check the rate limit for the origin from the storage.
        *   If limit exceeded, return 429 Too Many Requests via `c.JSON()` or `c.String()` using Echo's context.
        *   Otherwise, increment counter and call `next(c)` to proceed with the Echo route handling.
    5.  **Apply to Sensitive Echo Endpoints:** Apply rate limiting middleware to sensitive Echo endpoints like login, registration, password reset, and API routes prone to abuse within your Echo application. Consider global registration via `e.Use()` for broader protection across all Echo routes.
    6.  **Customize 429 Responses in Echo Middleware:** Customize the 429 error response returned by your Echo middleware to provide helpful information to users via `c.JSON()` or `c.String()`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Rate limiting in Echo middleware limits login attempts or other actions handled by Echo routes, making brute-force attacks harder against your Echo application.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Protects against simple DoS attacks targeting Echo routes by limiting request rate from individual IPs or users accessing your Echo application.
    *   **API Abuse (Medium Severity):** Prevents excessive or unauthorized use of Echo API endpoints, protecting resources and preventing service disruption of your Echo application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** High Risk Reduction for Echo application.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Medium Risk Reduction for Echo application.
    *   **API Abuse:** Medium Risk Reduction for Echo application.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Describe if rate limiting middleware is implemented in your Echo application. Specify which middleware is used, how it's registered with `e.Use()`, the storage mechanism, and configured rate limits for Echo routes. For example: "Implemented. Using a custom rate limiting middleware in `middleware/rate_limiter.go` registered with `e.Use()` and in-memory storage. Rate limits are set to 100 requests per minute per IP address for all API endpoints defined in Echo. Middleware is registered globally using `e.Use()`."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe areas where rate limiting in your Echo application might be missing or needs improvement. For example: "Rate limiting in Echo middleware is currently in-memory and might not scale well. Consider switching to Redis for distributed rate limiting for the Echo application. Need to fine-tune rate limits for specific Echo endpoints based on usage patterns. Implement different rate limits for authenticated and unauthenticated users accessing Echo routes."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization Middleware in Echo](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization_middleware_in_echo.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Authentication and Authorization Middleware in Echo.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Authentication Mechanism for Echo:** Select an authentication mechanism (JWT, OAuth 2.0, session-based) suitable for your Echo application.
    2.  **Implement Authentication Middleware for Echo:** Create Echo middleware (registered with `e.Use()`) to handle authentication for requests to your Echo application. This middleware should:
        *   Extract credentials from requests within the Echo context (`c`).
        *   Verify credentials.
        *   On success, set user info in Echo context using `c.Set()`.
        *   On failure, return 401/403 via `c.JSON()` or `c.String()` using Echo's context.
    3.  **Implement Authorization Middleware for Echo:** Create Echo middleware for authorization (registered with `e.Use()`). This middleware should:
        *   Retrieve user info from Echo context (`c.Get()`).
        *   Check user permissions to access resources or actions within the Echo route context.
        *   Enforce RBAC or ABAC in Echo middleware.
        *   On authorization failure, return 403 via `c.JSON()` or `c.String()` using Echo's context.
    4.  **Apply to Protected Echo Routes:** Apply authentication and authorization middleware to all Echo routes requiring protection using `e.Use()` or route-specific middleware registration.
    5.  **Principle of Least Privilege in Echo Authorization:** Design authorization policies for your Echo application based on least privilege.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing protected resources or functionalities within your Echo application.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Reduces data breach risk by ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive data via Echo routes.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Proper authorization in Echo middleware prevents privilege escalation within your Echo application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High Risk Reduction for Echo application.
    *   **Data Breaches:** High Risk Reduction for Echo application.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium Risk Reduction for Echo application.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Describe if authentication and authorization middleware is implemented in your Echo application. Specify mechanisms, models, and middleware registration using `e.Use()`. For example: "Implemented. Using JWT for authentication. Authentication middleware in `middleware/auth.go`, authorization middleware (basic RBAC) in `middleware/rbac.go`, both registered with `e.Use()` and applied to all API endpoints under `/api/` defined in Echo."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe areas where authentication/authorization in your Echo application is missing or needs improvement. For example: "Authorization in Echo middleware is basic RBAC. Need finer-grained authorization for specific resources served by Echo. Consider audit logging for authorization decisions made by Echo middleware. Review password policies and session management practices within the Echo application."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [CORS Middleware Configuration in Echo](./mitigation_strategies/cors_middleware_configuration_in_echo.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** CORS Middleware Configuration in Echo.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Echo CORS Middleware:** Utilize Echo's built-in CORS middleware (`middleware.CORS()`) or a dedicated CORS middleware library and register it with `e.Use()`.
    2.  **Configure `AllowOrigins` in Echo Middleware:** Carefully configure `AllowOrigins` option in Echo's CORS middleware.
        *   **Production Echo App:** Specify exact origins authorized to access your Echo API. Avoid wildcard `"*"` in production Echo configurations.
        *   **Development Echo App:** Permissive config for dev, restrict in production Echo setup.
    3.  **Configure `AllowMethods` and `AllowHeaders` in Echo Middleware:** Restrict `AllowMethods` and `AllowHeaders` in Echo CORS middleware to necessary HTTP methods and headers for legitimate cross-origin requests to your Echo API.
    4.  **Handle Credentials in Echo CORS Middleware (if needed):** Set `AllowCredentials: true` in Echo CORS middleware if needed, ensure `AllowOrigin` is not `"*"` when handling credentials in cross-origin requests to your Echo application.
    5.  **Test Echo CORS Configuration:** Thoroughly test CORS config for your Echo application to ensure correct behavior for cross-origin requests.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity - Indirect Mitigation):** CORS in Echo middleware indirectly helps prevent some CSRF forms by limiting origins that can make requests to your Echo API.
    *   **Unauthorized Access from Untrusted Origins (Medium Severity):** Prevents malicious websites from making unauthorized requests to your Echo API from browsers, controlled by Echo's CORS middleware.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Low to Medium Risk Reduction (indirect).
    *   **Unauthorized Access from Untrusted Origins:** Medium Risk Reduction for Echo application.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Describe if CORS middleware is implemented in your Echo application and its configuration. Specify allowed origins, methods, and headers in Echo's CORS middleware setup. For example: "Implemented. Using Echo's built-in CORS middleware (`middleware.CORS()`) registered with `e.Use()`. `AllowOrigins` configured for `https://example.com` and `https://staging.example.com` for Echo API access. `AllowMethods` set to `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE`. `AllowHeaders` includes `Content-Type, Authorization` in Echo CORS middleware."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe areas where CORS configuration in your Echo application might be missing or needs improvement. For example: "CORS configuration in Echo middleware needs review and hardening for production. Currently, `AllowOrigins` is too permissive in development Echo setup. Consider environment variables to manage CORS config for different environments of your Echo application."]
