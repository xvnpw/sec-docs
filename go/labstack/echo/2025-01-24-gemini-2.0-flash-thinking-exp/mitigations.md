# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for labstack/echo

## Mitigation Strategy: [Customize Default Error Handling](./mitigation_strategies/customize_default_error_handling.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Create a custom error handler function that conforms to the `echo.HTTPErrorHandler` type. This function will receive an `error` and an `echo.Context` as arguments.
*   Step 2: Within the custom error handler, use environment variables or configuration settings to determine if the application is running in development or production mode.
*   Step 3: In development mode, log detailed error information, including stack traces, using a logging library. This aids in debugging.
*   Step 4: In production mode, construct a generic, user-friendly error response (e.g., "Internal Server Error"). Avoid exposing sensitive details like stack traces, internal paths, or configuration information in the response body. Return an appropriate HTTP status code reflecting the error type (e.g., 500 for server errors, 404 for not found).
*   Step 5: Register this custom error handler with your Echo instance using `e.HTTPErrorHandler = customErrorHandler`. This replaces Echo's default error handling behavior.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Information Disclosure (Sensitive Data Exposure) - Severity: High
*   Path Disclosure - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Information Disclosure (Sensitive Data Exposure): High reduction - Prevents default error handler from leaking sensitive server details.
*   Path Disclosure: Medium reduction - Reduces the risk of revealing server-side file paths through error messages.

**Currently Implemented:** Yes, globally implemented in `main.go` using environment variable to switch between detailed and generic error responses based on environment.

**Missing Implementation:** None, currently applied application-wide.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Middleware Configuration and Usage](./mitigation_strategies/secure_middleware_configuration_and_usage.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: **CORS Middleware (using `middleware.CORSWithConfig`):**  Configure CORS middleware to restrict cross-origin requests. Define `AllowOrigins` explicitly, avoiding wildcard (`*`) in production. Specify `AllowMethods` and `AllowHeaders` to only permit necessary HTTP methods and headers.
*   Step 2: **Rate Limiting Middleware (using `middleware.RateLimiterWithConfig` or custom middleware):** Implement rate limiting to protect against brute-force and DoS attacks. Configure limits based on routes and expected traffic. Use appropriate key generation and storage mechanisms as needed.
*   Step 3: **Authentication/Authorization Middleware (e.g., `middleware.JWTWithConfig` or custom middleware):**  Use middleware to enforce authentication and authorization. For example, use `middleware.JWTWithConfig` for JWT-based authentication. Implement authorization checks within middleware or route handlers to control access based on user roles or permissions.
*   Step 4: **Secure Headers Middleware (using `middleware.SecureWithConfig`):** Utilize `middleware.SecureWithConfig` to set security-related HTTP headers. Customize `SecureConfig` to enable and configure headers like:
    *   `HSTSConfig`: Enable `Strict-Transport-Security` for HTTPS enforcement.
    *   `XContentTypeOptions`: Set `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to prevent MIME-sniffing attacks.
    *   `XFrameOptionsConfig`: Set `X-Frame-Options` to prevent clickjacking.
    *   `XXSSProtectionConfig`: Set `X-XSS-Protection` (though largely deprecated, consider for older browser compatibility if needed).
    *   `CSPConfig`: Configure `Content-Security-Policy` for defense-in-depth against XSS and other attacks.
*   Step 5: Apply middleware using `e.Use()` for global application or `e.Group().Use()` for route groups, or directly as route handlers' middleware arguments for specific routes.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfiguration - Severity: Medium
*   Brute-Force Attacks - Severity: High
*   Denial of Service (DoS) - Severity: High
*   Unauthorized Access - Severity: High
*   Clickjacking - Severity: Medium
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: Medium (Indirectly through CSP)
*   MIME-Sniffing Attacks - Severity: Low
*   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (via HSTS) - Severity: High

**Impact:**
*   CORS Misconfiguration: Medium reduction - Limits vulnerabilities related to cross-origin access.
*   Brute-Force Attacks: Medium reduction - Makes brute-force attempts more difficult.
*   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium reduction - Mitigates some DoS attack vectors.
*   Unauthorized Access: High reduction - Enforces access control policies.
*   Clickjacking: Medium reduction - Prevents clickjacking attacks.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Low reduction - CSP provides an additional layer of XSS defense.
*   MIME-Sniffing Attacks: Low reduction - Prevents MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities.
*   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (via HSTS): High reduction - Enforces HTTPS and protects against MITM attacks.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented using Echo's middleware features.
*   CORS middleware is globally applied with a restrictive configuration in `main.go`.
*   Secure Headers middleware is globally applied in `main.go` with basic configurations.
*   Authentication middleware (JWT) is applied to protected routes within the `api` route group in `routes/api.go`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Rate limiting middleware is not yet implemented. Consider adding globally or to sensitive endpoints.
*   More fine-grained authorization middleware or logic is needed for role-based access control beyond basic authentication.
*   CSP configuration in Secure Headers middleware needs further refinement based on application's specific content sources and security requirements.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization in Route Handlers (using `echo.Context`)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_in_route_handlers__using__echo_context__.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: In each route handler function that uses `echo.Context` (`echo.HandlerFunc`), identify all input sources accessed through the context:
    *   Path parameters: `c.Param()`, `c.ParamNames()`, `c.ParamValues()`
    *   Query parameters: `c.QueryParam()`, `c.QueryParams()`
    *   Request headers: `c.Request().Header`
    *   Request body: `c.Bind()`, `c.Request().Body`
*   Step 2: Implement validation logic for each input obtained from `echo.Context`. Validate data types, formats, ranges, lengths, and allowed values. Leverage libraries like `go-playground/validator/v10` for structured validation, integrating with `c.Bind()` if applicable.
*   Step 3: If validation fails, use `c.JSON()` or `c.String()` to return an appropriate HTTP error response (e.g., 400 Bad Request) with informative error messages to the client, utilizing Echo's response methods.
*   Step 4: Sanitize validated input data *before* using it in operations. When constructing responses using `c.JSON()`, `c.String()`, or `c.HTML()`, ensure proper encoding or sanitization of data to prevent output-related vulnerabilities like XSS. For database interactions, use parameterized queries or ORM features that handle escaping automatically.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   SQL Injection - Severity: High
*   Command Injection - Severity: High
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: High
*   Path Traversal - Severity: Medium (Indirectly if input from `echo.Context` is used to construct file paths)
*   Data Integrity Issues - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   SQL Injection: High reduction - Prevents SQL injection by validating and sanitizing inputs before database queries.
*   Command Injection: High reduction - Prevents command injection by validating and sanitizing inputs used in shell commands.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High reduction - Prevents XSS by validating and sanitizing inputs before rendering in responses.
*   Path Traversal: Medium reduction - Reduces path traversal risks if input from `echo.Context` is used in file paths.
*   Data Integrity Issues: Medium reduction - Improves data quality and application reliability.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
*   Basic validation exists in some route handlers, especially for authentication in `handlers/auth.go`, using `c.Bind()` and manual checks.
*   Parameter binding with `c.Bind()` is used throughout the application.
*   Parameterized queries are used for database interactions in the `database` package.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent and comprehensive input validation is needed across all route handlers using `echo.Context` to access request data.
*   Sanitization is not consistently applied, particularly for user-generated content rendered in responses via `c.HTML()` or similar methods. HTML sanitization is needed.
*   Adoption of a dedicated validation library like `go-playground/validator/v10` with integration into `c.Bind()` would improve validation robustness and maintainability.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Static File Serving (using `echo.Static()`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_static_file_serving__using__echo_static____.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: When serving static files with `echo.Static()`, carefully define the `root` directory argument. Ensure it points *only* to the directory containing public static assets and does not include application code or sensitive data.
*   Step 2: Verify that the `root` directory specified in `echo.Static()` does not inadvertently expose sensitive files or directories.
*   Step 3: While `echo.Static()` generally disables directory listing by default, explicitly confirm this behavior in your deployment environment. If directory listing is enabled by the underlying server or configuration, disable it for the static file directory.
*   Step 4: Enhance security for static file serving by implementing a restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) header using `middleware.Secure()` and `CSPConfig`. This is especially important if static files include user-generated content or resources from external domains.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Directory Traversal - Severity: High
*   Information Disclosure (Exposure of sensitive files) - Severity: High
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: Medium (If static files can be uploaded or modified by users)

**Impact:**
*   Directory Traversal: High reduction - Prevents access to files outside the intended static file directory configured in `echo.Static()`.
*   Information Disclosure (Exposure of sensitive files): High reduction - Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive application files through misconfigured static file serving.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Medium reduction - CSP can mitigate XSS risks associated with static files, especially user-generated content.

**Currently Implemented:** Yes, static file serving is implemented in `main.go` using `e.Static()` to serve files from the `public` directory. Default behavior of `echo.Static()` implicitly disables directory listing.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Explicit verification of directory listing being disabled in the production environment configuration for the static file directory served by `echo.Static()`.
*   CSP headers in `middleware.Secure()` should be configured to be more restrictive for static file serving, particularly if user-uploaded content is involved or if static assets load resources from external origins.
