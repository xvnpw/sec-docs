# Attack Tree Analysis for labstack/echo

Objective: Attacker's Goal: Execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Echo application.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Execute Arbitrary Code on Server *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
└───[AND]─ Exploit Echo Vulnerabilities via HTTP Requests
    ├───[OR]─ Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities
    │   └─── Parameter Injection *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    │       └───[OR]─ Command Injection via Route Parameters *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    ├───[OR]─ Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities
    │   ├─── Middleware Bypass *** CRITICAL NODE *** *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    │   └─── Middleware Injection/Manipulation (less likely in Echo core, more in custom middleware) *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    ├───[OR]─ Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities
    │   └─── Body Parsing Vulnerabilities (less Echo-specific, but relevant if Echo doesn't sanitize) *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    │       └───[OR]─ JSON/XML Injection *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on Server](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_server.md)

* This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker and is considered a high-risk path because successful exploitation of underlying vulnerabilities can lead to this outcome.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Route Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_route_parameters.md)

* Attack Vector: Manipulating route parameters to inject shell commands that are then executed by the server.
    * Likelihood: Possible
    * Impact: Critical
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Middleware Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/middleware_bypass.md)

* Attack Vector: Crafting requests that circumvent security middleware due to flaws in path matching or conditional logic.
    * Likelihood: Possible
    * Impact: Medium to High
    * Effort: Moderate to High
    * Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
    * Detection Difficulty: Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [JSON/XML Injection](./attack_tree_paths/jsonxml_injection.md)

* Attack Vector: Injecting malicious payloads into JSON or XML data within the request body, which are then processed without proper sanitization, potentially leading to code execution or other vulnerabilities.
    * Likelihood: Possible
    * Impact: Medium to High
    * Effort: Low to Moderate
    * Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Injection](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_injection.md)

* This node is critical because successful exploitation can directly lead to high-impact vulnerabilities like Command Injection or Code Injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Middleware Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/middleware_bypass.md)

* This node is critical because successfully bypassing middleware can negate security controls and grant access to sensitive resources or functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Middleware Injection/Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/middleware_injectionmanipulation.md)

* This node is critical due to the potential for significant impact if an attacker can inject or manipulate middleware behavior, potentially gaining control over request processing or introducing malicious logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Body Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/body_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

* This node is critical because vulnerabilities in how the application parses request bodies can lead to various injection attacks, including JSON/XML Injection, with potentially high impact.
