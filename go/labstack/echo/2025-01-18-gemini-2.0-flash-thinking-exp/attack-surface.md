# Attack Surface Analysis for labstack/echo

## Attack Surface: [Path Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/path_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers manipulate path parameters in URLs to access unauthorized resources or trigger unintended application behavior.
    *   **How Echo Contributes:** Echo's routing mechanism relies on defining path parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`). If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate these parameters, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An application has a route `/files/:filename`. An attacker could try `/files/../../etc/passwd` to attempt to access sensitive system files if the `filename` parameter isn't validated.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, potential for command execution if the parameter is used in system calls, or application crashes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation on path parameters to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious characters or sequences.
        *   **Avoid Direct File Access:**  Do not directly use path parameters to access files on the file system. Instead, use an identifier to look up the file in a secure manner.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application has the minimum necessary permissions to access resources.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities via Data Binding](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_via_data_binding.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send unexpected or malicious data in the request body, which gets automatically bound to internal application structures, potentially modifying unintended fields.
    *   **How Echo Contributes:** Echo's data binding features (e.g., `c.Bind(&struct{})`) automatically map request data to Go structs. If the struct contains fields that shouldn't be user-modifiable, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A user registration endpoint binds request data to a `User` struct containing fields like `isAdmin`. An attacker could send a request with `{"username": "evil", "password": "...", "isAdmin": true}` hoping to elevate their privileges if the binding isn't controlled.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized data modification, bypassing access controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Define Specific Binding Structs:** Create separate, smaller structs for binding request data that only contain the fields intended to be user-modifiable.
        *   **Manual Data Mapping:** Instead of direct binding, manually extract and validate data from the request and then populate the internal data structures.
        *   **Use Allow/Deny Lists:** Explicitly define which fields are allowed or denied during the binding process.

## Attack Surface: [Directory Traversal via Static File Serving](./attack_surfaces/directory_traversal_via_static_file_serving.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate URLs to access files outside the intended static file directory.
    *   **How Echo Contributes:** Echo's `Static` and `File` functions serve static content. If the provided path isn't properly sanitized, attackers can use ".." sequences to navigate up the directory structure.
    *   **Example:** The application serves static files from a `/public` directory. An attacker requests `/static/../../../../etc/passwd`, attempting to access the system's password file.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files, potential for configuration or source code disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Absolute Paths:**  Configure static file serving with absolute paths to the intended directory.
        *   **Path Sanitization:** Implement robust path sanitization to remove or block ".." sequences and other potentially malicious characters.
        *   **Restrict File System Permissions:** Ensure the application user has minimal permissions on the file system.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (if using HTML rendering)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti___if_using_html_rendering_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template engines, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **How Echo Contributes:** If the application uses Echo's HTML rendering capabilities and directly embeds user-controlled data into templates without proper escaping or sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to SSTI.
    *   **Example:** A profile page displays a user's custom message. The template uses `{{.Message}}` and the application directly passes user input to the template. An attacker could input `{{exec "rm -rf /"}}` (or equivalent template syntax) to attempt to execute commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Embedding User Input Directly:**  Never directly embed user-controlled data into templates without proper sanitization or escaping.
        *   **Use Safe Templating Practices:** Employ template engines that offer automatic escaping or sandboxing features.
        *   **Contextual Output Encoding:** Encode output based on the context (HTML, URL, JavaScript) to prevent injection.
