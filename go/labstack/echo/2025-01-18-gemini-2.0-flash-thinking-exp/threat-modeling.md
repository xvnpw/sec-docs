# Threat Model Analysis for labstack/echo

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Misconfigured Route Parameters](./threats/path_traversal_via_misconfigured_route_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters, intended to identify specific resources, by injecting path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files or directories outside the intended scope. They might craft a URL like `/files/../../etc/passwd` to read sensitive system files. This directly involves how Echo parses and uses route parameters.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive configuration files, source code, or user data. In severe cases, it could allow for arbitrary file reads or even writes if the application logic interacts with the file system based on the manipulated path.
*   **Affected Echo Component:** `echo.Context.Param()`, `echo.Context.PathParamNames()`, Route matching logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all route parameters.
    *   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths.
    *   Use allow-lists of allowed characters or patterns for file names.
    *   Utilize secure file access methods that restrict access based on predefined paths.
    *   Consider using UUIDs or other non-predictable identifiers for resources instead of relying on file paths directly.

## Threat: [Vulnerable or Malicious Middleware](./threats/vulnerable_or_malicious_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities present in third-party middleware used within the Echo application or leverages intentionally malicious custom middleware to compromise the application. This directly involves Echo's middleware integration and execution pipeline.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the middleware vulnerability, including information disclosure, authentication bypass, remote code execution, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Echo Component:** Middleware registration (`e.Use()`, `e.Group().Use()`), Middleware execution pipeline.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet and audit all third-party middleware before using it.
    *   Keep all middleware dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Implement security reviews for custom middleware code.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in middleware.
    *   Employ the principle of least privilege for middleware, granting only necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Bypassing Middleware](./threats/bypassing_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker finds ways to circumvent the intended execution of middleware, potentially gaining access to protected resources without proper authorization or validation. This can be due to flaws in how Echo handles middleware execution or misconfigured routes within Echo.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.
*   **Affected Echo Component:** Route registration, Middleware execution pipeline.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that all routes intended to be protected are covered by the appropriate middleware.
    *   Avoid creating routes that might inadvertently bypass middleware.
    *   Thoroughly test route configurations and middleware execution to prevent bypasses.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization](./threats/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a malicious serialized object within a request (e.g., in the request body or headers) that, when deserialized by Echo's data binding features, executes arbitrary code on the server. This is a direct consequence of how Echo handles data binding.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
*   **Affected Echo Component:** `echo.Context.Bind()`, `echo.Context.BindUnmarshaler()`, Data binding mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.
    *   If deserialization is necessary, use safe deserialization methods and formats that are less prone to exploitation.
    *   Implement strict input validation on the structure and content of serialized data before deserialization.
    *   Consider using alternative data formats like JSON, which are generally safer for deserialization.

## Threat: [Insufficient Input Validation](./threats/insufficient_input_validation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides unexpected or malicious input through request parameters, headers, or bodies that is not properly validated by the application logic after being bound by Echo. While the application logic is responsible for the validation, Echo's data binding facilitates the initial intake of this potentially malicious data.
*   **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the vulnerability, including data corruption, application errors, cross-site scripting (if output is not sanitized), and other security breaches.
*   **Affected Echo Component:** `echo.Context.Bind()`, `echo.Context.FormValue()`, `echo.Context.QueryParam()`, etc.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation on all data received from the client.
    *   Validate data types, formats, lengths, and ranges.
    *   Use allow-lists to define acceptable input values.
    *   Sanitize input data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
    *   Perform validation after data binding but before using the data in application logic.

## Threat: [Lack of Input Validation on WebSocket Messages](./threats/lack_of_input_validation_on_websocket_messages.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends malicious or unexpected data through WebSocket messages that are not properly validated by the application logic, potentially leading to vulnerabilities similar to those found in traditional HTTP request handling. This directly involves Echo's WebSocket handling capabilities.
*   **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the vulnerability, including application errors, data corruption, or even remote code execution if the message processing logic is flawed.
*   **Affected Echo Component:** WebSocket handling logic, message processing functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation on all data received through WebSocket messages.
    *   Validate the format, type, and content of messages.
    *   Sanitize or escape data before processing or storing it.

## Threat: [Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)](./threats/cross-site_websocket_hijacking__cswsh_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker hosts a malicious website that attempts to establish a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable application on behalf of an authenticated user. If the application doesn't properly protect against cross-origin WebSocket requests, the attacker can send commands as the victim. This directly relates to how Echo handles WebSocket connections and origin validation.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim, data manipulation, potential for account takeover.
*   **Affected Echo Component:** WebSocket handling logic, origin validation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement proper origin validation for WebSocket connections to only allow connections from trusted domains.
    *   Use techniques like synchronizer tokens or nonce values to prevent unauthorized connection establishment.
    *   Ensure that WebSocket authentication mechanisms are robust and tied to the user's session.
    *   Consider using a dedicated WebSocket subprotocol that includes security features.
