# Threat Model Analysis for labstack/echo

## Threat: [Route Hijacking through Ambiguous Definitions](./threats/route_hijacking_through_ambiguous_definitions.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies overlapping or poorly defined route patterns within the Echo application's route configuration. By crafting a specific request, they can force the application to execute a different route handler than intended, potentially accessing unauthorized functionality or bypassing security checks. This directly exploits how Echo's router matches requests to handlers based on the order and specificity of route definitions.

**Impact:** Access to unintended functionalities, bypassing authorization checks, potential data manipulation or information disclosure depending on the hijacked route.

**Affected Component:** Echo's Router (route registration and matching logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Define route patterns with clear and unambiguous distinctions.
*   Organize routes logically, placing more specific routes before more general ones.
*   Thoroughly test route definitions to ensure requests are routed as expected.
*   Avoid using overly broad wildcard patterns if more specific routes can be defined.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass due to Incorrect Configuration](./threats/middleware_bypass_due_to_incorrect_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits flaws in how middleware is configured and applied within the Echo application. This allows them to bypass intended security checks (authentication, authorization, input validation) by crafting requests that avoid the execution of crucial middleware. This directly relates to how Echo's `Use()` function and the `next()` mechanism control the middleware pipeline.

**Impact:** Circumvention of security measures, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Echo's Middleware handling mechanism (`Use()` function, `next()` function within middleware).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design and implement middleware, ensuring correct execution order.
*   Thoroughly test middleware execution flow to confirm all intended middleware is invoked.
*   Ensure the `next()` function is called correctly within each middleware to pass control to the next handler.
*   Avoid conditional middleware application that might be easily bypassed.

## Threat: [Unintended Data Binding Leading to Exploitation](./threats/unintended_data_binding_leading_to_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when bound using Echo's data binding features (`Bind()`, `Param()`, `QueryParam()`), is interpreted in an unintended way. This can lead to type confusion, unexpected application behavior, or even injection vulnerabilities if the bound data is not properly validated afterwards. This directly involves how Echo handles incoming request data and maps it to application structures.

**Impact:** Type confusion, unexpected application behavior, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) or other injection vulnerabilities if bound data is used unsafely.

**Affected Component:** `echo.Context` methods for data binding (`Bind()`, `Param()`, `QueryParam()`, `BindUnmarshaler()`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use explicit data binding and validation. Clearly define the expected data types and formats.
*   Sanitize and validate all data after binding before using it in application logic.
*   Avoid relying solely on Echo's built-in binding without additional validation.
*   Be aware of potential type coercion issues during binding.

## Threat: [Lack of Security Headers Leading to Client-Side Attacks](./threats/lack_of_security_headers_leading_to_client-side_attacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits the absence of security-related HTTP headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`) to launch client-side attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) or clickjacking. While Echo provides the means to set headers, it doesn't enforce them by default, making the application vulnerable if developers don't implement this.

**Impact:** Increased risk of XSS, clickjacking, and other client-side vulnerabilities, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or malicious actions performed on behalf of users.

**Affected Component:** Echo's response header handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement middleware to set appropriate security headers for the application.
*   Carefully configure `Content-Security-Policy` to restrict the sources of allowed content.
*   Enforce HTTPS and set `Strict-Transport-Security` to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   Set `X-Frame-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors` to prevent clickjacking.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to Missing Protection](./threats/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__due_to_missing_protection.md)

**Description:** An attacker tricks a logged-in user into making unintended requests on the application. Echo does not provide built-in CSRF protection, making applications vulnerable if developers don't implement their own mechanisms.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of legitimate users, such as changing passwords, transferring funds, or making purchases.

**Affected Component:** Lack of built-in CSRF protection in Echo's core framework.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement CSRF protection mechanisms, such as synchronizer tokens (using a library or custom implementation).
*   Consider using double-submit cookies as a simpler alternative for some scenarios.
*   Ensure that sensitive actions require a confirmation step or re-authentication.
