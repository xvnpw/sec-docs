*   **Path Traversal via Route Parameters** **(Critical Node)**
    *   Craft malicious URL with ".." sequences in parameters
    *   Echo fails to properly sanitize/validate route parameters

*   Header Injection
    *   Inject malicious headers (e.g., X-Forwarded-For, Content-Type)
    *   Echo doesn't sanitize or validate headers used in application logic
*   **Exploiting Data Binding Vulnerabilities** **(Critical Node)**
    *   **Injection attacks via bound parameters (SQLi, Command Injection)** **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   Send malicious input that is directly used in database queries or system commands
        *   Echo's data binding doesn't inherently prevent injection
    *   Data Type Mismatches leading to errors or unexpected behavior
        *   Send parameters with unexpected data types
        *   Echo's data binding doesn't enforce strict type checking
    *   **Lack of Input Validation** **(Critical Node)**
        *   Send invalid or malicious data through request parameters or body
        *   Echo provides basic binding but relies on application for comprehensive validation

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Built-in Features (less likely to be direct vulnerabilities, more misconfiguration) **(High-Risk Path)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_built-in_features__less_likely_to_be_direct_vulnerabilities__more_misconfiguration___high-ri_9c927511.md)

*   **Static File Serving Vulnerabilities** **(Critical Node)**
    *   **Path Traversal through static file routes** **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   Craft URL with ".." sequences to access files outside the intended directory
        *   Echo's static file serving doesn't properly sanitize file paths
    *   Access Control Issues with Static Files
        *   Access sensitive files not intended for public access
        *   Echo's static file serving configuration is not properly secured

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Security Defaults or Lack of Best Practices **(High-Risk Path)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_security_defaults_or_lack_of_best_practices__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Reliance on Default Configurations** **(Critical Node)**
        *   Use default secret keys or configurations
        *   Echo's default settings are not secure for production environments
    *   Insufficient Security Headers
        *   Lack of security headers (e.g., HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
        *   Echo doesn't enforce or provide easy configuration for essential security headers

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via Route Parameters (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_route_parameters__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a URL where a route parameter, intended to identify a specific resource, contains ".." sequences.
*   **Echo's Role:** If Echo doesn't properly sanitize or validate these route parameters before using them to construct file paths or access resources, the ".." sequences allow the attacker to navigate outside the intended directory and access unauthorized files or resources on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Header Injection:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates HTTP headers in the request.
    *   **Echo's Role:** If the application logic uses header values without proper sanitization or validation, vulnerabilities can arise. For example, injecting a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` header could lead to IP address spoofing if the application relies on this header for security decisions. Similarly, manipulating `Content-Type` could cause the application to misinterpret the request body.
*   **Exploiting Data Binding Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
    *   **Injection attacks via bound parameters (SQLi, Command Injection) (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides malicious input through request parameters or the request body.
        *   **Echo's Role:** If the application uses Echo's data binding features to directly incorporate this user-provided data into database queries (SQL injection) or system commands (command injection) without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries, the attacker's malicious input can be executed by the database or operating system.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends data that is outside the expected range, format, or type, or contains malicious characters.
        *   **Echo's Role:** While Echo provides basic data binding, it relies on the application to implement comprehensive input validation. If the application doesn't validate the data received through Echo's binding mechanisms, it becomes vulnerable to various attacks, including injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and business logic flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Built-in Features (less likely to be direct vulnerabilities, more misconfiguration) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_built-in_features__less_likely_to_be_direct_vulnerabilities__more_misconfiguration___high-ri_8182d701.md)

*   **Static File Serving Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
    *   **Path Traversal through static file routes (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a URL targeting a static file route, using ".." sequences in the file path.
        *   **Echo's Role:** If Echo's static file serving mechanism doesn't properly sanitize the requested file path, the ".." sequences allow the attacker to navigate outside the designated static file directory and access sensitive files on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Security Defaults or Lack of Best Practices (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_security_defaults_or_lack_of_best_practices__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Reliance on Default Configurations (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits well-known default configurations, such as default secret keys or API keys.
        *   **Echo's Role:** If the application uses Echo's default settings for security-sensitive configurations (e.g., session management secrets, JWT signing keys) without changing them to strong, unique values, attackers can easily compromise these mechanisms.
