# Attack Surface Analysis for labstack/echo

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Route Parameters](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_route_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate route parameters to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
*   **How Echo Contributes:** Echo's flexible routing allows capturing path segments as parameters. If these parameters are used directly in file system operations without proper sanitization, it creates an opportunity for path traversal.
*   **Example:**  A route defined as `/files/:filepath` and the application uses `c.Param("filepath")` directly in `os.Open()`. An attacker could send a request like `/files/../../../../etc/passwd` to potentially access sensitive files.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential code execution if accessed files are executable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on route parameters before using them in file system operations.
    *   Use safe file path manipulation functions provided by the operating system or libraries.
    *   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths.
    *   Consider using a whitelist of allowed file paths or patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Middleware](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within custom middleware developed for the Echo application can introduce significant security risks.
*   **How Echo Contributes:** Echo's middleware mechanism allows developers to intercept and process requests. If this custom logic is flawed, it can create attack vectors.
*   **Example:** Custom authentication middleware that relies on insecure token generation or doesn't properly validate tokens.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization flaws, information disclosure, potentially remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middleware.
    *   Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of custom middleware.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in middleware context without proper protection.
    *   Consider using well-vetted and established security middleware libraries where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Static File Serving](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_static_file_serving.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can request files outside the designated static directory when Echo's static file serving is enabled.
*   **How Echo Contributes:** Echo provides a built-in mechanism for serving static files. If not configured correctly, it can be vulnerable to path traversal.
*   **Example:** The static file handler is configured to serve files from `/public`, but an attacker requests `/..%2f..%2fetc/passwd` (URL encoded) to try and access the password file.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential access to sensitive configuration files or application code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the static file serving directory is correctly configured and restricted to the intended location.
    *   Avoid serving sensitive files through the static file handler.
    *   Consider using a dedicated web server or CDN for serving static content, which often provides more robust security features.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (if using Echo's HTML renderers)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__if_using_echo's_html_renderers_.md)

*   **Description:** If user-provided data is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code that is executed on the server.
*   **How Echo Contributes:** If using Echo's built-in HTML rendering capabilities or integrating with template engines, improper handling of user input within templates can lead to SSTI.
*   **Example:** A template uses `{{.UserInput}}` and the `UserInput` is directly taken from a request parameter without sanitization. An attacker could inject template directives to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize user-provided data before embedding it into templates.
    *   Use template engines with auto-escaping enabled by default.
    *   Avoid allowing users to control template content directly.
    *   Consider using logic-less templates where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Proper WebSocket Authentication/Authorization (if using Echo's WebSocket support)](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_proper_websocket_authenticationauthorization__if_using_echo's_websocket_support_.md)

*   **Description:**  WebSocket endpoints are not adequately protected, allowing unauthorized access and manipulation of data streams.
*   **How Echo Contributes:** Echo provides support for WebSockets. If developers don't implement proper authentication and authorization checks for WebSocket connections and messages, it creates a vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates doesn't require any authentication, allowing any client to connect and receive sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, manipulation of application state, potential impersonation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms for WebSocket connections (e.g., using tokens or session cookies).
    *   Implement authorization checks to ensure users only have access to the data and actions they are permitted.
    *   Validate and sanitize all data received through WebSocket messages.
