Based on your instructions, I have reviewed the provided vulnerability report.

The vulnerability "Integer Overflow in `ReadUint64` and related functions" is described in detail, including potential steps to trigger, impact, rank, mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, and a security test case.

However, the analysis and security test case clearly indicate that **this vulnerability is already mitigated**. The code includes overflow checks, and a test case confirms these checks are working as expected.

According to your instructions, I should **exclude vulnerabilities that are already mitigated**.

Therefore, this vulnerability should be excluded from the updated list.

Since this is the only vulnerability provided in the initial list, and it's mitigated, the updated vulnerability list will be empty.
