# Threat Model Analysis for go-gorm/gorm

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Raw Query](./threats/sql_injection_via_raw_query.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries and injects them through the use of GORM's `db.Raw()` method or similar raw SQL execution functions when handling unsanitized user input. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the database, including unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Potential for privilege escalation within the database.
*   **Affected GORM Component:** `github.com/go-gorm/gorm` - `db.Raw()`, `db.Exec()`, potentially custom callbacks using raw SQL.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid using `db.Raw()` or similar raw SQL functions whenever possible.**
    *   **If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, meticulously sanitize and validate all user inputs before embedding them in the query.** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements even within raw SQL.
    *   **Implement strict input validation on the application layer.**

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Unsafe Input in `Where` Clause](./threats/sql_injection_via_unsafe_input_in__where__clause.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user input that is directly used within GORM's `Where` clause without proper sanitization or parameterization. This can lead to the execution of unintended SQL code. For example, providing a malicious string that bypasses intended filtering logic.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Potential for bypassing application logic and security checks.
*   **Affected GORM Component:** `github.com/go-gorm/gorm` - `db.Where()`, `db.First()`, `db.Find()`, and other query builder methods that accept conditions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use parameterized queries with placeholders (`?`) when using `Where` clauses with user-provided data.**  Let GORM handle the proper escaping.
    *   **Avoid directly embedding user input into the query string within `Where` clauses.**
    *   **Implement input validation and sanitization on the application layer before passing data to GORM.**

## Threat: [Migration Vulnerabilities](./threats/migration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious or poorly written database migrations, managed through GORM's migration features, could introduce vulnerabilities or compromise data integrity. An attacker gaining access to the migration process could inject harmful schema changes or data manipulation scripts.
*   **Impact:**  Database schema corruption, data loss, introduction of backdoors or vulnerabilities at the database level.
*   **Affected GORM Component:** `github.com/go-gorm/gorm/migrator`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement a rigorous code review process for all database migrations.**
    *   **Store migration files securely and control access to them.**
    *   **Test migrations thoroughly in non-production environments before applying them to production.**
    *   **Implement a rollback strategy for migrations in case of errors.**
    *   **Restrict access to migration execution in production environments.**
