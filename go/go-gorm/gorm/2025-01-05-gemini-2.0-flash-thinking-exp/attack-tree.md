## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities Introduced by GORM [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_gorm__critical_.md)

*   This represents the overarching goal of exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities specifically arising from the use of GORM. It is critical due to the potential for complete database compromise.

    *   **Leverage Unsafe `Raw` SQL Queries [CRITICAL]:**
        *   This attack vector focuses on the use of `db.Raw()` in GORM, which allows developers to execute raw SQL queries. If user-supplied input is directly incorporated into these queries without proper sanitization, it creates a direct pathway for SQL injection.
            *   **Identify Code Using `db.Raw()` with Unsanitized User Input [CRITICAL]:**
                *   The attacker's first step is to find instances in the codebase where `db.Raw()` is used and where user-controlled data flows directly into the query parameters. This is a critical node because it identifies the vulnerable point.
            *   **Inject Malicious SQL Payloads [CRITICAL]:**
                *   Once a vulnerable `db.Raw()` call is identified, the attacker crafts and injects malicious SQL code through the unsanitized user input. This allows them to manipulate the database, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting data, or even executing arbitrary commands on the database server.

    *   **Abuse Find/Where Conditions with Unsanitized Input [CRITICAL]:**
        *   This attack vector targets the `Where` and `Find` methods in GORM. While these methods offer some protection against SQL injection, developers can still introduce vulnerabilities by directly embedding unsanitized user input into the conditions.
            *   **Identify Code Using `Where` or `Find` with Direct User Input [CRITICAL]:**
                *   The attacker searches for code where the arguments to `Where` or `Find` are constructed by directly concatenating or formatting user input. This node is critical as it pinpoints the vulnerable usage pattern.
            *   **Inject Malicious Conditions [CRITICAL]:**
                *   Exploiting the lack of sanitization, the attacker injects malicious SQL conditions that can bypass authentication checks, extract sensitive data, or manipulate the query logic to their advantage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Configurations or Practices Related to GORM [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_configurations_or_practices_related_to_gorm__critical_.md)

*   This represents the broader category of attacks that exploit insecure configurations or poor development practices related to GORM. It is critical because these issues can often provide direct and significant access to the application's data and resources.

    *   **Use Insecure Database Credentials [CRITICAL]:**
        *   This attack vector focuses on the compromise of database credentials used by the GORM application. If these credentials are weak, hardcoded, or poorly managed, attackers can gain direct access to the database, bypassing the application logic entirely.
            *   **Identify Hardcoded or Poorly Managed Database Credentials [CRITICAL]:**
                *   The attacker attempts to find database credentials within the application's codebase, configuration files, or environment variables. This is a critical step as it provides the keys to the database.
            *   **Gain Unauthorized Database Access [CRITICAL]:**
                *   With compromised credentials, the attacker can directly connect to the database and perform any actions allowed by the compromised user, potentially leading to complete data breach or manipulation.

    *   **Fail to Sanitize Input Before Using in GORM Operations [CRITICAL]:**
        *   This attack vector highlights the fundamental security flaw of not properly sanitizing user input before using it in any GORM operations. This can lead to various vulnerabilities beyond just SQL injection.
            *   **Identify Code Paths Where User Input Directly Influences GORM Queries [CRITICAL]:**
                *   The attacker looks for any instances where user-provided data is used to construct or influence GORM queries without proper validation or sanitization. This is a critical step in identifying potential attack surfaces.
            *   **Inject Malicious Data to Cause Errors or Unexpected Behavior [CRITICAL]:**
                *   By injecting malicious data, attackers can cause various issues, including SQL injection (as covered above), application errors that reveal sensitive information, or unexpected behavior in the application's data processing logic.
