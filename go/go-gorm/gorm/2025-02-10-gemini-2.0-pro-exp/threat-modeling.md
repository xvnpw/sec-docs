# Threat Model Analysis for go-gorm/gorm

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Raw SQL](./threats/sql_injection_via_raw_sql.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when incorporated into a raw SQL query using GORM's `Raw`, `Exec`, or improperly used `Where` clauses with string concatenation, alters the intended query logic. The attacker might try to read data they shouldn't have access to (e.g., other users' passwords), modify data (e.g., change their role to administrator), or even delete data (e.g., drop tables).
*   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality violation), data modification (integrity violation), data deletion (availability violation), potential complete system compromise.
*   **GORM Component Affected:** `Raw` function, `Exec` function, `Where` clause (when used with string concatenation and user input), any function accepting raw SQL strings.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly avoid** using `Raw` or `Exec` with any user-supplied data.
    *   **Always** use parameterized queries (GORM's default behavior with struct-based queries and placeholders).
    *   If string concatenation is unavoidable (strongly discouraged), use GORM's built-in escaping functions (if available) or a dedicated, well-vetted SQL escaping library. *Never* directly concatenate user input.
    *   Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization *before* data reaches GORM.
    *   Regularly review code for any instances of raw SQL usage.
    *   Use static analysis tools to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment (Unintended Data Modification)](./threats/mass_assignment__unintended_data_modification_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a crafted request (e.g., a modified HTTP POST request) that includes extra fields not intended to be updated. If GORM's `Create`, `Save`, or `Update` methods are used without specifying allowed fields, the attacker can overwrite protected fields (e.g., setting `isAdmin` to `true`, changing a password hash).
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification (integrity violation), privilege escalation.
*   **GORM Component Affected:** `Create` function, `Save` function, `Update` function, `Updates` function.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use GORM's `Select` or `Omit` methods to explicitly specify which fields are allowed to be created or updated.
    *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to define the structure of allowed data for specific operations.
    *   Implement authorization checks *before* calling GORM methods.

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Large Result Sets)](./threats/uncontrolled_resource_consumption__large_result_sets_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request that triggers a GORM query without limits or pagination. This can cause GORM to retrieve a massive number of records, consuming excessive memory and processing power on both the application server and the database server.
*   **Impact:** Performance degradation, denial of service (availability violation), potential application crash.
*   **GORM Component Affected:** Any query function without `Limit` and `Offset` (e.g., `Find`, `First`, `Last`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use pagination (GORM's `Limit` and `Offset` methods) for potentially large result sets.
    *   Implement limits on the maximum number of records retrievable in a single query.
    *   Consider streaming for very large datasets.

## Threat: [Exploitation of GORM or Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_gorm_or_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in GORM itself or one of its dependencies (e.g., the database driver). The attacker might use a publicly disclosed exploit or a zero-day vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability; could range from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
*   **GORM Component Affected:** Potentially any part of GORM or its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (potentially Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update GORM and all dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools.
    *   Monitor security advisories.

## Threat: [Ignoring GORM Updates and Security Patches](./threats/ignoring_gorm_updates_and_security_patches.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an outdated version of GORM that has already been patched in a newer release. The attacker leverages publicly available information about the vulnerability to compromise the application.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially ranging from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
    * **GORM Component Affected:** Potentially any part of GORM.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (potentially Critical)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Establish a process for regularly checking for and applying GORM updates.
        * Subscribe to GORM's release announcements or security mailing lists.
        * Use automated dependency management tools.
