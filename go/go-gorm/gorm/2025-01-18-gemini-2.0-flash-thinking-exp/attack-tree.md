## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using GORM [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_gorm__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Achieving this means successfully exploiting one or more vulnerabilities within the application's use of GORM to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or disrupt the application's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries executed by GORM. This can be achieved through various GORM methods that interact with the database if user input is not properly sanitized or parameterized. Successful exploitation can lead to data breaches, data modification, or even complete database takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject SQL via `Where` Clause [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_sql_via__where__clause__high_risk_path_.md)

**Unsanitized User Input in `Where` Conditions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** When user-provided data is directly incorporated into the `Where` clause of a GORM query without proper sanitization or the use of parameterized queries, attackers can manipulate the SQL query. This allows them to bypass intended filtering logic, access unauthorized data, or even execute arbitrary SQL commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject SQL via `Raw` SQL Queries [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_sql_via__raw__sql_queries__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The `db.Raw()` method in GORM allows developers to execute raw SQL queries. If user input is directly concatenated into these raw SQL strings without proper sanitization or parameterization, it creates a direct and easily exploitable SQL injection vulnerability. This is a particularly high-risk path due to the direct control over the executed SQL.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Access Control Issues [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_access_control_issues__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the application manages data access permissions, potentially bypassing intended restrictions and gaining access to or modifying data they are not authorized to interact with.

## Attack Tree Path: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** When the application directly binds user-provided input (e.g., from HTTP requests) to GORM model structs without explicitly defining which fields are allowed to be updated, attackers can manipulate the input to modify sensitive fields that were not intended to be exposed for modification. This can lead to privilege escalation, data corruption, or unauthorized changes to application state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Configuration or Setup](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_configuration_or_setup.md)

**Attack Vector:** This involves exploiting vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations or insecure setup of the application's interaction with the database through GORM.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Database Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_database_credentials__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If database credentials (username, password, connection string) are hardcoded within the application's source code, stored in easily accessible configuration files, or otherwise poorly managed, attackers who gain access to these credentials can directly access and control the database. This is a critical vulnerability as it bypasses all application-level security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default or Weak Database User Permissions [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/default_or_weak_database_user_permissions__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the database user account used by GORM has excessive privileges beyond what is strictly necessary for the application's functionality, an attacker who manages to exploit any vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection) can leverage these elevated privileges to perform more damaging actions within the database. This amplifies the impact of other vulnerabilities.
