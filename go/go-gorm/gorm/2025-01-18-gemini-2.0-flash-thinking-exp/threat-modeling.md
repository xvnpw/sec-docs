# Threat Model Analysis for go-gorm/gorm

## Threat: [SQL Injection via `Raw` SQL or Dynamic Query Construction](./threats/sql_injection_via__raw__sql_or_dynamic_query_construction.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries by manipulating user-supplied input that is directly incorporated into `db.Raw()` calls or used to dynamically build GORM conditions without proper sanitization. This could involve adding additional SQL statements, modifying existing logic, or extracting sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification or deletion, potential execution of arbitrary code on the database server (depending on database permissions).
*   **Affected GORM Component:** `db.Raw()`, `Where()`, `Or()`, `Not()`, `Having()` when used with string arguments directly incorporating user input.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Prioritize Parameterized Queries:  Always use GORM's built-in methods with parameterized queries (e.g., using `?` placeholders and passing arguments separately).
    *   Avoid String Interpolation:  Never directly embed user input into SQL strings.
    *   Input Sanitization: Sanitize and validate user input before using it in any database interaction, even with GORM's methods.
    *   Code Review: Regularly review code that constructs dynamic queries or uses `db.Raw()`.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate HTTP request parameters or other input sources to modify database columns that were not intended to be updated. This is possible if GORM models are directly populated with user-provided data without explicitly defining allowed fields.
*   **Impact:**  Data corruption, unauthorized modification of user profiles or settings, privilege escalation if sensitive fields like roles can be modified.
*   **Affected GORM Component:** `Create()`, `Updates()`, `AssignAttrs()`, `FirstOrCreate()`, `FirstOrInit()` when directly binding request data to models.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use `Select`:** Explicitly specify which fields can be updated using the `Select` method.
    *   Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):**  Create separate structs (DTOs) to handle incoming data and map only the allowed fields to the GORM model.
    *   `Omit` for Exclusion:** Use the `Omit` method to explicitly exclude specific fields from being updated.
    *   Whitelist Approach:**  Favor a whitelist approach where you explicitly define allowed fields rather than a blacklist.

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Concurrent Updates without Transactions](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_concurrent_updates_without_transactions.md)

*   **Description:** If multiple users or processes attempt to update the same data concurrently without proper transaction management, it can lead to data corruption or inconsistencies. This occurs when updates are not atomic and one update overwrites another's changes.
*   **Impact:**  Loss of data integrity, inconsistent application state, incorrect business logic execution.
*   **Affected GORM Component:** `Update()`, `Updates()`, `Save()` when used in concurrent scenarios without transactions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Transactions:**  Utilize GORM's transaction features (`db.Transaction()`) to ensure atomicity and consistency of database operations involving multiple updates.
    *   Optimistic Locking:** Implement optimistic locking using a version column to detect and prevent concurrent modifications.
    *   Pessimistic Locking:** In critical scenarios, use pessimistic locking to acquire exclusive locks on data before updating it.

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials in Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials_in_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to the application's codebase or configuration files could potentially find database credentials used by GORM stored in plain text or easily reversible formats.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the database, unauthorized access to all data, potential for data deletion or modification.
*   **Affected GORM Component:** Database connection configuration (DSN).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Environment Variables:** Store database credentials securely using environment variables.
    *   Secrets Management:** Utilize dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    *   Avoid Hardcoding:** Never hardcode credentials directly in the application code or configuration files.
    *   Secure Configuration Storage:** Ensure configuration files are stored securely with appropriate access controls.
