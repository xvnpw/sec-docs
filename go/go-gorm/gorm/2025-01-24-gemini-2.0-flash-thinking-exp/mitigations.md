# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for go-gorm/gorm

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries (GORM Default Enforcement)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries__gorm_default_enforcement_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterized Queries (GORM Default Enforcement)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strictly adhere to GORM's query builder methods:** Developers must consistently use GORM's built-in query builder methods like `db.Where()`, `db.Find()`, `db.Updates()`, etc. for all database interactions. These methods inherently utilize parameterized queries.
    2.  **Avoid `db.Raw()` and `db.Exec()` with direct string concatenation:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of `db.Raw()` and `db.Exec()` where user input is directly embedded into SQL strings. If raw SQL is unavoidable, use the `?` placeholder syntax with arguments.
    3.  **Code review focus on query construction:** Code reviews should specifically scrutinize database interaction code to ensure parameterized queries are used and raw SQL with string concatenation is absent.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code through user inputs, exploiting vulnerabilities arising from improper query construction within GORM usage.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Risk Reduction - Enforcing parameterized queries through GORM's features is the primary defense against SQL injection when using this ORM.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Largely implemented in the `internal/database` package where GORM is primarily used. Most data access functions leverage GORM's query builder.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Legacy modules, particularly in `legacy/reporting`, might still contain instances of `db.Raw()` or `db.Exec()` used insecurely. A targeted audit is needed to identify and refactor these specific GORM usages.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Updates with GORM's `Select` and `Omit`](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_updates_with_gorm's__select__and__omit_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Controlled Updates with GORM's `Select` and `Omit`
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Mandatory use of `Select` or `Omit` in GORM update operations:**  For all update operations using `db.Model().Updates()` or `db.Model().Update()`, developers must explicitly use `.Select("field1", "field2", ...)` to define allowed updatable fields or `.Omit("field3", "field4", ...)` to exclude fields.
    2.  **DTOs for update requests as GORM input:**  Employ Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to structure update request data. Map incoming requests to DTOs and then use these DTOs as input for GORM's `Updates` or `Update` methods in conjunction with `Select` or `Omit`.
    3.  **Enforce `Select`/`Omit` in update code reviews:** Code reviews must specifically verify the presence and correct usage of `Select` or `Omit` in all GORM update operations to prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerability (Medium Severity) - Prevents attackers from manipulating request parameters to modify database fields that should not be directly updatable, a risk directly related to how GORM handles updates.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerability: High Risk Reduction -  Using GORM's `Select` and `Omit` features effectively eliminates the mass assignment risk within the GORM context.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in newer API endpoints in `internal/api/v2` where GORM is used for data persistence. DTOs are used, and `Select` is applied in update operations within these endpoints.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Older API endpoints in `internal/api/v1` and admin panel functionalities in `web/admin` that utilize GORM for updates may lack consistent `Select` or `Omit` usage. These GORM update operations need to be audited and retrofitted with `Select` or `Omit`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Minimization with GORM's `Select` in Queries](./mitigation_strategies/data_minimization_with_gorm's__select__in_queries.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Data Minimization with GORM's `Select` in Queries
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Default to using `Select` in GORM queries:**  Establish a coding standard that mandates the use of `.Select("field1", "field2", ...)` in GORM's `Find`, `First`, and similar query methods to retrieve only necessary columns.
    2.  **Avoid implicit column selection in GORM:** Discourage or prohibit using `Find(&results)` or `First(&result)` without `Select` when only a subset of columns is required. Emphasize explicit column selection using GORM's `Select`.
    3.  **Code review focus on GORM query efficiency:** Code reviews should assess GORM queries for unnecessary data retrieval and ensure `Select` is used to minimize the data fetched from the database by GORM.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity) - Reduces the potential exposure of sensitive data if unauthorized access occurs, by limiting the data retrieved by GORM queries.
    *   Performance Issues (Low Severity) - Improves query performance by reducing data transfer, directly related to efficient GORM query construction.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium Risk Reduction - Limits the scope of data potentially exposed through GORM queries in case of a security incident.
    *   Performance Issues: Medium Risk Reduction - Optimizes GORM queries for better application performance.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in performance-critical API endpoints within `internal/api/public` where GORM is used for data retrieval.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Internal dashboards, admin panels in `web/admin`, and background tasks in `internal/workers` that use GORM might not consistently employ `Select`. GORM queries in these areas should be reviewed and optimized with `Select`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure GORM Logging Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_gorm_logging_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure GORM Logging Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set GORM logging level to `logger.Error` or `logger.Silent` in production:** Configure GORM's logger to minimize detailed SQL query logging in production environments.
    2.  **Disable GORM parameter logging in production:** Ensure GORM's logging configuration prevents the output of SQL queries with parameter values in production logs to avoid potential data exposure.
    3.  **Centralized and secure GORM log storage:** If GORM logging is enabled for debugging, ensure logs are stored securely with restricted access and are not publicly accessible.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity) - Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data that might be present in SQL queries logged by GORM.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of data leakage through GORM logs.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   GORM logging level is set to `logger.Error` in production configurations (`config/production.yaml`).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   While the logging level is configured, a more explicit configuration to *specifically* disable parameter logging within GORM (if such option exists or through custom logger implementation) could be explored for enhanced security. Review GORM's logger customization options for finer-grained control.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Eager Loading and Query Optimization (GORM Features)](./mitigation_strategies/eager_loading_and_query_optimization__gorm_features_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Eager Loading and Query Optimization (GORM Features)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Proactive use of GORM's `Preload` and `Joins`:** Developers should actively utilize GORM's `Preload` and `Joins` features to prevent N+1 query problems when fetching related data through GORM associations.
    2.  **Database indexing for GORM queries:** Ensure database indexes are created for columns frequently used in `WHERE` clauses and `JOIN` conditions within GORM queries to optimize performance.
    3.  **Performance monitoring of GORM-generated queries:** Implement monitoring to track the performance of database queries generated by GORM, identify slow queries, and optimize them using GORM's features or by refactoring query logic.
    4.  **Code review focus on GORM query efficiency:** Code reviews should assess GORM queries for potential performance bottlenecks and ensure efficient use of `Preload`, `Joins`, and appropriate indexing.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity) - Prevents performance degradation and potential DoS attacks stemming from inefficient database queries generated by GORM, especially N+1 query issues.
    *   Performance Issues (Medium Severity) - Improves application responsiveness and reduces resource consumption by optimizing GORM query patterns.
*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the vulnerability to performance-based DoS attacks related to inefficient GORM queries.
    *   Performance Issues: High Risk Reduction - Significantly improves application performance by optimizing GORM data access patterns.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `Preload` is used in some areas, particularly in API endpoints requiring related data. Basic database indexes are in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent and widespread use of `Preload` and `Joins` across all GORM data access patterns is needed. Database index coverage needs to be expanded based on GORM query analysis. Systematic performance monitoring of GORM queries and a process for query optimization are lacking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular GORM Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_gorm_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular GORM Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a schedule for GORM version checks:** Regularly check for new releases of the `go-gorm/gorm` library.
    2.  **Prioritize GORM updates:** Treat GORM updates, especially security-related updates, as high priority and apply them promptly.
    3.  **Integrate dependency scanning for GORM:** Utilize dependency scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect known vulnerabilities specifically in the `go-gorm/gorm` library and its direct dependencies.
    4.  **Test GORM updates thoroughly:** Before deploying GORM updates to production, conduct thorough testing to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly known security vulnerabilities present in outdated versions of the `go-gorm/gorm` library.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: High Risk Reduction - Keeping GORM updated is crucial for mitigating risks associated with known vulnerabilities in the ORM itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   GORM updates are performed occasionally, but not on a fixed schedule.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal schedule for GORM version checks and updates is missing. Automated dependency scanning specifically targeting GORM and its dependencies is not yet integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. A proactive and systematic approach to GORM updates is needed.
