## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Swagger Specification Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_swagger_specification_handling.md)

*   Attack Vector: Supply Malicious Swagger Specification [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   Description: An attacker crafts a seemingly valid but intentionally malicious Swagger/OpenAPI specification and provides it to the application. This could be through replacing the existing specification file, providing it via an API endpoint that accepts specification updates, or through other means depending on the application's design.
    *   Potential Impact: This is a critical entry point leading to various severe attacks.
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Implement strict validation of the Swagger specification using a well-maintained and up-to-date validator library.
        *   Enforce resource limits on the size and complexity of the specification.
        *   Sanitize or escape data from the specification used in further processing.
        *   If possible, disable fetching remote references within the specification.

    *   High-Risk Path: Trigger Denial of Service (DoS)
        *   Attack Vector: Exploit Parser Vulnerabilities (e.g., deeply nested objects, excessive schema complexity)
            *   Description: The attacker crafts a specification with constructs that exploit vulnerabilities in Go-Swagger's parsing logic. This could involve deeply nested objects, excessively long arrays, or overly complex schema definitions, leading to excessive resource consumption and denial of service.
            *   Potential Impact: Application becomes unavailable due to resource exhaustion.
            *   Mitigation Strategies:
                *   Implement resource limits during specification parsing.
                *   Use a robust and well-tested Swagger/OpenAPI parser library.
                *   Consider using a dedicated service for validating and sanitizing specifications before they reach the application.

    *   High-Risk Path: Trigger Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
        *   Attack Vector: Inject malicious URLs within specification (e.g., in `format: uri` fields) that are fetched by the server during processing.
            *   Description: The attacker injects malicious URLs into fields within the Swagger specification that Go-Swagger might attempt to resolve or fetch during its processing. This could allow the attacker to make requests to internal resources or external systems from the application's server.
            *   Potential Impact: Access to internal resources, potential data exfiltration, or launching attacks on other systems.
            *   Mitigation Strategies:
                *   Avoid fetching remote resources during specification processing if possible.
                *   If remote fetching is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of URLs.
                *   Use a whitelist of allowed domains or protocols for remote resources.

    *   High-Risk Path: Exploit Code Generation Flaws
        *   Attack Vector: Inject malicious code snippets or patterns that lead to vulnerabilities in generated server-side or client-side code.
            *   Description: The attacker crafts the specification in a way that, when processed by Go-Swagger's code generation, results in vulnerable code. This could involve injecting patterns that lead to SQL injection, XSS, or other code-level vulnerabilities in the generated output.
            *   Potential Impact: Remote code execution, cross-site scripting, or other vulnerabilities depending on the injected code.
            *   Mitigation Strategies:
                *   Use secure code generation templates.
                *   Implement static analysis security testing (SAST) on the generated code.
                *   Ensure proper input sanitization and output encoding in the generated code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Generated Code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_generated_code.md)

*   Attack Vector: Leverage Insecure Code Generation Practices [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   Description: Go-Swagger's code generation process, or custom templates used with it, might produce code that is inherently vulnerable due to lack of proper input handling, output encoding, or other security considerations.
    *   Potential Impact: Introduction of various web application vulnerabilities into the application.
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Use secure code generation templates provided by Go-Swagger or create custom templates following security best practices.
        *   Regularly review and update the Go-Swagger version to benefit from security fixes.
        *   Implement static analysis security testing (SAST) on the generated code.

    *   High-Risk Path: SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
        *   Attack Vector: If the specification defines database interactions and generated code doesn't properly sanitize inputs.
            *   Description: If the Swagger specification describes API endpoints that interact with a database, and the generated code doesn't properly sanitize user inputs before using them in database queries, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate or extract data.
            *   Potential Impact: Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access.
            *   Mitigation Strategies:
                *   Ensure generated code uses parameterized queries or prepared statements.
                *   Implement input validation on the server-side before database interaction.
                *   Follow the principle of least privilege for database access.

    *   High-Risk Path: Insecure Deserialization
        *   Attack Vector: If generated code handles deserialization of data based on the specification without proper safeguards.
            *   Description: If the Swagger specification defines data structures that are deserialized by the generated code, and the deserialization process is not secure, an attacker can provide malicious serialized data to execute arbitrary code on the server.
            *   Potential Impact: Remote code execution.
            *   Mitigation Strategies:
                *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
                *   Use safe deserialization methods and libraries.
                *   Implement integrity checks on serialized data.
                *   Restrict the classes that can be deserialized.
