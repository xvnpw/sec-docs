# Threat Model Analysis for go-swagger/go-swagger

## Threat: [Malicious OpenAPI Specification Parsing](./threats/malicious_openapi_specification_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a crafted OpenAPI specification (YAML or JSON) designed to exploit vulnerabilities within the `go-swagger` parser. This could involve deeply nested structures, excessively large values, or malformed syntax that causes the parser to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) or crash.

**Impact:** Denial-of-Service (DoS) by crashing the application during startup or configuration. Potential for remote code execution if a critical parser vulnerability is exploited.

**Affected Component:** `go-swagger`'s specification loading and parsing module (likely within the `loads` or `spec` packages).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet and sanitize any externally sourced OpenAPI specifications before using them with `go-swagger`.
*   Implement resource limits (e.g., memory limits, timeouts) during the specification loading process.
*   Keep `go-swagger` updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in its parsing logic.

## Threat: [Generation of Insecure Request Handling Code](./threats/generation_of_insecure_request_handling_code.md)

**Description:** `go-swagger` might generate request handlers that are vulnerable to common web application attacks due to insufficient input validation or improper handling of data types as defined in the OpenAPI specification. This could lead to vulnerabilities like SQL injection (if database interactions are involved in the generated handlers), command injection, or path traversal if input is used directly in system calls.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to resources, remote code execution on the server.

**Affected Component:** `go-swagger`'s code generation module, specifically the parts responsible for generating server-side handlers and parameter binding logic (likely within the `generator` package).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review the generated code, especially the request handlers, for potential security flaws.
*   Implement robust input validation within the generated handlers, even if `go-swagger` provides some basic validation.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
*   Avoid directly using user-supplied input in system commands or file paths.
*   Employ secure coding practices in the business logic implemented within or called by the generated handlers.
