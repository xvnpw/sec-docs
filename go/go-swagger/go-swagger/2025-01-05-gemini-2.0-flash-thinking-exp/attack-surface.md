# Attack Surface Analysis for go-swagger/go-swagger

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `go-swagger` Parser](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__go-swagger__parser.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs or flaws exist within the `go-swagger` library's parsing logic for OpenAPI specifications.
    *   **How go-swagger Contributes:** `go-swagger` is directly responsible for parsing the specification. Vulnerabilities here can be triggered by specific, potentially valid but unexpected, constructs within the specification.
    *   **Example:** A bug in the YAML parsing library used by `go-swagger` could be exploited with a specially crafted YAML structure within the OpenAPI specification, leading to a crash or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application crashes, potential for remote code execution if a critical vulnerability exists in the parser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `go-swagger` to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to `go-swagger` and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Code Generation](./attack_surfaces/insecure_code_generation.md)

*   **Description:** The code generated by `go-swagger` contains security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How go-swagger Contributes:** `go-swagger` generates server stubs, client libraries, and data models. Flaws in the generation logic can lead to insecure code patterns.
    *   **Example:**  `go-swagger` might generate server-side validation code that is incomplete or bypassable, allowing invalid data to reach the application's core logic.
    *   **Impact:**  Vulnerabilities like injection flaws (if input sanitization is missing), business logic errors due to invalid data, and other application-specific security issues.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review the generated code for potential security flaws.
        *   Supplement the generated validation with additional layers of validation in your application logic.
        *   Configure `go-swagger` with appropriate security settings and options if available.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Swagger UI](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_swagger_ui.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the Swagger UI itself allow for the injection of malicious scripts.
    *   **How go-swagger Contributes:** `go-swagger` integrates and serves the Swagger UI. If the bundled version of Swagger UI has XSS vulnerabilities, the application is exposed.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into a description field in the OpenAPI specification. When a user views this specification in the Swagger UI, the script is executed in their browser.
    *   **Impact:**  Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the Swagger UI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the version of Swagger UI bundled with `go-swagger` is up-to-date and patched against known XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate the impact of potential XSS attacks in the Swagger UI.
