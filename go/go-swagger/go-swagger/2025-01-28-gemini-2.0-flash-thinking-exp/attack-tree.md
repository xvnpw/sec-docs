## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit OpenAPI Specification Processing (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_openapi_specification_processing__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities during the parsing and processing of the OpenAPI specification by `go-swagger`. This path targets the core input of the framework.

    *   **1.1.1.1. Denial of Service via Complex/Recursive Structures (Critical Node)**
        *   **Insight:** Go-swagger relies on YAML/JSON parsing libraries. Providing excessively complex or deeply nested specifications can exhaust server resources (CPU, memory), leading to a Denial of Service.
        *   **Action:** Implement input size limits for specification files. Regularly update YAML/JSON parsing libraries used by go-swagger. Use security scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

    *   **1.1.1.2. Code Execution via Deserialization (Critical Node)**
        *   **Insight:** While less common in Go, if `go-swagger` or its dependencies use external libraries for specific data types, vulnerabilities related to unsafe deserialization might exist. Exploiting these could lead to arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Action:** Audit dependencies for known deserialization vulnerabilities. Enforce strict input validation on specification content.

    *   **1.2. Specification Injection (High-Risk Path if Spec Source is Untrusted)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the OpenAPI specification is loaded from an untrusted source (e.g., user-provided URL, insecure database), an attacker can inject malicious content into the specification.
        *   **1.2.1. Inject Malicious OpenAPI Definition (Critical Node)**
            *   **Insight:** By injecting malicious definitions, attackers can alter the API's structure and behavior.
            *   **Action:** Never load OpenAPI specifications from untrusted sources without rigorous validation and sanitization. Implement strict access control for specification storage and retrieval.

            *   **1.2.1.1. Introduce New, Unintended API Endpoints (Critical Node)**
                *   **Insight:**  A malicious specification can define new API endpoints that were not intended by the application developers. These endpoints could be designed for unauthorized actions, data access, or system manipulation.
                *   **Action:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any externally sourced OpenAPI specifications. Implement a process to review and approve any changes to the API definition.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Generated Code Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_generated_code_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the code generated by `go-swagger`, particularly if developers rely on default handlers without implementing proper security measures.

    *   **2.1. Insecure Default Handlers (High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Developers might use the default handlers generated by `go-swagger` without customizing them to include necessary security checks, such as input validation and sanitization.
        *   **2.1.1. Lack of Input Sanitization in Default Handlers (Critical Node)**
            *   **Insight:** Default handlers generated by `go-swagger` are intended as starting points and may not include robust input validation. This can leave applications vulnerable to common injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection, XSS) if developers don't add proper sanitization.
            *   **Action:** Developers must always review and customize generated handlers to implement robust input validation, sanitization, authorization, and error handling. Treat generated code as a template, not a secure solution.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Swagger UI/Redoc Integration (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_swagger_uiredoc_integration__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the integrated Swagger UI or Redoc components, or misconfigurations related to their deployment.

    *   **3.1. Vulnerabilities in Swagger UI/Redoc Components**
        *   **3.1.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Swagger UI/Redoc (Critical Node)**
            *   **Insight:** Swagger UI and Redoc are client-side JavaScript applications and may contain XSS vulnerabilities. If `go-swagger` serves these components directly, vulnerabilities in them can be exploited to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.
            *   **Action:** Keep Swagger UI/Redoc components updated to the latest versions. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks. Consider hosting Swagger UI/Redoc on a separate, isolated domain if possible.

        *   **3.1.2. Information Disclosure via Swagger UI/Redoc (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)**
            *   **Insight:** Swagger UI/Redoc exposes detailed API documentation, including endpoints, parameters, schemas, and potentially sensitive information in examples. Unrestricted access to this documentation can aid attackers in reconnaissance, providing valuable information for planning further attacks.
            *   **Action:** Implement access control for Swagger UI/Redoc. Restrict access to authorized users or internal networks. Review API documentation for sensitive information and remove or redact as necessary. Ensure example values do not contain real sensitive data.
