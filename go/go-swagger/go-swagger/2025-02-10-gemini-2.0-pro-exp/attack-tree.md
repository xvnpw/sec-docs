## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Code Generation Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_code_generation_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1. Template Injection in Custom Templates [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in custom templates used by `go-swagger` to generate code. This often involves injecting malicious code into the Swagger specification or manipulating template inputs.
    *   **1.1.1. Craft malicious Swagger spec with embedded template directives. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker creates a Swagger specification that includes malicious template directives (e.g., Go template syntax) designed to execute code when the specification is processed by `go-swagger`.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires control over the Swagger spec)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Code review, static analysis)
    *   **1.1.2. Use custom templates that don't properly sanitize user-provided input in the spec. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  Developers create custom templates for `go-swagger` but fail to properly sanitize user-provided input within the Swagger specification that is used by those templates. This allows attackers to inject malicious code through the specification.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on developer awareness)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Code review, static analysis)

*   **1.2. Insecure Default Configurations [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The application relies on `go-swagger`'s default settings without applying necessary security hardening.
    *   **1.2.1. Rely on default `go-swagger` settings without hardening. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Developers deploy the `go-swagger`-generated application without modifying the default configurations, leaving it vulnerable to known attacks or information disclosure.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (Common mistake)
        *   **Impact:** Medium (Information disclosure)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Configuration review)

*   **1.3. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Indirect via generated code)**
    *   **Description:** The code generated by `go-swagger` includes dependencies that have known vulnerabilities.
    *   **1.3.2. Attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in those dependencies. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker identifies and exploits publicly known vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by the `go-swagger`-generated code.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on dependency update frequency)
        *   **Impact:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability)
        *   **Effort:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability)
        *   **Skill Level:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Dependency scanning)

*   **1.6. Insecure handling of file uploads (if spec allows) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** If the API specification allows file uploads, the generated code may not properly validate the uploaded files.
    *   **1.6.2. `go-swagger` generated code doesn't properly validate file type, size, or content. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The `go-swagger`-generated code lacks sufficient checks for file type, size, and content, allowing attackers to upload malicious files.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If file uploads are used without proper validation)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (RCE, DoS)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (File upload testing, code review)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Runtime Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_runtime_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **2.2. Authentication/Authorization Bypass (Specific to `go-swagger`'s implementation) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers bypass the authentication or authorization mechanisms implemented by the `go-swagger`-generated code.
    *   **2.2.1. `go-swagger`'s generated authentication/authorization middleware has flaws. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The authentication and authorization middleware generated by `go-swagger` contains vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass security checks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (If using standard auth schemes, lower; custom schemes, higher)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Unauthorized access)
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Penetration testing, code review)

*   **3.1. Misconfigured Middleware**
    *   **Description:** The middleware components of the `go-swagger`-generated application are incorrectly configured, creating security vulnerabilities.
    *   **3.1.1. Developers incorrectly configure `go-swagger`'s middleware. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Developers make mistakes when configuring the middleware, such as disabling security features or setting incorrect parameters.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common configuration error)
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on the misconfiguration)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low

    *   **3.2.1. `go-swagger` or the generated application exposes debug endpoints. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Debug or management endpoints that should be restricted are accessible to attackers, potentially revealing sensitive information or providing control over the application.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Should be disabled in production)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Information disclosure, RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
