# Attack Surface Analysis for go-swagger/go-swagger

## Attack Surface: [1. Insufficient Input Validation (Specification-Driven)](./attack_surfaces/1__insufficient_input_validation__specification-driven_.md)

*   **Description:** Weak or missing validation rules (e.g., `maxLength`, `minLength`, `pattern`, `enum`, `format`) within the OpenAPI specification, leading to inadequate server-side validation.
*   **How `go-swagger` Contributes:** `go-swagger` *directly* generates server-side validation code based on the constraints defined in the OpenAPI specification.  If the specification lacks sufficient validation, the generated code will *inherit* this weakness. This is a core feature of how `go-swagger` operates.
*   **Example:** A `POST /users` endpoint accepts a `username` field with no `maxLength` or `pattern` defined in the specification.  `go-swagger` generates code that accepts *any* string for the username, allowing an attacker to potentially inject malicious payloads or cause a denial-of-service.
*   **Impact:** Injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, command injection), denial-of-service, data corruption, and potentially remote code execution (depending on how the unvalidated data is used).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Comprehensive Specification Validation:** Define *strict and comprehensive* validation rules in the OpenAPI specification for *all* request parameters and body fields.  Use all relevant constraints: `maxLength`, `minLength`, `pattern` (regular expressions), `enum` (allowed values), `format` (e.g., "email", "date-time"), `maximum`, `minimum`, `exclusiveMaximum`, `exclusiveMinimum`, `multipleOf`.  Treat the specification as a security-critical document.
    *   **Schema Composition (allOf, anyOf, oneOf):** Use schema composition features (`allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`) to create more complex and robust validation rules, combining multiple constraints for enhanced security.
    *   **Regular Expression Expertise:** Ensure that any regular expressions used in `pattern` constraints are carefully crafted and tested to avoid ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [2. Missing or Misconfigured Authentication/Authorization (Specification-Driven)](./attack_surfaces/2__missing_or_misconfigured_authenticationauthorization__specification-driven_.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to properly define or apply security schemes (`securityDefinitions` and `security`) in the OpenAPI specification, resulting in `go-swagger` generating code with inadequate or bypassed authentication/authorization checks.
*   **How `go-swagger` Contributes:** `go-swagger` has the capability to generate authentication middleware *directly* from the security definitions and requirements specified in the OpenAPI document.  Incorrect or missing definitions in the spec lead to flawed or absent security enforcement in the generated code. This is a *direct* consequence of `go-swagger`'s design.
*   **Example:** An API defines an OAuth 2.0 security scheme in `securityDefinitions`, but fails to apply it using the `security` keyword to a specific endpoint (e.g., `POST /admin/data`).  `go-swagger` will *not* generate authentication checks for this endpoint, leaving it unprotected.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Precise Security Definitions:** Define *all* required security schemes (API keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT, etc.) accurately and completely in the `securityDefinitions` section of the OpenAPI specification.  Include all necessary parameters and scopes.
    *   **Consistent Security Application:** Use the `security` keyword *consistently and correctly* to apply the defined security schemes to *every* endpoint and operation that requires protection.  Ensure there are no gaps or inconsistencies.  Use global security definitions where appropriate to avoid repetition.
    *   **Security Scheme Validation:**  Thoroughly test the generated authentication and authorization middleware to confirm it enforces the intended security policies.  Test both positive cases (valid credentials) and negative cases (invalid or missing credentials).

## Attack Surface: [3. Specification Injection (If Dynamic Generation is Used)](./attack_surfaces/3__specification_injection__if_dynamic_generation_is_used_.md)

*   **Description:**  If (and *only* if) the application dynamically generates or modifies the OpenAPI specification based on user input, an attacker could inject malicious definitions, leading to `go-swagger` generating vulnerable code.
*   **How `go-swagger` Contributes:** This vulnerability is *entirely* dependent on how the application uses `go-swagger`. If the specification is static, this is *not* a risk.  However, if the application *dynamically* generates the spec from user input, `go-swagger` becomes the mechanism by which the attacker's malicious definitions are translated into executable (and vulnerable) code.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to define custom data models through a web form, and these definitions are directly incorporated into the OpenAPI specification. An attacker provides a model definition that disables input validation or adds a new, hidden endpoint with elevated privileges. `go-swagger` then generates code based on this compromised specification.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially complete application compromise, including arbitrary code execution, data breaches, and denial-of-service. The attacker gains control over the API's behavior through the generated code.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Generation:** The *primary* and most effective mitigation is to *avoid dynamic generation of the OpenAPI specification from user input entirely*. Use a static, pre-defined specification whenever possible.
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (If Unavoidable):** If dynamic generation is *absolutely unavoidable*, implement *extremely rigorous* input validation and sanitization on *any* user-provided data that influences the specification.  Use a strict whitelist approach, allowing *only* known-good characters, structures, and keywords.  Reject *any* input that deviates from the expected format.
    *   **Sandboxing (If Possible):** If dynamic generation is required, consider using a sandboxed environment to generate and validate the specification before integrating it into the main application. This can limit the impact of a successful injection.
    * **Input escaping:** Escape all user inputs before using them in specification.
