# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for go-swagger/go-swagger

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation (Server-Side, `go-swagger` Enabled)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation__server-side___go-swagger__enabled_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable `go-swagger` Validation:** Ensure request validation is *explicitly enabled* in your `go-swagger` server configuration. This is typically done during server setup (e.g., within the `configureAPI` function).  Actively look for and remove any flags or settings that might disable validation.
    2.  **Comprehensive OpenAPI Schema:**  Within your OpenAPI specification (YAML or JSON), meticulously define the schema for *each* request body and parameter. Utilize `go-swagger`'s supported schema features:
        *   `type`: Specify precise data types (e.g., `integer`, `string`, `boolean`, `number`, `array`, `object`).
        *   `format`: Use standard formats for strings (e.g., `date-time`, `email`, `uuid`, `byte` for base64 encoded data).
        *   `required`:  Explicitly mark required fields.
        *   `minLength`, `maxLength`: Set length constraints for strings.
        *   `pattern`:  Use regular expressions for complex string validation (e.g., specific formats, allowed characters).
        *   `minimum`, `maximum`, `exclusiveMinimum`, `exclusiveMaximum`: Define numeric ranges.
        *   `enum`: Restrict values to a predefined set of allowed values.
        *   `items`: If the type is `array`, define the schema for the array items.
        *   `properties`: If the type is `object`, define the schema for each property.
    3.  **`go-swagger` Custom Validators:** For validation logic *not* expressible within the OpenAPI schema, create and register custom validators using `go-swagger`'s extension points. These are Go functions that receive the input and return an error. Use these for:
        *   Cross-field validation (dependencies between fields).
        *   Database lookups (e.g., verifying foreign key relationships).
        *   Complex business rules specific to your application.
    4.  **Fail-Fast:** Configure `go-swagger`'s validation to be "fail-fast" â€“ reject the request immediately upon encountering the *first* validation error. This is usually the default behavior, but confirm it.
    5.  **OpenAPI-Defined Error Responses:** Define a consistent error response schema *within your OpenAPI specification*.  `go-swagger` will use this to generate code that returns structured error responses. Use appropriate HTTP status codes (400 Bad Request, 422 Unprocessable Entity).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):**  SQLi, NoSQLi, command injection, XSS (if server output is not handled correctly on the client). `go-swagger`'s schema validation prevents malformed data from reaching your application logic.
    *   **Data Type Mismatches (Medium Severity):** Prevents unexpected behavior caused by incorrect data types.
    *   **Buffer Overflows (High Severity):** String length constraints (`minLength`, `maxLength`) enforced by `go-swagger` prevent overly long inputs.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**  `go-swagger` can limit the size of request bodies and parameters, mitigating some DoS vectors.
    *   **Business Logic Errors (Variable Severity):** Custom validators and schema constraints enforce business rules at the API boundary.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible, assuming proper client-side handling).
    *   **Data Type Mismatches:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Buffer Overflows:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible).
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Business Logic Errors:** Risk reduced (severity depends on the specific logic).

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Example: Validation enabled in `configureAPI`. Basic schema validation for most endpoints. Custom validators for date ranges.* **(Fill in your project details)**

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Example: Missing regex patterns for some string fields. No custom validators for user ID lookups. Error response schema not fully standardized.* **(Fill in your project details)**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Response Validation (Server-Side, `go-swagger` Enabled)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_response_validation__server-side___go-swagger__enabled_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable `go-swagger` Response Validation:** Explicitly enable response validation in your `go-swagger` server configuration. This is often a separate setting from request validation.
    2.  **Complete OpenAPI Response Schemas:** Define the schema for *every* response (success *and* error cases) in your OpenAPI specification. Use the same level of detail as for request schemas (data types, constraints, `required` fields, etc.).
    3.  **Standardized Error Response Schema:** Define a *specific, consistent* schema for error responses within your OpenAPI spec.  This ensures that all errors returned by your API have a predictable structure.
    4. **Use go-swagger generated response writers:** Ensure that you are using the response writers generated by go-swagger. These writers will automatically perform the validation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Leakage (Medium Severity):** Prevents exposing internal data structures or error details through responses. `go-swagger` ensures responses conform to the defined schema.
    *   **Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** If the client trusts unvalidated responses, it can be vulnerable. `go-swagger`'s response validation provides a server-side safeguard.
    *   **Broken Access Control (High Severity):** Prevents returning more data than the user is authorized to see (if the response schema accurately reflects authorization rules).
    *   **Data Consistency Issues (Medium Severity):** Ensures consistent response formats, preventing client-side errors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Client-Side Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced (severity depends on client behavior, but server-side validation adds a layer of defense).
    *   **Broken Access Control:** Risk reduced (High to Low/Medium, depending on how well the response schema reflects authorization).
    *   **Data Consistency Issues:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Example: Response validation enabled. Basic response schemas defined, but not for all error cases.* **(Fill in your project details)**

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Example: Missing response schemas for some endpoints. No consistent, OpenAPI-defined error response schema.* **(Fill in your project details)**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Client Generation and Usage (`go-swagger` Client)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_client_generation_and_usage___go-swagger__client_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable `go-swagger` Client-Side Response Validation:** Ensure the generated `go-swagger` client is configured to validate responses from the server. This is usually a flag or setting during client initialization.  This provides a defense-in-depth measure, even if the server *should* be validating its responses.
    2.  **Use Generated Client Methods:**  Use the methods provided by the generated `go-swagger` client to make API calls.  These methods typically handle serialization, deserialization, and (if enabled) response validation.  Avoid manually constructing HTTP requests.
    3. **Handle go-swagger generated errors:** The generated client will return errors if the response does not match the specification. Handle these errors appropriately.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Injection Attacks (Variable Severity):** If the client doesn't validate server responses, it can be vulnerable (e.g., XSS if the server returns unescaped HTML). `go-swagger` client-side validation helps mitigate this.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Processing invalid server responses can lead to client-side errors. `go-swagger` validation prevents this.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client-Side Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced (severity depends on the specific attack and client-side usage of the data).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Example: Client-side response validation enabled in the generated client.* **(Fill in your project details)**

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Example: Not consistently handling errors returned by the go-swagger client.* **(Fill in your project details)**

## Mitigation Strategy: [OpenAPI Specification as a Security Contract](./mitigation_strategies/openapi_specification_as_a_security_contract.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Principle of Least Privilege in API Design:** Design your API endpoints and data models with the principle of least privilege.  Expose *only* the necessary data and functionality through your OpenAPI specification.
    2.  **Precise Data Types and Constraints:** Use the most specific data types and constraints available in OpenAPI (as detailed in Strategy 1). This is *fundamental* to how `go-swagger` enforces security.
    3.  **`additionalProperties: false`:**  In your schema definitions, set `additionalProperties: false` unless you *absolutely require* allowing arbitrary, unvalidated properties. If you need additional properties, define a specific schema for them. This is a key feature of OpenAPI that `go-swagger` leverages.
    4.  **`go-swagger` Security Definitions:**  Properly define your security schemes (OAuth2, API keys, etc.) in the `securityDefinitions` section of your OpenAPI specification.  `go-swagger` uses this to generate authentication and authorization code.  Ensure the generated code correctly implements the chosen scheme (see Strategy 5).
    5. **Review and Audit OpenAPI Spec:** Regularly review and audit your OpenAPI specification for potential security issues, focusing on the aspects above.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Precise types and constraints limit the attack surface.
    *   **Data Validation Bypass (Medium Severity):** `additionalProperties: false` prevents sending unexpected data.
    *   **Broken Access Control (High Severity):** Security definitions and least privilege principles, enforced by `go-swagger`, prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Information Leakage (Medium Severity):** Minimizing exposed data reduces leakage risk.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced (High to Medium/Low).
    *   **Data Validation Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Broken Access Control:** Risk reduced (High to Medium/Low, depending on correct implementation of the security scheme).
    *   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Example: Using precise data types. `additionalProperties: false` in most schemas. OAuth2 defined.* **(Fill in your project details)**

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Example: Missing constraints on some string fields. Need to review the spec for least privilege.* **(Fill in your project details)**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `go-swagger` Security Scheme Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/secure__go-swagger__security_scheme_implementation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand the Chosen Scheme:** Thoroughly understand the security scheme you've defined in your OpenAPI specification (OAuth2, API keys, JWT, etc.).
    2.  **Leverage `go-swagger` Generated Security Handlers:** `go-swagger` generates code to handle authentication and authorization based on your `securityDefinitions`.  *Use this generated code*, but *verify its correctness*.
    3.  **Token Validation (JWT Example, within `go-swagger` context):** If using JWTs, ensure the `go-swagger` generated authentication handler (or your custom middleware *integrated with* `go-swagger`) performs these checks:
        *   **Signature Verification:** Verify the JWT signature.
        *   **Issuer and Audience:** Check `iss` and `aud` claims.
        *   **Expiration:** Verify the `exp` claim.
        *   **Scope Validation:** If using OAuth2 scopes, verify that the token has the required scopes.  `go-swagger` can generate code to help with this, based on your OpenAPI spec.
    4.  **API Key Handling (within `go-swagger` context):** If using API keys, ensure the `go-swagger` generated handler:
        *   Retrieves the API key from the correct location (header, query parameter, etc., as defined in your OpenAPI spec).
        *   Validates the API key (you'll likely need to provide a custom validator function to `go-swagger` for this).
    5. **Review Generated Auth Code:** Carefully review the authentication and authorization code generated by `go-swagger`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass (High Severity):** Flawed token validation or API key handling can allow attackers to bypass authentication.
    *   **Authorization Bypass (High Severity):** Incorrect scope validation or authorization logic can grant unauthorized access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible, if implemented correctly).
    *   **Authorization Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible, if implemented correctly).

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Example: Using JWTs with signature verification. Checking `iss`, `aud`, `exp`. Using `go-swagger` generated auth handler.* **(Fill in your project details)**

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Example: Missing scope validation. Need to review the generated auth code more thoroughly.* **(Fill in your project details)**
