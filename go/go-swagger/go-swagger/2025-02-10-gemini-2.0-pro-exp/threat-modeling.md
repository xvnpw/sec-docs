# Threat Model Analysis for go-swagger/go-swagger

## Threat: [Malformed Specification Parsing DoS](./threats/malformed_specification_parsing_dos.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits a deliberately crafted, overly complex, or cyclic OpenAPI specification (YAML or JSON) to the application. The attacker aims to cause excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) during the parsing process, either at code generation time or at runtime if the specification is loaded dynamically. The attacker might use techniques like deeply nested objects, circular references, or extremely large string values.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion. The application becomes unresponsive or crashes.  Potentially, the entire server could become unstable.
    *   **Affected Component:** `loads` package (specifically, the functions responsible for parsing the specification, like `loads.Spec()`), code generation tools (`swagger generate` command and its underlying components).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the OpenAPI specification against the official OpenAPI schema *before* any processing. Use a robust and well-maintained validator like `go-openapi/validate`.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement strict resource limits (timeouts, memory limits) during specification parsing.  Use Go's `context` package to enforce timeouts.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Analyze the specification for potential complexity issues (e.g., excessive nesting, large string literals) before processing.
        *   **Static Specification:** Prefer using a static, pre-generated specification rather than loading it dynamically at runtime.

## Threat: [Specification Poisoning via Compromised Source](./threats/specification_poisoning_via_compromised_source.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the source of the OpenAPI specification (e.g., a file on the filesystem, a database record, a remote URL). The attacker modifies the specification to introduce malicious definitions, such as altered data types, removed validation constraints, or added unexpected API endpoints.
    *   **Impact:**  The compromised specification can lead to various vulnerabilities, including data validation bypasses, injection attacks (if custom code generation templates are used), and exposure of unintended functionality.  The impact depends on the specific changes made by the attacker.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The entire `go-swagger` pipeline is affected, as the compromised specification influences code generation, routing, and validation.  Specifically, the `loads` package and code generation tools.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls on the specification source.  Only authorized users and processes should be able to modify it.
        *   **Integrity Checks:** Use checksums (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signatures to verify the integrity of the specification.  Detect any unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Version Control:** Use a version control system (like Git) to track changes to the specification and facilitate rollback to a known-good version.
        *   **Regular Audits:**  Periodically audit the specification source and access logs for any signs of tampering.

## Threat: [Parameter Tampering Bypass](./threats/parameter_tampering_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates request parameters (query, path, header, body) in ways that bypass `go-swagger`'s built-in validation.  The attacker might provide unexpected data types, values outside defined ranges, or exploit edge cases in the validation logic.  For example, they might try to send a string where an integer is expected, or a very large number where a small one is expected.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypassing input validation can lead to various issues, including data corruption, unexpected application behavior, and potentially security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) if the unvalidated data is used in subsequent operations.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The `runtime` package, specifically the parameter binding and validation logic (e.g., `runtime.BindParams`, generated `ParseParams` methods in operation handlers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Comprehensive Specification:** Ensure the OpenAPI specification is complete and accurate, defining all parameters with appropriate types, formats, and constraints (e.g., `minimum`, `maximum`, `pattern`, `enum`).
        *   **Strict Validation:** Use `go-swagger`'s validation features rigorously.  Don't rely solely on default settings.
        *   **Custom Validation:** Implement additional custom validation logic in your handlers if the built-in validation is insufficient for specific security requirements.
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Even after validation, consider sanitizing input data before using it in sensitive operations (e.g., database queries, system commands).

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** `go-swagger` itself, or one of its dependencies, has a known vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-swagger` itself or any of its transitive dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `go list -m all | nancy` or Snyk.
        *   **Update Dependencies:** Keep `go-swagger` and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use Go modules (`go mod`) to manage dependencies and ensure reproducible builds.
        *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to Go and `go-swagger`.
