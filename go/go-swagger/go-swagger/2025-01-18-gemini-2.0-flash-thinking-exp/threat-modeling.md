# Threat Model Analysis for go-swagger/go-swagger

## Threat: [Insecure Default CORS Configuration in Generated Code](./threats/insecure_default_cors_configuration_in_generated_code.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could exploit overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers set by default in the generated code. They might host malicious scripts on a different domain that can then make requests to the vulnerable API, potentially stealing data or performing actions on behalf of legitimate users.
- **Impact:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, unauthorized data access, and potential account compromise.
- **Affected go-swagger Component:** Code Generator (specifically, the part generating HTTP handler setup).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Explicitly configure restrictive CORS policies in the application's configuration or through custom middleware, overriding any insecure defaults.
    - Avoid using wildcard (`*`) for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in production environments.
    - Carefully define allowed origins based on the application's needs.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies Introduced by `go-swagger`](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies_introduced_by__go-swagger_.md)

- **Description:** `go-swagger` itself relies on other Go packages. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. This could involve various attack vectors depending on the vulnerable dependency.
- **Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
- **Affected go-swagger Component:** Dependency Management (the set of libraries `go-swagger` relies on).
- **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly update `go-swagger` to the latest version, which often includes updates to its dependencies.
    - Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
    - Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities affecting `go-swagger` and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Specification References](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_specification_references.md)

- **Description:** If the OpenAPI specification allows referencing external resources (e.g., remote schemas), a malicious actor could potentially manipulate the specification to make the server perform requests to arbitrary internal or external systems. This could be achieved by crafting a specification with malicious external references.
- **Impact:**  Exposure of internal resources, potential compromise of other systems, and data exfiltration.
- **Affected go-swagger Component:** OpenAPI Parser (specifically, the part handling external references).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully review and sanitize any external references within the OpenAPI specification.
    - Consider disallowing external references altogether or implementing strict whitelisting of allowed external resources.
    - Implement proper input validation and sanitization for any data derived from external references.
