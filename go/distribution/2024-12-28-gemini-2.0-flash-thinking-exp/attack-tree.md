## Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes for Compromising Application Using distribution/distribution

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: Execute Arbitrary Code on Application Infrastructure by exploiting vulnerabilities in the `distribution/distribution` container registry.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

```
└── Compromise Application Infrastructure
    ├── **Exploit Malicious Image Injection** **(Critical Node)**
    │   --> Compromise Registry Credentials **(Critical Node)**
    │   └── **Outcome:** Application pulls and executes malicious image, leading to code execution. **(Critical Node)**
    --> **Exploit Registry Upload Vulnerability** **(Critical Node)**
    │   └── **Outcome:** Application pulls and executes malicious image, leading to code execution. **(Critical Node)**
    ├── Exploit Registry Vulnerabilities
    │   └── **Authentication and Authorization Bypass** **(Critical Node)**
    │   └── **Outcome:** Direct compromise of the registry leading to control over images or disruption of service, indirectly impacting the application. **(Critical Node)**
```

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit Malicious Image Injection (Critical Node):**

*   **Description:** The attacker's goal is to inject a malicious container image into the registry that the target application will subsequently pull and execute. This is a direct path to compromising the application's execution environment.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Successful execution of a malicious image allows the attacker to run arbitrary code on the application infrastructure, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and complete system compromise.

**2. Compromise Registry Credentials (Critical Node):**

*   **Description:** The attacker gains valid credentials for the container registry. This allows them to authenticate and perform actions as a legitimate user, including pushing malicious images.
*   **Attack Vectors within this Node:**
    *   Phishing Attack against Registry Admins: Tricking administrators into revealing their credentials through social engineering.
    *   Exploit Vulnerability in Registry Authentication: Exploiting security flaws in the registry's authentication mechanisms to bypass login procedures.
    *   Credential Stuffing/Brute-force: Using lists of known usernames and passwords or systematically trying different combinations to guess valid credentials.
*   **Impact:** High. Compromised credentials provide a significant foothold in the registry, enabling various malicious activities, including malicious image injection and manifest manipulation.

**3. Exploit Registry Upload Vulnerability (Critical Node):**

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the registry's image upload process to bypass security checks and introduce malicious images.
*   **Attack Vectors within this Node:**
    *   Bypass Image Scanning/Validation: Circumventing or exploiting weaknesses in the registry's image scanning and validation mechanisms.
    *   Exploit API Vulnerability in Image Upload Process: Exploiting flaws in the API endpoints responsible for handling image uploads.
*   **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation allows the direct injection of malicious images, bypassing other security measures.

**4. Outcome: Application pulls and executes malicious image, leading to code execution (Critical Node):**

*   **Description:** This is the successful culmination of the "Exploit Malicious Image Injection" attack path. The application, believing the image to be legitimate, pulls and executes the malicious container.
*   **Impact:** Critical. This directly achieves the attacker's goal of executing arbitrary code on the application infrastructure.

**5. Exploit Registry Vulnerabilities -> Authentication and Authorization Bypass (Critical Node):**

*   **Description:** The attacker bypasses the registry's authentication and authorization mechanisms, gaining unauthorized access to its functionalities.
*   **Attack Vectors within this Node:**
    *   Exploit flaws in token generation/validation: Exploiting weaknesses in how the registry generates or validates authentication tokens.
    *   Exploit flaws in role-based access control: Circumventing or exploiting misconfigurations in the registry's role-based access control system.
    *   Leverage default or weak credentials: Using default or easily guessable credentials that haven't been changed.
*   **Impact:** High. Successful bypass grants the attacker significant control over the registry, potentially allowing them to manipulate images, access sensitive information, or disrupt service.

**6. Exploit Registry Vulnerabilities -> Outcome: Direct compromise of the registry leading to control over images or disruption of service, indirectly impacting the application (Critical Node):**

*   **Description:** This represents the outcome of directly exploiting vulnerabilities within the registry software itself. This can lead to various forms of compromise, including control over image content and denial of service.
*   **Impact:** High. While not directly executing code on the application infrastructure, compromising the registry can severely impact the application's ability to function correctly and securely. Manipulating images can lead to indirect code execution, and denial of service can impact application availability.

These High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes represent the most significant threats to applications using `distribution/distribution`. Focusing mitigation efforts on these areas will provide the most effective defense against potential attacks.
