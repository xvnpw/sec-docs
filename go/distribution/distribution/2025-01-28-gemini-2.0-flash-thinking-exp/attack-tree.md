## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Docker Registry Application](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_docker_registry_application.md)

This is the root goal and represents the ultimate compromise of the application. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Distribution Software](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_distribution_software.md)

This node represents attacks directly targeting the Docker Distribution codebase. Exploiting vulnerabilities here can lead to significant impact as it targets the core functionality of the registry.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Code Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_code_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on exploiting flaws in how Distribution processes input, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.
    *   **Attack Vector: Image Name/Tag Injection**
        *   Description: Attackers exploit insufficient input validation when processing image names or tags during push or pull operations. By crafting malicious names or tags, they can inject commands or manipulate registry behavior.
        *   Potential Impact: Registry manipulation, data corruption, potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on the execution context.
    *   **Attack Vector: Manifest Injection**
        *   Description: Attackers create malicious Docker manifests designed to inject code during manifest processing or validation within the registry. This can lead to RCE or data manipulation.
        *   Potential Impact: Critical impact including RCE, data manipulation, and potential registry takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Logic/Design Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_logicdesign_flaws.md)

This path targets inherent weaknesses in the design or logic of the Distribution software, bypassing intended security mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Authentication/Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_authenticationauthorization_bypass.md)

This sub-path focuses on circumventing authentication and authorization controls.
            *   **Attack Vector: Token Forgery/Exploitation**
                *   Description: Attackers exploit weaknesses in how authentication tokens are generated, validated, or stored. This allows them to forge valid tokens or exploit existing ones to bypass authentication checks and gain unauthorized access.
                *   Potential Impact: Unauthorized access to the registry, data manipulation, and potential registry takeover.
        *   **High-Risk Path: Insecure Default Configurations**
            *   Description: Attackers leverage insecure default settings in Distribution, such as weak authentication mechanisms or exposed API endpoints. These defaults can provide initial access or facilitate privilege escalation.
            *   Potential Impact: Initial unauthorized access, which can be a stepping stone to further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

This path exploits known vulnerabilities in external libraries and components used by Distribution.
    *   **Attack Vector: Vulnerable Go Libraries**
        *   Description: Attackers target known vulnerabilities in Go libraries that Distribution depends on (e.g., HTTP libraries, storage drivers, authentication libraries). Exploiting these vulnerabilities can compromise the registry.
        *   Potential Impact: Critical impact including RCE, data breach, and Denial of Service (DoS), depending on the specific vulnerable library.
    *   **Attack Vector: Vulnerable Container Image Dependencies**
        *   Description: If Distribution is deployed as a container, attackers target vulnerabilities in the base image or other container image dependencies used to build the Distribution container. Exploiting these can compromise the registry environment.
        *   Potential Impact: Critical impact including RCE, container escape, and compromise of the entire registry environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Misconfigurations or Weaknesses in Deployment Environment](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_misconfigurations_or_weaknesses_in_deployment_environment.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how Distribution is deployed and configured, rather than the software itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Insecure Storage Backend Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_insecure_storage_backend_configuration.md)

This sub-path targets misconfigurations in the storage backend used by Distribution to store image layers and manifests.
            *   **Attack Vector: Publicly Accessible Storage Bucket (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage)**
                *   Description: If the storage backend (like an S3 bucket) is misconfigured to be publicly accessible, attackers can directly access and manipulate image layers and manifests, completely bypassing registry access controls.
                *   Potential Impact: Critical impact as it allows direct access to all image data, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and registry bypass.
            *   **Attack Vector: Weak Storage Backend Credentials**
                *   Description: Attackers compromise or guess weak credentials used by Distribution to access the storage backend. This grants them direct access to image data.
                *   Potential Impact: Critical impact, similar to publicly accessible buckets, allowing direct access to and manipulation of image data.
            *   **Attack Vector: Insufficient Storage Backend Permissions**
                *   Description: Attackers exploit overly permissive permissions granted to the Distribution service on the storage backend. This allows them to modify or delete image data, causing data corruption or DoS.
                *   Potential Impact: High impact including data corruption and DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Insecure Network Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_insecure_network_configuration.md)

This sub-path targets weaknesses in the network setup of the registry.
            *   **Attack Vector: Unprotected Registry API Endpoint**
                *   Description: The registry API endpoint is exposed without proper network security controls (e.g., firewall, network segmentation). This allows unauthorized access from external networks, potentially exposing the registry to all other attacks in this tree.
                *   Potential Impact: High impact as it provides a wide open door for various attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Weak Operational Security Practices](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_weak_operational_security_practices.md)

This sub-path highlights weaknesses in the operational procedures surrounding the registry.
            *   **Attack Vector: Insufficient Monitoring and Logging**
                *   Description: Lack of adequate monitoring and logging makes it difficult to detect malicious activities and respond to incidents effectively. This increases the dwell time of attackers and hinders incident response.
                *   Potential Impact: Medium impact, primarily by enabling other attacks and delaying detection.
            *   **Attack Vector: Delayed Security Patching**
                *   Description: Failure to promptly apply security patches for Distribution and its dependencies leaves the registry vulnerable to known exploits.
                *   Potential Impact: High impact as it directly exposes the registry to known and potentially easily exploitable vulnerabilities.
            *   **Attack Vector: Insecure Secrets Management**
                *   Description: Improper handling of secrets (e.g., API keys, database credentials) can lead to the compromise of the registry and its backend systems.
                *   Potential Impact: Critical impact, potentially leading to full compromise of the registry and backend systems, and data breaches.
