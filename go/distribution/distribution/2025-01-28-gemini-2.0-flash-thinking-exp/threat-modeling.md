# Threat Model Analysis for distribution/distribution

## Threat: [Anonymous Pull Access Misconfiguration](./threats/anonymous_pull_access_misconfiguration.md)

Description: Registry is misconfigured to allow anonymous users to pull container images. An attacker could anonymously access and download sensitive or proprietary container images without authentication, potentially using automated tools to scrape and exfiltrate data.
Impact: Data breach, intellectual property theft, exposure of internal application details, competitive disadvantage.
Affected Component: Configuration, Authentication Module
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Enforce authentication for pull operations by configuring authentication middleware.
    * Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using the registry's authorization features to restrict access to specific repositories based on user roles.
    * Regularly review and audit the registry's authentication and authorization configurations to ensure they align with security policies.

## Threat: [Weak Authentication Mechanisms](./threats/weak_authentication_mechanisms.md)

Description: Registry configured with weak or easily bypassed authentication methods. An attacker could exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access to the registry, potentially by intercepting credentials, exploiting fallback mechanisms, or leveraging vulnerabilities in authentication plugins.
Impact: Credential compromise, unauthorized access to push and pull images, data breach, unauthorized image manipulation leading to supply chain attacks.
Affected Component: Authentication Module, Configuration
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Enforce strong authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or client certificates, utilizing the registry's supported authentication options.
    * Disable or restrict weaker authentication methods if possible within the registry's configuration.
    * Ensure TLS (HTTPS) is strictly enforced for all communication to protect credentials in transit and prevent downgrade attacks.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass Vulnerabilities](./threats/authorization_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Exploitable vulnerabilities in the registry's authorization logic or code. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass authorization checks and gain unauthorized access to repositories or perform actions they are not permitted to, such as pulling or pushing images to restricted repositories.
Impact: Unauthorized access to images, data breach, unauthorized image manipulation, potential for privilege escalation within the registry context, supply chain compromise.
Affected Component: Authorization Module, API Endpoints
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Regularly update the `distribution/distribution` software to the latest stable version to patch known authorization vulnerabilities.
    * Perform thorough security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on the registry's authorization implementation and API endpoints.
    * Implement robust unit and integration tests for authorization logic to catch potential flaws during development and updates.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Image Manipulation/Deletion](./threats/unauthorized_image_manipulationdeletion.md)

Description: Attackers gaining unauthorized access (through compromised credentials or authorization bypass) and manipulating or deleting images within the registry. This could involve modifying image tags, manifests, or layers, leading to the distribution of compromised images or disruption of services relying on those images.
Impact: Supply chain poisoning, deployment of compromised applications across the organization or to customers, service disruption, loss of image integrity and trust, reputational damage.
Affected Component: Authorization Module, API Endpoints, Storage Backend, Image Manifest Handling
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Enforce strong authentication and authorization for all registry operations, especially push and delete actions.
    * Implement image signing and verification using tools like Notary to ensure image integrity and provenance, leveraging registry's integration capabilities if available.
    * Regularly audit registry access logs for suspicious activities related to image manipulation or deletion.
    * Consider using immutable image tags to prevent accidental or malicious overwrites and ensure image version stability.

## Threat: [Known CVEs in Distribution/Distribution Core](./threats/known_cves_in_distributiondistribution_core.md)

Description: Exploitable vulnerabilities discovered in the `distribution/distribution` codebase itself. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely or locally to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code on the registry server, or cause denial of service, potentially compromising the entire registry and the images it hosts.
Impact: Remote code execution on the registry server, denial of service, information disclosure, complete compromise of the registry infrastructure, data breach, supply chain compromise.
Affected Component: Core Registry Codebase, Various Modules
Risk Severity: Critical to High (depending on the specific CVE and exploitability)
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Regularly update `distribution/distribution` to the latest stable version, applying security patches promptly as soon as they are released.
    * Subscribe to security mailing lists and vulnerability databases related to `distribution/distribution` to stay informed about new CVEs.
    * Implement a vulnerability management process to actively track, assess, and remediate known vulnerabilities in the registry software.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by `distribution/distribution`. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities indirectly through the registry, potentially leading to similar impacts as core vulnerabilities if critical or high severity vulnerabilities exist in dependencies.
Impact: Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, potential compromise of the registry, supply chain implications if vulnerabilities are exploited to inject malicious code.
Affected Component: Dependencies, Build Process, Vendoring mechanisms
Risk Severity: High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools integrated into the development and deployment pipeline.
    * Keep dependencies up-to-date with security patches and newer versions, following the `distribution/distribution` project's dependency update recommendations.
    * Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies and ensure consistent builds.

## Threat: [Distribution of Malicious Images (Unintentional or Intentional)](./threats/distribution_of_malicious_images__unintentional_or_intentional_.md)

Description: The registry is used as a distribution point for compromised or malicious container images. This can happen unintentionally (hosting images with vulnerabilities introduced during build process) or intentionally (attacker with push access uploading malicious images). Users pulling these images will then deploy potentially compromised applications.
Impact: Deployment of compromised applications across the organization or to customers, system compromise of environments pulling malicious images, wider supply chain attacks, reputational damage, legal liabilities.
Affected Component: Registry Content, Image Storage, Distribution Pipeline, Push API
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement mandatory image scanning for vulnerabilities and malware using vulnerability scanners integrated with the registry (e.g., Clair, Trivy) before allowing images to be pushed or made available for pull.
    * Enforce image signing and verification using Notary or similar technologies to ensure image provenance and integrity and prevent tampering.
    * Establish a clear process for reporting, investigating, and removing malicious images from the registry.
    * Educate users and developers about the risks of pulling images from untrusted sources and emphasize the importance of verifying image integrity.

## Threat: [Image Tampering within the Registry (Integrity Compromise)](./threats/image_tampering_within_the_registry__integrity_compromise_.md)

Description: Attackers compromising the registry infrastructure itself and tampering with images stored within it. This could involve directly modifying image layers or manifests in the storage backend, bypassing normal push processes and leading to the distribution of backdoored or compromised images without detection through standard image scanning processes.
Impact: Deployment of severely compromised applications, widespread supply chain compromise affecting all users pulling tampered images, undermining trust in the entire container image supply chain, catastrophic security incidents.
Affected Component: Storage Backend, Image Manifest Handling, Distribution Pipeline, Registry Infrastructure
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Enforce very strong access controls to the registry infrastructure, including the storage backend, limiting access to only highly authorized personnel and automated systems.
    * Implement image signing and verification as a critical security control to detect tampering, ensuring signatures are verified at pull time.
    * Use immutable storage for image layers and manifests if technically feasible to prevent direct modification after initial upload.
    * Regularly audit registry infrastructure, access logs, and storage backend integrity for any signs of unauthorized access or tampering. Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems for the registry infrastructure.
