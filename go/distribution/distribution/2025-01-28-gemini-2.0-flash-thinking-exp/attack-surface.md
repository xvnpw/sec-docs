# Attack Surface Analysis for distribution/distribution

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Image Push (Authorization Bypass)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_image_push__authorization_bypass_.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain the ability to push malicious or unauthorized container images to the registry due to flaws in `distribution/distribution`'s authorization mechanisms or misconfiguration. This compromises the image supply chain.
*   **Distribution Contribution:** `distribution/distribution` is the component responsible for enforcing authorization policies for image pushing. Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within its authorization logic directly enable this attack.
*   **Example:**  Authorization rules in `distribution/distribution` are misconfigured, allowing users with pull access to also push images, or a vulnerability in the authorization middleware bypasses intended restrictions. An attacker exploits this to push a backdoored image.
*   **Impact:** Integrity compromise, supply chain attack, deployment of malicious code, potential for widespread system compromise across environments using images from this registry.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Authorization Configuration:**  Carefully configure `distribution/distribution`'s authorization settings, ensuring robust and granular access control lists (ACLs) are in place.
    *   **Regular Authorization Audits:** Periodically audit `distribution/distribution` authorization configurations to identify and rectify any misconfigurations or overly permissive rules.
    *   **Leverage RBAC Features:** Utilize `distribution/distribution`'s Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) capabilities to define and enforce least privilege for image pushing, limiting push access to only necessary users or services.
    *   **Thorough Testing of Authorization:**  Implement comprehensive testing of authorization rules to ensure they function as intended and prevent unauthorized push operations.

## Attack Surface: [Image Layer Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/image_layer_poisoning.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious content into container image layers stored and served by `distribution/distribution`. When these images are pulled and run, the malicious layers execute, compromising the container and potentially the host.
*   **Distribution Contribution:** `distribution/distribution` is responsible for storing, retrieving, and serving image layers. Vulnerabilities in how `distribution/distribution` handles, validates, or processes image layers can be exploited for poisoning.
*   **Example:** An attacker, exploiting an authorization bypass or vulnerability in `distribution/distribution`, pushes a malicious image layer containing a reverse shell. When a developer pulls and runs this seemingly legitimate image from the registry, the malicious layer executes.
*   **Impact:** Container compromise, potential host system compromise, supply chain compromise, widespread impact if poisoned images are widely used.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Image Scanning Integration:** Integrate automated image vulnerability scanning directly into the `distribution/distribution` workflow, preventing vulnerable images from being pushed or flagged before being pulled.
    *   **Content Trust Enforcement:** Implement and enforce image signing and verification mechanisms (like Docker Content Trust/Notary) within `distribution/distribution` to ensure image integrity and provenance are validated during pull operations.
    *   **Layer Validation and Sanitization (if feasible):** Explore if `distribution/distribution` or extensions can be configured to perform any level of validation or sanitization on image layers during push to detect potentially malicious content (though this is complex and resource-intensive).
    *   **Regular Security Updates for Distribution:** Keep `distribution/distribution` updated to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities in layer handling or processing.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities within Distribution](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_within_distribution.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries and dependencies used by `distribution/distribution` itself can be exploited to compromise the registry service.
*   **Distribution Contribution:** `distribution/distribution` relies on numerous Go libraries. Security flaws in these dependencies directly impact the security posture of the `distribution/distribution` service.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a Go library used by `distribution/distribution` for HTTP request parsing or image manifest handling. An attacker crafts a malicious request that exploits this dependency vulnerability to gain remote code execution on the `distribution/distribution` server.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the `distribution/distribution` registry service, potential data breaches (registry metadata, configuration), service disruption, and the ability to manipulate the entire image repository.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning and Monitoring:** Implement automated tools to continuously scan `distribution/distribution`'s dependencies for known vulnerabilities and monitor for new disclosures.
    *   **Proactive Dependency Updates:** Establish a process for promptly updating `distribution/distribution`'s dependencies to patched versions as soon as security updates are released.
    *   **Vulnerability Management Program:** Integrate `distribution/distribution` dependency vulnerability management into a broader organizational vulnerability management program.
    *   **Security Hardening of Deployment Environment:**  Harden the operating system and environment where `distribution/distribution` is deployed to limit the impact of a dependency vulnerability exploitation (e.g., using minimal base images, disabling unnecessary services).
