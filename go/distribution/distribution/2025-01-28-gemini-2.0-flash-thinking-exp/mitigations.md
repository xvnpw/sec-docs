# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for distribution/distribution

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Distribution Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_distribution_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Subscribe to the official Docker Distribution security mailing list and monitor release notes on the GitHub repository.
    2.  Establish a dedicated testing environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.
    3.  Upon release of a new stable version of Docker Distribution, download the latest release artifacts.
    4.  Deploy the updated Distribution version in the testing environment.
    5.  Conduct thorough testing in the testing environment, including functional, performance, and security testing.
    6.  If testing is successful and no regressions are identified, schedule a maintenance window for production deployment.
    7.  Before production update, create a backup of the current production Distribution configuration and data.
    8.  Deploy the updated Distribution version to the production environment during the scheduled maintenance window.
    9.  Monitor the production environment closely after the update to ensure stability and performance, and to verify the update was successful.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated Distribution versions to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or compromise stored images and metadata.
*   **Impact:** High. Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities by patching them promptly.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have a testing environment, but the update process is manual and not consistently followed.
    *   Location: Testing environment exists, but update process documentation is incomplete.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated update process.
    *   Formal schedule for updates.
    *   Clear documentation of the update procedure.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Token Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/implement_token_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure Docker Distribution to use token authentication instead of basic authentication.
    2.  Set up a token service (can be integrated with existing identity providers or a dedicated service) that issues tokens for registry access.
    3.  Configure token expiration times to limit the validity of tokens and reduce the window of opportunity for compromised tokens.
    4.  Implement token rotation policies to regularly refresh tokens and further minimize the risk of long-term token compromise.
    5.  Ensure all clients (Docker daemons, CI/CD systems, users) are configured to authenticate using tokens when interacting with the registry.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Credential Compromise (High Severity): Basic authentication credentials, if compromised, can provide persistent access to the registry. Token authentication with short expiration and rotation limits the impact of compromised credentials.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity): Token authentication, especially with rate limiting, is more resistant to brute-force attacks compared to basic authentication.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High. Significantly improves authentication security compared to basic authentication, reducing the risk of credential-based attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We are using token authentication for some automated systems, but basic authentication is still enabled for some user access.
    *   Location: Token authentication configured for CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enforcing token authentication exclusively for all access.
    *   Disabling basic authentication entirely.
    *   Implementation of token rotation policies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Namespaces](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac__with_namespaces.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define clear roles and permissions for registry access based on the principle of least privilege. Examples: `image-puller`, `image-pusher`, `registry-admin`.
    2.  Utilize Distribution's authorization mechanisms to implement RBAC, mapping roles to users or groups.
    3.  Leverage namespaces within the registry to logically separate images and apply granular access control at the namespace level.
    4.  Assign roles to users and services based on their required access to specific namespaces or operations.
    5.  Regularly review and update RBAC policies to ensure they remain aligned with organizational needs and security best practices.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity): Without RBAC, users or services might have overly broad access to the registry, potentially leading to unauthorized image pulls, pushes, or administrative actions.
    *   Lateral Movement (Medium Severity): In case of compromise, overly permissive access can facilitate lateral movement within the registry and potentially to other systems.
    *   Data Breaches (Medium Severity): Unauthorized image pulls could lead to exposure of sensitive data contained within container images.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High. Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized actions and data breaches by enforcing granular access control.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have namespaces defined, but RBAC is not fully enforced, and access control is still somewhat broad.
    *   Location: Namespaces are used for image organization.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal definition of roles and permissions.
    *   Enforcement of RBAC policies across all namespaces.
    *   Integration with an identity provider for centralized role management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Docker Content Trust (DCT)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_docker_content_trust__dct_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Enable Docker Content Trust on both the registry server and client side (Docker daemons).
    2.  Generate and securely manage signing keys for image publishers.
    3.  Train developers and CI/CD pipelines to sign images during the push process using their private signing keys.
    4.  Configure Docker clients to enforce content trust verification during image pull operations. Clients will only pull signed images and verify their signatures against trusted keys.
    5.  Establish a process for key management, including key rotation and revocation in case of compromise.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Image Tampering (High Severity): Without content trust, malicious actors could potentially tamper with images in transit or at rest, injecting malware or vulnerabilities.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity): DCT helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks where attackers could intercept and replace images during pull operations.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity): DCT enhances supply chain security by verifying the integrity and origin of images, reducing the risk of using compromised images from untrusted sources.
*   **Impact:** High. Significantly reduces the risk of using tampered or malicious images, enhancing image integrity and supply chain security.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Docker Content Trust is not currently enabled in our registry setup.
    *   Location: N/A
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enabling DCT on the registry server.
    *   Enabling DCT on Docker clients.
    *   Key generation and secure key management process.
    *   Integration of image signing into CI/CD pipelines.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_hardening.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Review the default `config.yml` file and remove or disable any unnecessary features, modules, or storage drivers that are not required for your specific use case.
    2.  Restrict access to the `config.yml` file and other sensitive configuration files to only authorized administrators using file system permissions.
    3.  Disable insecure protocols and cipher suites in the Distribution configuration, ensuring only TLS 1.2 or higher and strong ciphers are used for HTTPS.
    4.  Regularly review the Distribution configuration for any misconfigurations or deviations from security best practices.
    5.  Consult official Docker Distribution security hardening guides and apply relevant recommendations to your configuration.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Misconfigurations (Medium to High Severity): Weak or default configurations can expose vulnerabilities and increase the attack surface of the registry.
    *   Unauthorized Access (Medium Severity): Misconfigured access controls or exposed management interfaces can lead to unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Medium. Reduces the attack surface and mitigates risks associated with misconfigurations.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic configuration is done, but a formal hardening review has not been performed.
    *   Location: Initial configuration in `config.yml`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal security hardening review of `config.yml`.
    *   Implementation of specific hardening recommendations.
    *   Regular configuration review process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting on Registry API](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_on_registry_api.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure rate limiting on the Docker Distribution API endpoints, especially for authentication, pull, and push operations, within the `config.yml` file.
    2.  Define appropriate rate limits based on expected usage patterns and resource capacity directly in the Distribution configuration. Start with conservative limits and adjust as needed based on monitoring.
    3.  Implement different rate limits for different user roles or client types if necessary using Distribution's rate limiting features.
    4.  Monitor rate limiting metrics exposed by Distribution to detect potential DoS attacks or unusual traffic patterns.
    5.  Provide informative error messages to clients when rate limits are exceeded, guiding them on how to retry or adjust their behavior, which can be customized in Distribution.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity): Without rate limiting, attackers can overwhelm the registry API with excessive requests, causing denial of service and impacting application deployments.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity): Rate limiting can slow down brute-force attacks against authentication endpoints, making them less effective.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High. Protects the registry from DoS attacks and improves availability by preventing resource exhaustion.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Rate limiting is not currently configured on our registry API.
    *   Location: N/A
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Configuration of rate limiting in the Distribution configuration (`config.yml`).
    *   Monitoring of rate limiting metrics.
    *   Testing of rate limiting effectiveness.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Logging](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_logging.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure Docker Distribution to generate detailed logs by adjusting the logging settings in `config.yml`. Include authentication events, authorization decisions, API requests, errors, and audit trails.
    2.  Configure Distribution to output logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON) for easier parsing and analysis by logging systems.
    3.  Ensure logs include sufficient detail for security auditing and incident investigation, adjusting log levels as needed in the Distribution configuration.
    4.  Regularly review Distribution logs for suspicious activities and security events.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Security Incident Detection (High Severity): Comprehensive logging is crucial for detecting security incidents and breaches in a timely manner.
    *   Unauthorized Access Detection (Medium Severity): Monitoring logs for failed authentication or authorization attempts can help identify and respond to unauthorized access attempts.
    *   Auditing and Compliance (Medium Severity): Logs provide an audit trail of registry activities, which is essential for security audits and compliance requirements.
*   **Impact:** High. Enables timely detection and response to security incidents, improves security visibility, and supports auditing and compliance.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Logging is enabled, but the level of detail and format might need improvement for effective security monitoring.
    *   Location: Distribution logs are written to local files.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Configuration of detailed and structured logging in `config.yml`.
    *   Formal log review process for security events.
