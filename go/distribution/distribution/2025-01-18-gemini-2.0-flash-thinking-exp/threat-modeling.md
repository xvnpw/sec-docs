# Threat Model Analysis for distribution/distribution

## Threat: [Malicious Image Push (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/malicious_image_push__supply_chain_attack_.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Image Push (Supply Chain Attack)
    * **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to push images to the registry and uploads a compromised image containing malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities. This could be achieved by compromising registry credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities in the push API of `distribution/distribution`.
    * **Impact:** Applications pulling this malicious image will be compromised, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or unauthorized access to the application's environment.
    * **Affected Component:** `registry/handlers/app.PushImage`, `registry/api/v2/manifest`
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for pushing images within `distribution/distribution`.
        * Utilize Docker Content Trust (image signing and verification) supported by `distribution/distribution`.
        * Regularly scan pushed images for vulnerabilities using tools integrated with or operating on the registry.
        * Enforce a secure image build pipeline with integrity checks before pushing to `distribution/distribution`.
        * Implement access controls based on the principle of least privilege within `distribution/distribution`.

## Threat: [Credential Compromise (Push/Pull)](./threats/credential_compromise__pushpull_.md)

* **Threat:** Credential Compromise (Push/Pull)
    * **Description:** An attacker obtains valid credentials for accessing the `distribution/distribution` registry (e.g., through phishing, brute-force, or leaked credentials). This allows them to perform actions authorized for that user, including pushing or pulling images.
    * **Impact:** If push credentials are compromised, attackers can inject malicious images. If pull credentials are compromised, attackers can gain access to proprietary images or potentially launch further attacks based on the image contents.
    * **Affected Component:** `auth/handlers`, `auth/token`
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (for push credentials), High (for pull credentials)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for `distribution/distribution` users.
        * Regularly rotate credentials used to access `distribution/distribution`.
        * Securely store and manage credentials used by `distribution/distribution` (e.g., using a secrets manager).
        * Monitor for suspicious login attempts to `distribution/distribution`.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Image Deletion](./threats/unauthorized_image_deletion.md)

* **Threat:** Unauthorized Image Deletion
    * **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges within `distribution/distribution` (or by exploiting an authorization vulnerability) deletes images from the registry.
    * **Impact:** Loss of critical application images, leading to deployment failures and service disruption.
    * **Affected Component:** `registry/handlers/app.DeleteImage`, `registry/api/v2/manifest`
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement granular role-based access control (RBAC) within `distribution/distribution` with the principle of least privilege.
        * Audit all deletion operations performed on `distribution/distribution`.
        * Implement image backups or replication strategies outside of `distribution/distribution`.
        * Require confirmation for deletion operations within `distribution/distribution`.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion
    * **Description:** An attacker floods the `distribution/distribution` registry with requests (e.g., image pulls, manifest requests) to exhaust its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
    * **Impact:** The registry becomes unavailable, preventing legitimate users from pulling or pushing images, leading to deployment failures and service disruption.
    * **Affected Component:** Various components within `distribution/distribution`, particularly `registry/handlers/app` and the underlying storage backend accessed by it.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rate limiting and request throttling within `distribution/distribution`.
        * Ensure sufficient resources are allocated to the `distribution/distribution` deployment.
        * Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for image pulls to reduce load on `distribution/distribution`.
        * Implement load balancing for `distribution/distribution` instances.
        * Monitor `distribution/distribution` resource usage and performance.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `distribution/distribution`](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__distributiondistribution_.md)

* **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `distribution/distribution`
    * **Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the `distribution/distribution` codebase itself. This could lead to unauthorized access, code execution on the registry server, or denial of service.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the registry, potentially affecting all hosted images and users.
    * **Affected Component:** Various components within `distribution/distribution` depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Stay up-to-date with the latest releases and security patches for `distribution/distribution`.
        * Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to `distribution/distribution`.
        * Regularly scan the `distribution/distribution` deployment for vulnerabilities.
        * Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect the `distribution/distribution` endpoints.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration Leading to Exposure](./threats/misconfiguration_leading_to_exposure.md)

* **Threat:** Misconfiguration Leading to Exposure
    * **Description:** Incorrect configuration of the `distribution/distribution` registry exposes it to security risks. This could include weak authentication settings, insecure storage backend configurations managed by `distribution/distribution`, or allowing anonymous access.
    * **Impact:** Increased risk of unauthorized access, information disclosure, or other threats outlined above.
    * **Affected Component:** `configuration` components within `distribution/distribution`, various modules depending on the misconfiguration.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Follow security best practices for configuring `distribution/distribution`.
        * Regularly review and audit the `distribution/distribution` configuration.
        * Use infrastructure-as-code to manage and version the `distribution/distribution` configuration.
        * Implement security hardening measures for the underlying operating system and infrastructure hosting `distribution/distribution`.
