## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using distribution/distribution [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_distributiondistribution__critical_.md)

*   **Compromise Application Using `distribution/distribution` [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and is inherently critical. Success at this level means the application's security has been breached through the container registry.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR: Inject Malicious Image [HIGH-RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/or_inject_malicious_image__high-risk___critical_.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Image [HIGH-RISK] [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This is a primary and high-risk attack vector. The attacker's goal is to introduce a container image containing malicious code into the registry, which will then be pulled and executed by the application.

    *   **AND: Compromise Developer/CI Credentials [CRITICAL]:**
        *   This is a critical node because gaining access to legitimate developer or CI/CD system credentials allows the attacker to bypass normal authentication and authorization controls, enabling them to push malicious images as if they were authorized users.
            *   **Action: Phishing attack on developer [HIGH-RISK]:**  Attackers use deceptive emails or messages to trick developers into revealing their credentials. This is a common and relatively easy attack to execute with potentially critical impact.
            *   **Action: Exploit vulnerability in CI/CD pipeline [HIGH-RISK]:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., insecure configurations, vulnerable dependencies) to gain access and inject malicious code into the image building process. This can lead to automated deployment of compromised images.

    *   **AND: Exploit Registry Vulnerability to Push Malicious Image [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   This high-risk path involves directly exploiting vulnerabilities within the `distribution/distribution` registry software to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms and push malicious images without legitimate credentials.
            *   **Action: Exploit authentication bypass vulnerability [HIGH-RISK]:** Attackers exploit flaws in the registry's authentication logic to gain access without providing valid credentials.
            *   **Action: Exploit authorization flaw allowing unauthorized push [HIGH-RISK]:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the registry's authorization rules to push images to repositories they should not have access to.
            *   **Action: Exploit API vulnerability to manipulate image layers [HIGH-RISK]:** Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in the registry's API to directly modify image layers, injecting malicious code into existing or new images.

    *   **AND: Supply Chain Attack via Base Image [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   This high-risk path involves compromising a commonly used base image and pushing the malicious version to the registry. Applications that rely on this base image will then inherit the malicious code.
            *   **Action: Inject malicious code into a commonly used base image and push it to the registry. [HIGH-RISK]:** Attackers gain access to the source or build process of a base image and inject malicious code before pushing it to the registry.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR: Exploit Registry API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/or_exploit_registry_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Exploit Registry API Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **AND: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Registry Server [CRITICAL]:**
        *   This is a critical node because gaining remote code execution on the registry server grants the attacker full control over the registry infrastructure.
            *   **Action: Exploit vulnerabilities in the registry's API handling or underlying infrastructure to execute arbitrary code on the server. [HIGH-RISK]:** Attackers exploit flaws in how the registry's API processes requests or vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or libraries to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This is a high-risk action due to the critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR: Exploit Content Trust Weaknesses (If Enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/or_exploit_content_trust_weaknesses__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Exploit Content Trust Weaknesses (If Enabled):**
    *   **AND: Compromise Signing Keys [CRITICAL]:**
        *   This is a critical node if content trust is enabled. Compromising the private keys used to sign images allows attackers to sign malicious images, making them appear trusted and bypassing the intended security mechanism.
            *   **Action: Steal or compromise the private keys used for signing images. [HIGH-RISK]:** Attackers target the storage and management of the private keys used for signing container images. If successful, they can forge signatures and push malicious images that appear legitimate. This is a high-risk action due to the critical impact on the trust mechanism.
