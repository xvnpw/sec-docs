# Attack Surface Analysis for distribution/distribution

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the registry's authentication or authorization mechanisms allow unauthorized access to private repositories.

**How Distribution Contributes:** `distribution/distribution` handles user authentication (often delegated to an external service) and enforces authorization policies for accessing repositories and performing actions.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the token validation process or a misconfiguration in the authorization rules to gain access to private images they shouldn't be able to see or modify.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive container images, potential for malicious image injection, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
* Regularly review and audit authentication and authorization configurations.
* Keep the `distribution/distribution` version up-to-date to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* Enforce the principle of least privilege when granting access to repositories.

## Attack Surface: [API Rate Limiting and Denial of Service](./attack_surfaces/api_rate_limiting_and_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:**  Lack of proper rate limiting on the registry's API endpoints allows attackers to overwhelm the service with requests, leading to denial of service.

**How Distribution Contributes:** `distribution/distribution` exposes various API endpoints for image management, and its implementation determines how these requests are handled and if rate limiting is enforced.

**Example:** An attacker floods the `/v2/<name>/manifests/<reference>` endpoint with requests for numerous or non-existent image manifests, causing the registry to become unresponsive.

**Impact:**  Inability for legitimate users to pull or push images, disruption of CI/CD pipelines.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure and enable rate limiting on the registry's API endpoints.
* Implement network-level rate limiting or traffic shaping.
* Monitor API request patterns for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Manifest Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/manifest_manipulation.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the manifest handling logic allow attackers to modify image manifests, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code.

**How Distribution Contributes:** `distribution/distribution` is responsible for parsing, validating, and storing image manifests, which describe the layers of a container image.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious manifest that, when pulled and used by a container runtime, executes arbitrary commands on the host system.

**Impact:** Container escape, host compromise, supply chain attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `distribution/distribution` version up-to-date to patch known manifest parsing vulnerabilities.
* Implement content trust (image signing and verification) to ensure the integrity of images.
* Use container runtime security features to limit the capabilities of containers.

## Attack Surface: [Blob Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/blob_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Issues in the blob upload process allow attackers to upload excessively large or malicious blobs, potentially leading to storage exhaustion or other resource exhaustion attacks.

**How Distribution Contributes:** `distribution/distribution` handles the process of uploading image layers (blobs) to the storage backend.

**Example:** An attacker uploads numerous very large, but ultimately useless, image layers, filling up the registry's storage and preventing legitimate users from pushing new images.

**Impact:** Storage exhaustion, denial of service, increased storage costs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement size limits on individual blob uploads.
* Implement overall storage quotas for the registry.
* Monitor storage usage and alert on unusual spikes.
* Regularly perform garbage collection to remove unused blobs.

## Attack Surface: [Content Trust Vulnerabilities (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/content_trust_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:**  If content trust is enabled, vulnerabilities in the signature verification process could allow attackers to push unsigned or maliciously signed images that are incorrectly trusted.

**How Distribution Contributes:** `distribution/distribution` implements the Notary integration for content trust, handling signature verification and trust management.

**Example:** An attacker compromises the signing keys or exploits a flaw in the signature verification logic to push a malicious image that appears to be signed and trusted.

**Impact:** Distribution of compromised images, supply chain attacks, execution of malicious code.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Securely manage and protect signing keys.
* Regularly rotate signing keys.
* Keep the `distribution/distribution` and Notary components up-to-date.
* Enforce mandatory content trust verification for all image pulls.
