# Attack Tree Analysis for distribution/distribution

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized control over applications utilizing the `distribution/distribution` Docker registry by exploiting vulnerabilities within the registry itself, leading to the ability to execute arbitrary code within the application's environment or manipulate the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Registry Software Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_registry_software_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   This represents the fundamental risk of the registry software itself containing exploitable flaws. Successful exploitation grants significant control over the registry's operations and data.
    *   **Exploit Known CVEs ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
        *   Attack Vector: Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in the `distribution/distribution` software or its dependencies. They use existing exploits or develop their own to target these known weaknesses.
        *   Impact: Can lead to remote code execution on the registry server, data breaches (accessing stored images or metadata), or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication and Authorization [CRITICAL] ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication_and_authorization__critical__high-risk_path.md)

*   This category encompasses attacks that circumvent the security mechanisms designed to control access to the registry. Success allows unauthorized actions.
    *   **Exploit Weak Authentication Mechanisms ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
        *   Attack Vector: Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the registry verifies user identities.
        *   Impact: Gains unauthorized access to user accounts and their associated privileges.
            *   **Exploit Default Credentials ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
                *   Attack Vector: Attackers use well-known default usernames and passwords that were not changed after deployment.
                *   Impact: Immediate and complete access to the registry with administrative privileges.
    *   **Exploit Authorization Flaws ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
        *   Attack Vector: Attackers exploit flaws in how the registry determines what actions a user is permitted to perform after successful authentication.
        *   Impact: Allows users to perform actions beyond their intended privileges, potentially gaining administrative control or manipulating sensitive data.
            *   **Insecure API Key Management ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
                *   Attack Vector: Attackers obtain valid API keys through insecure storage, transmission, or accidental exposure.
                *   Impact: Allows attackers to authenticate and perform actions associated with the compromised API key, potentially including pushing or pulling images, or managing repositories.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Images and Tags [CRITICAL] ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_images_and_tags__critical__high-risk_path.md)

*   This involves attacks that directly target the core function of the registry: storing and managing container images.
    *   **Push Malicious Images ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
        *   Attack Vector: Attackers with sufficient (or bypassed) permissions push container images containing malicious code or vulnerabilities.
        *   Impact: Applications pulling these images will execute the malicious code, leading to compromise of the application environment.
            *   **Overwrite Existing Tags with Malicious Images ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
                *   Attack Vector: Attackers overwrite the tag of a legitimate, trusted image with a pointer to their malicious image.
                *   Impact: When applications pull the image using the expected tag, they unknowingly retrieve and run the malicious version.
    *   **Tamper with Image Manifests ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
        *   Attack Vector: Attackers modify the image manifest, which describes the image's layers and configuration.
        *   Impact: Can alter how the container runs, potentially executing malicious commands or injecting vulnerabilities.
            *   **Modify Image Configuration (e.g., entrypoint, environment variables) ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
                *   Attack Vector: Attackers alter the manifest to change the container's entrypoint or environment variables to execute malicious code upon container startup.
                *   Impact: Direct code execution within the container when it is launched by an application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Distribution Dependencies [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_distribution_dependencies__critical_.md)

*   This involves compromising the registry indirectly by targeting the software it relies upon.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
        *   Attack Vector: Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries used by `distribution/distribution`.
        *   Impact: Can lead to various forms of compromise, depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service affecting the registry itself.
