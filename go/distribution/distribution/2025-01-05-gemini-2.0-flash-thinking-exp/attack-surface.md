# Attack Surface Analysis for distribution/distribution

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Push via Registry API](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_push_via_registry_api.md)

**Description:** Attackers push crafted container images containing malware, exploits, or backdoors to the registry.

**How Distribution Contributes:** `distribution/distribution` provides the API endpoints and mechanisms for pushing and storing container images. If not properly secured, it becomes the entry point for malicious images.

**Example:** An attacker pushes an image with a compromised `bash` binary that allows remote code execution on any system pulling and running that image.

**Impact:** Compromise of systems pulling and running the malicious image, potential data breaches, and supply chain attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Content Trust/Image Signing:** Implement and enforce image signing and verification using technologies like Docker Content Trust (Notary).
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate vulnerability scanning tools to automatically analyze pushed images for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Access Control:** Implement strong authentication and authorization to restrict who can push images to the registry.
*   **Image Layer Analysis:** Employ tools to inspect image layers for suspicious content or unexpected changes.

## Attack Surface: [Manifest Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/manifest_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how `distribution/distribution` parses or handles image manifests to inject malicious content or cause registry instability.

**How Distribution Contributes:** `distribution/distribution` is responsible for interpreting and storing image manifests, which define the layers and configuration of an image. Parsing flaws can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a manifest with an excessively large number of layers or with malformed fields that cause the registry to crash or consume excessive resources.

**Impact:** Denial of service, registry instability, potential for injecting malicious content that is executed when the image is pulled.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep `distribution/distribution` updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches related to manifest parsing.
*   **Strict Schema Validation:** Ensure robust validation of manifest schemas to reject malformed or suspicious manifests.
*   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits to prevent a single manifest from consuming excessive resources during processing.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** Attackers bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to push, pull, or delete images.

**How Distribution Contributes:** `distribution/distribution` implements the authentication and authorization framework for accessing the registry. Weaknesses in this implementation are direct vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the token verification process or finds a default credential that allows them to bypass authentication and pull private images.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to private images, potential for data breaches, ability to inject malicious images, and disruption of service through unauthorized deletion.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strong Authentication:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect instead of basic authentication.
*   **Robust Authorization:** Configure fine-grained authorization policies to control access to specific repositories and actions.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the authentication and authorization configuration.
*   **Credential Management:** Enforce strong password policies and secure storage of credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Storage Backend Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/storage_backend_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying storage backend used by `distribution/distribution` to store image layers and metadata.

**How Distribution Contributes:** `distribution/distribution` interacts with the storage backend. Vulnerabilities in this interaction or misconfigurations can expose the storage layer.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the S3 storage backend configuration, allowing them to directly access and modify image layers without going through the registry API.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access to image data, potential for data breaches, and denial of service by manipulating storage resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Storage Configuration:** Properly configure the storage backend with strong access controls, encryption at rest, and network segmentation.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant `distribution/distribution` only the necessary permissions to access the storage backend.
*   **Storage Security Best Practices:** Follow security best practices for the chosen storage backend.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit the storage backend configuration and access controls regularly.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the Go libraries or other dependencies used by `distribution/distribution`.

**How Distribution Contributes:** `distribution/distribution` relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries become indirect vulnerabilities of the registry.

**Example:** A vulnerability in a specific version of a Go library used for HTTP handling is exploited to perform a remote code execution on the registry server.

**Impact:** Potential for complete compromise of the registry server, data breaches, and service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep `distribution/distribution` and its dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Vendor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for the Go language and relevant libraries.
