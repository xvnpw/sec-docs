# Threat Model Analysis for distribution/distribution

## Threat: [Malicious Image Push](./threats/malicious_image_push.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Image Push
    *   **Description:** An attacker with push access could push a container image containing malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities. This could be done by compromising legitimate credentials or exploiting authorization flaws *within the registry*. The malicious image could then be inadvertently pulled and run by users or systems, leading to compromise.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, data breaches, denial of service on systems running the malicious container, supply chain contamination.
    *   **Affected Component:** `registry/handlers/app.go` (handling image push requests), `registry/storage` (storing image layers and manifests).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms *within the registry* with granular access control.
        *   Regularly scan pushed images for vulnerabilities using automated tools *integrated with the registry workflow*.
        *   Implement content trust using Docker Content Trust (Notary) to verify image publishers.
        *   Employ image signing and verification processes.
        *   Limit push access to trusted users and automated systems.

## Threat: [Image Tag Manipulation / Tag Replay Attack](./threats/image_tag_manipulation__tag_replay_attack.md)

**Threat:** Image Tag Manipulation / Tag Replay Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges *within the registry* could manipulate image tags to point to older, vulnerable versions of an image or to entirely different, malicious images. Users pulling images using these manipulated tags would unknowingly deploy compromised containers.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of vulnerable applications, potential for exploitation of known vulnerabilities, execution of malicious code.
    *   **Affected Component:** `registry/handlers/app.go` (handling tag creation and update requests), `registry/storage` (storing tag to manifest mappings).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls for tag manipulation *within the registry*.
        *   Consider immutable tags or a policy of not overwriting tags.
        *   Implement auditing of tag changes *within the registry*.
        *   Encourage users to pull images by digest instead of tags for greater immutability.

## Threat: [Manifest Poisoning](./threats/manifest_poisoning.md)

**Threat:** Manifest Poisoning
    *   **Description:** An attacker could modify the image manifest *within the registry* to alter metadata like labels, environment variables, or the entry point of an image. This could lead to unexpected behavior or compromise when the image is run, even if the image layers themselves are not malicious.
    *   **Impact:** Misconfiguration of deployed containers, potential for remote code execution if the entry point is maliciously altered, information disclosure through manipulated environment variables.
    *   **Affected Component:** `registry/handlers/app.go` (handling manifest push and update requests), `registry/storage` (storing image manifests).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls for manifest manipulation *within the registry*.
        *   Utilize content trust mechanisms to ensure manifest integrity.
        *   Implement auditing of manifest changes *within the registry*.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Image Pull / Information Disclosure](./threats/unauthorized_image_pull__information_disclosure.md)

**Threat:** Unauthorized Image Pull / Information Disclosure
    *   **Description:** An attacker without proper authorization *within the registry* could gain access to and pull container images. This could expose proprietary code, intellectual property, or sensitive configuration data embedded within the images.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive information, potential reverse engineering of applications, exposure of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** `registry/handlers/app.go` (handling image pull requests), `registry/auth` (handling authorization checks).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms *within the registry*.
        *   Enforce granular access control policies based on users, teams, or namespaces *within the registry configuration*.
        *   Regularly review and audit access control configurations.
        *   Consider using private registries with strong access controls.

## Threat: [Credential Compromise leading to Registry Access](./threats/credential_compromise_leading_to_registry_access.md)

**Threat:** Credential Compromise leading to Registry Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the credentials of a user with access to the registry. This could be achieved through phishing, brute-force attacks, or exploiting vulnerabilities in related systems *that provide authentication to the registry*. With compromised credentials, the attacker could perform unauthorized actions like pushing malicious images, deleting repositories, or changing access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, deployment of malicious containers, service disruption, unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Affected Component:** `registry/auth` (handling authentication), potentially all other components depending on the compromised user's permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies *for registry users*.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) *for registry access*.
        *   Regularly review and revoke unnecessary user permissions *within the registry*.
        *   Monitor for suspicious login activity *to the registry*.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `distribution/distribution`](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__distributiondistribution_.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `distribution/distribution`
    *   **Description:** The `distribution/distribution` project itself may contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code on the registry server, or cause a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the registry server, data breaches, service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `distribution/distribution` binary updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories for the project.
        *   Implement a vulnerability management process for the registry infrastructure.
