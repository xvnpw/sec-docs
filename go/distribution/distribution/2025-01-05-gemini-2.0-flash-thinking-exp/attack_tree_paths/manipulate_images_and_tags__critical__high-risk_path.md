## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Manipulate Images and Tags [CRITICAL]

This analysis delves into the "Manipulate Images and Tags" path within the attack tree for an application utilizing the `distribution/distribution` container registry. This path is marked as **CRITICAL** and a **HIGH-RISK PATH**, highlighting its significant potential for causing severe damage. We will break down each sub-path, analyzing the attack vectors, potential impacts, likelihood, and suggesting mitigation and detection strategies.

**OVERARCHING CONTEXT:**

The core function of a container registry like `distribution/distribution` is to securely store and distribute container images. Attacks targeting the manipulation of images and tags directly undermine this core function, potentially leading to widespread compromise of applications relying on the registry. The trust placed in the registry as a source of truth for container images makes these attacks particularly dangerous.

**DETAILED ANALYSIS OF SUB-PATHS:**

**1. Push Malicious Images [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* **Description:** This attack vector relies on attackers gaining the ability to push images to the registry. This could be through compromised credentials, misconfigured access controls, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the registry's authentication/authorization mechanisms.

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Compromised Credentials:** Attackers obtain valid credentials of a user or service account with push permissions.
    * **Exploiting Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Vulnerabilities in the registry software itself could allow unauthorized pushing of images.
    * **Internal Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate push access abuses their privileges.
    * **Supply Chain Attack:** A compromised build pipeline or a trusted upstream image source introduces malicious content.

* **Impact:**
    * **Direct Code Execution:** Applications pulling these malicious images will execute the embedded malicious code upon container startup, leading to system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    * **Backdoors and Persistence:** Malicious images can contain backdoors allowing attackers persistent access to the application environment.
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious code can be designed to steal sensitive data from the environment where the container is running.
    * **Resource Hijacking:** Malicious containers could be used for cryptocurrency mining or other resource-intensive activities.

* **Likelihood:**  Medium to High, depending on the security posture of the registry and the surrounding infrastructure. Weak access controls or compromised credentials are common attack vectors.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement granular permissions, limiting push access to only authorized users and services. Regularly review and audit these permissions.
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users with push permissions. Ensure strong password policies and regularly rotate credentials.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning (Pre-Push):** Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into the image push process. Reject images with critical vulnerabilities.
    * **Content Trust (Image Signing and Verification):**  Utilize Docker Content Trust or similar mechanisms to cryptographically sign images and verify their integrity upon pull. This ensures the image hasn't been tampered with since it was signed by a trusted entity.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the registry within a secure network segment to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the registry configuration, access controls, and underlying infrastructure.
    * **Supply Chain Security:** Implement measures to secure the build pipeline and verify the integrity of base images and dependencies.

* **Detection Methods:**
    * **Monitoring Push Events:** Log and monitor all image push events, including the user/service account, image name, and tags. Alert on unexpected or unauthorized push attempts.
    * **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual patterns in image pushes, such as pushes from unfamiliar sources or during off-hours.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning (Post-Push):** Regularly scan images within the registry for vulnerabilities, even after they have been pushed.
    * **Runtime Security:** Employ runtime security tools that can detect malicious behavior within running containers.

**1.1. Overwrite Existing Tags with Malicious Images [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* **Description:** This is a particularly insidious attack where attackers leverage their ability to push images to overwrite the tag of a legitimate, trusted image with a pointer to their malicious version.

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Compromised Credentials with Overwrite Permissions:** Attackers gain access to an account with the necessary permissions to overwrite existing tags.
    * **Race Conditions or API Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the registry's API or internal processes could allow overwriting tags without proper authorization.

* **Impact:**
    * **Silent Compromise:** Applications pulling the image using the expected tag will unknowingly retrieve and run the malicious version. This can happen without any immediate indication of an attack.
    * **Widespread Impact:** If a widely used base image or application image is targeted, the impact can be significant, affecting numerous deployments.
    * **Trust Erosion:** This attack directly undermines the trust in the registry as a reliable source of images.

* **Likelihood:** Medium, as it requires specific permissions and knowledge of existing tags. However, the potential impact makes it a high-priority threat.

* **Mitigation Strategies (In addition to those for "Push Malicious Images"):**
    * **Immutable Tags:**  Implement policies or registry configurations that prevent overwriting existing tags. This can be achieved through features like tag immutability or by using content digests instead of mutable tags.
    * **Stricter Access Controls for Tag Manipulation:**  Implement finer-grained access controls specifically for tag operations, limiting overwrite permissions to a very small set of highly trusted accounts or automated processes.
    * **Auditing Tag Operations:**  Thoroughly audit all tag creation, modification, and deletion events.
    * **Alerting on Tag Overwrites:** Implement real-time alerts whenever an existing tag is overwritten. Investigate these alerts immediately.

* **Detection Methods:**
    * **Monitoring Tag Updates:**  Actively monitor tag updates and compare the image digest associated with the tag before and after the update. Alert on any changes to the digest of a previously known good tag.
    * **Regular Integrity Checks:** Periodically verify the integrity of images associated with critical tags.

**2. Tamper with Image Manifests [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* **Description:** The image manifest is a JSON file that describes the layers and configuration of a container image. Modifying this manifest can alter how the container runs without necessarily changing the underlying image layers.

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Compromised Credentials with Manifest Manipulation Permissions:** Attackers gain access to accounts with the ability to modify image manifests.
    * **API Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the registry's API could allow unauthorized modification of manifests.

* **Impact:**
    * **Subtle and Difficult to Detect:** Manifest modifications might not be immediately apparent, making them harder to detect than replacing entire images.
    * **Circumventing Security Controls:** Attackers could modify the manifest to disable security features or bypass access controls within the container.
    * **Introducing Vulnerabilities:**  Manifest changes can introduce vulnerabilities by altering the container's configuration or dependencies.

* **Likelihood:** Medium, requiring specific permissions and knowledge of the manifest structure.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strictest Access Controls for Manifest Operations:** Implement very restrictive access controls for modifying image manifests.
    * **Content Trust (Manifest Signing and Verification):**  Similar to image signing, signing the manifest ensures its integrity and prevents unauthorized modifications.
    * **Immutable Manifests:**  Where possible, implement mechanisms to prevent modifications to existing manifests.
    * **Regular Integrity Checks:** Periodically verify the integrity of image manifests against a known good state.

* **Detection Methods:**
    * **Monitoring Manifest Changes:** Log and monitor all manifest modification events, including the user/service account, image name, and the specific changes made.
    * **Baseline Manifests:** Establish baseline manifests for critical images and alert on any deviations.
    * **Integrity Checks:** Regularly compute and compare the checksum or hash of image manifests.

**2.1. Modify Image Configuration (e.g., entrypoint, environment variables) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* **Description:** This is a specific type of manifest tampering where attackers alter the container's configuration, such as the entrypoint (the command executed when the container starts) or environment variables.

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Compromised Credentials with Manifest Write Access:** Attackers gain access to accounts with permissions to modify the image manifest.
    * **API Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the registry's API could allow unauthorized modification of the configuration section within the manifest.

* **Impact:**
    * **Direct Code Execution upon Container Startup:** Changing the entrypoint allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands when the container is launched.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Modifying environment variables can be used to influence the behavior of applications within the container, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Setting environment variables to point to attacker-controlled servers can facilitate data exfiltration.
    * **Denial of Service:**  Modifying the entrypoint to a non-existent command or a resource-intensive process can lead to container failures or resource exhaustion.

* **Likelihood:** Medium, as it requires specific permissions and knowledge of the manifest structure.

* **Mitigation Strategies (In addition to those for "Tamper with Image Manifests"):**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions for manifest operations.
    * **Automated Manifest Validation:** Implement automated checks to validate the integrity and expected configuration within image manifests.
    * **Secure Defaults:**  Establish secure default configurations for container images and enforce adherence to these defaults.

* **Detection Methods:**
    * **Monitoring Manifest Changes (Focus on Configuration):** Specifically monitor changes to the configuration section of the image manifest.
    * **Runtime Monitoring:** Monitor the actual entrypoint and environment variables of running containers and compare them against the expected configuration. Alert on discrepancies.
    * **Static Analysis of Manifests:**  Perform static analysis of manifests to identify potentially malicious or unexpected configurations.

**CONCLUSION:**

The "Manipulate Images and Tags" attack path poses a significant threat to applications relying on the `distribution/distribution` registry. A layered security approach is crucial to mitigate these risks, encompassing robust access controls, strong authentication, vulnerability scanning, content trust mechanisms, and continuous monitoring and auditing. Development teams must be aware of these attack vectors and actively implement the recommended mitigation strategies to ensure the integrity and security of their containerized applications. Regular security assessments and penetration testing targeting these specific attack paths are also highly recommended.
