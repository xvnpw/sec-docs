## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass (1.1.1.2 -> 1.1.1.3 -> 1.1.2.2)](./attack_tree_paths/authenticationauthorization_bypass__1_1_1_2_-_1_1_1_3_-_1_1_2_2_.md)

**Description:** This path represents a common attack sequence where an attacker leverages weak or leaked credentials, combined with misconfigured access control, to gain unauthorized access to the registry.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **1.1.1.2 Weak/Default Credentials:** The attacker uses default or easily guessable credentials for the registry or its associated token service.  This could be due to unchanged default passwords, weak password policies, or credentials found through online searches or data breaches.
    *   **1.1.1.3 Token Leakage:** The attacker obtains a valid authentication token through accidental exposure.  This could happen if tokens are logged, stored in insecure locations (e.g., environment variables exposed in a compromised container), or transmitted over insecure channels.
    *   **1.1.2.2 Misconfigured Access Control Policies:**  The registry's access control policies are overly permissive, granting broader access than intended.  This could be due to misconfigured roles, incorrect permission assignments, or a lack of granular access control.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies and prohibit default credentials.
    *   Use a secure secrets management solution to store and manage tokens.
    *   Regularly audit and review access control policies (RBAC). Implement the principle of least privilege.
    *   Monitor logs for authentication failures and suspicious token usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Storage Backend Compromise (1.2.1.1)](./attack_tree_paths/storage_backend_compromise__1_2_1_1_.md)

**Description:** This path represents a direct attack on the underlying storage backend (e.g., S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage) used by the registry.  Misconfigured permissions can allow public access or unauthorized access to the stored images and metadata.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **1.2.1.1 Misconfigured Storage Permissions:** The storage backend is configured with overly permissive permissions, allowing public read or write access.  This is often due to misconfigured bucket policies (e.g., a public S3 bucket) or incorrect IAM role assignments.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege for storage backend access.  The registry should only have the necessary permissions.
    *   Regularly audit storage permissions (e.g., S3 bucket policies, Azure Blob Storage access policies).
    *   Use IAM roles/service accounts with tightly scoped permissions instead of long-term credentials.
    *   Enable logging and monitoring for storage access.

## Attack Tree Path: [CI/CD Pipeline Compromise (2.4.1)](./attack_tree_paths/cicd_pipeline_compromise__2_4_1_.md)

**Description:** This path highlights the supply chain risk, where a compromised build system or CI/CD pipeline is used to inject malicious code into a container image before it's pushed to the registry.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **2.4.1 Inject malicious code into build process:** The attacker gains access to the build environment (e.g., a compromised build server, a malicious dependency injected into the build process) and inserts malicious code into the container image during the build process.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Secure the build environment and CI/CD pipeline.  Implement strong access controls and authentication.
    *   Use code signing and verification to ensure the integrity of build artifacts.
    *   Use trusted base images and regularly scan them for vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement software composition analysis (SCA) to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
    *   Implement robust monitoring and logging for the build pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes (Individual Attack Steps)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes__individual_attack_steps_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws:** This is the gateway to many attacks.  Strong authentication and authorization are fundamental.
*   **1.1.1.2 Weak/Default Credentials:**  A very common and easily exploitable vulnerability.  Mitigation: Strong password policies, no default credentials.
*   **1.1.1.3 Token Leakage:**  Secrets management is crucial.  Mitigation: Secure storage and handling of tokens.
*   **1.1.2.2 Misconfigured Access Control Policies:**  Principle of least privilege is key.  Mitigation: Regular audits and strict RBAC.
*   **1.2 Exploit Storage Backend Vulnerabilities:**  Direct access bypasses registry security.  Mitigation: Secure storage configuration and access controls.
*   **1.2.1.1 Misconfigured Storage Permissions:**  A common and high-impact misconfiguration.  Mitigation: Regular audits and strict permissions.
*   **1.2.1.2 Compromised Storage Credentials:**  Leads to direct access.  Mitigation: Secure credential management, IAM roles/service accounts.
*   **1.3.1.1 Registry configured to use HTTP instead of HTTPS:**  A fundamental security flaw.  Mitigation: Enforce HTTPS.
*   **2.4 Compromise Build System/CI/CD Pipeline:**  Highlights supply chain risks.  Mitigation: Secure the entire build and deployment process.
*   **2.4.1 Inject malicious code into build process:**  The core of the CI/CD pipeline attack.  Mitigation: Secure build environment, code signing, vulnerability scanning.
*   **3.1.1.1 Lack of Rate Limiting:**  Essential for DoS protection.  Mitigation: Implement rate limiting.
*   **3.1.2.1 Lack of Storage Quotas:**  Essential for DoS protection.  Mitigation: Implement storage quotas.
*   **4.1.3.1 Registry configuration details leaked through error messages or logs:**  Information disclosure.  Mitigation: Sanitize logs and error messages.
