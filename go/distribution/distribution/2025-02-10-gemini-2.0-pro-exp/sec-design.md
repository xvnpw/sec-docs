Okay, let's create a design document for the `distribution/distribution` project (OCI registry implementation).

# BUSINESS POSTURE

The `distribution/distribution` project, which is the reference implementation of the OCI Distribution specification, serves a critical role in the modern software development and deployment ecosystem.  It's used by countless organizations to store and distribute container images.

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Reliability and Availability:  The registry must be highly available and reliable. Downtime or data loss directly impacts software deployments and can halt development pipelines.
*   Scalability: The registry needs to scale to handle a potentially massive number of images, tags, and concurrent requests.  Growth in container adoption necessitates horizontal scalability.
*   Performance:  Pushing and pulling images should be fast.  Slow performance impacts developer productivity and deployment speed.
*   Security:  The registry must protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and image tampering.  This is paramount, as compromised images can lead to widespread security vulnerabilities.
*   Compliance:  The registry should adhere to the OCI Distribution specification, ensuring interoperability with other container tools and platforms.
*   Maintainability: The codebase should be maintainable and extensible to allow for future enhancements and bug fixes.
*   Cost-Effectiveness: While not explicitly stated, operating the registry should be cost-effective, especially when self-hosting.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Compromised Images:  An attacker successfully pushing a malicious image into the registry, leading to widespread compromise of systems using that image. This is the highest risk.
*   Denial of Service:  The registry becoming unavailable, preventing deployments and impacting development.
*   Data Breach:  Unauthorized access to image data, potentially exposing sensitive information embedded within images.
*   Data Loss:  Loss of image data due to hardware failure, software bugs, or operational errors.
*   Non-Compliance:  Deviation from the OCI specification, leading to interoperability issues.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the repository and common practices):

*   security control: Authentication: The registry supports various authentication mechanisms, including token-based authentication (often via OAuth 2.0 providers) and basic authentication. Described in documentation and configuration files.
*   security control: Authorization: Access control is typically implemented through a combination of registry-level permissions and integration with external identity providers. Described in documentation and configuration files.
*   security control: TLS Encryption: Communication with the registry is expected to be encrypted using TLS. Described in documentation and configuration files.
*   security control: Input Validation: The registry validates incoming requests and data to prevent common attacks like path traversal and injection vulnerabilities. Implemented in the codebase.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: The project likely undergoes regular security audits and penetration testing, given its critical role. Implied, but best practice.
*   security control: Dependency Management: The project uses Go modules, which helps manage dependencies and track vulnerabilities. Implemented in go.mod and go.sum files.
*   security control: Code Reviews: The project uses a pull request-based workflow, which implies code reviews are performed. Implemented in GitHub workflow.
*   security control: Static Analysis: The project likely uses static analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase. Implied, but best practice.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity: The registry is a complex piece of software, and despite best efforts, there's always a risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Third-Party Dependencies: The registry relies on third-party libraries, which may contain vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Configuration Errors: Misconfiguration of the registry (e.g., weak authentication settings, exposed ports) can lead to security breaches.
*   accepted risk: Operational Errors: Human error during operation (e.g., accidental deletion of data) can lead to data loss or downtime.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Content Trust/Image Signing: Integrate with Notary or other image signing mechanisms to ensure image integrity and authenticity. This is a *high priority* addition.
*   Vulnerability Scanning: Implement continuous vulnerability scanning of stored images to identify known vulnerabilities.
*   Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.
*   Audit Logging: Implement comprehensive audit logging to track all registry operations for security monitoring and incident response.
*   Web Application Firewall (WAF): Deploy a WAF in front of the registry to protect against common web attacks.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support multiple authentication mechanisms (token-based, basic auth, etc.).
    *   Integrate with common identity providers (LDAP, OAuth 2.0, etc.).
    *   Enforce strong password policies.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   Authorization:
    *   Implement granular access control based on roles and permissions.
    *   Support fine-grained control over image repositories and tags.
    *   Integrate with external authorization services.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all incoming data against a strict schema.
    *   Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Protect against path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use TLS for all communication.
    *   Use strong cryptographic algorithms and key lengths.
    *   Securely store sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys).
    *   Implement image signing and verification.

## BUILD

The `distribution/distribution` project uses Go modules and a Makefile for building.  A typical CI/CD pipeline would involve the following steps:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- Commits Code --> GitHub["GitHub Repository"]
    GitHub -- Triggers --> CI["CI System (e.g., GitHub Actions)"]
    CI -- Checks Out --> Code["Code"]
    CI -- Runs --> Lint["Linters (e.g., gofmt, govet)"]
    CI -- Runs --> Tests["Unit Tests"]
    CI -- Runs --> SAST["SAST (e.g., gosec)"]
    CI -- Builds --> Binary["Registry Binary"]
    CI -- Builds --> DockerImage["Docker Image"]
    CI -- Pushes --> ArtifactRegistry["Artifact Registry (e.g., Docker Hub)"]

```
Build Process Security Controls:

*   security control: Code Reviews:  Mandatory code reviews before merging changes. Implemented via GitHub pull requests.
*   security control: Static Analysis (SAST):  Using tools like `gosec` to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code. Integrated into the CI pipeline.
*   security control: Dependency Scanning:  Using `go mod` to manage dependencies and identify vulnerable packages.  Regularly updating dependencies.
*   security control: Build Automation:  Using a Makefile and CI system (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate the build process, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.
*   security control: Signed Commits: Developers should sign their commits using GPG keys to ensure the integrity of the codebase.
*   security control: Least Privilege: Build systems should run with the least necessary privileges.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Software Deployment: The registry is critical for deploying containerized applications.
    *   Development Pipeline: The registry is an integral part of the development workflow.

*   Data to Protect:
    *   Container Images (Manifests and Layers): These are the primary data stored in the registry.
        *   Sensitivity:  Varies greatly.  Images can contain anything from public open-source software to highly sensitive proprietary code and data.  The sensitivity depends on the specific image and its contents.
    *   Registry Metadata:  Information about images, tags, and users.
        *   Sensitivity:  Moderately sensitive.  Metadata can reveal information about the organization's software and infrastructure.
    *   Authentication Credentials:  Usernames, passwords, API keys, and tokens.
        *   Sensitivity:  Highly sensitive.  Compromise of credentials can lead to unauthorized access to the registry.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

    *   What specific authentication providers are intended to be supported?
    *   What are the expected performance and scalability requirements (e.g., number of images, concurrent requests)?
