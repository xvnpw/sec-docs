# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for distribution/distribution

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Authentication and Basic Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/configure_authentication_and_basic_authorization.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Choose Authentication Method:** Within the `distribution/distribution` configuration file (`config.yml`), select an authentication method.  While basic authentication is the simplest, token-based authentication is generally preferred for better security.
2.  **Configure Authentication:**  Set the appropriate parameters within the `auth` section of the `config.yml`.  For basic authentication, you'll define users and passwords (hashed, ideally). For token authentication, you'll configure the token service endpoint.
3.  **Basic Authorization (Optional):**  `distribution/distribution` has built-in, limited authorization capabilities.  You can define simple access control rules within the configuration file, specifying which users or tokens have read, write, or delete access to specific repositories.  This is less granular than what you'd get with a reverse proxy, but it's a direct configuration option.
4.  **Restart Registry:**  After modifying the configuration, restart the registry service for the changes to take effect.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the registry.
    *   **Unauthorized Image Pushes/Deletions (High Severity):**  Limits who can push or delete images, even with basic authorization.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of unauthorized users listing or viewing image details.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced (from High to Medium/Low, depending on the authentication method). Basic auth is weaker than token auth.
    *   **Unauthorized Image Pushes/Deletions:** Risk reduced (from High to Medium/Low).
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `distribution/distribution` directly supports basic authentication and token authentication through its configuration file.
    *   Basic authorization rules can be defined within the configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More advanced authorization (role-based access control, fine-grained permissions) typically requires an external solution (reverse proxy or authorization plugin).  The built-in authorization is limited.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Storage Quotas](./mitigation_strategies/configure_storage_quotas.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Edit Configuration:**  Open the `distribution/distribution` configuration file (`config.yml`).
2.  **Locate Storage Section:**  Find the `storage` section of the configuration.
3.  **Enable Quotas:**  Within the `storage` section, and depending on your chosen storage driver (e.g., `filesystem`, `s3`), there may be options to enable and configure storage quotas.  This might involve setting limits on the total storage used or the number of images/tags allowed. The exact configuration options vary depending on the storage driver.
4.  **Set Quota Limits:**  Specify the desired quota limits (e.g., in bytes, number of images, etc.).
5.  **Restart Registry:**  Restart the registry service for the changes to take effect.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Prevents attackers (or even legitimate users) from consuming all available storage space on the registry server.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (High Severity):**  A form of DoS attack where an attacker fills the storage, making the registry unavailable.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Risk reduced (from High to Low/Medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `distribution/distribution` has *some* built-in support for storage quotas, but it depends heavily on the chosen storage driver.  Not all drivers support quotas.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Quota support is not universally available across all storage drivers.  The granularity and features of quota management may be limited.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Configure Audit Logging](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_configure_audit_logging.md)

**Description:**
1. **Edit Configuration:** Open the `distribution/distribution` configuration file (`config.yml`).
2. **Locate `log` or `reporting` Section:** Find the section related to logging (it might be called `log`, `reporting`, or something similar).
3. **Enable Audit Logging:** Within the logging section, there should be options to enable audit logging. This might involve setting a log level (e.g., `info`, `debug`) or specifying a separate audit log file.
4. **Configure Log Format and Destination:** Configure the format of the audit logs (e.g., JSON, plain text) and the destination (e.g., file, syslog, standard output).
5. **Restart Registry:** Restart the registry service.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Non-Repudiation (Medium Severity):** Provides a record of actions performed on the registry, which can be used for auditing and investigation.
    * **Intrusion Detection (Medium Severity):** Audit logs can be analyzed to detect suspicious activity or potential security breaches.
    * **Compliance (Variable Severity):** Helps meet compliance requirements that mandate audit logging.

* **Impact:**
    * **Non-Repudiation:** Provides evidence of actions.
    * **Intrusion Detection:** Enables detection of suspicious patterns.
    * **Compliance:** Helps meet regulatory requirements.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * `distribution/distribution` supports logging, and the level of detail can be configured.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * The specific options for *audit* logging (as opposed to general operational logging) might be limited.  Integration with external log management systems might require additional configuration.  The default log level might not capture all relevant audit events.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure HTTP Headers for Security](./mitigation_strategies/configure_http_headers_for_security.md)

**Description:**
1. **Edit Configuration:** Open the `distribution/distribution` configuration file (`config.yml`).
2. **Locate `http` Section:** Find the `http` section of the configuration.
3. **Add `headers` Option:** Within the `http` section, there should be an option to add custom HTTP headers. This is often done using a `headers` field, which takes a list of key-value pairs.
4. **Add Security Headers:** Add relevant security headers, such as:
    * `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
    * `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` (if using HTTPS)
    * `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) - This one is complex and requires careful configuration.
    * `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
5. **Restart Registry:** Restart the registry.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Clickjacking (Low Severity):** `X-Frame-Options` prevents the registry's web interface (if it has one) from being embedded in an iframe on a malicious site.
    * **MIME Sniffing (Low Severity):** `X-Content-Type-Options` prevents browsers from incorrectly interpreting the content type of responses.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Low Severity):** CSP can help mitigate XSS attacks, although it's primarily relevant if the registry has a web interface.
    * **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) enforces HTTPS connections, preventing downgrade attacks.

* **Impact:**
    * **Clickjacking:** Risk reduced (from Low to Negligible).
    * **MIME Sniffing:** Risk reduced (from Low to Negligible).
    * **XSS:** Risk reduced (variable, depends on CSP configuration).
    * **MITM Attacks:** Risk reduced (from High to Low, *if* HTTPS is already in use).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * `distribution/distribution` allows configuring custom HTTP headers through the `http.headers` option in the configuration file.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * These headers are often not configured by default, leaving the registry vulnerable to these (relatively low-severity) attacks.
