# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for distribution/distribution

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Distribution](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_distribution.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Regularly Update Distribution

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to Security Mailing Lists/GitHub Watch:** Subscribe to the Docker Distribution security mailing list (if available) or watch the official Docker Distribution GitHub repository's releases and security announcements.
    2.  **Monitor Release Notes:** Regularly check the release notes for new versions of Docker Distribution on GitHub. Pay close attention to sections related to security fixes and vulnerability patches.
    3.  **Test Updates in a Staging Environment:** Before applying updates to the production registry, deploy and test the new version in a staging or testing Distribution environment. Verify core registry functionality (push, pull, delete) and configuration compatibility.
    4.  **Apply Updates Promptly:** Once staging testing is successful, schedule and apply the updates to the production Docker Distribution instance as soon as possible, following the official upgrade documentation.
    5.  **Document Update Process:** Maintain documentation of the Distribution update process, including steps taken, versions updated from and to, and any Distribution configuration changes made.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Distribution Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Distribution software is susceptible to publicly known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise the registry.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Distribution Vulnerabilities (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation by patching known weaknesses in the Distribution software itself.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** We have a manual process for checking GitHub releases, but it's not consistently followed. Staging updates and testing for Distribution are not automated.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automated Release Monitoring for Distribution:** Implement automated scripts or alerts to monitor Docker Distribution GitHub releases and security announcements.
    *   **Automated Staging Updates and Testing for Distribution:** Automate the process of deploying new Distribution versions to staging and running automated tests specifically for Distribution functionality before production deployment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Authentication in Distribution](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_authentication_in_distribution.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Robust Authentication in Distribution

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Distribution Authentication Method:** Select a suitable authentication method supported by Distribution's configuration, such as basic authentication, token authentication, or integration with an external identity provider (LDAP, OAuth 2.0, OIDC) as configured within Distribution's `config.yml`.
    2.  **Configure Authentication in Distribution's `config.yml`:** Configure the chosen authentication method in the Distribution configuration file (`config.yml`). This involves specifying the authentication realm, provider, and related settings *within Distribution's configuration*.
    3.  **Test Distribution Authentication:** Thoroughly test the Distribution authentication configuration by attempting to push and pull images using valid and invalid credentials against the Distribution registry. Verify that unauthorized access is denied by Distribution.
    4.  **Enforce Authentication for All Distribution Operations:** Ensure that authentication is enforced for all registry operations handled by Distribution, including push, pull, delete, and metadata access, through Distribution's configuration.
    5.  **Regularly Review Distribution Authentication Configuration:** Periodically review the authentication configuration in Distribution's `config.yml` to ensure it remains secure and aligned with security policies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Images via Distribution (High Severity):** Without proper authentication configured in Distribution, anyone can potentially access and pull private images directly from the registry, bypassing access controls.
    *   **Unauthorized Image Pushing via Distribution (Medium Severity):** Anonymous push access enabled in Distribution can allow attackers to inject malicious images into the registry through Distribution, potentially compromising downstream systems.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Images via Distribution (High Impact):**  Effectively prevents unauthorized access to private images *at the Distribution level* by requiring valid credentials enforced by Distribution.
    *   **Unauthorized Image Pushing via Distribution (Medium Impact):** Prevents unauthorized image injection *at the Distribution level* by restricting push access to authenticated users as configured in Distribution.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Basic authentication is enabled in Distribution using username/password stored in a database configured within Distribution.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Transition to Token-Based Authentication in Distribution:** Migrate from basic authentication to token-based authentication within Distribution's configuration for improved security and scalability.
    *   **Integration with External Identity Provider (OIDC/OAuth 2.0) in Distribution:** Integrate Distribution with our organization's existing identity provider through Distribution's configuration for centralized user management and stronger authentication mechanisms like multi-factor authentication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Authorization Policies in Distribution](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_authorization_policies_in_distribution.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Utilize Authorization Policies in Distribution

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles and Permissions for Distribution:** Define clear roles and permissions for accessing and managing repositories within the registry, specifically as they will be enforced by Distribution's authorization module. Examples include "read-only," "push-pull," "admin" *within the context of Distribution*.
    2.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Distribution:** Configure Distribution's authorization module (specified in `config.yml`) to implement RBAC. This involves defining authorization policies that map users or groups to specific roles and permissions for repositories or namespaces *within Distribution's authorization configuration*.
    3.  **Apply Least Privilege Principle in Distribution Authorization:** Grant users and service accounts only the minimum necessary permissions required for their tasks *as enforced by Distribution's authorization policies*. Avoid granting overly broad permissions in Distribution.
    4.  **Test Distribution Authorization Policies:** Thoroughly test the authorization policies configured in Distribution by attempting various operations (push, pull, delete) with different user roles and permissions. Verify that access is correctly granted or denied by Distribution based on the configured policies.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Distribution Authorization Policies:** Periodically review and update authorization policies configured in Distribution's `config.yml` to reflect changes in user roles, application requirements, and security best practices *within the Distribution context*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Distribution (Medium Severity):**  Without proper authorization configured in Distribution, users or services might gain access to resources or operations beyond their intended scope *within the registry as managed by Distribution*, leading to unauthorized actions.
    *   **Data Breaches due to Over-Permissive Access in Distribution (Medium Severity):**  Overly permissive access controls configured in Distribution can increase the risk of data breaches if accounts are compromised and have excessive permissions *within the registry as enforced by Distribution*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Distribution (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of privilege escalation *within the registry as controlled by Distribution* by enforcing granular access control through Distribution's authorization module.
    *   **Data Breaches due to Over-Permissive Access in Distribution (Medium Impact):** Limits the potential impact of compromised accounts *within the registry as managed by Distribution* by restricting their access to only necessary resources through Distribution's authorization policies.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** Authorization in Distribution is currently based on simple authentication; all authenticated users have the same level of access *within Distribution*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Implement RBAC using Distribution's Authorization Module:** Configure and enable Distribution's authorization module (specified in `config.yml`) to enforce RBAC policies.
    *   **Define Granular Authorization Policies for Distribution:** Develop and implement detailed authorization policies *within Distribution's configuration* based on roles and responsibilities within the development and operations teams.
    *   **Integrate with Policy Management System via Distribution (Optional):** Consider integrating Distribution with a centralized policy management system *if supported by Distribution's authorization module* for more complex authorization scenarios.

## Mitigation Strategy: [HTTPS Enforcement in Distribution](./mitigation_strategies/https_enforcement_in_distribution.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: HTTPS Enforcement in Distribution

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain TLS Certificates for Distribution:** Obtain valid TLS/SSL certificates for the registry's domain name from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or use internally generated certificates if appropriate for your environment. These certificates will be used to configure HTTPS *within Distribution*.
    2.  **Configure TLS in Distribution's `config.yml`:** Configure Distribution to use TLS by specifying the paths to the certificate and private key files in the `config.yml` file under the `http.tls` section.
    3.  **Enable HTTPS Listener in Distribution:** Ensure that Distribution is configured to listen for HTTPS connections on port 443 (or a custom port if needed) by verifying the `http.addr` setting in `config.yml`.
    4.  **Disable HTTP Listener in Distribution (Optional but Recommended):**  Disable the HTTP listener (port 80) in Distribution by setting `http.addr` to only listen on HTTPS or by explicitly removing the HTTP listener configuration from `config.yml`. This strictly enforces HTTPS at the Distribution level.
    5.  **Test Distribution HTTPS Configuration:** Verify that the registry is accessible over HTTPS and that the TLS certificate presented by Distribution is valid and trusted by clients.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Distribution Communication (High Severity):** Without HTTPS configured in Distribution, communication between clients and the registry *via Distribution* is unencrypted, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and interception of credentials and image data.
    *   **Credential Theft via Distribution Communication (High Severity):**  Credentials transmitted over HTTP to Distribution can be easily intercepted by attackers, leading to unauthorized access.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping on Distribution Communication (Medium Severity):**  Image data transmitted over HTTP via Distribution can be intercepted and viewed by attackers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Distribution Communication (High Impact):**  Effectively prevents MitM attacks on communication *with Distribution* by encrypting the connection at the Distribution level.
    *   **Credential Theft via Distribution Communication (High Impact):**  Protects credentials in transit *to and from Distribution* by encryption configured within Distribution.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping on Distribution Communication (Medium Impact):** Protects image data in transit *via Distribution* from eavesdropping by enabling HTTPS in Distribution.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented:** HTTPS is enabled and configured in Distribution with valid TLS certificates obtained from a trusted CA, as configured in Distribution's `config.yml`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) Configuration (External to Distribution):** While HTTPS is enabled in Distribution, HSTS header enforcement is typically configured at a reverse proxy or load balancer *in front of Distribution*, not directly within Distribution itself.  This should be implemented externally to further enhance HTTPS security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Docker Content Trust (DCT) Integration in Distribution](./mitigation_strategies/enable_docker_content_trust__dct__integration_in_distribution.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Enable Docker Content Trust (DCT) Integration in Distribution

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Deploy and Configure Notary (Content Trust Server):** Deploy and configure a Notary server, which is the component responsible for storing and managing image signatures. Distribution integrates with Notary for DCT. This is a prerequisite for enabling DCT in Distribution.
    2.  **Configure Distribution for DCT Integration in `config.yml`:** Configure Distribution to integrate with the Notary server by specifying the Notary server's address and enabling DCT related settings in the `config.yml` file under the `content` section.
    3.  **Test Distribution DCT Integration:** Verify that Distribution is correctly connected to the Notary server and that DCT functionality is enabled by attempting to push and pull signed images through the Distribution registry.
    4.  **Enforce DCT Policies (External to Distribution):** While Distribution enables DCT integration, the enforcement of DCT policies (requiring signed images) is primarily handled by Docker clients and CI/CD pipelines, not directly configured within Distribution itself. Distribution acts as the intermediary for signature verification.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Image Tampering via Distribution (High Severity):** Without DCT integration in Distribution, malicious actors could potentially tamper with images in the registry, and Distribution would not inherently verify image integrity.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Distribution (High Severity):**  Compromised images in the registry, if not verified by DCT through Distribution, can introduce vulnerabilities and malware into downstream systems.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Image Tampering via Distribution (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of image tampering *within the registry as accessed through Distribution* by enabling image integrity and authenticity verification via DCT integration in Distribution.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Distribution (High Impact):**  Mitigates supply chain attacks *related to images pulled from the registry via Distribution* by enabling verification of image origin and integrity through DCT integration in Distribution.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** Docker Content Trust integration is not currently enabled in Distribution's `config.yml`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Deploy and Configure Notary Server (Prerequisite):** Set up and configure a Notary server instance as a prerequisite for DCT integration in Distribution.
    *   **Configure DCT Integration in Distribution's `config.yml`:** Configure Distribution to communicate with the Notary server by modifying the `config.yml` file.
    *   **Implement Key Management and Distribution (External to Distribution):** Establish a secure process for generating, distributing, and managing signing keys for image publishers. This is an external process but essential for DCT to function with Distribution.
    *   **Enable DCT in CI/CD Pipelines and Developer Workstations (External to Distribution):** Update CI/CD pipelines and developer documentation to enable DCT on Docker clients and incorporate image signing into the image publishing workflow. This is client-side configuration to leverage DCT enabled in Distribution.

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Rate Limiting in Distribution

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Rate Limiting Policies:** Determine appropriate rate limits for different operations (pull, push, etc.) based on expected usage patterns and resource capacity of the Distribution registry.
    2.  **Configure Rate Limiting in Distribution's `config.yml`:** Configure rate limiting policies in Distribution's `config.yml` file under the `middleware.registry.options.rate_limit` section. Define limits based on IP address, user, or repository as supported by Distribution's rate limiting configuration.
    3.  **Test Rate Limiting Configuration:** Test the rate limiting configuration by simulating excessive requests from a single source and verifying that Distribution enforces the configured limits and returns appropriate error responses (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests).
    4.  **Monitor Rate Limiting Effectiveness:** Monitor the effectiveness of rate limiting by analyzing Distribution logs and metrics to identify if rate limits are being triggered and if they are effectively preventing abuse.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on Distribution (Medium Severity):** Without rate limiting configured in Distribution, attackers could flood the registry with excessive requests, potentially overwhelming the Distribution service and causing a DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on Distribution (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the risk of DoS attacks *targeting Distribution* by limiting the rate of requests that Distribution will process.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion of Distribution (Medium Impact):**  Prevents resource exhaustion *of the Distribution service* by controlling request rates and ensuring fair resource allocation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** Rate limiting is not currently configured in Distribution's `config.yml`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Define and Implement Rate Limiting Policies in Distribution's `config.yml`:**  Develop and implement rate limiting policies in Distribution's `config.yml` based on anticipated usage and resource constraints.
    *   **Monitor and Tune Rate Limiting:** Implement monitoring to track rate limiting effectiveness and tune the policies as needed based on observed traffic patterns and potential abuse attempts.
