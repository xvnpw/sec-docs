Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving `distribution/distribution`, focusing on high and critical severity:

*   **Malicious Image Push**
    *   **Description:** An attacker pushes a container image containing malware, vulnerabilities, or backdoors to the registry.
    *   **How Distribution Contributes:** The registry's core function is to accept and store pushed images. It doesn't inherently perform deep content inspection or prevent the upload of malicious content.
    *   **Example:** An attacker pushes an image named `ubuntu:latest` containing a cryptominer. If a user unknowingly pulls and runs this image, their system is compromised.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of systems running the malicious image, data breaches, resource hijacking (e.g., for cryptomining).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement automated image scanning tools that analyze images for vulnerabilities and malware *before* they are pulled for deployment.
        *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for pushing images, limiting who can contribute to the registry.
        *   Utilize content trust (Docker Content Trust) to ensure the integrity and publisher of images.
        *   Implement a process for regularly auditing and removing suspicious or outdated images.

*   **Authentication Bypass via API**
    *   **Description:** An attacker bypasses the registry's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to push, pull, or manage images.
    *   **How Distribution Contributes:** The registry exposes an HTTP API for image management. Vulnerabilities in the authentication implementation within `distribution/distribution` could allow bypass.
    *   **Example:** A flaw in the token validation logic allows an attacker to forge a valid authentication token without proper credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive container images, potential for malicious image injection, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the `distribution/distribution` instance is running the latest stable version with all security patches applied.
        *   Carefully configure authentication methods (e.g., basic auth, bearer tokens, OAuth 2.0) and ensure they are properly secured (e.g., using HTTPS).
        *   Implement robust authorization policies to control access based on roles and permissions.
        *   Regularly audit authentication configurations and access logs.

*   **Authorization Bypass**
    *   **Description:** An authenticated user gains access to repositories or actions they are not authorized to perform.
    *   **How Distribution Contributes:** The registry's authorization logic determines who can perform which actions on specific repositories. Flaws in this logic within `distribution/distribution` can lead to bypass.
    *   **Example:** A user with pull access to repository "A" is able to push images to repository "B" due to an authorization misconfiguration or vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of images, potential for malicious image injection, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement and enforce granular role-based access control (RBAC) policies.
        *   Thoroughly test authorization rules after any configuration changes.
        *   Regularly review and audit authorization policies and user permissions.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Image Push/Pull**
    *   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the registry with requests to push or pull extremely large or numerous images, causing resource exhaustion and service disruption.
    *   **How Distribution Contributes:** The registry must handle potentially large data transfers for image push and pull operations. Lack of proper resource management can make it vulnerable to DoS.
    *   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly attempts to push multi-gigabyte images, saturating the registry's network bandwidth and storage capacity.
    *   **Impact:**  Registry unavailability, impacting application deployments and updates.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on API requests to prevent excessive push/pull attempts.
        *   Configure resource limits (e.g., maximum image size) within the registry.
        *   Ensure the underlying infrastructure has sufficient resources (CPU, memory, storage, bandwidth) to handle expected load and potential spikes.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for resource utilization.

*   **Manifest Manipulation/Poisoning**
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates image manifests to alter image metadata, layer dependencies, or configuration settings, leading to unexpected or malicious behavior when the image is pulled.
    *   **How Distribution Contributes:** The registry stores and serves image manifests. Vulnerabilities in manifest parsing or validation within `distribution/distribution` could allow for manipulation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a manifest to point to a malicious layer or alters environment variables within the image configuration.
    *   **Impact:**  Deployment of compromised images, unexpected application behavior, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement content trust (Docker Content Trust) to ensure manifest integrity.
        *   Thoroughly validate image manifests upon pull before deployment.
        *   Regularly audit and compare manifests of critical images.
