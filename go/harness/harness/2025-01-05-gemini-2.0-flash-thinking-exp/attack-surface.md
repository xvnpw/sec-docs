# Attack Surface Analysis for harness/harness

## Attack Surface: [I. Delegate Compromise](./attack_surfaces/i__delegate_compromise.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor gains control of a Harness Delegate instance.

**How Harness Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Harness Delegates run within the target infrastructure and have access to sensitive resources needed for deployments. Their compromise directly impacts the security of the deployed applications and infrastructure *because they are a core component of the Harness deployment process*.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the delegate software or its underlying OS, gaining shell access. They then use the delegate's credentials *managed by Harness* to access secrets stored by Harness or manipulate deployments *orchestrated through Harness*.

**Impact:**  Critical. Full control over deployment infrastructure, potential data breaches, service disruption, and deployment of malicious code *via the Harness platform*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update delegate software and underlying operating systems.
*   Implement strong security hardening for delegate environments (e.g., restrict network access, disable unnecessary services).
*   Monitor delegate activity for suspicious behavior.
*   Use ephemeral delegates where feasible to limit the window of opportunity for compromise.
*   Implement strong access controls for managing and accessing delegate instances.

## Attack Surface: [II. Compromised Harness API Keys/Tokens](./attack_surfaces/ii__compromised_harness_api_keystokens.md)

**Description:**  API keys or tokens used by the application to interact with the Harness platform are exposed or stolen.

**How Harness Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Harness requires API keys or tokens for programmatic access to its features, such as triggering deployments or retrieving information. If these are compromised, attackers can impersonate legitimate users or systems *within the Harness ecosystem*.

**Example:** An API key is hardcoded in the application's source code or stored insecurely in configuration files. An attacker finds this key and uses it to deploy a malicious application version *through the Harness API*.

**Impact:** High. Unauthorized access to Harness resources, potential for malicious deployments, data exfiltration from Harness, and manipulation of deployment pipelines *within the Harness platform*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store API keys securely using secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
*   Implement proper access control and authorization for API key usage within the application.
*   Regularly rotate API keys.
*   Avoid hardcoding API keys in source code or configuration files.
*   Utilize Harness's built-in mechanisms for managing API keys and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [III. Insecure Communication with Harness Platform/Delegates](./attack_surfaces/iii__insecure_communication_with_harness_platformdelegates.md)

**Description:** Communication channels between the application infrastructure and the Harness platform or delegates are not properly secured.

**How Harness Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Harness relies on network communication for various functions. If these channels are unencrypted or lack proper authentication, they become vulnerable to interception and manipulation *of data flowing to and from Harness components*.

**Example:** Communication between a delegate and the Harness platform uses unencrypted HTTP. An attacker on the network intercepts the communication and steals deployment secrets being transmitted *to the Harness platform*.

**Impact:** High. Man-in-the-middle attacks, interception of sensitive data (credentials, deployment configurations) *related to Harness operations*, potential for tampering with deployment instructions *sent to Harness*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure all communication with the Harness platform and delegates uses HTTPS/TLS with strong ciphers.
*   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for enhanced authentication between delegates and the platform.
*   Secure the network infrastructure where delegates and the application reside.
*   Verify the authenticity of the Harness platform endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [IV. Insecure Customizations/Scripts within Harness Pipelines](./attack_surfaces/iv__insecure_customizationsscripts_within_harness_pipelines.md)

**Description:** Custom scripts or integrations within Harness pipelines contain vulnerabilities.

**How Harness Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Harness allows for custom scripting and integrations within deployment pipelines. If these are not developed securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities *directly into the Harness deployment process*.

**Example:** A custom script in a deployment pipeline executes arbitrary commands based on user-provided input without proper sanitization, leading to command injection *during a Harness-orchestrated deployment*.

**Impact:** High. Potential for arbitrary code execution on deployment targets, privilege escalation, and data breaches *through the execution of vulnerable Harness pipeline steps*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom scripts and integrations.
*   Implement thorough input validation and sanitization for any external data used in scripts.
*   Minimize the use of external commands and dependencies within scripts.
*   Regularly review and audit custom scripts for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Utilize Harness's built-in features and integrations where possible to reduce the need for custom code.

## Attack Surface: [V. Exposed Secrets in Harness Configurations](./attack_surfaces/v__exposed_secrets_in_harness_configurations.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys for other services) is stored insecurely within Harness configurations.

**How Harness Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Harness stores configurations required for deployments, which may include sensitive credentials. If these are not managed securely *within the Harness platform*, they can be exposed.

**Example:** Database credentials for the production environment are stored as plain text within a Harness environment variable. An attacker with access to the Harness project can view these credentials *directly within the Harness UI or API*.

**Impact:** High. Direct access to sensitive resources, potential for data breaches and unauthorized access to connected systems *due to insecure storage within Harness*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize Harness's built-in secrets management features to securely store and manage sensitive information.
*   Avoid storing secrets directly in environment variables or configuration files *within Harness*.
*   Implement strong access controls for managing Harness projects and configurations.
*   Regularly audit Harness configurations for exposed secrets.

## Attack Surface: [VI. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in Harness Components](./attack_surfaces/vi__supply_chain_vulnerabilities_in_harness_components.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the third-party libraries or dependencies used by the Harness platform or delegates.

**How Harness Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Like any software, Harness relies on external components. Vulnerabilities in these components can be exploited to compromise the Harness platform or delegates *themselves*.

**Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a widely used library included in the Harness Delegate. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability if the delegate is not updated promptly.

**Impact:** Medium to Critical (depending on the vulnerability). Potential for remote code execution, denial of service, and data breaches affecting the Harness platform or delegates.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Harness platform and delegates updated to the latest versions, which include security patches.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in Harness dependencies.
*   Implement a process for promptly patching or mitigating identified vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify vulnerabilities in Harness dependencies.
