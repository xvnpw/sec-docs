## Deep Threat Analysis: Compromised Harness Account

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Compromised Harness Account" threat within the context of an application utilizing the Harness platform (https://github.com/harness/harness). This analysis expands on the initial description, delving into the attack lifecycle, potential exploitation techniques, and more granular mitigation strategies.

**1. Threat Breakdown and Attack Lifecycle:**

Let's break down the attack lifecycle of a compromised Harness account:

* **Phase 1: Initial Access (The Compromise):**
    * **Credential Theft:** This is the most likely entry point.
        * **Phishing:** Attackers craft emails or messages mimicking legitimate Harness communications or related services (e.g., CI/CD tools, cloud providers) to trick users into revealing their credentials.
        * **Password Reuse:** Users often reuse passwords across multiple platforms. If a user's credentials for another service are compromised, those credentials might be valid for their Harness account.
        * **Password Spraying:** Attackers attempt to log in with commonly used passwords against a large number of user accounts.
        * **Brute-Force Attacks:** While less likely due to potential account lockout mechanisms, targeted brute-force attacks against specific usernames are possible.
        * **Keylogging/Malware:** If a user's workstation is compromised with malware, attackers can capture their keystrokes, including their Harness login credentials.
        * **Social Engineering:** Attackers might directly contact users pretending to be support staff or colleagues to elicit their credentials.
    * **Session Hijacking:**  Less common but possible, attackers might intercept or steal active Harness session tokens if proper security measures are not in place (e.g., lack of HTTPS, vulnerabilities in the user's browser).

* **Phase 2: Post-Compromise Activities (Exploitation within Harness):**
    * **Reconnaissance:** The attacker will likely explore the Harness environment to understand its configuration, identify valuable assets (secrets, pipelines), and map out potential attack paths. This includes:
        * **Browsing the UI:** Examining pipelines, workflows, services, environments, connectors, secrets, and user roles.
        * **Utilizing the API:** Programmatically querying the Harness API to gather information about the environment.
    * **Malicious Pipeline Modification:** This is a high-impact scenario.
        * **Injecting Malicious Code:** Modifying existing pipeline stages to include tasks that execute malicious code during deployments. This could involve:
            * Adding steps to download and execute malware.
            * Modifying deployment scripts to introduce backdoors or vulnerabilities.
            * Injecting code to exfiltrate data.
        * **Altering Deployment Targets:** Changing the target environment or infrastructure for deployments to deploy malicious versions.
        * **Introducing Supply Chain Attacks:** Injecting malicious dependencies or artifacts into the deployment process.
    * **Secret Exfiltration:** Harness often stores sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and other secrets. A compromised account allows direct access to these secrets.
        * **Direct Access through UI/API:** Viewing secrets directly through the Harness interface or API.
        * **Modifying Pipelines to Exfiltrate Secrets:** Adding tasks to pipelines to extract secrets and send them to attacker-controlled infrastructure.
    * **Unauthorized Deployment Approval:**  Bypassing or manipulating approval workflows to deploy compromised versions of applications.
    * **Service Disruption:**
        * **Deleting or Modifying Critical Configurations:**  Disrupting deployments by altering pipeline configurations, deleting connectors, or modifying environment settings.
        * **Triggering Unnecessary Deployments:** Launching numerous deployments to overload resources or disrupt services.
        * **Revoking Permissions:** Removing permissions from other legitimate users to hinder their ability to manage the platform.
    * **Lateral Movement (Potentially):** While Harness itself might not be the primary target for lateral movement, the compromised account could provide access to connected systems and services (e.g., cloud providers, artifact repositories) if credentials for those systems are stored within Harness or accessible through the compromised user's access.

* **Phase 3: Maintaining Access (Persistence):**
    * **Creating New Users/API Keys:**  The attacker might create new administrator accounts or API keys to maintain access even if the initially compromised account is revoked.
    * **Modifying Security Settings:**  Weakening security controls within Harness to prevent detection or future lockout.

**2. Deeper Dive into Affected Components:**

* **Harness UI:**
    * **Vulnerability:** The primary entry point for manual interaction and exploration. A compromised account grants full access to the UI's functionalities.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can directly manipulate pipelines, view secrets, manage users, and trigger deployments through the UI.
    * **Impact:** Direct manipulation of the application's deployment process and access to sensitive information.

* **Harness API:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Provides programmatic access to Harness functionalities. API keys or session tokens associated with the compromised account can be used for automated attacks.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can automate malicious actions like pipeline modifications, secret retrieval, and deployment triggers. This allows for faster and more widespread impact.
    * **Impact:** Enables large-scale, automated attacks and potentially bypasses some UI-based security controls.

* **User Management Module:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Controls user accounts, roles, and permissions. A compromised account with sufficient privileges can be used to escalate privileges, create new malicious accounts, or disable security measures.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can grant themselves higher privileges, create backdoor accounts, or remove legitimate users' access.
    * **Impact:**  Long-term persistence and increased control over the Harness environment.

**3. Advanced Exploitation Techniques:**

Beyond the basic scenarios, consider these more advanced techniques:

* **Exploiting Custom Delegates:** If the application utilizes custom Harness delegates with elevated privileges, a compromised account could be used to deploy malicious code through these delegates.
* **Manipulating Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Integrations:** If Harness is integrated with IaC tools like Terraform or CloudFormation, attackers might modify IaC configurations to introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into the underlying infrastructure.
* **Leveraging Third-Party Integrations:**  Compromised accounts could be used to manipulate integrations with other services (e.g., notification systems, monitoring tools) to cover their tracks or further their attack.
* **Abuse of Approval Workflows:**  Understanding and manipulating approval workflows to deploy malicious code without proper review. This could involve compromising approver accounts or exploiting weaknesses in the approval logic.

**4. Granular Mitigation Strategies (Expanding on the Initial List):**
