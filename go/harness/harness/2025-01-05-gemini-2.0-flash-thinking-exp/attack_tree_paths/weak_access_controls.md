## Deep Analysis: Weak Access Controls in Harness - An Attack Tree Path

As a cybersecurity expert working with the development team, let's delve into a deep analysis of the "Weak Access Controls" attack path within the context of Harness, as described in the provided attack tree. This path highlights a critical vulnerability that can have significant consequences for the security and integrity of the entire software delivery pipeline.

**ATTACK TREE PATH:**

**Weak Access Controls**

* **Attackers exploit misconfigured user roles and permissions within Harness.**
    * **This allows them to compromise user accounts (through phishing, credential stuffing, etc.) and use those accounts to perform malicious actions, such as modifying deployment pipelines or accessing secrets.**

**Deep Dive Analysis:**

This attack path hinges on the fundamental principle of **least privilege**. When access controls are weak or misconfigured, users are granted permissions beyond what they need to perform their designated tasks. This creates opportunities for attackers to exploit these excessive privileges.

**1. Attackers exploit misconfigured user roles and permissions within Harness:**

* **Understanding the Vulnerability:** Harness, like any robust platform, relies on a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions. Misconfigurations can arise from various sources:
    * **Overly Permissive Default Roles:**  Harness might have default roles that grant broad access, and administrators fail to customize them according to the principle of least privilege.
    * **Granularity Issues:** The RBAC system might not offer sufficiently granular control over specific actions or resources within Harness. This forces administrators to grant broader permissions than necessary.
    * **Lack of Understanding:**  Administrators might not fully understand the implications of different roles and permissions within Harness, leading to unintentional over-provisioning.
    * **Poor Documentation and Training:** Inadequate documentation or training on Harness's RBAC features can contribute to misconfigurations.
    * **Legacy Configurations:**  Permissions granted in the past might not be reviewed or revoked as user roles and responsibilities evolve.
    * **Integration with External Systems:** If Harness integrates with external identity providers or authentication systems, misconfigurations in these systems can propagate to Harness.

* **Exploitation Tactics:** Attackers actively seek out these misconfigurations. This can involve:
    * **Information Gathering:**  Reconnaissance to understand the organization's structure, potential user roles, and the functionalities exposed within Harness.
    * **Scanning for Openly Accessible Resources:**  While less likely within Harness itself, attackers might look for publicly accessible dashboards or APIs that reveal information about user roles or permissions.
    * **Social Engineering:** Tricking legitimate users into revealing information about their roles and permissions.

**2. This allows them to compromise user accounts (through phishing, credential stuffing, etc.) and use those accounts to perform malicious actions, such as modifying deployment pipelines or accessing secrets.**

* **Compromising User Accounts:**  Weak access controls create a larger attack surface for account compromise. If a user has excessive permissions, compromising their account becomes a more valuable target for attackers. Common methods include:
    * **Phishing:** Crafting deceptive emails or messages to trick users into revealing their credentials. The impact is amplified if the targeted user has elevated privileges.
    * **Credential Stuffing:** Using lists of previously compromised usernames and passwords from other breaches to attempt logins on Harness. The lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) exacerbates this risk.
    * **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Attempting to guess passwords, especially if password policies are weak or not enforced.
    * **Insider Threats:**  Malicious or negligent insiders with excessive permissions can directly exploit these weaknesses.
    * **Software Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the user's endpoint or browser to steal credentials.

* **Malicious Actions Enabled by Compromised Accounts:** Once an attacker gains access with a compromised account that has excessive permissions, the potential damage is significant:
    * **Modifying Deployment Pipelines:**
        * **Injecting Malicious Code:**  Altering pipeline stages to introduce backdoors, malware, or vulnerabilities into the deployed application.
        * **Deploying Compromised Versions:**  Rolling back to vulnerable versions of the application or deploying entirely malicious builds.
        * **Disrupting Deployments:**  Introducing errors or delays to disrupt the software delivery process.
        * **Changing Deployment Targets:**  Redirecting deployments to attacker-controlled infrastructure.
    * **Accessing Secrets:**
        * **Stealing API Keys and Credentials:**  Accessing secrets stored within Harness, such as database credentials, API keys for third-party services, and cloud provider credentials. This can lead to further compromise of connected systems.
        * **Exfiltrating Sensitive Data:**  Using the compromised credentials to access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored within the deployed applications or connected services.
    * **Manipulating Configurations:**
        * **Changing Infrastructure Settings:**  Modifying infrastructure configurations managed through Harness, potentially creating vulnerabilities or disrupting services.
        * **Altering Security Settings:**  Disabling security features or audit logging within Harness to cover their tracks.
    * **Creating New Malicious Users:**  Adding new users with high privileges to maintain persistent access.
    * **Deleting Critical Resources:**  Deleting pipelines, environments, or other critical Harness resources to cause disruption.

**Impact Assessment:**

The successful exploitation of weak access controls in Harness can have severe consequences:

* **Security Breaches:**  Compromised deployments can lead to data breaches, exposing sensitive customer information or intellectual property.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Injecting malicious code into the deployment pipeline can lead to supply chain attacks, impacting downstream users of the software.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Security incidents can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
* **Financial Losses:**  Breaches can result in significant financial losses due to fines, remediation costs, and business disruption.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to implement proper access controls can lead to violations of industry regulations and compliance standards.
* **Loss of Control over Deployment Process:**  Attackers can gain control over the entire software delivery lifecycle, undermining its integrity and reliability.

**Root Causes and Contributing Factors:**

Several factors can contribute to the existence of weak access controls:

* **Lack of Awareness and Training:**  Development and operations teams might not fully understand the importance of proper access controls and the potential risks of misconfigurations.
* **Complexity of RBAC Systems:**  Implementing and managing complex RBAC systems can be challenging, leading to errors and oversights.
* **Time Constraints and Pressure:**  Teams under pressure to deliver quickly might prioritize functionality over security, leading to shortcuts in access control implementation.
* **Insufficient Security Reviews:**  Lack of regular security reviews and audits of user roles and permissions.
* **Poorly Defined Roles and Responsibilities:**  Unclear definitions of user roles and responsibilities can lead to inconsistent and overly broad permissions.
* **Inadequate Tooling and Automation:**  Lack of tools and automation to manage and monitor access controls effectively.
* **Default Configurations Not Hardened:**  Relying on default configurations without proper hardening.
