## Deep Analysis: Compromise Artifact Registry Connected to Harness (via Vulnerable Integrations)

This analysis delves into the attack tree path "Compromise Artifact Registry Connected to Harness (via Vulnerable Integrations)," exploring the potential attack vectors, impact, and mitigation strategies. We will focus on the scenario where attackers successfully compromise an artifact registry that Harness integrates with to pull deployment artifacts.

**Attack Tree Path Breakdown:**

**Root Node:** Compromise Artifact Registry Connected to Harness (via Vulnerable Integrations)

**Child Node:** Attackers compromise an artifact registry from which Harness pulls deployment artifacts.

**Grandchild Node:** They can replace legitimate application artifacts with malicious ones, leading to the deployment of compromised software.

**Detailed Analysis:**

This attack path highlights a critical vulnerability in the software supply chain. Harness, as a Continuous Delivery platform, relies on trusted sources for the artifacts it deploys. If that trust is broken, the entire deployment pipeline becomes a potential vector for malicious activity.

**1. Compromise of the Artifact Registry:**

This is the initial and crucial step in the attack. Attackers can leverage various vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the artifact registry. These vulnerabilities can exist within the registry software itself, its infrastructure, or the integration points with Harness.

**Possible Attack Vectors for Registry Compromise:**

* **Weak Credentials:** Default or easily guessable usernames and passwords for registry accounts (including service accounts used by Harness).
* **Software Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the artifact registry software (e.g., Docker Registry, Artifactory, Nexus). This could involve remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities.
* **Insecure API Endpoints:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the registry's API, allowing unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of artifacts.
* **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent insiders with legitimate access to the registry.
* **Network Attacks:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure hosting the registry, allowing attackers to gain access to the system.
* **Supply Chain Attacks on the Registry:** Compromising dependencies or third-party libraries used by the artifact registry software itself.
* **Compromised Integration Credentials:**  If the credentials used by Harness to access the registry (e.g., API keys, tokens) are compromised, attackers can use these to manipulate the registry.

**2. Replacement of Legitimate Artifacts:**

Once the attacker has gained access to the artifact registry, their primary goal in this attack path is to replace legitimate application artifacts with malicious ones. This could involve:

* **Direct Upload of Malicious Artifacts:** Uploading compromised Docker images, JAR files, or other deployment artifacts with the same name and version as legitimate ones.
* **Modification of Existing Artifacts:** Injecting malicious code or dependencies into existing, legitimate artifacts. This can be harder to detect.
* **Manipulation of Metadata:** Altering artifact tags, versions, or checksums to trick Harness into deploying the malicious version.
* **Deletion of Legitimate Artifacts:** Removing legitimate artifacts, potentially forcing Harness to pull a previously uploaded malicious version or causing deployment failures.

**3. Deployment of Compromised Software:**

After the malicious artifacts are in place, Harness, operating under the assumption that the registry is a trusted source, will pull these compromised artifacts and deploy them to the target environment. This leads to the execution of malicious code within the application infrastructure.

**Impact of Successful Attack:**

The consequences of this attack can be severe and far-reaching:

* **Data Breach:** The deployed malicious software could be designed to steal sensitive data from the application environment.
* **System Compromise:** Attackers could gain control of the servers and infrastructure where the compromised application is running.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** The malicious artifact could contain code that disrupts the application's functionality or overloads resources.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Financial Losses:**  Recovery from such an attack can be costly, involving incident response, system remediation, and potential legal repercussions.
* **Supply Chain Contamination:** The compromised application could further infect downstream systems and users.

**Likelihood and Severity:**

The likelihood of this attack depends on the security posture of the artifact registry and the robustness of the integration between Harness and the registry. If the registry has weak security controls or the integration is poorly configured, the likelihood increases significantly.

The severity of the attack is high due to the potential for widespread impact and significant damage.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate this attack path, a multi-layered approach is necessary, focusing on securing both the artifact registry and the integration with Harness.
