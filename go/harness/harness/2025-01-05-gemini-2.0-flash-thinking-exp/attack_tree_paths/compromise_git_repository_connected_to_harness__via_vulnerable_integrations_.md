## Deep Analysis: Compromise Git Repository Connected to Harness (via Vulnerable Integrations)

This analysis delves into the attack path "Compromise Git Repository Connected to Harness (via Vulnerable Integrations)," outlining the steps, potential attack vectors, impact, and mitigation strategies. We will focus on the specific context of Harness as a CI/CD platform and how this attack path can be exploited.

**Attack Tree Path:**

* **Compromise Git Repository Connected to Harness (via Vulnerable Integrations)**
    * **Attackers compromise a Git repository that Harness uses as a source code provider.**
        * **They can then inject malicious code into branches used by Harness, which will be included in subsequent builds and deployments.**

**Detailed Breakdown:**

This attack path represents a **supply chain attack** targeting the software development lifecycle. Instead of directly attacking the Harness platform, attackers target a trusted external dependency â€“ the Git repository containing the application's source code. Harness, like many CI/CD platforms, relies on these repositories as the source of truth for building and deploying applications.

**Step 1: Attackers compromise a Git repository connected to Harness.**

This is the initial and crucial step. Attackers aim to gain unauthorized access to the Git repository that Harness is configured to use. This can be achieved through various attack vectors:

* **Vulnerable Integrations:** This is explicitly mentioned in the attack path name. Harness integrates with Git providers (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) using various methods (API keys, SSH keys, OAuth tokens). Vulnerabilities in these integration points can be exploited:
    * **Stolen or leaked API keys/tokens:** If these credentials are compromised, attackers can impersonate Harness and manipulate the repository.
    * **Misconfigured OAuth permissions:**  Overly permissive OAuth scopes granted to Harness can allow attackers to perform actions beyond what's necessary.
    * **Vulnerabilities in the Git provider's API:** If the Git provider itself has vulnerabilities, attackers might leverage them to gain access to repositories.
* **Compromised Developer Accounts:** Attackers might target individual developers with access to the repository through:
    * **Phishing attacks:** Tricking developers into revealing their credentials.
    * **Malware infections:** Stealing credentials stored on developer machines.
    * **Social engineering:** Manipulating developers into granting access or performing malicious actions.
    * **Weak or reused passwords:** Exploiting poor password hygiene.
* **Insider Threats:** A malicious insider with legitimate access to the repository could intentionally inject malicious code.
* **Compromised CI/CD Infrastructure (indirectly):** While not directly targeting the Git repository, attackers might compromise other parts of the CI/CD infrastructure that have write access to the repository.
* **Software Vulnerabilities in Git Clients or Servers:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Git software itself, although less common, is a possibility.

**Step 2: They can then inject malicious code into branches used by Harness.**

Once access is gained, attackers can manipulate the repository's contents. Key actions include:

* **Identifying target branches:** Attackers will focus on branches that Harness uses for building and deploying applications (e.g., `main`, `release` branches, feature branches integrated into the pipeline).
* **Injecting malicious code:** This can take various forms:
    * **Backdoors:**  Code that allows persistent remote access to the deployed application or infrastructure.
    * **Data exfiltration code:** Code designed to steal sensitive data.
    * **Supply chain malware:**  Introducing malicious dependencies or libraries.
    * **Cryptominers:**  Utilizing the deployed infrastructure for cryptocurrency mining.
    * **Ransomware:**  Encrypting data and demanding a ransom.
    * **Code that disrupts application functionality:** Causing denial of service or other operational issues.
* **Creating malicious commits and pull requests:** Attackers will attempt to blend their malicious code into legitimate changes, potentially using similar coding styles or commenting patterns.
* **Bypassing code review processes:** If code reviews are in place, attackers might try to exploit weaknesses in the process or target reviewers with social engineering.

**Impact of a Successful Attack:**

The consequences of this attack path can be severe and far-reaching:

* **Compromised Deployed Applications:** Malicious code injected into the repository will be included in subsequent builds and deployments managed by Harness. This leads to the deployment of compromised applications, potentially affecting end-users and the organization's infrastructure.
* **Data Breaches:**  Malicious code can be designed to steal sensitive data from the deployed application or the underlying infrastructure.
* **Service Disruption:**  Attackers can introduce code that disrupts the application's functionality, leading to downtime and loss of revenue.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach stemming from a compromised supply chain can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
* **Financial Losses:**  Recovery efforts, legal liabilities, and loss of business can result in significant financial losses.
* **Supply Chain Contamination:** If the compromised application is part of a larger ecosystem or used by other organizations, the malicious code can spread further.
* **Loss of Trust in the CI/CD Pipeline:**  A successful attack can undermine trust in the entire CI/CD process, requiring significant effort to rebuild confidence.

**Detection Strategies:**

Identifying this type of attack can be challenging but is crucial:

* **Git Repository Monitoring:**
    * **Monitoring commit history for suspicious changes:** Look for unexpected commits, changes from unfamiliar users, or large code additions without proper review.
    * **Tracking branch activity:** Monitor for unauthorized branch creation, deletion, or merges.
    * **Analyzing commit metadata:** Examine author information, timestamps, and commit messages for anomalies.
* **Harness Audit Logs:**
    * **Monitoring pipeline executions:** Look for unexpected pipeline runs, changes to pipeline configurations, or deployments to unauthorized environments.
    * **Analyzing integration activity:** Review logs related to the connection between Harness and the Git repository for suspicious authentication attempts or API calls.
* **Code Review Processes:**
    * **Thorough code reviews:** Implement robust code review processes to catch malicious code before it's merged.
    * **Automated code analysis (SAST):** Utilize Static Application Security Testing tools to scan code for potential vulnerabilities and malicious patterns.
* **Dependency Scanning:**
    * **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Attackers might introduce vulnerable dependencies as part of their malicious code.
* **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):**  RASP solutions can detect and block malicious activity within the running application, potentially mitigating the impact even if malicious code is deployed.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Correlate logs from various sources (Git repository, Harness, application logs) to identify suspicious patterns and potential attacks.
* **Anomaly Detection:**  Establish baselines for normal repository activity and alert on deviations.

**Prevention Strategies:**

Proactive measures are essential to prevent this attack path:

* **Secure Git Repository Management:**
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Git repository accounts. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to necessary personnel.
