## Deep Analysis: Modify Deployment Pipelines/Configurations (Harness)

This analysis delves into the attack path "Modify Deployment Pipelines/Configurations" within the context of a Harness-powered application deployment environment. We will explore the technical details, potential impact, mitigation strategies, and detection methods associated with this attack.

**Attack Tree Path:**

**Root Node:** Modify Deployment Pipelines/Configurations

* **Child Node:** Attackers gain access to the Harness control plane and alter pipeline definitions or configurations.
    * **Leaf Node:** This allows them to inject malicious code, scripts, or configurations that will be executed during the deployment process, directly compromising the application.

**Deep Dive Analysis:**

This attack path represents a critical vulnerability in the application deployment lifecycle managed by Harness. By successfully gaining unauthorized access and modifying deployment pipelines or configurations, attackers can bypass traditional security measures and directly influence the deployed application.

**Phase 1: Gaining Access to the Harness Control Plane**

This is the initial and crucial step for the attacker. Several methods can be employed to achieve this:

* **Credential Compromise:**
    * **Stolen Credentials:** Attackers might obtain valid usernames and passwords through phishing attacks, social engineering, or data breaches of related services.
    * **Weak Passwords:** Usage of default or easily guessable passwords for Harness accounts.
    * **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Absence of MFA significantly weakens account security.
    * **Compromised API Keys/Tokens:** If Harness API keys or tokens are exposed or stolen, attackers can authenticate programmatically.
* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Harness:**
    * **Zero-day or Known Vulnerabilities:** Attackers might exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in the Harness platform itself. This requires timely patching and staying updated with security advisories.
* **Insider Threat:**
    * **Malicious Insiders:** Individuals with legitimate access might intentionally modify pipelines for malicious purposes.
    * **Compromised Insider Accounts:** An attacker might compromise the account of a legitimate user with sufficient permissions.
* **API Abuse:**
    * **Exploiting API Endpoints:**  Attackers might leverage vulnerabilities in the Harness API to gain unauthorized access or manipulate configurations.
    * **Lack of Proper Authorization and Authentication:** Weaknesses in API security can allow unauthorized actions.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**
    * **Compromised Integrations:** If Harness integrates with other systems (e.g., version control, artifact repositories) and these integrations are compromised, attackers might gain indirect access to Harness.

**Phase 2: Altering Pipeline Definitions or Configurations**

Once access to the Harness control plane is gained, attackers can manipulate pipeline definitions and configurations in various ways:

* **Direct Modification via the Harness UI:** If the attacker gains access to a user account with sufficient permissions, they can directly edit pipeline configurations through the Harness web interface.
* **API-Driven Modifications:** Attackers can use the Harness API to programmatically alter pipeline definitions. This allows for automated and potentially more stealthy changes.
* **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Manipulation:** If pipelines are defined using IaC tools (e.g., Terraform), attackers might target the repositories storing these definitions. Modifying the IaC and triggering an update can alter the pipeline configuration in Harness.

**Phase 3: Injecting Malicious Code, Scripts, or Configurations**

This is the payload delivery stage where the attacker's malicious intent is realized. Examples of malicious injections include:

* **Adding Malicious Steps to Pipelines:**
    * **Pre-deployment or Post-deployment Scripts:** Injecting scripts that execute arbitrary commands on the target environment before or after the actual application deployment. This could involve installing backdoors, exfiltrating data, or modifying system configurations.
    * **Container Image Manipulation:** Altering the container image being deployed to include malware or vulnerabilities. This could involve replacing the base image or adding malicious layers.
    * **Modifying Deployment Strategies:** Changing the deployment strategy to introduce vulnerabilities or create backdoors in the deployed application.
* **Modifying Environment Variables or Secrets:**
    * **Injecting Malicious Environment Variables:** Introducing environment variables that alter the application's behavior in a harmful way.
    * **Exposing or Replacing Secrets:** Gaining access to sensitive secrets used by the application or replacing them with attacker-controlled values.
* **Altering Artifact Sources:**
    * **Pointing to Compromised Repositories:** Changing the pipeline to pull artifacts from a repository controlled by the attacker, containing malicious code.
* **Introducing Backdoors:**
    * **Deploying Backdoor Applications:** Injecting a completely separate malicious application alongside the intended application.
    * **Embedding Backdoors in the Application:** Modifying the application code during the deployment process to include backdoors for persistent access.
* **Disabling Security Controls:**
    * **Removing Security Checks:** Altering pipeline steps that perform security scans or vulnerability assessments.
    * **Disabling Monitoring or Logging:** Preventing the detection of their malicious activities.

**Potential Impact:**

The consequences of a successful attack through this path can be severe:

* **Complete Application Compromise:** Attackers gain control over the deployed application and its underlying infrastructure.
* **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data stored or processed by the application.
* **Supply Chain Contamination:** If the compromised application is part of a larger ecosystem or used by other applications, the attack can spread.
* **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust and brand image.
* **Financial Losses:** Costs associated with incident response, recovery, and potential fines.
* **Service Disruption:** Denial of service or disruption of critical business operations.
* **Malware Distribution:** Using the compromised application as a platform to distribute malware to users or other systems.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

A layered security approach is crucial to mitigate the risk of this attack path:

* **Strong Access Control and Authentication:**
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement granular permissions to limit who can access and modify Harness pipelines and configurations.
