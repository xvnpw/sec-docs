## Deep Analysis: Abuse of Custom Shell Steps in Harness Pipelines

This analysis delves into the attack path "Abuse of Custom Shell Steps" within the context of a Harness deployment pipeline. We'll break down the mechanics, potential impact, necessary prerequisites, detection methods, and mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

The core of this attack lies in leveraging the flexibility of Harness's custom shell steps for malicious purposes. Harness allows users to define arbitrary shell commands to be executed within their deployment pipelines. While this provides powerful customization, it also introduces a potential vulnerability if not properly secured.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Attacker Goal:** The attacker aims to achieve arbitrary code execution on the target deployment environment (e.g., servers, containers, cloud instances) managed by the Harness pipeline. This allows them to compromise the application, its data, or the underlying infrastructure.

2. **Prerequisite: Sufficient Permissions:** This is the critical enabler. The attacker needs the ability to modify pipeline definitions within the Harness platform. This typically translates to:
    * **Direct Access to Harness UI/API:** Credentials or API keys that grant write access to pipelines.
    * **Compromised User Account:** An authorized user's account with the necessary permissions has been compromised (phishing, credential stuffing, etc.).
    * **Insider Threat:** A malicious actor with legitimate access to the Harness platform.
    * **Exploitation of Harness Vulnerability:** While less likely for this specific attack path, a vulnerability in Harness itself could potentially allow unauthorized modification of pipelines.

3. **Mechanism: Malicious Command Injection:** Once the attacker has the necessary permissions, they can modify an existing or create a new pipeline and insert a custom shell step containing malicious commands. These commands can be anything executable within the shell environment of the deployment target. Examples include:
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Commands to copy sensitive data to an external location.
    * **Backdoor Installation:**  Creating new user accounts, installing remote access tools, or modifying system configurations to allow persistent access.
    * **Resource Hijacking:**  Utilizing the deployment target's resources for cryptocurrency mining or other malicious activities.
    * **Application Tampering:** Modifying application code, configurations, or data.
    * **Lateral Movement:** Using the compromised target as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Commands to overload the target system, making the application unavailable.

4. **Execution during Deployment:** The crucial aspect is that these malicious commands are executed *during the deployment process*. This means they run with the privileges and within the environment of the deployment target. Harness orchestrates the execution of these steps as part of its deployment workflow.

5. **Potential Impact:** The consequences of this attack can be severe:
    * **Application Compromise:**  Direct control over the application, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and manipulation of functionality.
    * **Data Breach:** Exfiltration of sensitive customer data, intellectual property, or internal business information.
    * **Infrastructure Compromise:**  Control over the underlying servers, containers, or cloud resources, potentially impacting other applications and services.
    * **Supply Chain Attack:** If the compromised application is part of a larger supply chain, the attacker could use it to propagate attacks to other organizations.
    * **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of customer trust and brand damage due to security incidents.
    * **Financial Losses:** Costs associated with incident response, data recovery, legal fees, and regulatory fines.
    * **Service Disruption:**  Downtime and unavailability of the application.

**Security Considerations and Mitigation Strategies:**

To defend against this attack path, a multi-layered approach is necessary:

* **Robust Access Control (RBAC):** Implement granular role-based access control within Harness.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Restrict who can modify pipeline definitions, especially in production environments.
    * **Regular Review of Permissions:** Periodically audit user roles and permissions to ensure they are still appropriate.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all Harness users to prevent unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.

* **Pipeline Security Best Practices:**
    * **Code Review for Pipeline Definitions:** Treat pipeline definitions as code and subject them to review processes before deployment. Look for suspicious or unexpected commands in custom shell steps.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** If custom shell steps take user input, rigorously validate and sanitize that input to prevent command injection vulnerabilities within the step itself.
    * **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Strive for immutable infrastructure where changes are deployed as new instances rather than modifying existing ones. This limits the impact of malicious commands on persistent systems.
    * **Secure Secrets Management:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials within pipeline definitions or custom shell steps. Utilize Harness's built-in secrets management features or integrate with external secret stores.

* **Monitoring and Detection:**
    * **Audit Logging:** Enable and actively monitor Harness audit logs for changes to pipeline definitions, especially modifications to custom shell steps. Look for unusual user activity or unexpected changes.
    * **Runtime Security Monitoring:** Implement security solutions on the deployment targets to detect and prevent malicious commands from executing. This could include Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools or container security platforms.
    * **Anomaly Detection:** Establish baselines for normal pipeline behavior and alert on deviations, such as the introduction of new or unusual commands in custom shell steps.
    * **Integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Forward Harness audit logs and security events to a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and analysis.

* **Secure Development Practices:**
    * **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers and DevOps engineers about the risks associated with insecure pipeline configurations and the importance of secure coding practices.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct periodic security assessments of the Harness platform and its configurations to identify potential vulnerabilities.

* **Harness Specific Features:**
    * **Approval Workflows:** Implement approval workflows for changes to critical pipelines, requiring a second pair of eyes before modifications are deployed.
    * **Pipeline Governance Policies:** Utilize Harness's governance features to enforce security policies and restrictions on pipeline configurations.
    * **Integration with Security Tools:** Leverage Harness's integrations with security scanning tools to automatically analyze pipeline definitions for potential vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

The "Abuse of Custom Shell Steps" attack path highlights the inherent risks associated with powerful automation tools like Harness. While custom shell steps offer valuable flexibility, they also present a significant attack surface if not properly secured. By implementing robust access controls, adhering to pipeline security best practices, and leveraging monitoring and detection mechanisms, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this type of attack. A proactive and layered security approach is crucial to maintaining the integrity and security of applications deployed through Harness. Regularly reviewing and updating security measures in response to evolving threats is also essential.
