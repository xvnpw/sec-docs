## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Modify Deployment Pipelines (via Weak Access Controls)

This analysis delves into the attack tree path "Modify Deployment Pipelines (via Weak Access Controls)" within the context of an application using Harness for its CI/CD. We will break down the attack, explore its implications, and suggest mitigation strategies.

**Attack Tree Path:**

**Modify Deployment Pipelines (via Weak Access Controls)**

* **A consequence of weak access controls.** Attackers with compromised credentials modify deployment pipelines.
    * **Allows injection of malicious stages, steps, or scripts into the deployment process.**

**Deep Dive Analysis:**

This attack path highlights a critical vulnerability stemming from inadequate access control mechanisms within the Harness platform. It leverages the principle that if access to modify critical infrastructure like deployment pipelines is not properly secured, attackers can exploit this weakness to inject malicious components.

**1. Root Cause: Weak Access Controls**

* **Description:** This is the foundational vulnerability enabling the attack. Weak access controls can manifest in several ways:
    * **Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Users are granted excessive permissions beyond what is necessary for their roles. This could mean developers having the ability to modify production deployment pipelines, or even non-developers having write access to pipeline configurations.
    * **Default or Weak Credentials:**  Failure to change default credentials for administrative accounts or the use of easily guessable passwords makes accounts vulnerable to brute-force attacks or credential stuffing.
    * **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Even with strong passwords, the absence of MFA significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or other social engineering tactics.
    * **Inadequate Session Management:** Long-lived or poorly secured sessions can be hijacked by attackers.
    * **Lack of Regular Access Reviews:**  Permissions might become stale over time, with users retaining access they no longer require.
    * **Overly Permissive API Keys or Tokens:** If Harness API keys or tokens used for automation are not properly managed and secured, they can be exploited to gain unauthorized access.

**2. Action: Attackers with compromised credentials modify deployment pipelines.**

* **Description:** Once attackers gain access to a Harness account with sufficient privileges (due to the weak access controls), they can directly manipulate the deployment pipeline configurations. This can be achieved through:
    * **Harness UI:**  Directly logging into the Harness UI and modifying pipeline definitions.
    * **Harness API:** Utilizing the Harness API to programmatically alter pipeline configurations. This is particularly concerning if API keys are compromised.
    * **Harness CLI:** Using the Harness CLI tool with compromised credentials to make changes.
* **Attack Vectors for Credential Compromise:**
    * **Phishing:** Deceiving users into revealing their credentials through fake login pages or emails.
    * **Malware:** Infecting user machines with keyloggers or information stealers.
    * **Brute-force Attacks:** Repeatedly trying different password combinations.
    * **Credential Stuffing:** Using previously compromised credentials from other breaches.
    * **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent insiders with legitimate access.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromising the credentials of third-party vendors with access to the Harness environment.

**3. Consequence: Allows injection of malicious stages, steps, or scripts into the deployment process.**

* **Description:** This is the core impact of the attack. By modifying the pipeline, attackers can introduce malicious elements that will be executed during the deployment process. This can take various forms:
    * **Injecting Malicious Stages:** Adding entirely new stages to the pipeline that perform malicious actions before, during, or after the legitimate deployment. For example, a stage to exfiltrate sensitive data after a successful deployment.
    * **Injecting Malicious Steps within Existing Stages:** Modifying existing stages by adding steps that execute malicious scripts or commands. This could involve:
        * **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data from the deployment environment or the application being deployed.
        * **Backdoor Installation:** Deploying persistent backdoors into the application or infrastructure.
        * **Resource Hijacking:** Utilizing deployment resources for cryptomining or other malicious purposes.
        * **Supply Chain Poisoning:** Introducing vulnerabilities or malicious components into the software being deployed, affecting downstream users.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupting the deployment process or the application itself.
        * **Privilege Escalation:** Leveraging the deployment context to gain higher privileges within the infrastructure.
    * **Modifying Existing Scripts:** Altering existing scripts within the pipeline to include malicious code. This can be subtle and difficult to detect.
    * **Introducing Malicious Artifacts:**  Changing the source of deployment artifacts to include compromised versions of the application or its dependencies.

**Impact Analysis:**

The successful execution of this attack path can have severe consequences:

* **Compromise of the Application:** The injected malicious code can directly compromise the application being deployed, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, or other security incidents.
* **Compromise of the Deployment Infrastructure:** Attackers can leverage the deployment process to gain access to the underlying infrastructure, potentially compromising other applications or systems.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** If the deployed application is used by other organizations or individuals, the injected malicious code can propagate, leading to widespread compromise.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
* **Financial Losses:**  Incident response, recovery efforts, legal liabilities, and loss of business can result in significant financial losses.
* **Compliance Violations:** Depending on the industry and regulations, such an attack could lead to significant fines and penalties.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent this attack path, organizations should implement robust security measures focusing on strengthening access controls and monitoring pipeline activity:

* **Strong Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement granular RBAC within Harness, adhering to the principle of least privilege. Ensure users only have the necessary permissions for their specific roles. Regularly review and update access controls.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all Harness users, especially those with administrative or pipeline modification privileges.
* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong, unique passwords and encourage the use of password managers.
* **Regular Access Reviews:** Conduct periodic reviews of user access and permissions to identify and remove unnecessary privileges.
* **Secure API Key Management:** Implement secure storage and rotation practices for Harness API keys. Restrict their scope and usage as much as possible. Consider using short-lived tokens where feasible.
* **Audit Logging and Monitoring:** Enable comprehensive audit logging within Harness to track all pipeline modifications and user activity. Implement alerts for suspicious activity.
* **Pipeline Configuration as Code:** Treat pipeline configurations as code and store them in version control systems. This allows for tracking changes, performing code reviews, and reverting to previous versions if necessary.
* **Code Reviews for Pipeline Changes:** Implement a review process for any changes made to deployment pipelines, similar to code reviews for application code.
* **Immutable Infrastructure:** Where possible, leverage immutable infrastructure principles to limit the ability to modify deployed environments directly.
* **Secrets Management:** Utilize Harness's built-in secrets management capabilities to securely store and manage sensitive credentials used within pipelines. Avoid hardcoding secrets in pipeline definitions.
* **Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing:** Regularly scan the Harness environment for vulnerabilities and conduct penetration testing to identify weaknesses in access controls and pipeline security.
* **Security Training:** Educate developers and operations teams about the risks associated with weak access controls and the importance of secure pipeline management.
* **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Harness environment and the deployment infrastructure from less trusted networks.
* **Implement Approval Stages:**  Require manual approvals for critical pipeline stages, especially those deploying to production environments. This adds a human review step before potentially malicious changes can be executed.

**Specific Harness Considerations:**

* **Leverage Harness Audit Trails:** Regularly review the audit trails to identify any unauthorized modifications to pipelines or access control settings.
* **Utilize Harness Governance Features:** Explore and implement Harness's governance features to enforce security policies and controls across pipelines.
* **Integrate with Identity Providers (IdPs):** Integrate Harness with a centralized identity provider for streamlined user management and enhanced security.
* **Harness Security Best Practices:** Refer to Harness's official documentation and security best practices for specific guidance on securing the platform.

**Conclusion:**

The "Modify Deployment Pipelines (via Weak Access Controls)" attack path represents a significant threat to applications using Harness for CI/CD. By exploiting weak access controls, attackers can inject malicious code into the deployment process, leading to severe consequences. A proactive and layered security approach, focusing on strong access controls, continuous monitoring, and adherence to security best practices, is crucial to mitigate this risk and ensure the integrity and security of the application and its deployment pipeline. Organizations using Harness must prioritize securing access to their pipelines as a fundamental aspect of their overall security posture.
