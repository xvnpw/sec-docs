**Attack Tree Path:** Gain Unauthorized Access to Harness Control Plane

**Description:** This pivotal point represents a successful compromise of the authentication and authorization mechanisms protecting the Harness Control Plane. Achieving this grants the attacker significant control over the entire Harness ecosystem.

**Detailed Breakdown of Potential Attack Vectors:**

To successfully gain unauthorized access, an attacker would likely exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in one or more of the following areas:

**1. Credential Compromise:**

* **1.1. Phishing for User Credentials:**
    * **Description:** Tricking legitimate Harness users into revealing their usernames and passwords through deceptive emails, websites, or other communication channels. This could target individual developers, administrators, or even service accounts.
    * **Technical Details:** Attackers might create fake login pages mimicking the Harness UI, send emails with malicious links, or use social engineering tactics to gain trust.
    * **Impact:** Direct access to the Harness Control Plane with the permissions associated with the compromised user account.
    * **Harness Specific Considerations:**  Targeting users with high-level permissions (e.g., Organization Admins, Account Admins) would be particularly impactful.

* **1.2. Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks:**
    * **Description:** Using lists of known username/password combinations (credential stuffing) or systematically trying different passwords (brute-force) against the Harness login portal or API endpoints.
    * **Technical Details:**  Automated tools are used to attempt numerous login attempts. Success depends on weak or reused passwords.
    * **Impact:**  Gaining access to accounts with weak credentials.
    * **Harness Specific Considerations:**  Rate limiting and account lockout policies are crucial defenses against these attacks. The strength of password policies enforced by Harness is also a factor.

* **1.3. Compromised Developer Workstations/Environments:**
    * **Description:**  Attackers compromise developer machines or development environments that have stored Harness credentials (e.g., in configuration files, scripts, or browser history).
    * **Technical Details:** Malware, vulnerabilities in development tools, or insecure practices can lead to credential theft.
    * **Impact:**  Access to Harness using the stolen credentials.
    * **Harness Specific Considerations:**  Developers often interact with Harness through the UI, CLI, or APIs, making their workstations potential targets for credential theft.
