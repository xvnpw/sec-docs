---

##### 1.1.1. Unauthorized Access to Harness Project/Pipeline Settings [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Node Description:** This critical node highlights the fundamental requirement for attackers to gain unauthorized access to the Harness platform's project and pipeline configuration settings to proceed with pipeline manipulation. This is a gateway node, as without this access, further attacks in this path become significantly harder.
*   **Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to the Harness platform's project and pipeline configuration settings. This is a gateway node to pipeline manipulation.
*   **Exploitation:** Exploiting weak user credentials, lack of MFA, insufficient RBAC, or vulnerabilities in the Harness UI/API. Attackers may use techniques like brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, phishing, social engineering, or exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain access.
*   **Impact:** **High** - Enables pipeline configuration manipulation and further attacks. Successful unauthorized access directly opens the door to modifying pipeline configurations, injecting malicious code, and compromising deployments.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies, including complexity requirements, regular password changes, and prohibit password reuse.
    *   **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):**  Mandate MFA for all Harness user accounts, especially administrators and users with pipeline modification permissions.

---

###### 1.1.1.1. Weak Harness User Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Node Description:** This critical node focuses on the vulnerability arising from weak user credentials used to access Harness accounts. Weak passwords are easily compromised and are a common entry point for attackers.
*   **Attack Vector:** Using easily guessable or compromised usernames and passwords to gain access to Harness accounts.
*   **Exploitation:** Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing (using lists of compromised credentials from other breaches), or password guessing. Attackers may also leverage social engineering or phishing to trick users into revealing their passwords.
*   **Impact:** **High** - Account takeover leading to unauthorized access to Harness. Compromised accounts can be used to manipulate pipelines, access sensitive data, and disrupt deployments.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement and enforce robust password policies, including:
        *   **Password Complexity Requirements:** Mandate minimum password length, and require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
        *   **Password History:** Prevent users from reusing recently used passwords.
        *   **Regular Password Expiration (with caution):** While password expiration can be helpful, frequent forced changes can lead to users choosing weaker passwords. Consider risk-based password rotation instead.
    *   **Password Complexity Requirements:** (Redundant, already covered above, but emphasizes importance)
    *   **Account Lockout Mechanisms:** Implement account lockout policies to automatically disable accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts, mitigating brute-force attacks.

    *   **Security Awareness Training:** Educate users about the importance of strong passwords and the risks of using weak or reused passwords.

---

###### 1.1.1.2. Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Harness Accounts [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Node Description:** This critical node highlights the security gap created by the absence of MFA on Harness accounts. MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond just username and password, making account takeover significantly more difficult.
*   **Attack Vector:** Bypassing single-factor authentication (username/password only) to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Exploitation:** Credential theft via phishing, malware, or social engineering becomes much more effective without MFA. Even if an attacker obtains a valid username and password, MFA prevents them from gaining access without the second factor (e.g., a code from a mobile app, a security key).
*   **Impact:** **High** - Increased risk of account takeover. Without MFA, a compromised password is often sufficient for full account access, leading to all the impacts of unauthorized access.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Mandate MFA for all Harness User Accounts:**  This is the most critical mitigation. Enable and enforce MFA for all users, especially administrators and those with pipeline modification permissions.
    *   **Support Multiple MFA Methods:** Offer a variety of MFA methods to accommodate user preferences and security needs (e.g., authenticator apps, SMS codes, security keys).
    *   **Prioritize MFA for High-Privilege Accounts:** Ensure MFA is enabled for all administrator accounts and users with permissions to modify pipelines or access sensitive data.
    *   **User Education on MFA:** Educate users on the benefits of MFA and how to set up and use it effectively.

---

###### 1.1.1.3. Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Harness [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Node Description:** This critical node addresses the risk of overly permissive RBAC configurations in Harness. Insufficient RBAC can grant users more permissions than necessary, allowing them to access and modify pipeline settings even if it's not part of their intended role.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting overly permissive user roles to gain access to functionalities or resources beyond what is necessary for a user's role, including pipeline modification.
*   **Exploitation:** Users with inappropriately broad permissions can modify pipelines, even if they shouldn't have direct pipeline administration roles. This can be due to default roles being too permissive, misconfigured custom roles, or failure to regularly review and adjust RBAC policies.
*   **Impact:** **High** - Privilege escalation and unauthorized pipeline modification.  Attackers can leverage compromised accounts with excessive permissions to manipulate pipelines, even if those accounts were not intended for pipeline administration.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Implement Granular RBAC:** Design and implement a granular RBAC model that aligns with the principle of least privilege. Define specific roles with narrowly scoped permissions.
    *   **Adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their job functions. Avoid assigning overly broad or default roles.
    *   **Regularly Review and Refine RBAC Policies:** Periodically review and audit RBAC policies to ensure they are still appropriate and effective. Adjust roles and permissions as user responsibilities change or new functionalities are introduced.
    *   **Role-Based Training:** Provide role-specific training to users to ensure they understand their assigned permissions and responsibilities.
    *   **Automated RBAC Management Tools:** Consider using automated tools to manage and enforce RBAC policies, simplifying administration and reducing the risk of misconfigurations.

---

##### 1.1.2. Pipeline Definition Injection [HIGH RISK PATH]

*   **Node Description:** This high-risk path focuses on injecting malicious code or commands directly into the pipeline definitions themselves. This can be achieved by manipulating external sources where pipeline definitions are stored or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Harness processes these definitions.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code or commands into pipeline definitions, often through manipulating external sources or exploiting lack of input validation.
*   **Exploitation:**  Compromising Git repositories where pipeline definitions are stored or exploiting vulnerabilities in how Harness processes pipeline definitions (lack of input sanitization). Attackers might modify YAML files in Git, inject malicious parameters via pipeline triggers, or exploit weaknesses in Harness's parsing of pipeline definitions.
*   **Impact:** **High** - Direct injection of malicious code into the deployment pipeline. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code during deployment, leading to application compromise, data breaches, or infrastructure attacks.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Secure Pipeline Definition Storage (Git):** Implement strong access controls on repositories where pipeline definitions are stored. Use branch protection, code review processes, and audit logging.
    *   **Implement Input Validation and Sanitization in Pipeline Definitions:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all inputs used in pipeline definitions, including parameters, variables, and external data sources.
    *   **Use Secure Coding Practices for Pipeline Scripts:**  Follow secure coding practices when writing scripts used in pipeline steps. Avoid using shell commands directly where possible and use parameterized commands or SDKs.
    *   **Static Analysis of Pipeline Definitions:** Utilize static analysis tools to scan pipeline definitions for potential security vulnerabilities, such as command injection flaws.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Secure Git Repositories with Strong Access Controls:** Implement robust access controls on Git repositories storing pipeline definitions.
        *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce strong authentication (MFA) for Git access and implement granular authorization based on roles and responsibilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to access and modify pipeline definition repositories.
    *   **Use Branch Protection:** Implement branch protection rules on the main branch (e.g., `main`, `master`) to prevent direct commits and require code reviews for all changes.
    *   **Implement Code Review Processes for Pipeline Definition Changes:** Mandate code reviews for all changes to pipeline definitions before they are merged into the main branch.
    *   **Audit Logging of Git Repository Access and Changes:** Enable audit logging for Git repository access and modifications to track who made changes and when.

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious commands or code within pipeline parameters or scripts that are not properly validated and sanitized by Harness during pipeline execution.
*   **Exploitation:** Providing malicious input through pipeline triggers, parameters, or external data sources that are incorporated into pipeline commands without proper sanitization. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Harness Delegate or deployment targets.
*   **Impact:** **High** - Command injection vulnerabilities leading to arbitrary code execution during deployment. Attackers can gain control of the deployment environment, access sensitive data, or disrupt deployments.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Implement Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all pipeline parameters and external inputs used in pipeline steps. This includes:
        *   **Input Type Validation:** Ensure inputs conform to expected data types (e.g., strings, numbers, enums).
        *   **Input Length Validation:** Limit the length of inputs to prevent buffer overflows or other issues.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize inputs to remove or escape potentially malicious characters or code (e.g., shell metacharacters, HTML tags).
        *   **Context-Specific Sanitization:** Apply sanitization appropriate to the context where the input is used (e.g., shell command, SQL query, HTML output).
    *   **Use Parameterized Commands and SDKs:**  Instead of directly constructing shell commands with user inputs, use parameterized commands or SDKs that handle input sanitization automatically.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Pipeline Execution:** Run pipeline steps with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Testing of Pipeline Definitions:** Conduct security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, of pipeline definitions to identify input validation flaws.
