*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow Harness's recommended security best practices for Delegate deployment and hardening.
    *   Regularly update the Delegate software to the latest version.
    *   Harden the infrastructure hosting the Delegate: use minimal OS, apply security patches, implement network segmentation (e.g., isolate Delegates in a dedicated network segment).
    *   Implement robust access controls to the Delegate host and restrict network access to only necessary services.
    *   Monitor Delegate logs and activity for suspicious behavior.
    *   Consider using ephemeral Delegates where possible to reduce the attack surface.
    *   Use dedicated service accounts with least privilege for the Delegate.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Delegate](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_delegate.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains initial limited access to the Delegate host (e.g., through a vulnerability in an application running on the same host or weak SSH credentials). They then exploit vulnerabilities in the Delegate software or the host OS to escalate their privileges to root or administrator, gaining full control of the Delegate host.
*   **Impact:** High. Full control over the Delegate host, potentially leading to Delegate compromise and further attacks on your infrastructure. The attacker can then leverage the Delegate's access to deployment environments and other resources.
*   **Affected Harness Component:** Harness Delegate (Software, Host OS)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to Delegate user accounts and processes. Run Delegate processes with minimal necessary permissions.
    *   Regularly patch the Delegate host operating system and all software running on it.
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) on the Delegate host.
    *   Restrict access to the Delegate host to only authorized personnel and use strong authentication methods.
    *   Perform regular vulnerability scanning on the Delegate host and software.

## Threat: [Compromised Connector Credentials](./threats/compromised_connector_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to credentials stored within Harness connectors. This could be through control plane compromise, insider threats, or vulnerabilities in Harness secret management.  Compromised credentials (API keys, access tokens, passwords) allow the attacker to authenticate as your Harness account to external services (Git, Cloud Providers, etc.).
*   **Impact:** Critical. Unauthorized access to connected external services, potentially leading to data breaches, resource manipulation (e.g., deleting cloud resources, modifying code repositories), and service disruption in those services.
*   **Affected Harness Component:** Harness Connectors (Credential Storage, Secret Management)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Harness's built-in secret management features to securely store connector credentials. Avoid storing secrets in plain text or external configuration files.
    *   Rotate connector credentials regularly according to security best practices.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to connector permissions, granting only the necessary access to external services.
    *   Regularly audit connector usage and access to identify and revoke unnecessary or unused connectors.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual activity on connected external services that might indicate compromised connector credentials.

## Threat: [Pipeline Tampering](./threats/pipeline_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access to pipeline definitions modifies them to inject malicious code, alter deployment processes, or exfiltrate data. This could be achieved through compromised Harness user accounts, insider threats, or vulnerabilities in pipeline management features.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Deployment of compromised application versions, introduction of backdoors into applications, data breaches through modified pipelines, and disruption of the CI/CD pipeline. Severe impact on application security and integrity.
*   **Affected Harness Component:** Harness Pipelines (Definition, Execution)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for pipeline editing and management. Restrict pipeline modification access to authorized personnel only.

    *   Store pipeline definitions as code in version control systems (Git) and follow code review processes for all pipeline changes.
    *   Implement pipeline approval workflows for critical changes, requiring review and approval from authorized personnel before changes are applied.
    *   Regularly audit pipeline definitions for unexpected or malicious modifications.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks via Pipeline Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_via_pipeline_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Pipelines rely on external dependencies such as scripts, tools, libraries, and artifacts downloaded from external sources. If these dependencies are compromised (e.g., malicious code injected into a public repository, compromised artifact registry), the pipeline will incorporate the malicious code into the application build and deployment process.
*   **Impact:** High. Deployment of applications containing malware or vulnerabilities, compromising the security of the application and its users. This can lead to data breaches, service disruption, and reputational damage.
*   **Affected Harness Component:** Harness Pipelines (Dependency Management, Artifact Handling)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use trusted and verified sources for pipeline dependencies. Prefer internal or private repositories over public, untrusted sources.
    *   Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability analysis for all pipeline dependencies to identify and mitigate known vulnerabilities.
    *   Utilize artifact registries with security scanning and signing capabilities to ensure the integrity and authenticity of downloaded artifacts.
    *   Implement checksum verification for downloaded artifacts to detect tampering.
    *   Practice secure coding principles within pipeline scripts and custom tasks to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via RBAC Misconfiguration](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_rbac_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Harness RBAC allow users to escalate their privileges and gain unauthorized access to features and data they should not have access to. This could be due to bugs in the RBAC implementation or overly permissive default roles.
*   **Impact:** High. Unauthorized access to sensitive Harness features and data, potentially leading to control plane compromise, data breaches, or pipeline tampering. Attackers could leverage escalated privileges to bypass security controls and perform malicious actions.
*   **Affected Harness Component:** Harness RBAC (Role Management, Permission Enforcement)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly review and audit RBAC configurations for potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
    *   Monitor Harness security advisories and updates related to RBAC and apply patches promptly if applicable.
    *   Implement segregation of duties and separation of concerns in RBAC roles to prevent any single user from having excessive control.
    *   Perform penetration testing and security assessments of your Harness configuration, including RBAC, to identify potential vulnerabilities.
