- Improve software quality and reliability.
- Reduce operational costs associated with software deployments.
- Enhance developer productivity and satisfaction.
- Provide a scalable and resilient platform for mission-critical applications.
- Support a wide range of deployment environments and technologies.
- Offer a secure and compliant platform for sensitive workloads.

Business Risks:
- Platform downtime impacting software delivery pipelines and business operations.
- Data breaches or leaks compromising sensitive application data or infrastructure credentials.
- Unauthorized access to the platform leading to malicious deployments or configuration changes.
- Supply chain attacks targeting build or deployment processes.
- Compliance violations due to insecure configurations or lack of audit trails.
- Performance bottlenecks hindering software delivery velocity.
- Lack of user adoption due to complexity or poor user experience.

- security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Implement software composition analysis (SCA) to manage open-source dependencies vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) security scanning to identify misconfigurations in deployment infrastructure.
- security control: Implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) for deployed applications.
- security control: Implement network segmentation to isolate CI/CD platform components.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits of the platform.
- security control: Implement robust incident response plan for security incidents.
- security control: Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures to protect sensitive data.

Security Requirements:

Authentication:
- requirement: The platform must support strong authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication.
- requirement: Integration with enterprise identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, Okta) should be supported via SAML or OAuth.
- requirement: API access should be secured using API keys or tokens with appropriate scopes.

Authorization:
- requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be implemented to manage user permissions and access to resources.
- requirement: Granular permissions should be configurable to control access to specific projects, pipelines, and environments.
- requirement: Least privilege principle should be enforced for all user and service accounts.

Input Validation:
- requirement: All user inputs and API requests must be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
- requirement: Input validation should be performed on both the client-side and server-side.
- requirement: Data sanitization and encoding should be applied to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

Cryptography:
- requirement: Sensitive data at rest (e.g., secrets, credentials, application data) must be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms.
- requirement: Data in transit must be encrypted using TLS/HTTPS for all communication channels.
- requirement: Cryptographic keys must be securely managed and stored.
- requirement: Hashing algorithms should be used for password storage.
