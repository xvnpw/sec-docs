#### 4.2. Impact Analysis and Threat Mitigation

The mitigation strategy effectively targets the identified threats:

*   **Deployment of Vulnerable Application Code (High Severity):**  **High Risk Reduction.** SAST and DAST directly address this threat by identifying vulnerabilities in the application code before and during runtime. Pipeline gates prevent vulnerable code deployment.
*   **Deployment of Vulnerable Dependencies (Medium to High Severity):** **Medium to High Risk Reduction.** SCA is specifically designed to mitigate this threat by identifying vulnerable open-source components.
*   **Infrastructure Misconfigurations with Security Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** **Medium Risk Reduction.** IaC scanning addresses this threat by identifying misconfigurations in infrastructure code before deployment.
*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Low to Medium Severity):** **Low to Medium Risk Reduction.** While pipeline scanning is not a primary defense against zero-day vulnerabilities, it can contribute by:
    *   Identifying known vulnerabilities that might be exploited alongside zero-days.
    *   Ensuring a baseline level of security, making it harder for attackers to exploit zero-days.
    *   DAST can potentially detect some zero-day vulnerabilities through behavioral analysis, although this is not guaranteed.

The impact assessment is generally accurate. The strategy provides strong mitigation for code and dependency vulnerabilities, moderate mitigation for infrastructure misconfigurations, and a lower but still valuable level of mitigation for zero-day vulnerabilities.
