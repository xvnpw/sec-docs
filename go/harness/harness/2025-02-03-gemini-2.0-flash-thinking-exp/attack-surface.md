# Attack Surface Analysis for harness/harness

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Harness Delegate](./attack_surfaces/compromised_harness_delegate.md)

*   **Description:** A Harness Delegate, a Harness-provided agent deployed in your environment to execute deployment tasks, is compromised by an attacker.
*   **Harness Contribution:** Harness Delegates are essential for connecting Harness control plane to your deployment infrastructure, inherently extending Harness's attack surface into your network.
*   **Example:** A zero-day vulnerability in the Harness Delegate software allows remote code execution. An attacker exploits this, gains control of the Delegate host, and uses it to access your internal network and sensitive resources.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Delegate host and potentially the surrounding network, unauthorized access to internal systems, data breaches, disruption of deployments managed by Harness, and potential lateral movement to other critical infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Automated Delegate Updates:** Enable automatic updates for Harness Delegates to ensure timely patching of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Delegate Host Hardening:** Implement robust security hardening on Delegate host operating systems, including regular patching, minimal software installation, and strong firewall rules.
    *   **Network Isolation for Delegates:** Deploy Delegates in isolated network segments (VLANs, subnets) with strict firewall rules limiting inbound and outbound traffic to only necessary ports and services.
    *   **Least Privilege Delegate Permissions:** Configure Delegates with the absolute minimum permissions required to perform their deployment tasks within your infrastructure. Avoid using overly permissive service accounts.
    *   **Delegate Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging for Delegate activity, and set up alerts for suspicious behavior or security events.
    *   **Secure Delegate Bootstrap:** Ensure the initial Delegate installation and configuration process is secure, following Harness's recommended best practices and avoiding insecure credential handling during setup.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Secrets Management within Harness](./attack_surfaces/insecure_secrets_management_within_harness.md)

*   **Description:** Secrets managed directly within Harness's secrets management system are compromised due to vulnerabilities in Harness's implementation or misconfiguration.
*   **Harness Contribution:** Harness's built-in secrets management is designed to store and manage sensitive credentials for deployments and integrations, making it a prime target if vulnerabilities exist.
*   **Example:** A flaw in Harness's secret encryption mechanism is discovered. An attacker gains access to the Harness database and exploits this flaw to decrypt and steal stored secrets, including cloud provider API keys and database passwords.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of highly sensitive credentials, unauthorized access to connected systems (cloud providers, databases, repositories), significant data breaches, widespread infrastructure compromise, and potential disruption of all services managed by Harness.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prioritize External Secrets Managers:** Integrate Harness with dedicated, enterprise-grade external secrets management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager) instead of relying solely on Harness's internal secrets management.
    *   **Regular Secret Rotation Policies:** Implement and enforce regular rotation policies for all secrets managed by Harness and external secrets managers integrated with Harness.
    *   **Strict Access Control for Secrets:** Implement granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Harness to restrict access to secrets to only authorized users, teams, and pipelines.
    *   **Audit Logging of Secrets Access:** Enable comprehensive audit logging for all access and modifications to secrets within Harness to detect and investigate any unauthorized activity.
    *   **Secure Secrets Storage Configuration (if using Harness internal):** If utilizing Harness's internal secrets management, meticulously follow Harness's security guidelines and best practices for configuring secure storage and access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Pipeline Definition Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/pipeline_definition_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access and modify Harness pipeline definitions, injecting malicious steps or altering configurations to compromise deployments.
*   **Harness Contribution:** Harness pipelines are the core of the deployment automation. Control over pipeline definitions grants significant control over the entire deployment process, making them a high-value target.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a Harness user account with pipeline editing permissions. They modify a production deployment pipeline to inject a malicious container image or script that creates a backdoor in deployed applications.
*   **Impact:**  Deployment of backdoored or compromised applications, potential data breaches through deployed applications, supply chain attacks impacting production environments, disruption of critical services, and reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Strong RBAC for Pipelines:** Implement strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Harness, carefully controlling who can view, edit, and approve pipeline definitions, especially for production environments.
    *   **Pipeline Version Control and Review:** Treat pipeline definitions as code and store them in version control systems (like Git). Implement mandatory code review processes for all pipeline changes before they are applied.
    *   **Immutable Pipeline Promotion:** Implement a workflow where approved pipeline definitions are promoted through environments (e.g., Dev -> Stage -> Prod) and become immutable in higher environments to prevent unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Audit Logging for Pipeline Changes:** Enable detailed audit logging for all pipeline modifications, including who made the changes and when, to track activity and identify suspicious alterations.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Harness Users:** Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Harness user accounts, especially those with permissions to modify pipelines, to prevent account compromise.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Integrations with External Systems (Harness Managed)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_integrations_with_external_systems__harness_managed_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arise from insecure configurations or exploitable weaknesses in *Harness-managed* integrations with external systems. This focuses on how Harness itself handles integrations, not vulnerabilities in the *external systems* themselves.
*   **Harness Contribution:** Harness's integration framework and how it manages connections and credentials for external systems (like Git, artifact registries, cloud providers) can introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented securely.
*   **Example:** Harness uses a vulnerable library to interact with a specific type of artifact registry. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to bypass authentication and access or modify artifacts stored in the registry through the Harness integration.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to integrated systems via Harness, data breaches from integrated systems, potential tampering with artifacts or code repositories used in deployments, and cloud infrastructure compromise if cloud provider integrations are affected.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Least Privilege for Harness Integrations:** When configuring integrations within Harness, grant the integration only the minimum necessary permissions in the external system required for its intended function.
    *   **Secure Integration Configuration Review:** Regularly review the configurations of all Harness integrations to ensure they adhere to security best practices, including using secure connection protocols (HTTPS, SSH) and strong authentication methods.
    *   **Harness Integration Security Updates:** Stay informed about Harness security advisories and updates related to integrations and apply patches promptly to address any identified vulnerabilities in Harness's integration framework.
    *   **Monitor Integration Activity within Harness:** Monitor logs and audit trails within Harness related to integration usage to detect any suspicious or unauthorized access patterns.
    *   **Secure Credential Handling for Integrations:** Ensure that credentials used for Harness integrations are managed securely, ideally using external secrets managers as described previously, and avoid storing them directly within Harness configuration if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Harness Platform Software](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_harness_platform_software.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable security vulnerabilities are present in the core Harness platform software itself (both SaaS and self-managed deployments).
*   **Harness Contribution:** As a complex software platform, Harness is susceptible to software vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities directly impact the security of all CI/CD processes managed by Harness.
*   **Example:** A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability is discovered in the Harness API server. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain complete control over the Harness platform, potentially impacting all users and deployments.
*   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the Harness platform, widespread data breaches, manipulation of all pipelines and deployments, disruption of all CI/CD processes, privilege escalation for attackers, and significant reputational damage for both Harness and its users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proactive Harness Platform Updates:** Implement a process for promptly applying all security updates and patches released by Harness for both SaaS and self-managed deployments. Subscribe to Harness security advisories and notifications.
    *   **Regular Security Scanning and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing of your Harness deployment (especially for self-managed instances) to proactively identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) for Harness UI (Self-Managed):** For self-managed Harness deployments, consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the Harness web UI to provide an additional layer of protection against common web attacks.
    *   **Follow Harness Security Best Practices:** Adhere to all security best practices and hardening guidelines recommended by Harness for configuring and operating the platform securely.
