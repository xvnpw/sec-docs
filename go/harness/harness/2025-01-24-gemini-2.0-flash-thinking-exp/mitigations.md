# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for harness/harness

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage External Secret Managers](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_external_secret_managers.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Leverage External Secret Managers
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Supported Secret Manager:** Select an external secret management solution that Harness natively integrates with, such as HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud Secret Manager.
    2.  **Configure Secret Manager in Harness:** Within the Harness platform UI, navigate to the "Security" section and then "Secret Managers". Add a new Secret Manager, choosing your selected external provider. Provide the necessary connection details (API keys, credentials, URLs) required for Harness to communicate and authenticate with your external vault.
    3.  **Migrate Harness Secrets:** Identify all secrets currently stored directly within Harness's built-in secret management. Migrate these secrets to your chosen external secret manager. This involves creating equivalent secrets in your external vault and securely transferring the secret values.
    4.  **Update Harness Configurations to Use External Secrets:** Modify your Harness pipelines, connectors, and other configurations to retrieve secrets from the newly configured external Secret Manager. Utilize Harness expression language (e.g., `${secrets.getValue("secretName")}` ) to reference secrets stored in the external vault within your Harness workflows.
    5.  **Disable Built-in Harness Secret Management (Optional but Recommended):** After successful migration and verification, consider disabling or restricting the use of Harness's built-in secret management to enforce the use of the more secure, centralized external solution. This reduces the attack surface within Harness itself.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Harness Platform Compromise (High Severity):** If the Harness platform is compromised, secrets stored directly within Harness are at risk of exposure. Using an external manager isolates secrets.
    *   **Internal Insider Threat via Harness Access (Medium Severity):** Overly broad access to secrets *within Harness* increases insider threat risk. External managers can offer more granular access control outside of Harness.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Harness Platform Compromise:** Significantly reduces risk. Secrets are no longer directly stored and managed within Harness, limiting the impact of a potential Harness platform breach on secret exposure.
    *   **Internal Insider Threat via Harness Access:** Moderately reduces risk. While access control within the external secret manager is still critical, it centralizes secret management outside of Harness, potentially strengthening overall security posture.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We are using AWS Secrets Manager for some application secrets, but direct integration with Harness Secret Manager is not fully configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Full integration of AWS Secrets Manager as a Harness Secret Manager is missing. Migration of all secrets currently managed within Harness (like API keys and connector credentials) to AWS Secrets Manager is needed. Disabling or restricting the built-in Harness Secret Management is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Least Privilege for Secret Access within Harness RBAC](./mitigation_strategies/implement_least_privilege_for_secret_access_within_harness_rbac.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Least Privilege for Secret Access within Harness RBAC
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Harness Roles Based on Secret Needs:** Clearly define roles within your teams that interact with Harness and require access to secrets. Categorize these roles based on their specific responsibilities related to pipelines, deployments, and secret management *within Harness*.
    2.  **Review and Customize Harness Roles:** Examine the default Harness roles and determine if they align with your defined roles. Create custom Harness roles using Harness RBAC to precisely match your needs for secret access control.
    3.  **Grant Minimal Secret Permissions per Role:** For each custom role, grant only the minimum necessary permissions required to access and manage secrets *within Harness*. Avoid assigning overly broad roles like "Account Administrator" to users who only need to manage specific pipelines or environments. Focus on granular secret-related permissions (e.g., "Read Secrets in Project X", "Update Secrets in Environment Y").
    4.  **Apply RBAC Policies in Harness:** Utilize Harness Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to assign the defined custom roles to individual users and user groups within Harness. Ensure users are assigned roles that strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege for accessing secrets *through Harness*.
    5.  **Regularly Audit Harness RBAC for Secret Permissions:** Periodically review user roles and permissions related to secret access within Harness RBAC. Ensure permissions remain appropriate as teams and responsibilities evolve. Revoke any unnecessary or overly permissive access.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Internal Insider Threat via Harness (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized secret access by internal users who have overly broad permissions *within Harness*.
    *   **Accidental Secret Exposure via Misconfigured Harness Permissions (Low Severity):** Minimizes accidental secret exposure due to misconfigured Harness user permissions by limiting the number of users with access to sensitive secrets *through Harness*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Internal Insider Threat via Harness:** Moderately reduces risk. Limits the potential for malicious insiders with Harness access to gain unauthorized access to secrets managed *by Harness*.
    *   **Accidental Secret Exposure via Misconfigured Harness Permissions:** Minimally reduces risk. While helpful, other security practices are more critical for preventing accidental exposure, but this reduces the scope of potential accidental exposure *via Harness*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have started using custom roles in Harness, but a detailed review and refinement of secret access permissions based on least privilege within Harness RBAC is still required.
*   **Missing Implementation:** A comprehensive audit of current Harness user roles and their associated secret access permissions is missing. Refinement of custom Harness roles to enforce least privilege for secret access across all projects and environments *within Harness RBAC* is needed. Documentation of Harness roles and responsibilities related to secret management *within Harness* is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Rotate Secrets Used by Harness Connectors and Delegates](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_rotate_secrets_used_by_harness_connectors_and_delegates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Rotate Secrets Used by Harness Connectors and Delegates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Secrets Used by Harness Components:** Identify all secrets used by Harness Connectors (e.g., cloud provider API keys, Kubernetes cluster credentials, repository access tokens) and Delegates (e.g., Delegate service account keys, SSH keys).
    2.  **Define Harness Secret Rotation Policy:** Establish a clear policy for rotating secrets used by Harness components. Specify rotation frequency for different types of secrets based on their sensitivity and potential impact of compromise (e.g., rotate cloud provider API keys every 90 days, Kubernetes credentials every 30 days).
    3.  **Automate Harness Secret Rotation (Preferred):** Leverage automation capabilities of your external secret manager (if integrated with Harness) or Harness's API to automate secret rotation for Connectors and Delegates. This may involve configuring the secret manager to automatically generate new secrets and update the corresponding Connector or Delegate configurations in Harness.
    4.  **Manual Harness Secret Rotation (If Automation Not Possible):** If automation is not feasible for certain Harness secrets, create a documented procedure for manual secret rotation. This procedure should include steps for generating new secrets, updating the relevant Harness Connector or Delegate configurations with the new secrets, and decommissioning the old secrets *within Harness*.
    5.  **Test Harness Secret Rotation Process:** Thoroughly test the secret rotation process in non-production Harness environments to ensure that pipelines and deployments using the rotated secrets continue to function correctly after rotation. Verify that Harness Connectors and Delegates successfully adopt the new secrets.
    6.  **Monitor Harness Secret Rotation Success:** Implement monitoring to verify that secret rotation for Harness components is occurring as scheduled and that there are no errors or failures during the rotation process *within Harness*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Harness Connector/Delegate Secrets (Medium Severity):** Reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit compromised secrets used by Harness Connectors or Delegates by regularly invalidating them.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Compromised Harness Components (Medium Severity):** Limits potential lateral movement if a Harness Connector or Delegate is compromised and attackers attempt to use stale credentials.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Harness Connector/Delegate Secrets:** Moderately reduces risk. Significantly reduces the lifespan of a compromised secret used by Harness components, limiting potential damage.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Compromised Harness Components:** Moderately reduces risk. Makes it harder for attackers to leverage compromised Harness components for lateral movement using outdated credentials.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Secret rotation for Harness-specific secrets (Connectors, Delegates) is currently a manual and infrequent process, not systematically applied.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implementation of automated secret rotation for all relevant Harness Connector and Delegate secrets is missing. A documented secret rotation policy specifically for Harness components is also missing. Integration with our chosen secret manager for automated rotation workflows *for Harness* needs to be configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audit Harness Secret Access and Usage via Harness Audit Trails](./mitigation_strategies/audit_harness_secret_access_and_usage_via_harness_audit_trails.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Audit Harness Secret Access and Usage via Harness Audit Trails
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Harness Audit Trails for Secret Events:** Ensure that Harness audit trails are enabled and specifically configured to capture events related to secret management *within Harness*. This includes events like secret creation, modification, access (viewing/retrieving secrets), and deletion *within the Harness platform*.
    2.  **Centralize Harness Audit Logs:** Configure Harness to forward its audit logs to a centralized logging system or SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform. This enables aggregation, analysis, and long-term retention of Harness audit data, including secret-related events.
    3.  **Define SIEM Monitoring Rules for Harness Secret Events:** Establish rules and alerts within your SIEM system to actively monitor Harness audit logs for suspicious activities specifically related to secret access and usage *within Harness*. Examples include:
        *   Failed secret access attempts *in Harness*.
        *   Unauthorized secret modifications or deletions *within Harness*.
        *   Unusual patterns of secret access *within Harness*.
        *   Access to sensitive secrets by unauthorized Harness users (based on RBAC).
    4.  **Regularly Review Harness Audit Logs in SIEM:** Schedule periodic reviews of the centralized Harness audit logs within your SIEM to proactively identify and investigate any potential security incidents or anomalies related to secret management *within Harness*.
    5.  **Automate Alerting and Reporting for Harness Secret Events:** Automate alerting for critical security events detected in Harness audit logs within your SIEM. Generate regular reports on secret access and usage patterns *within Harness* to identify trends and potential risks.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Secret Access via Harness UI/API (Medium Severity):** Detects and alerts on unauthorized attempts to access secrets *through the Harness platform*, enabling timely response and investigation.
    *   **Secret Misuse by Authorized Harness Users (Medium Severity):** Helps identify potential misuse of secrets by authorized Harness users by monitoring their access patterns and anomalies *within Harness*.
    *   **Post-Breach Forensics of Harness-Related Incidents (High Severity):** Provides valuable Harness audit trail data for investigating security incidents and breaches related to secret compromise or misuse *within the Harness platform*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Secret Access via Harness UI/API:** Moderately reduces risk. Provides detection capabilities for unauthorized secret access attempts *within Harness*, allowing for faster incident response.
    *   **Secret Misuse by Authorized Harness Users:** Moderately reduces risk. Increases visibility into secret usage *within Harness*, making it harder for malicious activities to go unnoticed.
    *   **Post-Breach Forensics of Harness-Related Incidents:** Significantly reduces risk. Provides crucial audit data for understanding the scope and impact of security breaches involving secrets managed *by or accessed through Harness*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Harness audit trails are enabled, but full integration with our SIEM system for comprehensive *Harness* secret access monitoring is not yet configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Full integration of Harness audit logs with our SIEM system is missing. Specific monitoring rules and alerts for *Harness* secret-related events need to be defined and implemented in the SIEM. Regular review and analysis of *Harness* audit logs for secret-related activities are not yet consistently performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Pipeline as Code and Version Control for Harness Pipelines](./mitigation_strategies/implement_pipeline_as_code_and_version_control_for_harness_pipelines.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Pipeline as Code and Version Control for Harness Pipelines
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Adopt "Pipeline as Code" Approach in Harness:** Shift from primarily managing Harness pipelines through the UI to defining them as code in YAML files.
    2.  **Store Harness Pipeline YAML in Version Control (Git):** Store all Harness pipeline definitions (YAML files) in a version control system like Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). This provides version history, change tracking, and collaboration capabilities.
    3.  **Utilize Harness Git Connectors:** Configure Harness Git Connectors to synchronize your pipeline definitions from your Git repository. This ensures that Harness pipelines are automatically updated whenever changes are committed to the Git repository.
    4.  **Enforce Code Review for Harness Pipeline Changes:** Implement a code review process for all changes to Harness pipeline definitions in Git. This allows for peer review of pipeline logic, security configurations, and potential vulnerabilities before they are deployed to Harness.
    5.  **Treat Harness Pipeline Configurations as Infrastructure Code:** Manage Harness pipeline configurations with the same rigor and security considerations as you would for infrastructure code. Apply secure coding practices, automated testing (where applicable), and version control best practices.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Pipeline Modifications (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized or malicious modifications to Harness pipelines by enforcing version control and code review.
    *   **Configuration Drift in Harness Pipelines (Low Severity):** Prevents configuration drift by ensuring that Harness pipelines are consistently defined and managed through version-controlled code.
    *   **Lack of Auditability for Pipeline Changes (Low Severity):** Improves auditability of pipeline changes by providing a clear version history and change log in Git.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Pipeline Modifications:** Moderately reduces risk. Code review and version control make it significantly harder to introduce unauthorized changes to Harness pipelines without detection.
    *   **Configuration Drift in Harness Pipelines:** Minimally reduces risk. Primarily improves consistency and manageability, with a minor security benefit by reducing unexpected pipeline behavior.
    *   **Lack of Auditability for Pipeline Changes:** Minimally reduces risk. Primarily improves operational visibility and compliance, with a minor security benefit for incident investigation.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We are using "Pipeline as Code" for some newer pipelines, but many older pipelines are still managed primarily through the Harness UI. Version control is used, but code review for all pipeline changes is not consistently enforced.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Full adoption of "Pipeline as Code" for all Harness pipelines is missing. Consistent enforcement of code review for all Harness pipeline changes in Git is needed. A formal process for managing Harness pipeline configurations as infrastructure code is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Pipeline Approval Processes in Harness](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_pipeline_approval_processes_in_harness.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Pipeline Approval Processes in Harness
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Pipeline Stages:** Determine pipeline stages, especially those deploying to sensitive environments (production, staging), that require mandatory approval before execution *within Harness*.
    2.  **Configure Harness Approval Stages:** Implement Harness Approval stages in your pipelines at the identified critical points. Choose between manual approvals (requiring human intervention) or automated approvals (based on predefined criteria or integrations).
    3.  **Define Approval Workflows in Harness:** Define clear approval workflows within Harness, specifying who are the designated approvers for each approval stage. Assign approvers based on roles and responsibilities (e.g., security team approval for production deployments, manager approval for significant changes).
    4.  **Enforce Mandatory Approvals in Harness:** Configure Harness Approval stages to be mandatory, preventing pipeline execution from proceeding without explicit approval from designated approvers.
    5.  **Audit Harness Pipeline Approvals:** Regularly review Harness pipeline approval logs to ensure that approval processes are being followed and to identify any potential bypasses or irregularities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Deployments to Sensitive Environments (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized deployments to production or other sensitive environments by requiring explicit approval within Harness before deployment.
    *   **Malicious Code Deployment via Pipelines (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of malicious code being deployed through Harness pipelines by introducing a human review and approval step.
    *   **Accidental Production Deployments (Medium Severity):** Minimizes the risk of accidental deployments to production by requiring a deliberate approval step in Harness.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Deployments to Sensitive Environments:** Significantly reduces risk. Mandatory approvals in Harness act as a strong control against unauthorized deployments.
    *   **Malicious Code Deployment via Pipelines:** Moderately reduces risk. Human review during approval can help catch potentially malicious code changes before deployment, but is not a foolproof security measure.
    *   **Accidental Production Deployments:** Moderately reduces risk. Approval stages add a deliberate step, making accidental production deployments less likely.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Approval stages are used in some production pipelines, but not consistently enforced across all sensitive deployments. Approval workflows and designated approvers are not always clearly defined in Harness.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent enforcement of mandatory approval stages in Harness for all deployments to sensitive environments is missing. Clear definition of approval workflows and designated approvers within Harness for each pipeline is needed. Regular auditing of Harness pipeline approvals is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Harness Connectors and Delegate Security](./mitigation_strategies/secure_harness_connectors_and_delegate_security.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Harness Connectors and Delegate Security
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Apply Least Privilege to Harness Connectors:** When configuring Harness Connectors (e.g., Cloud Providers, Kubernetes, Git), grant them only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their intended tasks. Avoid overly permissive roles or credentials. For example, for a Kubernetes Connector, grant only the necessary RBAC permissions for deployment operations, not cluster-admin.
    2.  **Harden Harness Delegate Hosts:** Follow Harness best practices for securing Delegate hosts. This includes:
        *   Deploy Delegates in secure network segments with restricted network access.
        *   Regularly update Delegate software and operating systems with security patches.
        *   Harden the Delegate host operating system by disabling unnecessary services and applying security configurations.
        *   Restrict network access to and from Delegates to only necessary ports and protocols.
    3.  **Utilize Harness Delegate Profiles:** Leverage Harness Delegate Profiles to further restrict permissions and capabilities of Delegates. Define profiles that limit access to specific resources or functionalities based on the Delegate's intended purpose.
    4.  **Regularly Update Harness Delegates:** Ensure that Harness Delegates are regularly updated to the latest versions provided by Harness. This ensures that Delegates are patched against known security vulnerabilities.
    5.  **Monitor Harness Delegate Activity:** Monitor Delegate logs and activity for any suspicious behavior or anomalies. Integrate Delegate logs with your SIEM system for centralized monitoring and alerting.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Harness Connectors (Medium to High Severity):** Weakly secured Connectors can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to connected systems (cloud providers, Kubernetes clusters, etc.).
    *   **Compromised Harness Delegates (Medium to High Severity):** Compromised Delegates can be used as entry points into your infrastructure or to execute malicious code within your environment.
    *   **Lateral Movement via Compromised Harness Components (Medium Severity):** Attackers could potentially use compromised Connectors or Delegates for lateral movement within your infrastructure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Harness Connectors:** Moderately to Significantly reduces risk. Least privilege limits the potential damage from a compromised Connector.
    *   **Compromised Harness Delegates:** Moderately to Significantly reduces risk. Hardening and Delegate Profiles limit the attack surface and potential impact of a compromised Delegate.
    *   **Lateral Movement via Compromised Harness Components:** Moderately reduces risk. Secure configuration makes it harder to leverage Harness components for lateral movement.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Least privilege is considered for some Connectors, but not consistently applied. Delegate host hardening is partially implemented, but could be improved. Delegate Profiles are not fully utilized. Delegate updates are generally performed, but monitoring is not comprehensive.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent application of least privilege to all Harness Connectors is needed. Full hardening of all Delegate hosts according to best practices is missing. Implementation and utilization of Harness Delegate Profiles for enhanced security is needed. Comprehensive monitoring of Delegate activity and integration with SIEM is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Audit Harness Pipeline Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_audit_harness_pipeline_configurations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Review and Audit Harness Pipeline Configurations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule Periodic Harness Pipeline Reviews:** Establish a schedule for regular reviews and audits of your Harness pipeline configurations. The frequency should depend on the complexity and sensitivity of your pipelines and deployment environments (e.g., monthly or quarterly reviews).
    2.  **Review Pipeline Definitions and Logic:** During reviews, examine the logic and steps within your Harness pipeline definitions. Look for potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or inefficient practices.
    3.  **Audit Harness Connector and Secret Usage in Pipelines:** Specifically audit how Harness Connectors and Secrets are used within pipelines. Ensure that Connectors are used with least privilege and that secrets are accessed securely and only when necessary.
    4.  **Verify Pipeline Security Configurations:** Review security-related configurations within pipelines, such as environment variables, security context settings for deployments, and any custom security scripts or steps.
    5.  **Document Review Findings and Remediation:** Document the findings of each pipeline review and track any identified security issues or areas for improvement. Implement remediation plans to address identified vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Harness pipelines.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Pipeline Misconfigurations Leading to Security Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Regular reviews help identify and correct pipeline misconfigurations that could introduce security vulnerabilities in deployments.
    *   **Drift from Security Best Practices in Pipelines (Low Severity):** Ensures that pipelines remain aligned with security best practices over time and prevents configuration drift that could weaken security posture.
    *   **Outdated or Inefficient Pipeline Security Measures (Low Severity):** Reviews help identify and update outdated or inefficient security measures within pipelines, ensuring they remain effective.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Pipeline Misconfigurations Leading to Security Vulnerabilities:** Moderately reduces risk. Proactive reviews help catch and fix misconfigurations before they can be exploited.
    *   **Drift from Security Best Practices in Pipelines:** Minimally reduces risk. Primarily maintains a consistent security posture and prevents gradual degradation of security over time.
    *   **Outdated or Inefficient Pipeline Security Measures:** Minimally reduces risk. Ensures that security measures remain relevant and effective as threats and best practices evolve.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Regular, scheduled reviews and audits of Harness pipeline configurations are not currently performed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Establishment of a schedule for regular Harness pipeline reviews is missing. A documented process for conducting pipeline reviews and tracking remediation is needed. Training for relevant teams on conducting security-focused pipeline reviews is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization in Harness Pipelines](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_in_harness_pipelines.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization in Harness Pipelines
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Pipeline Inputs from Untrusted Sources:** Identify all sources of input data to your Harness pipelines that could be considered untrusted or potentially malicious. This includes user-provided data, external APIs, and data from third-party systems.
    2.  **Implement Input Validation in Harness Pipelines:** Implement input validation steps within your Harness pipelines to validate all data received from untrusted sources. Use Harness expressions, scripting steps, or custom validation logic to check data types, formats, ranges, and expected values. Reject invalid input and halt pipeline execution if validation fails.
    3.  **Sanitize Input Data in Harness Pipelines:** Sanitize input data before using it in pipeline steps, especially when constructing commands, scripts, or API requests. Use appropriate sanitization techniques to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting). Harness provides scripting capabilities that can be used for sanitization.
    4.  **Avoid Direct Execution of Untrusted Input:** Avoid directly executing untrusted input as commands or scripts within Harness pipelines. If execution is necessary, ensure thorough validation and sanitization are performed, and use parameterized commands or safe execution methods where possible.
    5.  **Log Input Validation and Sanitization Events:** Log input validation and sanitization events within your Harness pipelines for auditing and debugging purposes. Log both successful validation and any validation failures or sanitization actions taken.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks via Pipelines (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents injection attacks (e.g., command injection, script injection) by validating and sanitizing input data processed by Harness pipelines.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues in Pipelines (Medium Severity):** Input validation helps ensure data integrity within pipelines by rejecting invalid or unexpected input that could lead to errors or incorrect processing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks via Pipelines:** Moderately to Significantly reduces risk. Input validation and sanitization are crucial defenses against injection vulnerabilities in pipelines.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues in Pipelines:** Moderately reduces risk. Improves data quality and reliability within pipelines, reducing the likelihood of errors due to bad input.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic input validation might be present in some pipelines, but systematic and comprehensive input validation and sanitization are not consistently implemented across all pipelines.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Systematic implementation of input validation and sanitization for all pipelines handling untrusted input is missing. Development of reusable validation and sanitization functions or steps within Harness pipelines is needed. Training for pipeline developers on secure input handling practices in Harness is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization for Harness Platform Access](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strong_authentication_and_authorization_for_harness_platform_access.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization for Harness Platform Access
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Harness Users:** Enable and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all Harness users. This adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords, requiring users to provide a second factor of authentication (e.g., OTP from authenticator app, SMS code) during login to Harness.
    2.  **Integrate Harness with Organizational Single Sign-On (SSO):** Integrate Harness with your organization's Single Sign-On (SSO) provider (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace). This centralizes user authentication and management, improves security, and simplifies user login to Harness.
    3.  **Utilize Harness Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement Harness Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to different features and resources within the Harness platform. Define granular roles and assign them to users based on their job functions and the principle of least privilege.
    4.  **Regularly Review Harness User Accounts and Permissions:** Periodically review Harness user accounts and their assigned permissions. Remove inactive accounts and ensure that user permissions remain appropriate and aligned with their current roles.
    5.  **Enforce Strong Password Policies for Non-SSO Users (If Applicable):** If you have users who are not using SSO for Harness access, enforce strong password policies (e.g., password complexity requirements, password expiration) to improve password security.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Harness Platform (High Severity):** Weak authentication controls can allow unauthorized users to gain access to the Harness platform, potentially compromising pipelines, deployments, and secrets.
    *   **Account Takeover of Harness User Accounts (High Severity):** Weak authentication makes Harness user accounts vulnerable to takeover attacks, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users and perform malicious actions within Harness.
    *   **Insider Threats via Compromised Harness Accounts (Medium Severity):** Compromised Harness user accounts can be exploited by malicious insiders to access sensitive resources or disrupt operations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Harness Platform:** Significantly reduces risk. Strong authentication makes it much harder for unauthorized users to gain initial access to Harness.
    *   **Account Takeover of Harness User Accounts:** Significantly reduces risk. MFA and SSO significantly reduce the risk of account takeover attacks.
    *   **Insider Threats via Compromised Harness Accounts:** Moderately reduces risk. While not a complete solution to insider threats, stronger authentication makes it harder for insiders to compromise accounts.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. SSO is implemented for some users, but MFA is not yet enforced for all Harness users. RBAC is used, but regular reviews of user accounts and permissions are not consistently performed. Strong password policies are likely in place, but not explicitly verified for non-SSO users.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Enforcement of MFA for all Harness users is missing. Full integration with SSO for all users is recommended. Regular reviews of Harness user accounts and permissions are needed. Explicit verification and enforcement of strong password policies for non-SSO users (if any) is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Harness Platform and Delegates](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_harness_platform_and_delegates.md)

    2.  **Establish a Harness Update Schedule:** Establish a schedule for regularly updating your Harness platform and Delegates. The frequency should be based on the criticality of your deployments and the severity of any announced security vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Apply Harness Platform Updates:** Follow Harness's recommended procedures for updating your Harness platform to the latest versions. This may involve scheduled maintenance windows and coordination with Harness support if needed.
    4.  **Update Harness Delegates Regularly:** Implement a process for automatically or semi-automatically updating Harness Delegates to the latest versions. Consider using Delegate auto-update features if available and appropriate for your environment.
    5.  **Test Updates in Non-Production Environments:** Before applying updates to production Harness environments, thoroughly test the updates in non-production environments to ensure compatibility and identify any potential issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Harness Platform (High Severity):** Outdated Harness platforms may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise the platform or gain access to sensitive data.
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Harness Delegates (Medium to High Severity):** Outdated Delegates may contain known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise Delegates or gain access to the environments they connect to.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Harness Platform:** Significantly reduces risk. Regular updates patch known vulnerabilities, reducing the attack surface of the Harness platform.
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Harness Delegates:** Moderately to Significantly reduces risk. Regular Delegate updates patch known vulnerabilities, reducing the attack surface of Delegates and the risk of Delegate compromise.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Harness platform and Delegate updates are generally performed, but not always on a strict schedule or with proactive monitoring of release notes and security advisories. Testing of updates in non-production environments might not be consistently performed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Establishment of a formal schedule for Harness platform and Delegate updates is missing. Proactive monitoring of Harness release notes and security advisories is needed. Consistent testing of updates in non-production environments before production deployment is missing. Automation of Delegate updates where feasible is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Harness Platform Logs and Activity for Security Events](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_harness_platform_logs_and_activity_for_security_events.md)

    2.  **Centralize Harness Logs in SIEM:** Configure Harness to forward all relevant logs to a centralized logging system or SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform. This allows for aggregation, analysis, and long-term retention of Harness log data.
    3.  **Define SIEM Monitoring Rules for Harness Security Events:** Establish rules and alerts within your SIEM system to actively monitor Harness logs for security-relevant events. Examples include:
        *   Suspicious login attempts to Harness.
        *   Unauthorized access attempts to Harness resources.
        *   Changes to Harness security configurations.
        *   Anomalous pipeline execution patterns.
        *   Errors or failures in security-related Harness components.
    4.  **Regularly Review Harness Logs in SIEM:** Schedule periodic reviews of the centralized Harness logs within your SIEM to proactively identify and investigate any potential security incidents or anomalies.
    5.  **Automate Alerting and Reporting for Harness Security Events:** Automate alerting for critical security events detected in Harness logs within your SIEM. Generate regular reports on Harness security events and trends to identify potential risks and improve security posture.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Security Incidents within Harness Platform (Medium to High Severity):** Monitoring helps detect security incidents occurring within the Harness platform, enabling faster incident response and containment.
    *   **Unauthorized Activity within Harness (Medium Severity):** Monitoring helps detect unauthorized or suspicious activity by users or processes within Harness.
    *   **Operational Issues with Security Implications in Harness (Low to Medium Severity):** Monitoring can identify operational issues that could have security implications, such as misconfigurations or failures in security components.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Security Incidents within Harness Platform:** Moderately to Significantly reduces risk. Monitoring provides early detection capabilities, allowing for faster response to security incidents.
    *   **Unauthorized Activity within Harness:** Moderately reduces risk. Increases visibility into user and system activity within Harness, making it harder for unauthorized actions to go unnoticed.
    *   **Operational Issues with Security Implications in Harness:** Minimally to Moderately reduces risk. Proactive detection of operational issues can prevent them from escalating into security problems.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Harness logging is enabled, but full integration with our SIEM system for comprehensive monitoring is not yet configured. Specific monitoring rules and alerts for Harness security events need to be defined. Regular review and analysis of Harness logs are not consistently performed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Full integration of Harness logs with our SIEM system is missing. Definition and implementation of specific monitoring rules and alerts for Harness security events in the SIEM are needed. Regular review and analysis of Harness logs for security events are not yet consistently performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Assessments and Penetration Testing of Harness Environment](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_assessments_and_penetration_testing_of_harness_environment.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Security Assessments and Penetration Testing of Harness Environment
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule Regular Security Assessments:** Schedule periodic security assessments of your Harness environment. This includes reviewing Harness configurations, security policies, access controls, and integrations.
    2.  **Conduct Penetration Testing of Harness Infrastructure:** Engage security professionals to conduct penetration testing of your Harness infrastructure, including Delegates, Connectors (where applicable and permitted), and the Harness platform itself (within the scope allowed by Harness).
    3.  **Focus Assessments on Harness-Specific Security Aspects:** Ensure that security assessments and penetration tests specifically focus on Harness-related security aspects, such as pipeline security, secret management within Harness, Delegate security, Connector security, and Harness platform access controls.
    4.  **Remediate Identified Vulnerabilities:** Promptly address any vulnerabilities or security weaknesses identified during security assessments and penetration testing. Track remediation efforts and verify that vulnerabilities are effectively resolved.
    5.  **Incorporate Findings into Security Improvements:** Use the findings from security assessments and penetration tests to continuously improve the security posture of your Harness environment. Update security policies, configurations, and processes based on assessment results.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Undiscovered Vulnerabilities in Harness Configuration or Infrastructure (Medium to High Severity):** Proactive assessments and testing help identify and remediate undiscovered vulnerabilities in your Harness setup before they can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Misconfigurations in Harness Security Controls (Medium Severity):** Assessments can identify misconfigurations in Harness security controls (RBAC, secret management, etc.) that could weaken security posture.
    *   **Evolving Threat Landscape Affecting Harness Security (Low to Medium Severity):** Regular assessments help ensure that your Harness security measures remain effective against the evolving threat landscape.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Undiscovered Vulnerabilities in Harness Configuration or Infrastructure:** Moderately to Significantly reduces risk. Proactive testing helps find and fix vulnerabilities before exploitation.
    *   **Misconfigurations in Harness Security Controls:** Moderately reduces risk. Assessments help identify and correct misconfigurations that could weaken security.
    *   **Evolving Threat Landscape Affecting Harness Security:** Minimally to Moderately reduces risk. Ensures that security measures remain relevant and effective over time.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Regular security assessments and penetration testing specifically focused on the Harness environment are not currently performed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Establishment of a schedule for regular Harness security assessments and penetration testing is missing. Budget allocation and engagement of security professionals for these activities are needed. A process for tracking and remediating identified vulnerabilities and incorporating findings into security improvements is also missing.
