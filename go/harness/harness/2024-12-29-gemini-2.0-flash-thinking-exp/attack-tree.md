**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Exploit Harness Platform Weaknesses [CRITICAL]:**

*   This represents a broad category where attackers target inherent vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the Harness platform itself. Success here can grant significant control over deployments and the application.

**Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws [CRITICAL]:**

*   Attackers aim to bypass or subvert the mechanisms that control access to Harness. This can involve stealing credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication process, or abusing authorization rules to gain unauthorized access.

    *   **Brute-force/Credential Stuffing on Harness Accounts [HIGH_RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to guess user credentials by trying numerous combinations of usernames and passwords (brute-force) or by using lists of previously compromised credentials from other breaches (credential stuffing).
        *   **Consequences:** Successful access grants the attacker the permissions associated with the compromised account, potentially including the ability to manage deployments.
    *   **Exploit API Key/Token Vulnerabilities [HIGH_RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities related to Harness API keys or tokens. This could involve stealing keys, exploiting overly permissive key scopes, or intercepting key transmissions.
        *   **Consequences:**  Compromised API keys allow attackers to interact with the Harness API as a legitimate user, potentially manipulating deployments or accessing sensitive information.
    *   Bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Harness Accounts [CRITICAL]:
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to circumvent the additional security layer provided by MFA. This can involve social engineering to obtain MFA codes or exploiting vulnerabilities in the MFA implementation itself.
        *   **Consequences:** Successful bypass grants full access to the targeted Harness account, regardless of password strength.

**Exploit Vulnerabilities in Harness Software [CRITICAL]:**

*   Attackers exploit known or unknown security flaws (vulnerabilities) within the Harness platform's code.

    *   Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Harness Platform (CVEs) [CRITICAL]:
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific versions of Harness. This often targets outdated or unpatched instances.
        *   **Consequences:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it can range from information disclosure to remote code execution, potentially granting full control over the Harness platform.
    *   Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Harness Platform [CRITICAL]:
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in Harness. This requires significant research and expertise.
        *   **Consequences:** Similar to known vulnerabilities, the impact can be severe, potentially leading to complete compromise of the Harness platform.

**Abuse Harness Features for Malicious Purposes [HIGH_RISK, CRITICAL]:**

*   Attackers leverage legitimate functionalities of Harness in unintended and harmful ways.

    *   **Manipulate Deployment Pipelines [HIGH_RISK, CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers modify the deployment pipelines within Harness to introduce malicious changes.
        *   **Consequences:** This can lead to the deployment of compromised application versions.
            *   **Inject Malicious Code/Scripts into Deployment Stages [HIGH_RISK]:** Attackers insert malicious code or scripts into the deployment process, which will be executed during deployment.
            *   **Modify Deployment Configurations to Deploy Malicious Artifacts [HIGH_RISK]:** Attackers alter the deployment configuration to pull and deploy malicious application artifacts.
            *   **Trigger Deployments to Malicious Infrastructure [HIGH_RISK]:** Attackers configure deployments to target infrastructure controlled by the attacker.
    *   **Exfiltrate Sensitive Information [HIGH_RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use Harness features to access and extract sensitive data.
        *   **Consequences:** This can lead to the theft of credentials, environment variables, or other confidential information.
            *   **Access Stored Secrets/Credentials within Harness [HIGH_RISK, CRITICAL]:** Attackers gain access to the secure storage within Harness where secrets and credentials for deployments are kept.
        *   Gain Access to Underlying Infrastructure [CRITICAL]:
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage deployment processes or misconfigurations to gain access to the servers or cloud infrastructure where the application is deployed.
            *   **Consequences:** This grants direct control over the application's runtime environment.

**Social Engineering Targeting Harness Users [HIGH_RISK]:**

*   Attackers manipulate individuals with access to Harness to gain unauthorized access or influence deployments.

    *   Phishing for Harness Credentials [HIGH_RISK]:
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use deceptive emails or messages to trick users into revealing their Harness login credentials.
        *   **Consequences:** Successful phishing grants the attacker access to the user's Harness account.
    *   Targeting Users with High Privileges in Harness [HIGH_RISK, CRITICAL]:
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers specifically target users with elevated permissions within Harness, as their accounts provide greater control.
        *   **Consequences:** Compromising these accounts can have a significant impact due to the extensive privileges they possess.

**Exploit Weaknesses in Harness Integrations [HIGH_RISK, CRITICAL]:**

*   Attackers target vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in systems integrated with Harness, using these as a stepping stone to compromise the application deployment process.

    *   **Compromise Source Code Management (SCM) System (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) [HIGH_RISK, CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the source code repository used by Harness.
        *   **Consequences:** This allows for the injection of malicious code directly into the application's codebase.
            *   **Inject Malicious Code into Repository [HIGH_RISK]:** Attackers directly insert malicious code into the application's source code.
            *   **Modify Deployment Scripts within Repository [HIGH_RISK]:** Attackers alter the scripts used by Harness to build and deploy the application, introducing malicious steps.
    *   **Compromise Artifact Repository (e.g., Docker Registry, Nexus) [HIGH_RISK, CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the repository where application artifacts (e.g., Docker images) are stored.
        *   **Consequences:** This allows for the replacement of legitimate artifacts with malicious ones.
            *   **Upload Malicious Artifacts [HIGH_RISK]:** Attackers upload completely malicious application artifacts to the repository.
            *   **Replace Legitimate Artifacts with Malicious Ones [HIGH_RISK]:** Attackers overwrite legitimate artifacts with compromised versions.
    *   Compromise Cloud Provider Credentials Stored in Harness [CRITICAL]:
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to the cloud provider credentials stored within Harness, which are used for deploying and managing infrastructure.
        *   **Consequences:** This grants the attacker direct access to the underlying cloud infrastructure where the application runs, potentially bypassing application-level security.
