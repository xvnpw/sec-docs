* **Attack Surface:** Harness Platform Compromise
    * **Description:**  The central Harness platform, if compromised, grants broad control over deployments, infrastructure, and secrets.
    * **How Harness Contributes:** Harness acts as the central control plane for deployments and infrastructure management, making it a high-value target.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Harness administrative account through credential stuffing or a phishing attack.
    * **Impact:**  Critical. Attackers can deploy malicious code, exfiltrate sensitive data, disrupt services, and gain control over the entire deployment pipeline and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Harness user accounts.
        * Enforce strong password policies and regularly rotate passwords.
        * Restrict access to the Harness platform based on the principle of least privilege.
        * Regularly audit user permissions and access logs.
        * Keep the Harness platform updated with the latest security patches.
        * Implement network segmentation to limit access to the Harness platform.

* **Attack Surface:** Harness Delegate Compromise
    * **Description:**  Harness Delegates, deployed within the application's infrastructure, execute deployment tasks. Compromise provides a direct foothold.
    * **How Harness Contributes:** Delegates are necessary for Harness to interact with the target environment, creating a potential attack vector within the infrastructure.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the delegate software or gains access to the host machine where the delegate is running.
    * **Impact:** High. Attackers can execute arbitrary code within the application's environment, perform lateral movement, access sensitive data, and disrupt services.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the host machines where delegates are deployed (e.g., regular patching, strong security configurations).
        * Implement network segmentation to isolate delegate networks.
        * Use the principle of least privilege for delegate permissions.
        * Regularly update delegate software to the latest versions.
        * Monitor delegate activity for suspicious behavior.
        * Consider using ephemeral delegates where feasible.

* **Attack Surface:** Harness API Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the Harness APIs can allow unauthorized access and manipulation of the platform.
    * **How Harness Contributes:** Harness exposes APIs for programmatic interaction, which, if not properly secured, can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Harness API to create new users with administrative privileges.
    * **Impact:** High. Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify deployment pipelines, and disrupt services.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure proper input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints.
        * Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for API access.
        * Regularly audit and penetration test the Harness APIs.
        * Enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse.
        * Keep the Harness platform updated with the latest security patches.

* **Attack Surface:** Insecure Secrets Management within Harness
    * **Description:**  Weaknesses in how Harness manages and stores secrets can lead to their exposure.
    * **How Harness Contributes:** Harness is often used to manage sensitive credentials required for deployments and integrations.
    * **Example:** Secrets are stored with weak encryption or are accessible to unauthorized users within the Harness platform.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Exposure of secrets can lead to unauthorized access to critical systems, data breaches, and significant financial and reputational damage.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize Harness's built-in secrets management features with strong encryption.
        * Implement strict access controls for accessing and managing secrets within Harness.
        * Avoid storing secrets directly in pipeline definitions or configuration files.
        * Regularly rotate secrets managed by Harness.
        * Integrate with external secrets management providers for enhanced security.

* **Attack Surface:** Malicious Pipeline Modification
    * **Description:**  Attackers with access to pipeline definitions can inject malicious code or alter deployment steps.
    * **How Harness Contributes:** Harness uses "Pipeline as Code," making pipeline definitions a potential target for malicious modification.
    * **Example:** An attacker with compromised developer credentials modifies a pipeline to include a step that exfiltrates data to an external server.
    * **Impact:** High. Attackers can deploy backdoors, steal sensitive information, or disrupt services through compromised pipelines.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement version control for pipeline definitions and track changes.
        * Enforce code review processes for pipeline modifications.
        * Restrict access to pipeline editing based on the principle of least privilege.
        * Implement automated security scanning of pipeline definitions.
        * Utilize approval workflows for critical pipeline changes.
