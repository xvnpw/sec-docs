**[CRITICAL_NODE] Compromise Application via Harness**

This top-level node represents the attacker's ultimate goal: gaining control or significantly impacting the target application by exploiting its integration with the Harness platform. To achieve this, the attacker needs to leverage vulnerabilities or weaknesses in how the application interacts with Harness. Here's a breakdown of potential sub-paths and attack vectors:

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Hardcoded API Keys:**  Keys stored directly in the application's codebase or configuration files (e.g., environment variables without proper encryption).
    * **Compromised Development Environment:**  Attackers gaining access to developer machines or CI/CD environments where API keys are stored or used.
    * **Insecure Key Storage:**  Storing keys in easily accessible locations without proper encryption or access controls.
    * **Exposure through Logging or Monitoring:**  Accidentally logging or exposing API keys in monitoring systems or error messages.
* **Impact:**
    * **Unauthorized Access to Harness Resources:**  The attacker can manipulate deployments, access logs, and potentially modify configurations within Harness.
    * **Malicious Deployments:**  Injecting malicious code or configurations into the application's deployment pipeline.
    * **Data Exfiltration:**  Accessing sensitive data stored within Harness or used during deployments.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Utilize Harness Secret Management:**  Leverage Harness's built-in secret management features to securely store and manage API keys.

    * **Insider Threats:**  Malicious insiders with access to service account credentials.
* **Impact:**
    * **Similar impacts to compromised API keys:** Unauthorized access, malicious deployments, data exfiltration, depending on the service account's permissions.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strong Password Policies:**  Enforce strong, unique passwords for all service accounts.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA for all service accounts to add an extra layer of security.
    * **Regular Password Rotation:**  Implement a policy for periodic password rotation.
    * **Access Control and Auditing:**  Implement strict access controls and audit logs to monitor service account activity.
