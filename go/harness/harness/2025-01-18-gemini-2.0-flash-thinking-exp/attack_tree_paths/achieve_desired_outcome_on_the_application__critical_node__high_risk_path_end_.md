### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

**Achieve Desired Outcome on the Application [CRITICAL_NODE, HIGH_RISK_PATH END]**

* *This represents the successful execution of the attacker's objective after deploying malicious changes.*

This high-level node signifies that the attacker has successfully manipulated the application deployment process to achieve their desired malicious outcome. This could range from data theft and system disruption to complete control over the application and its environment. The fact that this is a "CRITICAL_NODE" and a "HIGH_RISK_PATH END" underscores the severity of reaching this state.

**Attack Vectors:**

Here's a deep dive into each attack vector, considering the Harness context:

**1. Deploy a Backdoor Application Version:**

* **Description:** The attacker deploys a modified version of the application containing a backdoor. This backdoor allows them persistent, unauthorized access to the application and potentially the underlying infrastructure, bypassing normal authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* **Harness Context:**
    * **Compromised Source Code Repository:** An attacker could compromise the source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) integrated with Harness. By pushing malicious code, they can trigger a deployment of the backdoored version through a Harness pipeline.
    * **Compromised Build Artifacts:** If the build process is separate from Harness, an attacker could compromise the build system and inject the backdoor into the application artifacts (e.g., Docker images, JAR files) before they are picked up by Harness for deployment.
    * **Compromised Harness Credentials:** If an attacker gains access to Harness credentials with sufficient permissions, they could directly modify pipeline configurations or manually trigger a deployment using a malicious artifact.
    * **Exploiting Pipeline Vulnerabilities:**  While less likely, vulnerabilities in the Harness pipeline definition or execution could be exploited to inject malicious steps or artifacts.
* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Persistent Access:**  The attacker gains long-term, unauthorized access to the application and its data.
    * **Data Exfiltration:**  The backdoor can be used to steal sensitive data.
    * **Malware Deployment:**  The attacker can use the backdoor to deploy further malware or establish a foothold in the infrastructure.
    * **System Manipulation:**  The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the application server.
* **Detection Strategies:**
    * **Code Reviews and Static Analysis:** Regularly review code changes and use static analysis tools to identify potential backdoors.
    * **Artifact Scanning:** Scan build artifacts (e.g., Docker images) for known vulnerabilities and suspicious code patterns before deployment.
    * **Harness Audit Logs:** Monitor Harness audit logs for unauthorized pipeline modifications, deployment triggers, and changes to user permissions.
    * **Runtime Monitoring:** Implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect suspicious activity within the running application.
    * **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic for unusual connections originating from the application.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Source Code Management:** Implement strong access controls, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and code review processes for the source code repository.
    * **Secure Build Pipeline:** Secure the build process, ensuring integrity checks and access controls.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege in Harness:** Grant only necessary permissions to Harness users and service accounts.
    * **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Utilize immutable infrastructure principles where changes require redeployment rather than in-place modifications.
