### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Execute Arbitrary Code on the Application Infrastructure

**Description of the Attack Path:**

The "Execute Arbitrary Code on the Application Infrastructure" path represents a highly critical security breach. Successful execution of this attack grants the attacker the ability to run any code they choose on the underlying infrastructure supporting the application. This level of access allows for a wide range of malicious activities, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and its data.

**Attack Vectors and Vulnerabilities:**

Given the prompt's indication that the attack vectors are the same as "Achieve Desired Outcome on the Application" sub-vectors related to code execution, we can categorize potential attack vectors as follows:

* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Application Code:**
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities:**  These are critical flaws in the application code that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. Examples include:
        * **Serialization/Deserialization vulnerabilities:**  If the application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, an attacker can inject malicious code.
        * **Command Injection:**  If the application constructs system commands based on user input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands.
        * **SQL Injection (in some cases):** While primarily for database access, in certain scenarios, SQL injection can be leveraged for code execution through features like `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server or `sys_exec` in other databases (if the application interacts directly with the database server).
        * **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**  If user-controlled input is directly embedded into server-side templates, attackers can inject malicious code that gets executed during template rendering.
    * **Impact:** Complete control over the server, data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service, further lateral movement within the infrastructure.
    * **Likelihood:** Varies depending on the application's security practices and code quality.
    * **Mitigation:** Secure coding practices, input validation, output encoding, using parameterized queries, avoiding dynamic code execution, regular security audits and penetration testing.

* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:**
    * **Using components with known vulnerabilities:**  Applications often rely on third-party libraries and frameworks. If these dependencies have known RCE vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them.
    * **Impact:** Similar to application code vulnerabilities, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    * **Likelihood:** Depends on the application's dependency management practices and the prevalence of vulnerabilities in used libraries.
    * **Mitigation:**  Maintaining an up-to-date inventory of dependencies, using dependency scanning tools, promptly patching vulnerable dependencies.

* **Exploiting Misconfigurations in the Infrastructure:**
    * **Insecurely configured services:**  Services like SSH, databases, or message queues might be exposed with default credentials or weak security settings, allowing attackers to gain access and execute commands.
    * **Unpatched operating systems or software:**  Outdated systems are susceptible to known vulnerabilities that can be exploited for code execution.
    * **Overly permissive firewall rules:**  Allowing unnecessary inbound or outbound traffic can create attack vectors.
    * **Impact:** Direct access to the infrastructure, enabling code execution and further exploitation.
    * **Likelihood:** Depends on the organization's infrastructure management practices and security awareness.
    * **Mitigation:**  Following security hardening guidelines, regular patching and updates, implementing strong firewall rules, using intrusion detection/prevention systems.

* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Containerization (if applicable):**
    * **Vulnerable container images:**  Using base images or adding software with known vulnerabilities can allow attackers to escape the container and execute code on the host.
    * **Insecure container configurations:**  Privileged containers or improperly configured security contexts can provide attackers with excessive permissions.
    * **Impact:** Container escape, leading to code execution on the underlying host system.
    * **Likelihood:** Depends on the security practices used in building and deploying container images.
    * **Mitigation:**  Using minimal and trusted base images, regularly scanning container images for vulnerabilities, adhering to container security best practices, using security context constraints.

* **Exploiting Harness Platform Integrations:**
    * **Compromised Harness API Keys or Tokens:** If an attacker gains access to valid Harness API keys or tokens, they could potentially manipulate deployment pipelines or infrastructure configurations to inject malicious code.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Harness Connectors:**  If connectors used by Harness to interact with infrastructure providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) have vulnerabilities, attackers could leverage them to execute code on the target infrastructure.
    * **Malicious Code in Deployment Pipelines:**  Attackers could inject malicious code into deployment scripts or configuration files managed by Harness, leading to its execution during deployment.
    * **Impact:**  Ability to modify infrastructure, deploy malicious applications, and execute code on the target environment.
    * **Likelihood:** Depends on the security of Harness credentials and the security posture of the Harness platform itself.
    * **Mitigation:**  Securely storing and managing Harness API keys and tokens, regularly reviewing and auditing Harness configurations, implementing strong access controls within Harness, using secure coding practices for deployment scripts.

* **Supply Chain Attacks:**
    * **Compromised build tools or dependencies:**  Attackers could compromise tools used in the build process or inject malicious code into dependencies used by the application, leading to the execution of arbitrary code during the build or deployment process.
    * **Impact:**  Introduction of malicious code into the application or infrastructure without direct exploitation of application vulnerabilities.
    * **Likelihood:** Increasing concern, requires strong supply chain security measures.
    * **Mitigation:**  Verifying the integrity of build tools and dependencies, using software bill of materials (SBOMs), implementing secure build pipelines.

* **Social Engineering and Insider Threats:**
    * **Tricking authorized users into running malicious code:**  Attackers could use phishing or other social engineering techniques to convince users with access to the infrastructure to execute malicious commands or scripts.
    * **Malicious insiders:**  Individuals with legitimate access could intentionally execute arbitrary code for malicious purposes.
    * **Impact:**  Direct execution of code with the privileges of the compromised user.
    * **Likelihood:** Depends on the organization's security awareness training and internal security controls.
    * **Mitigation:**  Strong access controls, multi-factor authentication, security awareness training, monitoring user activity, implementing least privilege principles.

**Impact of Successful Attack:**

Successfully executing arbitrary code on the application infrastructure has severe consequences, including:

* **Complete System Compromise:**  The attacker gains full control over the affected systems.
* **Data Breach and Exfiltration:**  Sensitive data can be accessed, stolen, or manipulated.
* **Denial of Service:**  The attacker can disrupt the application's availability.
* **Malware Installation:**  The attacker can install persistent malware for long-term access and control.
* **Lateral Movement:**  The compromised system can be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the infrastructure.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Financial Losses:**  Recovery efforts, legal fees, and business disruption can lead to significant financial losses.
