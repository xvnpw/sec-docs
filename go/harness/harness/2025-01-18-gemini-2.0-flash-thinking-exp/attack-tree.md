## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Harness [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_harness__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Harness [CRITICAL_NODE, HIGH_RISK_PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_harness__critical_node__high_risk_path_start_.md)

* This is the initial critical step. Without access to Harness, the attacker cannot leverage its capabilities for malicious purposes.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Harness Login Mechanism: Exploiting weaknesses in the login process (e.g., brute-force, credential stuffing, vulnerabilities).
    * Exploit API Key/Token Vulnerabilities: Obtaining and using leaked or compromised API keys or tokens.
    * Compromise a Legitimate User Account: Gaining access through phishing, social engineering, or other means.
    * Exploit Misconfigured RBAC: Leveraging overly permissive role-based access control.
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Harness SaaS Platform: Targeting vulnerabilities in the Harness-managed infrastructure (less likely for end-users).
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Self-Hosted Harness Instance: Targeting vulnerabilities in the organization's infrastructure hosting Harness.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Harness Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_harness_authenticationauthorization__critical_node_.md)

* This node represents the core mechanisms for gaining unauthorized access to Harness.
* Attack Vectors (same as "Gain Access to Harness" sub-vectors related to authentication/authorization).

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Harness to Deploy Malicious Code/Configuration [CRITICAL_NODE, HIGH_RISK_PATH CONTINUE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_harness_to_deploy_malicious_codeconfiguration__critical_node__high_risk_path_continue_.md)

* Once access is gained, this step involves using Harness's features to introduce malicious changes.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Modify Source Code in Integrated Repositories: Injecting malicious code directly into the source code repository.
    * Inject Malicious Artifacts into Artifact Repositories: Replacing legitimate build artifacts with malicious ones.
    * Modify Deployment Manifests/Configurations within Harness: Altering deployment settings to introduce malicious configurations.
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Harness Pipeline Stages: Leveraging vulnerabilities in custom scripts or integrations within the pipeline.
    * Change Deployment Target to a Malicious Environment: Redirecting deployments to a controlled environment.
    * Modify Environment Variables: Injecting malicious data or credentials through environment variables.
    * Downgrade to a Vulnerable Application Version: Rolling back to a version with known security flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into the Deployment Pipeline [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_the_deployment_pipeline__critical_node_.md)

* This is a direct and effective way to compromise the application by inserting malicious code into the deployment process.
* Attack Vectors (same as "Manipulate Harness to Deploy Malicious Code/Configuration" sub-vectors related to code injection).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Harness Integrations [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_harness_integrations__critical_node_.md)

* Leveraging vulnerabilities in systems integrated with Harness to facilitate attacks.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Compromise Integrated Secrets Managers: Gaining access to sensitive credentials stored in integrated secrets management systems.
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Integrated Monitoring/Logging Tools: Manipulating monitoring or logging data to hide malicious activity.
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Integrated Notification Systems: Suppressing alerts about malicious deployments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Integrated Secrets Managers [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_integrated_secrets_managers__critical_node_.md)

* A successful compromise here grants access to sensitive credentials, which can be used for further attacks.
* Attack Vectors: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the secrets manager itself, misconfigurations, or weak access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Malicious Deployment [CRITICAL_NODE, HIGH_RISK_PATH CONTINUE]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_malicious_deployment__critical_node__high_risk_path_continue_.md)

* This step involves initiating the deployment of the manipulated code or configuration.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Manually Trigger a Malicious Pipeline Execution: Manually starting a pipeline that deploys malicious changes.
    * Automate Malicious Deployment via Harness APIs: Using compromised API keys to programmatically trigger deployments.
    * Exploit Automated Triggers: Manipulating automated triggers (e.g., Git webhooks) to initiate malicious deployments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Desired Outcome on the Application [CRITICAL_NODE, HIGH_RISK_PATH END]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_desired_outcome_on_the_application__critical_node__high_risk_path_end_.md)

* This represents the successful execution of the attacker's objective after deploying malicious changes.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Deploy a Backdoor Application Version: Deploying a version of the application with a backdoor for persistent access.
    * Inject Malicious Code during Deployment: Injecting code during the deployment process to execute on the application infrastructure.
    * Modify Application Configuration to Execute Malicious Commands: Altering configuration files to execute arbitrary commands.
    * Deploy Code that Exfiltrates Data: Deploying a modified application version that steals sensitive data.
    * Modify Logging/Monitoring to Capture and Exfiltrate Data: Configuring logging or monitoring to capture and exfiltrate sensitive information.
    * Deploy a Faulty Application Version: Deploying a broken version to cause disruption.
    * Modify Infrastructure Configuration to Cause Denial of Service: Altering infrastructure settings to make the application unavailable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on the Application Infrastructure [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_application_infrastructure__critical_node_.md)

* This is a highly critical outcome, granting the attacker significant control over the application's infrastructure.
* Attack Vectors (same as "Achieve Desired Outcome on the Application" sub-vectors related to code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Sensitive Data from the Application [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_sensitive_data_from_the_application__critical_node_.md)

* This represents a successful data breach, a critical security incident.
* Attack Vectors (same as "Achieve Desired Outcome on the Application" sub-vectors related to data exfiltration).
