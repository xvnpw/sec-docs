# Attack Surface Analysis for harness/harness

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Harness API Keys/Tokens](./attack_surfaces/compromised_harness_api_keystokens.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to Harness platform via stolen or leaked API keys or tokens used for authentication.
*   **How Harness Contributes:** Harness relies on API keys/tokens for programmatic access and automation, making their security critical.
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits a Harness API key to a public GitHub repository. An attacker finds the key and uses it to modify deployment pipelines.
*   **Impact:** Full control over deployment processes, access to sensitive data within Harness (secrets, logs), potential for malicious deployments and infrastructure compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store API keys securely using dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secrets managers).
    *   Implement strict access controls and least privilege principles for API key generation and usage within Harness.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys.
    *   Utilize environment variables or secure configuration mechanisms instead of hardcoding keys in code.
    *   Scan code repositories for accidentally committed secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Harness Delegate](./attack_surfaces/compromised_harness_delegate.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a Harness Delegate, which has direct access to the application's infrastructure.
*   **How Harness Contributes:** Delegates are necessary for Harness to interact with and manage deployment environments. Their compromise provides a direct pathway into the infrastructure.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in the Delegate software allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host machine. They then use this access to pivot to other systems in the network.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the target environment where the delegate resides, potential for data breaches, service disruption, and lateral movement within the infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Harden the operating system and network where the Delegate is running.
    *   Keep the Harness Delegate software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Implement network segmentation to limit the Delegate's access to only necessary resources.
    *   Monitor Delegate activity for suspicious behavior.
    *   Use ephemeral Delegates where possible to minimize the window of opportunity for compromise.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection into Harness Pipelines](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_into_harness_pipelines.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers with access to Harness modify deployment pipelines to inject malicious code that gets executed during deployments.
*   **How Harness Contributes:** Harness pipelines define the deployment process, making them a target for injecting malicious steps.
*   **Example:** An attacker with compromised Harness user credentials adds a step to a pipeline that downloads and executes a malicious script on the target server during deployment.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the deployed application and its environment, potential data breaches, and introduction of backdoors.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access controls and code review processes for pipeline modifications.
    *   Utilize infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and version control for pipeline definitions to track changes and enable rollback.
    *   Implement security scanning and validation steps within the pipeline to detect malicious code or vulnerabilities.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for users who can modify pipelines.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Secrets Managed by Harness](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_secrets_managed_by_harness.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information (credentials, API keys) managed within Harness's secrets management is exposed due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities.
*   **How Harness Contributes:** Harness provides a centralized secrets management feature, and its security is paramount to protecting these secrets.
*   **Example:** Incorrectly configured access controls on a secret within Harness allow an unauthorized user to view database credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to critical systems and data protected by the exposed secrets.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Harness's built-in secrets management features securely.
    *   Implement strong access controls and the principle of least privilege for accessing secrets within Harness.
    *   Regularly audit access to secrets.
    *   Consider using external secrets managers integrated with Harness for enhanced security.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Harness Platform Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_harness_platform_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within the Harness platform software that could be exploited by attackers.
*   **How Harness Contributes:** As a software platform, Harness is susceptible to vulnerabilities that need to be addressed by the vendor.
*   **Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of Harness. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the Harness platform.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Harness platform, potentially affecting all applications and deployments managed by it.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay informed about Harness security advisories and release notes.
    *   Promptly apply security patches and updates provided by Harness.
    *   Follow Harness's recommended security best practices for platform configuration.
