### Security Implications of Key Components:

**1. Harness Manager:**

*   **Security Implication:** As the central point of control, a compromise of the Harness Manager could grant an attacker widespread access and control over the entire CI/CD pipeline and potentially connected environments.
    *   **Specific Threat:**  Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the UI or API server could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or manipulation of pipeline configurations.
    *   **Specific Threat:** Weak password policies or lack of multi-factor authentication for user accounts could allow for credential compromise.
    *   **Specific Threat:** Insufficient input validation on API endpoints could lead to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
*   **Security Implication:** The authentication and authorization mechanisms are critical. Flaws in these systems could lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
    *   **Specific Threat:**  Bypass of role-based access control (RBAC) could allow users to perform actions beyond their authorized scope.
    *   **Specific Threat:**  Insecure storage or transmission of API keys or tokens could lead to their compromise.

**2. Pipeline Service:**

*   **Security Implication:** The Pipeline Service orchestrates the CI/CD process, and vulnerabilities here could allow attackers to inject malicious code into pipelines or manipulate deployment processes.
    *   **Specific Threat:**  Insufficient validation of pipeline definitions could allow for the injection of malicious scripts or commands that are executed by the Delegate.
    *   **Specific Threat:**  Lack of proper authorization checks when retrieving connector details or secrets could expose sensitive credentials.
