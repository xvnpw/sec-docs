# Threat Model Analysis for harness/harness

## Threat: [Compromised Harness API Keys](./threats/compromised_harness_api_keys.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to Harness API keys used by the application. They might use these keys to authenticate against the Harness API and perform actions such as:
    *   Modifying deployment pipelines to inject malicious code.
    *   Accessing and exfiltrating secrets stored within Harness.
    *   Triggering unauthorized deployments or rollbacks, causing service disruption.
    *   Deleting or modifying critical Harness configurations.
*   **Impact:**  Significant impact, potentially leading to:
    *   Deployment of compromised application versions.
    *   Exposure of sensitive application data and credentials.
    *   Denial of service or instability of the application.
    *   Loss of control over the deployment process.
*   **Affected Component:** Harness API, API Keys
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store API keys securely using secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) instead of directly in code or configuration files.
    *   Implement strict access controls on where API keys are stored and who can access them.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys.
    *   Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity.
    *   Utilize Harness's built-in features for managing API keys and their permissions.

## Threat: [Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Harness](./threats/insufficient_role-based_access_control__rbac__in_harness.md)

## Threat: [Injection of Malicious Secrets](./threats/injection_of_malicious_secrets.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges within Harness injects malicious secrets (e.g., a database password that grants excessive permissions, a compromised API key) that are then used by the application during deployment or runtime. This could allow them to:
    *   Gain unauthorized access to application resources.
    *   Escalate privileges within the application's environment.
    *   Execute malicious code within the application's context.
*   **Impact:** High impact, potentially leading to:
