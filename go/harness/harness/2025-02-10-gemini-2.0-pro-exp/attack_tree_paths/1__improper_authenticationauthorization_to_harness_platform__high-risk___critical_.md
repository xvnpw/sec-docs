# Deep Analysis: Improper Authentication/Authorization to Harness Platform

## 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the attack path "Improper Authentication/Authorization to Harness Platform" within the broader attack tree, identifying specific vulnerabilities, attack vectors, potential impacts, and recommended mitigations.  The goal is to provide actionable insights to the development team to strengthen the platform's security posture against unauthorized access.  We aim to reduce the likelihood and impact of successful attacks exploiting authentication and authorization weaknesses.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the Harness platform itself, as deployed and configured using the resources from [https://github.com/harness/harness](https://github.com/harness/harness).  The scope includes:

*   **Authentication Mechanisms:**  All supported authentication methods (e.g., local user accounts, SSO integrations like SAML/OIDC, API keys, service accounts).
*   **Authorization Controls:**  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation, permission models, delegation mechanisms, and any custom authorization logic.
*   **Configuration:**  Default configurations, recommended security settings, and common misconfigurations related to authentication and authorization.
*   **API Security:**  Authentication and authorization for API access to the Harness platform.
*   **Session Management:** How user sessions are handled, including session timeouts, token validation, and protection against session hijacking.
*   **Secret Management (related to AuthN/AuthZ):** How secrets used for authentication (e.g., API keys, service account credentials) are stored and managed *within* the Harness platform.  This does *not* include the broader topic of how Harness manages secrets for *deployments*.
* **Audit Logging (related to AuthN/AuthZ):** How authentication and authorization events are logged and monitored.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Security of external systems integrated with Harness (e.g., the security of a specific SSO provider).  We assume the *integration* is the focus, not the provider itself.
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes cluster security) *unless* they directly impact Harness's authentication/authorization.
*   Social engineering attacks targeting users to obtain credentials (although mitigations like MFA are in scope).
*   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, unless they specifically target authentication/authorization mechanisms.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the Harness codebase (from the provided GitHub repository) to identify potential vulnerabilities in authentication and authorization logic.  This includes searching for:
    *   Hardcoded credentials.
    *   Weak or insecure cryptographic implementations.
    *   Improper input validation related to authentication/authorization.
    *   Logic flaws in RBAC implementation.
    *   Insecure session management practices.
    *   Missing or insufficient authorization checks.

2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Review default configurations and recommended security settings to identify potential weaknesses and misconfigurations.  This includes:
    *   Default user accounts and passwords.
    *   Weak password policies.
    *   Insufficient session timeout settings.
    *   Overly permissive default roles.
    *   Lack of mandatory MFA.

3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Develop specific attack scenarios based on common authentication and authorization vulnerabilities, considering the context of the Harness platform.  Examples include:
    *   Brute-force attacks against user accounts.
    *   Credential stuffing attacks.
    *   Exploitation of weak or compromised API keys.
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Privilege escalation due to misconfigured RBAC.
    *   Exploitation of vulnerabilities in SSO integrations.

4.  **Documentation Review:**  Analyze Harness's official documentation to understand the intended security model and identify any gaps or inconsistencies.

5.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Search for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) related to Harness or its dependencies that could impact authentication/authorization.

6.  **Best Practices Comparison:**  Compare Harness's implementation against industry best practices for authentication and authorization (e.g., OWASP guidelines, NIST standards).

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Improper Authentication/Authorization

This section details the analysis of the specific attack path, breaking it down into sub-paths and analyzing each.

**4.1 Sub-Paths and Attack Vectors**

The primary attack path, "Improper Authentication/Authorization to Harness Platform," can be further divided into these sub-paths:

*   **4.1.1 Weak Authentication:**
    *   **4.1.1.1 Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers attempt to guess usernames and passwords through repeated login attempts.
        *   **Code Review Focus:**  Check for rate limiting, account lockout mechanisms, and CAPTCHA implementation.  Look for any bypasses to these protections.
        *   **Configuration Analysis:**  Examine default password policies (length, complexity, history), account lockout settings, and rate limiting configurations.
        *   **Threat Modeling:**  Simulate brute-force attacks against various authentication endpoints (UI, API).
        *   **Mitigation:** Strong password policies, account lockout, rate limiting, CAPTCHA, multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   **4.1.1.2 Credential Stuffing:** Attackers use lists of stolen credentials (from other breaches) to attempt to gain access.
