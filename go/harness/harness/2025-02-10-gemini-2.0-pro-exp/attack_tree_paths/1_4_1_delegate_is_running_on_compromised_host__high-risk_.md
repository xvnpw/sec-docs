# Deep Analysis of Harness Delegate Compromise: Attack Tree Path 1.4.1

## 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the attack path "1.4.1 Delegate is running on a compromised host" within the Harness platform, identify potential attack vectors, assess the impact, propose mitigation strategies, and recommend detection mechanisms.  The goal is to provide actionable insights to the development and security teams to reduce the risk associated with this scenario.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where a Harness Delegate, deployed on a host machine (e.g., a virtual machine, container, physical server), is compromised.  This includes:

*   **Harness Delegate Versions:**  All currently supported versions of the Harness Delegate.  We will note if specific vulnerabilities are version-dependent.
*   **Deployment Environments:**  The analysis considers various deployment environments where the Delegate might be running, including:
    *   Cloud-based VMs (AWS EC2, Azure VMs, GCP Compute Engine)
    *   On-premises VMs (VMware, Hyper-V)
    *   Containerized environments (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
    *   Bare-metal servers
*   **Delegate Functionality:**  We will consider all functionalities of the Delegate, including:
    *   Connecting to target environments (Kubernetes clusters, cloud accounts, etc.)
    *   Executing deployment tasks (deploying applications, running scripts, etc.)
    *   Fetching secrets and configurations
    *   Communicating with the Harness Manager
*   **Exclusions:** This analysis *does not* cover:
    *   Compromise of the Harness Manager itself.
    *   Attacks originating from within the target environments (e.g., a compromised application deployed *by* the Delegate).  We focus on the Delegate as the initial point of compromise.
    *   Social engineering attacks targeting Harness users (these would be separate attack tree paths).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:** We will use a threat modeling approach to identify potential attack vectors that could lead to the compromise of the host running the Delegate.  This includes considering:
    *   **STRIDE:** Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:**  Researching known vulnerabilities in operating systems, container runtimes, and related software that could be exploited.
    *   **Common Attack Patterns:**  Analyzing common attack patterns used to compromise servers and containers.

2.  **Impact Assessment:**  We will assess the potential impact of a compromised Delegate, considering:
    *   **Confidentiality:**  Exposure of sensitive data (secrets, credentials, application code).
    *   **Integrity:**  Modification of deployment pipelines, applications, or infrastructure.
    *   **Availability:**  Disruption of deployment processes and application availability.

3.  **Mitigation Strategy Recommendation:**  We will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies to reduce the likelihood and impact of this attack path.  These will be categorized as:
    *   **Preventative:**  Measures to prevent the initial compromise of the host.
    *   **Detective:**  Mechanisms to detect a compromised host or Delegate.
    *   **Responsive:**  Actions to take after a compromise has been detected.

4.  **Detection Difficulty Analysis:** We will analyze the difficulty of detecting a compromised Delegate, considering factors like:
    *   **Stealth Techniques:**  How an attacker might attempt to hide their presence on the compromised host.
    *   **Monitoring Capabilities:**  The effectiveness of existing monitoring tools and techniques.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.4.1: Delegate on Compromised Host

**4.1 Threat Modeling (How the Host Gets Compromised)**

An attacker could compromise the host running the Harness Delegate through various means.  Here are some key attack vectors, categorized using STRIDE:

*   **Spoofing:**
    *   **ARP Spoofing/Man-in-the-Middle:**  If the Delegate communicates with the Harness Manager or other services over an insecure network, an attacker could intercept and modify traffic.  This is less likely with HTTPS, but still a consideration for internal network traffic.
    *   **DNS Spoofing:** Redirecting the Delegate's DNS queries to malicious servers.

*   **Tampering:**
    *   **OS/Software Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in the host operating system (e.g., Linux kernel vulnerabilities, Windows vulnerabilities) or installed software (e.g., outdated SSH server, vulnerable container runtime).  This is a *primary* attack vector.
    *   **Malicious Software Installation:**  Tricking a user or automated process into installing malware on the host (e.g., through a compromised software repository, phishing email, or supply chain attack).
    *   **Physical Access:**  If an attacker gains physical access to the host, they could directly tamper with the system.

*   **Repudiation:**  (Less directly relevant to initial compromise, but important for post-compromise analysis)
    *   **Log Tampering:**  An attacker might attempt to delete or modify logs to cover their tracks.

*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  An attacker could use vulnerability scanners to identify weaknesses in the host's exposed services.
    *   **Credential Leakage:**  If credentials for the host are leaked (e.g., through a data breach, weak passwords, or exposed configuration files), an attacker could gain access.
    *   **Open Ports and Services:** Unnecessary open ports and services increase the attack surface.

*   **Denial of Service:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  While a DoS attack wouldn't directly compromise the host, it could make it unavailable, impacting the Delegate's functionality.  This could be a precursor to another attack.
    *   **Exploiting DoS Vulnerabilities:**  Some vulnerabilities can be exploited to crash the host or specific services.

*   **Elevation of Privilege:**
    *   **Local Privilege Escalation:**  An attacker who gains initial access with limited privileges (e.g., through a compromised user account) might exploit vulnerabilities to gain root/administrator access.  This is a *critical* step for the attacker.
    *   **Container Escape:**  If the Delegate is running in a container, an attacker might attempt to escape the container and gain access to the host.

**4.2 Impact Assessment (What the Attacker Can Do)**

Once the host is compromised, the attacker gains significant control over the Harness Delegate and its capabilities.  The impact is HIGH:

*   **Access to Secrets:** The Delegate likely has access to sensitive secrets and credentials used to connect to target environments (e.g., Kubernetes API keys, cloud provider credentials, SSH keys, database passwords).  The attacker can steal these secrets.
*   **Manipulation of Deployments:** The attacker can modify deployment pipelines, inject malicious code into applications, or deploy their own malicious applications.  This could lead to widespread compromise of production systems.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The attacker can use the compromised Delegate as a pivot point to attack other systems within the network, including the Harness Manager itself or other target environments.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can exfiltrate sensitive data from the target environments accessed by the Delegate.
*   **Disruption of Services:** The attacker can disrupt deployment processes, causing outages and impacting application availability.
*   **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack could lead to significant reputational damage for the organization.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  The compromise could lead to violations of compliance regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).

**4.3 Mitigation Strategies**

**4.3.1 Preventative Measures (Reduce Likelihood)**

*   **Host Hardening:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the Delegate with the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid running it as root/administrator.  Use dedicated service accounts with restricted permissions.
    *   **Regular Patching:**  Implement a robust patch management process to ensure the host operating system and all installed software are up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Automate patching where possible.
    *   **Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) / AppArmor:**  Use mandatory access control (MAC) systems like SELinux or AppArmor to confine the Delegate's processes and limit the impact of a potential compromise.
    *   **Firewall Configuration:**  Configure a host-based firewall to allow only necessary inbound and outbound traffic.  Restrict access to the Delegate's ports.
    *   **Minimize Attack Surface:**  Disable unnecessary services and remove unused software.
    *   **Secure Boot:**  Enable secure boot to prevent unauthorized bootloaders and operating systems from loading.
    *   **Configuration Management:**  Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to ensure consistent and secure configurations across all Delegate hosts.
    *   **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Consider using immutable infrastructure principles, where servers are replaced rather than updated in place. This makes it harder for attackers to maintain persistence.

*   **Network Security:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Delegate host in a separate network segment with restricted access to other parts of the network.
    *   **VPN/TLS:**  Ensure all communication between the Delegate and the Harness Manager is encrypted using TLS/HTTPS.  Consider using a VPN for additional security.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Deploy network-based IDS/IPS to detect and prevent malicious network traffic.

*   **Container Security (if applicable):**
    *   **Use Minimal Base Images:**  Use minimal container base images (e.g., distroless images) to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Regularly Scan Container Images:**  Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deploying them.
    *   **Runtime Security:**  Use container runtime security tools (e.g., Falco, Sysdig Secure) to monitor container behavior and detect anomalies.
    *   **Seccomp and AppArmor/SELinux Profiles:**  Use seccomp profiles to restrict the system calls that the container can make.  Use AppArmor or SELinux to further confine the container.
    *   **Read-Only Root Filesystem:**  Run the container with a read-only root filesystem to prevent attackers from modifying the container's files.

*   **Credential Management:**
    *   **Avoid Hardcoded Credentials:**  Never hardcode credentials in the Delegate configuration or scripts.
    *   **Use a Secrets Management Solution:**  Use a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to securely store and manage secrets.  The Delegate should retrieve secrets from the secrets management solution at runtime.
    *   **Short-Lived Credentials:**  Use short-lived credentials whenever possible.  Rotate credentials regularly.

* **Harness Specific Configuration:**
    * **Delegate Scopes:** Utilize Delegate Scopes to limit the permissions and access of individual Delegates. This minimizes the blast radius if a Delegate is compromised.
    * **Delegate Selectors:** Use Delegate Selectors to ensure that specific tasks are only executed by designated Delegates, further restricting access.

**4.3.2 Detective Measures (Increase Detection Probability)**

*   **Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS):**  Deploy a HIDS (e.g., OSSEC, Wazuh) to monitor the host for suspicious activity, such as:
    *   Unauthorized file modifications
    *   Unexpected process creation
    *   Changes to system configurations
    *   Failed login attempts

*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate logs from the host, Delegate, and other relevant systems into a SIEM (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack) to centralize log analysis and correlation.  Create alerts for suspicious events.

*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Use FIM tools (e.g., AIDE, Tripwire) to monitor critical system files and directories for unauthorized changes.

*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan the host for vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS).

*   **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):** If the delegate is running a custom application, consider RASP solutions.

*   **Harness Auditing:**  Enable and regularly review Harness audit logs to track Delegate activity and identify any unusual behavior.

*   **Behavioral Analysis:**  Monitor the Delegate's network traffic and resource usage for anomalies.  Look for unusual patterns that might indicate a compromise.

**4.3.3 Responsive Measures (Post-Compromise Actions)**

*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and maintain a comprehensive incident response plan that outlines the steps to take in the event of a Delegate compromise.
*   **Isolate the Host:**  Immediately isolate the compromised host from the network to prevent further damage and lateral movement.
*   **Forensic Analysis:**  Conduct a forensic analysis of the compromised host to determine the cause of the compromise, the extent of the damage, and the attacker's actions.
*   **Revoke Credentials:**  Revoke all credentials that were accessible to the compromised Delegate.
*   **Rebuild the Host:**  Rebuild the host from a known-good image or configuration.  Do not attempt to "clean" the compromised host.
*   **Review and Improve Security Controls:**  After the incident, review and improve security controls to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
*   **Notify Affected Parties:**  If sensitive data was compromised, notify affected parties as required by law and regulations.

**4.4 Detection Difficulty Analysis**

The detection difficulty is rated as **Medium**.  Here's why:

*   **Stealth Techniques:**  A skilled attacker can use various techniques to hide their presence on the compromised host, such as:
    *   Rootkits:  Modify the kernel or system utilities to conceal malicious processes and files.
    *   Log Tampering:  Delete or modify logs to cover their tracks.
    *   Living Off the Land:  Use legitimate system tools and utilities to carry out malicious activities, making it harder to distinguish between normal and malicious behavior.

*   **Monitoring Capabilities:**  The effectiveness of detection depends on the monitoring capabilities in place.  Without adequate monitoring (HIDS, SIEM, FIM), a compromise could go undetected for a long time.  However, with proper monitoring and alerting, detection is possible.

*   **Delegate Behavior:**  The Delegate's normal behavior (connecting to various systems, executing scripts, etc.) can make it harder to distinguish between legitimate activity and malicious activity.  This requires careful analysis of logs and network traffic.

* **Harness Built-in Features:** Harness provides some built-in features that can aid in detection, such as audit logs and Delegate Scopes. However, these features need to be properly configured and monitored.
