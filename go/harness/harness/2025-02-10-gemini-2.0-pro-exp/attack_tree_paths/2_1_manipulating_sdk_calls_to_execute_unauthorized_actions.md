Okay, let's dive into a deep analysis of the attack tree path "2.1 Manipulating SDK Calls to Execute Unauthorized Actions" within the context of a Harness-based application.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1 Manipulating SDK Calls to Execute Unauthorized Actions

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors, and mitigation strategies related to an attacker manipulating SDK calls made by a Harness-integrated application to execute unauthorized actions.  This analysis aims to identify specific weaknesses that could be exploited and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the application's security posture.  We want to prevent attackers from leveraging the Harness SDK to bypass intended security controls and perform actions they should not be authorized to do.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following:

*   **Harness SDK Usage:**  How the application utilizes the Harness SDK (Go, Java, Python, etc.).  This includes identifying *which* SDK functions are used, *where* they are used within the application's codebase, and *how* they are integrated into the application's logic.
*   **Application Context:** The specific application using the Harness SDK.  We need to understand the application's purpose, its architecture, the types of data it handles, and its existing security mechanisms.  A CI/CD pipeline application will have different vulnerabilities than a feature flag management application.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  How the application handles inputs that are passed to the Harness SDK.  This is crucial because manipulated inputs are a primary vector for this attack.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** How the application authenticates itself to the Harness platform and how it enforces authorization for actions performed through the SDK.  This includes the use of API keys, service accounts, and role-based access control (RBAC).
*   **Error Handling:** How the application handles errors returned by the Harness SDK.  Poor error handling can leak information or create exploitable conditions.
*   **Dependencies:** The specific version of the Harness SDK being used, and any other relevant libraries that interact with the SDK or handle input data.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Attacks targeting the Harness platform itself (e.g., vulnerabilities in the Harness Manager). This analysis focuses on the *application's* use of the SDK.
*   Generic application vulnerabilities unrelated to the Harness SDK (e.g., SQL injection in a database unrelated to Harness).
*   Physical security or social engineering attacks.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough review of the application's source code, focusing on the areas identified in the Scope.  This will involve:
    *   Identifying all instances where the Harness SDK is used.
    *   Tracing the flow of data from user inputs or external sources to the SDK calls.
    *   Analyzing input validation, sanitization, and error handling logic.
    *   Examining authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Checking for hardcoded credentials or other sensitive information.

2.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Identifying the specific version of the Harness SDK and related libraries.  Checking for known vulnerabilities in these dependencies using vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, Snyk, etc.).

3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Developing specific attack scenarios based on the code review and dependency analysis.  This will involve:
    *   Identifying potential attacker goals (e.g., deploying malicious code, deleting resources, accessing sensitive data).
    *   Mapping these goals to specific SDK calls that could be manipulated.
    *   Constructing attack scenarios that describe how an attacker could achieve these goals.

4.  **Dynamic Analysis (Optional):**  If feasible, performing dynamic analysis using techniques like fuzzing or penetration testing to attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities. This would involve crafting malicious inputs and observing the application's behavior.

5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Based on the findings, providing specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1 Manipulating SDK Calls

Now, let's analyze the specific attack path, "2.1 Manipulating SDK Calls to Execute Unauthorized Actions."

**4.1 Potential Attack Vectors:**

*   **Input Manipulation:**
    *   **Parameter Tampering:**  An attacker modifies parameters passed to SDK calls.  For example, changing a deployment target, pipeline ID, or artifact version to unauthorized values.  This is the most likely attack vector.
    *   **Injection Attacks:**  Injecting malicious code or commands into parameters that are then executed by the Harness platform.  This is less likely with the SDK (compared to, say, a direct API call), but still possible if the application doesn't properly sanitize inputs.
    *   **Type Juggling:** Exploiting weaknesses in how the application handles different data types. For example, passing a string where an integer is expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

*   **Compromised Credentials:**
    *   **Stolen API Keys:**  If an attacker gains access to the application's Harness API key (e.g., through a compromised developer machine, exposed configuration file, or leaked secret), they can directly use the SDK to perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Service Account Abuse:**  If the application uses a service account with overly permissive permissions, an attacker who compromises the application could leverage the service account to perform unauthorized actions through the SDK.

*   **Logic Flaws:**
    *   **Missing Authorization Checks:**  The application might call the Harness SDK without properly verifying that the current user is authorized to perform the requested action.  This is a critical flaw in the application's logic.
    *   **Race Conditions:**  In multi-threaded applications, there might be race conditions that allow an attacker to manipulate SDK calls between the time of authorization check and the actual SDK call.
    *   **Improper Error Handling:**  If the application doesn't handle errors from the SDK correctly, an attacker might be able to trigger an error condition that leads to an exploitable state.

**4.2 Example Attack Scenarios:**

*   **Scenario 1: Unauthorized Deployment:**
    *   **Goal:** Deploy a malicious application to a production environment.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Parameter Tampering.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  The attacker intercepts a request to the application that triggers a deployment through the Harness SDK.
        2.  The attacker modifies the `pipelineId` or `applicationId` parameter in the request to point to a production pipeline and application.
        3.  The application, lacking proper input validation, passes the modified parameters to the Harness SDK.
        4.  The Harness SDK executes the deployment to the production environment.

*   **Scenario 2: Resource Deletion:**
    *   **Goal:** Delete a critical infrastructure resource (e.g., a database or load balancer).
    *   **Attack Vector:** Compromised Credentials + Logic Flaw (Missing Authorization Checks).
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  The attacker gains access to the application's Harness API key.
        2.  The attacker uses the API key to directly interact with the Harness SDK.
        3.  The attacker calls an SDK function to delete a resource (e.g., `DeleteInfrastructure`).
        4.  The application (or a separate component using the SDK) does not perform any authorization checks before calling the SDK function.
        5.  The Harness platform deletes the resource.

*   **Scenario 3: Feature Flag Manipulation:**
    *   **Goal:** Enable a hidden feature flag that grants access to sensitive data or functionality.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Parameter Tampering.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  The attacker intercepts a request that interacts with a feature flag through the Harness SDK.
        2.  The attacker modifies the `flagIdentifier` parameter to target a sensitive feature flag.
        3.  The attacker modifies the `value` parameter to enable the flag.
        4.  The application, lacking proper input validation, passes the modified parameters to the Harness SDK.
        5.  The Harness SDK updates the feature flag, granting the attacker access.

**4.3 Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed values for all parameters passed to the Harness SDK.  Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.
    *   **Data Type Enforcement:**  Ensure that parameters are of the correct data type.  Use strong typing and validation libraries to prevent type juggling attacks.
    *   **Regular Expressions:**  Use regular expressions to validate the format of parameters, especially for strings.
    *   **Input Length Limits:**  Enforce maximum length limits on input parameters to prevent buffer overflow or denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Sanitization:**  Sanitize all inputs to remove or escape any potentially malicious characters or code.

*   **Robust Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Least Privilege Principle:**  Use API keys or service accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid using overly permissive credentials.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Implement RBAC within the application to ensure that users can only perform actions they are authorized to do.  This should be enforced *before* calling the Harness SDK.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Consider using MFA for access to the Harness platform, especially for sensitive operations.
    *   **Credential Management:**  Store API keys and other secrets securely using a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).  Never hardcode credentials in the application's code.

*   **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling for all SDK calls.  Log errors securely and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
    *   **Race Condition Prevention:**  Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, mutexes) to prevent race conditions in multi-threaded applications.
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Training:**  Provide security training to developers on secure coding practices and the specific risks associated with using the Harness SDK.

*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Keep SDK Updated:**  Regularly update the Harness SDK to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the SDK and other dependencies.

*   **Monitoring and Auditing:**
    *   **Audit Logs:**  Enable audit logging in the Harness platform to track all actions performed through the SDK.
    *   **Security Monitoring:**  Monitor application logs and Harness audit logs for suspicious activity.
    *   **Intrusion Detection:**  Implement intrusion detection systems to detect and respond to potential attacks.

### 5. Conclusion

Manipulating SDK calls to execute unauthorized actions is a significant threat to applications using the Harness SDK. By understanding the potential attack vectors, implementing robust security controls, and following secure coding practices, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack.  The key is to treat all inputs to the SDK as untrusted, enforce strict authorization checks, and manage credentials securely.  Regular security assessments, code reviews, and vulnerability scanning are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
