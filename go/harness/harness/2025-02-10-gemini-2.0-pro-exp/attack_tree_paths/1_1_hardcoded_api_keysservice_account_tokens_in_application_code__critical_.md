# Deep Analysis: Hardcoded API Keys/Service Account Tokens in Application Code

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks, implications, and mitigation strategies associated with hardcoding API keys or service account tokens within the application's source code, specifically in the context of an application leveraging the Harness platform (https://github.com/harness/harness).  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to eliminate this vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Attack Vector:**  Hardcoded credentials (API keys, service account tokens, passwords, etc.) directly embedded within the application's source code.  This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Source code repositories (Git, SVN, etc.)
    *   Configuration files checked into version control
    *   Build scripts
    *   Deployment scripts
    *   Dockerfiles (if credentials are baked into the image)
    *   Environment variables set *within* the code (as opposed to being injected externally)
*   **Harness Context:**  How the presence of hardcoded credentials impacts the security posture of an application using Harness for CI/CD.  This includes potential compromise of Harness itself, as well as the resources and services managed by Harness.
*   **Impact:**  The potential consequences of an attacker gaining access to these hardcoded credentials.
*   **Mitigation:**  Specific, actionable steps to remove hardcoded credentials and implement secure credential management practices.
* **Exclusion:** This analysis will not cover other attack vectors, such as social engineering or phishing, that could lead to credential compromise.  It also does not cover vulnerabilities *within* the Harness platform itself, but rather how misuse of credentials can compromise the application and its interaction with Harness.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will analyze the potential threats and attack scenarios that arise from hardcoded credentials.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  We will describe the types of code patterns and locations where hardcoded credentials are commonly found, as if performing a code review.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  We will evaluate the potential damage an attacker could inflict if they obtained the hardcoded credentials.
4.  **Harness-Specific Considerations:**  We will analyze how hardcoded credentials can be exploited in the context of a Harness deployment, including potential access to Harness secrets, pipelines, and connected infrastructure.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  We will provide detailed, prioritized recommendations for remediating the vulnerability, including best practices for secure credential management.
6.  **Tooling Suggestions:** We will suggest tools that can help detect and prevent hardcoded credentials.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1 Hardcoded API Keys/Service Account Tokens

### 4.1 Threat Modeling

*   **Threat Actor:**
    *   **External Attacker:**  An individual or group outside the organization attempting to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Malicious Insider:**  A current or former employee, contractor, or other individual with legitimate access who intends to cause harm.
    *   **Compromised Developer Account:**  An attacker who has gained control of a developer's workstation or credentials.
*   **Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **Source Code Repository Compromise:**  An attacker gains access to the organization's source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and discovers the hardcoded credentials.
    *   **Public Code Exposure:**  The source code is accidentally made public (e.g., misconfigured repository permissions, accidental upload to a public forum).
    *   **Dependency Vulnerability:**  A third-party library used by the application contains hardcoded credentials, which are then exposed.
    *   **Decompiled Code:**  An attacker decompiles the application's binary and extracts the hardcoded credentials.
    *   **Insider Threat:**  A malicious insider with access to the source code copies the credentials for personal gain or to cause damage.
    * **Compromised CI/CD pipeline:** Attacker gains access to CI/CD pipeline and can read environment variables.

### 4.2 Hypothetical Code Review Findings

During a code review, we would look for the following patterns:

*   **Directly Embedded Credentials:**
    ```java
    // BAD PRACTICE!
    String apiKey = "sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
    String serviceAccountToken = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...";
    ```
    ```python
    # BAD PRACTICE!
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
    ```
    ```javascript
    // BAD PRACTICE!
    const HARNESS_API_KEY = "pat.xxxx.xxxx";
    ```

*   **Credentials in Configuration Files (Checked into Version Control):**
    ```yaml
    # BAD PRACTICE! (if checked into version control)
    # config.yaml
    database:
      host: localhost
      port: 5432
      username: dbuser
      password: mysecretpassword  # Hardcoded password!
    ```

*   **Credentials in Build/Deployment Scripts:**
    ```bash
    # BAD PRACTICE!
    # deploy.sh
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
    aws s3 cp ...
    ```

*   **Credentials in Dockerfiles:**
    ```dockerfile
    # BAD PRACTICE!
    FROM ubuntu:latest
    ENV API_KEY=my-secret-api-key  # Hardcoded in the image!
    ```

### 4.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of compromised credentials depends on the privileges associated with those credentials.  Potential consequences include:

*   **Data Breach:**  Access to sensitive data stored in databases, cloud storage, or other services.
*   **Service Disruption:**  Ability to shut down or modify critical services.
*   **Financial Loss:**  Unauthorized access to financial accounts or resources.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of customer trust and negative publicity.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Fines and penalties for non-compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Compromise of Harness Platform:**  If the hardcoded credentials are for Harness itself (e.g., a Harness API key), the attacker could:
    *   Modify or delete deployment pipelines.
    *   Deploy malicious code.
    *   Access secrets stored within Harness.
    *   Gain access to connected infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes clusters, cloud accounts).
    *   Exfiltrate sensitive data from Harness audit logs.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The compromised credentials could be used to access other systems and services, escalating the attack.

### 4.4 Harness-Specific Considerations

Harness relies heavily on secrets management for secure operation.  Hardcoding credentials bypasses these security mechanisms and creates significant risks:

*   **Harness API Key Compromise:**  A hardcoded Harness API key grants extensive control over the Harness platform.  An attacker could use this key to manipulate deployments, access other secrets, and compromise the entire CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Delegate Credentials:**  If credentials used by Harness Delegates (agents that execute tasks) are hardcoded, an attacker who compromises a Delegate could gain access to those credentials and the resources they can access.
*   **Secret Manager Bypass:**  Hardcoding credentials negates the benefits of using Harness's built-in secret managers (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager).  This makes it much harder to rotate credentials and audit access.
*   **Pipeline Manipulation:**  An attacker with a compromised Harness API key could modify pipelines to inject malicious code or exfiltrate data during the deployment process.

### 4.5 Mitigation Recommendations

The following prioritized recommendations should be implemented to eliminate hardcoded credentials:

1.  **Immediate Remediation (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Identify and Remove:**  Immediately identify and remove *all* instances of hardcoded credentials from the codebase, configuration files, build scripts, and Dockerfiles.
    *   **Rotate Credentials:**  Immediately rotate *all* compromised credentials.  Assume that any hardcoded credential has been compromised.  This includes API keys, service account tokens, passwords, and any other sensitive information.
    *   **Revoke Access:** Revoke any access granted using the compromised credentials.

2.  **Secure Credential Management (High Priority):**
    *   **Use a Secret Manager:**  Integrate a dedicated secret manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Harness's built-in secret management capabilities).  Store *all* credentials in the secret manager.
    *   **Environment Variables (External Injection):**  Use environment variables to inject credentials into the application at runtime.  *Do not* set environment variables within the code itself.  Instead, configure them through the operating system, container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes), or CI/CD platform (Harness).
    *   **Harness Secret Management:**  Leverage Harness's built-in secret management features to securely store and access credentials.  Use secret references in your pipelines and configurations.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that credentials have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their intended function.  Avoid using overly permissive credentials.
    *   **Regular Rotation:**  Implement a policy for regularly rotating credentials, even if they haven't been compromised.  Automate this process whenever possible.

3.  **Code Review and Prevention (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  Enforce mandatory code reviews for all code changes, with a specific focus on identifying hardcoded credentials.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Integrate static analysis tools (SAST) into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect hardcoded credentials.  Examples include:
        *   **TruffleHog:**  Detects high-entropy strings and secrets.
        *   **GitGuardian:**  Scans for secrets in Git repositories.
        *   **gitleaks:** Another tool for finding secrets in Git repositories.
        *   **SonarQube:**  A comprehensive code quality and security platform that can detect hardcoded credentials.
        * **Semgrep:** Customizable static analysis tool.
    *   **Pre-Commit Hooks:**  Use pre-commit hooks (e.g., with Git) to prevent developers from accidentally committing code with hardcoded credentials.
    * **Training:** Educate developers on the risks of hardcoded credentials and best practices for secure credential management.

4. **Monitoring and Auditing (Low Priority):**
    * **Audit Logs:** Regularly review audit logs to detect any unauthorized access or suspicious activity related to credential usage.
    * **Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify security personnel of any potential credential compromise or misuse.

### 4.6 Tooling Suggestions

*   **Secret Managers:**
    *   HashiCorp Vault
    *   AWS Secrets Manager
    *   GCP Secret Manager
    *   Azure Key Vault
    *   Harness Built-in Secret Management

*   **Static Analysis Tools (SAST):**
    *   TruffleHog
    *   GitGuardian
    *   gitleaks
    *   SonarQube
    *   Semgrep

*   **Pre-Commit Hooks:**
    *   pre-commit (framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks)

* **Dependency Checkers**
    * OWASP Dependency-Check
