Okay, let's create a design document for the Harness platform based on the provided GitHub repository.  Since the repository is vast and encompasses the entire Harness platform, I will focus on the core concepts and architecture, making reasonable assumptions where necessary. I will prioritize providing a structure that's useful for threat modeling, as requested.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Harness is a Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Integration (CI) platform. Its primary business goal is to enable software development teams to release software faster, more reliably, and with less manual effort.  It aims to reduce the risk and complexity associated with software deployments.  The platform targets a wide range of customers, from startups to large enterprises. Given its nature, Harness likely operates with a moderate risk appetite, balancing innovation with the need for stability and security, as their customers rely on them for critical deployment processes.

Business Priorities:

*   Speed of Delivery: Enable customers to deploy software updates rapidly.
*   Reliability: Ensure deployments are successful and minimize downtime.
*   Scalability: Support a growing number of customers and increasingly complex deployments.
*   Security: Protect customer code, credentials, and deployment environments.
*   Compliance: Help customers meet regulatory and compliance requirements.
*   Ease of Use: Provide a user-friendly platform that simplifies complex tasks.
*   Extensibility: Allow integration with a wide range of tools and services.

Business Risks:

*   Unauthorized Access: Unauthorized users gaining access to the Harness platform or customer environments could lead to data breaches, code theft, or malicious deployments.
*   Service Disruption: Outages or performance issues in the Harness platform could disrupt customer deployments and cause significant business impact.
*   Data Loss: Loss of customer data (e.g., deployment configurations, secrets) could damage customer trust and lead to operational problems.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Harness could be exploited to compromise the platform or customer environments.
*   Compliance Violations: Failure to meet relevant compliance standards (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR, PCI DSS) could result in legal and financial penalties.
*   Insider Threats: Malicious or negligent actions by Harness employees could compromise the platform or customer data.
*   Misconfiguration: Incorrectly configured Harness settings or customer deployments could lead to security vulnerabilities or deployment failures.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Based on the GitHub repository and general knowledge of CI/CD platforms, I can infer the following security controls and accepted risks.  It's important to note that this is an assessment based on a public repository, and a full security audit would reveal more detail.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Harness likely implements RBAC to restrict access to features and resources based on user roles (admin, developer, operator, etc.). Implemented within the Harness platform, likely in the manager and delegate components.
*   security control: Authentication: Harness likely supports various authentication methods, including username/password, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and single sign-on (SSO) integrations (e.g., SAML, OAuth). Implemented in the Harness manager component.
*   security control: Secrets Management: Harness likely provides a mechanism for securely storing and managing secrets (e.g., API keys, passwords, certificates) used in deployments. This might involve integration with external secrets managers (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). Implemented in the Harness manager and delegate components, potentially leveraging external services.
*   security control: Audit Logging: Harness likely logs user actions and system events for auditing and security monitoring purposes. Implemented across various Harness components.
*   security control: Encryption: Data in transit is likely encrypted using TLS/SSL. Data at rest encryption may be implemented for sensitive data stored in databases or other storage systems. Implemented at various levels, including network communication and data storage.
*   security control: Network Security: Harness likely employs network security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and network segmentation, to protect its infrastructure. Implemented at the infrastructure level, likely within the cloud provider environment (e.g., AWS, GCP).
*   security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC): Harness, as a company building a software product, likely follows secure coding practices, performs code reviews, and conducts security testing (SAST, DAST, penetration testing). Implemented throughout the development process.
*   security control: API Security: Harness likely implements API security best practices, such as input validation, rate limiting, and authentication/authorization for API access. Implemented in the Harness manager component, which exposes APIs.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity of Configuration: The flexibility and power of Harness can lead to complex configurations, which, if not managed carefully, could introduce security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Dependence on Third-Party Services: Harness integrates with various third-party services (e.g., cloud providers, source code repositories, artifact repositories). The security of these integrations depends on the security posture of the third-party services.
*   accepted risk: Rapid Pace of Development: The fast-paced development of new features and updates could potentially introduce new vulnerabilities if not thoroughly tested.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify and manage vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies.
*   Enhance secrets management by enforcing rotation policies and integrating with hardware security modules (HSMs) where appropriate.
*   Implement a robust vulnerability management program with regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
*   Provide detailed security documentation and best practices guides for customers to help them configure Harness securely.
*   Offer security training and awareness programs for Harness employees.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts.
    *   Integration with enterprise identity providers (IdPs) via SAML, OAuth, or OpenID Connect.
    *   Strong password policies and enforcement.
    *   Session management with appropriate timeouts and secure cookie handling.

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to resources and actions.
    *   Principle of least privilege enforced throughout the platform.
    *   Ability to define custom roles and permissions.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All user inputs and API requests should be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    *   Data sanitization and encoding should be used where appropriate.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher, AES-256).
    *   Secure key management practices, including key rotation and secure storage.
    *   Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.

## DEPLOYMENT

Harness itself, as a platform, can be deployed in various ways.  Here are some possible deployment models:

1.  **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Harness manages the entire infrastructure and deployment. Customers access the platform through a web browser. This is the most common and likely the primary deployment model.
2.  **Self-Managed (On-Premises or Private Cloud):** Customers deploy and manage Harness within their own infrastructure (on-premises data center or private cloud). This provides more control but requires more operational overhead.
3.  **Hybrid:** A combination of SaaS and self-managed, where some components (e.g., the Manager) are hosted by Harness, and others (e.g., Delegates) are deployed in the customer's environment.

I will describe the **SaaS deployment model** in detail, as it's the most likely scenario for the majority of Harness users.

## BUILD

The build process for Harness, being a complex platform, likely involves multiple stages and tools. I'll describe a generalized build process based on common CI/CD practices and what can be inferred from the repository.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer[("Developer")] --> Git[("Git Repository\n(GitHub)")]
    Git --> BuildServer[("Build Server\n(e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)")]
    BuildServer --> SAST[("SAST Tools")]
    BuildServer --> SCA[("SCA Tools")]
    BuildServer --> UnitTests[("Unit Tests")]
    BuildServer --> IntegrationTests[("Integration Tests")]
    BuildServer --> ArtifactRepo[("Artifact Repository\n(e.g., Docker Hub, Artifactory)")]
    SAST --> BuildServer
    SCA --> BuildServer
    UnitTests --> BuildServer
    IntegrationTests --> BuildServer

    subgraph "Artifact Repository"
        DockerImages[("Docker Images")]
        JARFiles[("JAR Files")]
    end
```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Code Commit:** Developers commit code changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  **Build Trigger:** A commit or pull request triggers a build on the build server (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions).
3.  **Code Checkout:** The build server checks out the latest code from the repository.
4.  **Static Analysis:**
    *   **SAST (Static Application Security Testing):** SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, Checkmarx) analyze the source code for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **SCA (Software Composition Analysis):** SCA tools (e.g., Snyk, Black Duck) identify and analyze open-source dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
5.  **Testing:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Unit tests are executed to verify the functionality of individual code components.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Integration tests are executed to verify the interaction between different components.
6.  **Artifact Creation:** If all tests and analyses pass, build artifacts are created. This likely includes Docker images for containerized components and JAR files for Java-based components.
7.  **Artifact Storage:** The build artifacts are pushed to an artifact repository (e.g., Docker Hub, Artifactory).

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   **Source Code Management:** Git provides version control and access control for the codebase.
*   **Build Automation:** The build server automates the build process, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
*   **SAST:** Identifies security vulnerabilities in the source code.
*   **SCA:** Identifies vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies.
*   **Automated Testing:** Unit and integration tests help ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   **Artifact Repository:** Provides a secure and controlled environment for storing build artifacts.
*   **Build Server Security:** The build server itself should be secured with appropriate access controls and security hardening.
*   **Supply Chain Security:** Measures should be in place to ensure the integrity of the build tools and dependencies. This might include using trusted sources, verifying digital signatures, and scanning for malicious code.
