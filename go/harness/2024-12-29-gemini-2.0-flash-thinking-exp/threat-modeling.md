Here is the updated threat list, focusing on high and critical threats directly involving Harness:

**Threat Category: Authentication and Authorization**

*   **Threat:** Compromised Harness API Keys
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to valid Harness API keys. They might steal these keys from developer machines, CI/CD environments, or through supply chain attacks. With these keys, they can authenticate to the Harness API as a legitimate user.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker can perform any action the compromised API key is authorized for, including deploying malicious code, modifying pipelines, accessing secrets, and disrupting deployments.
    *   **Affected Harness Component:** Harness API, potentially affecting all modules accessible via the API (Pipelines, Deployments, Connectors, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store API keys using secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege for API key permissions.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys.
        *   Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity.
        *   Avoid storing API keys in code or version control.

*   **Threat:** Insufficiently Granular Harness Permissions
    *   **Description:** Harness users or service accounts are granted overly broad permissions within the Harness platform. An attacker who compromises one of these accounts can then perform actions beyond their intended scope.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources, modify critical configurations, or disrupt deployments even if their initial access was limited.
    *   **Affected Harness Component:** Harness User and Role Management, potentially affecting all modules based on user permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when assigning roles and permissions in Harness.
        *   Regularly review and audit user permissions.
        *   Utilize custom roles to define fine-grained access control.
        *   Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Harness users.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Storage of Harness Credentials
    *   **Description:** Harness API keys or other credentials (e.g., for connecting to artifact repositories or cloud providers) are stored insecurely within the application's codebase, configuration files, or environment variables. An attacker gaining access to these locations can retrieve the credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of credentials allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users or services, leading to unauthorized access and control over deployment processes and connected resources.
    *   **Affected Harness Component:** Harness Secrets Management (if not used properly), Connectors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Harness's built-in Secrets Management feature or integrate with external secrets management solutions.
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in code, configuration files, or environment variables.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

**Threat Category: Data Handling**

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Harness Logs
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or other secrets, is inadvertently logged within the Harness platform during deployments or pipeline executions. Attackers with access to these logs can retrieve this information.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data can lead to further compromise of systems and resources.
    *   **Affected Harness Component:** Harness Pipeline Execution Logs, potentially affecting all pipeline stages and steps.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure logging practices to prevent the logging of sensitive information.
        *   Utilize Harness's secrets management features to mask or redact sensitive data in logs.
        *   Restrict access to Harness logs to authorized personnel only.
        *   Regularly review and monitor Harness logs for sensitive data exposure.

*   **Threat:** Data Breaches within Harness Infrastructure
    *   **Description:** A security breach occurs within Harness's own infrastructure, potentially exposing customer data, including deployment configurations, secrets, or deployment artifacts stored within Harness.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive application data and potential compromise of deployed environments. This is a risk inherent in using any cloud-based service.
    *   **Affected Harness Component:** Harness Platform Infrastructure (out of direct user control).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the sensitivity of the data stored).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Understand Harness's security practices and certifications.
        *   Implement strong security measures within your own application and infrastructure to minimize the impact of a potential breach.
        *   Utilize encryption for sensitive data stored within Harness.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Handling of Deployment Artifacts by Harness
    *   **Description:** Harness does not securely handle or store deployment artifacts (e.g., container images, binaries). An attacker could potentially tamper with these artifacts.
    *   **Impact:**  Deployment of compromised application versions, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or malicious functionality in the deployed application.
    *   **Affected Harness Component:** Harness Artifact Management, potentially affecting integrations with artifact repositories.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that artifact repositories used with Harness have strong security controls.
        *   Implement content trust and image signing for container images.
        *   Verify the integrity of deployment artifacts before and after deployment.

**Threat Category: Pipeline Execution and Integrations**

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection via Harness Pipelines
    *   **Description:** Attackers gain the ability to inject malicious code into the deployment pipeline through vulnerabilities in Harness configurations, integrations, or by compromising a user with pipeline editing permissions.
    *   **Impact:**  Deployment of compromised application versions without proper authorization or review.
    *   **Affected Harness Component:** Harness Pipelines, potentially affecting all stages and steps.
