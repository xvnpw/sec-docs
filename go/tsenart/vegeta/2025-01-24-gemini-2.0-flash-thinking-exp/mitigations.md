# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tsenart/vegeta

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Control Attack Rate and Duration](./mitigation_strategies/1__control_attack_rate_and_duration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Control Attack Rate and Duration using Vegeta Flags
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Vegeta's `-rate` flag:**  Specify the desired requests per second (RPS) using the `-rate` flag when executing Vegeta attacks.  For example, `vegeta attack -rate=100 ...`. Start with a low rate and incrementally increase it in subsequent tests.
    2.  **Utilize Vegeta's `-duration` flag:** Define the total duration of the attack using the `-duration` flag. For example, `vegeta attack -duration=1m ...` for a one-minute attack. Keep durations reasonable to avoid unintended prolonged stress.
    3.  **Combine `-rate` and `-duration`:** Use both flags together to precisely control the total load. For instance, `-rate=500 -duration=5m` will send 500 requests per second for 5 minutes.
    4.  **Script Ramp-Up (External Scripting):** While Vegeta doesn't have built-in ramp-up, use external scripting (e.g., shell scripts, Python) to programmatically adjust the `-rate` flag over time, simulating a gradual increase in load. This involves running Vegeta multiple times with increasing `-rate` values.
    5.  **Review and Adjust:** After each test run, analyze the results and adjust the `-rate` and `-duration` flags for subsequent tests based on observed application behavior and performance.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Uncontrolled high request rates from Vegeta can overwhelm server resources, leading to application slowdowns or crashes.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):**  Excessive load generated by Vegeta, if not controlled, can unintentionally cause a DoS, making the application unavailable.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (High):** Significantly reduces the risk by allowing precise control over the load Vegeta generates, preventing accidental system overload.
    *   **Denial of Service (High):** Greatly minimizes the chance of unintentionally causing a DoS by enabling careful management of the attack intensity and duration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   Developers are aware of and use the `-rate` and `-duration` flags in basic Vegeta commands.
    *   Simple examples of using these flags might be present in internal documentation or test scripts.
    *   Location: Test scripts directory, internal documentation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized ramp-up scripting using Vegeta flags in a controlled manner is not consistently implemented.
    *   No standardized guidelines or scripts for gradually increasing `-rate` over time.
    *   Best practices for choosing appropriate `-rate` and `-duration` values based on application capacity are not well-defined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Custom User-Agent and Request Headers](./mitigation_strategies/2__custom_user-agent_and_request_headers.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Custom User-Agent and Request Headers with Vegeta
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set Custom User-Agent with `-user-agent` flag:** Use the `-user-agent` flag in Vegeta commands to set a distinctive User-Agent header. For example: `vegeta attack -user-agent="Vegeta-Load-Test/1.0" ...`. Choose a User-Agent string that clearly identifies the traffic as load testing.
    2.  **Add Custom Headers with `-header` flag:** Employ the `-header` flag to include custom headers in Vegeta requests.  For example: `vegeta attack -header="X-Test-Type: Load-Test" -header="X-Test-Tool: Vegeta" ...`.  Use headers to provide additional context about the test.
    3.  **Define Headers in Target File (if using):** If defining targets in a file, include custom headers within the target definitions.  Refer to Vegeta documentation for the correct format to specify headers in target files.
    4.  **Document Custom Headers:** Clearly document the specific User-Agent string and custom headers used for load testing. Share this information with relevant teams (security, operations) for easier traffic identification and analysis.
    5.  **Leverage Headers in Monitoring/Security:**  Inform security and monitoring teams about the custom headers so they can configure their tools to recognize and filter Vegeta test traffic based on these headers. This aids in distinguishing test traffic from real user traffic in logs and dashboards.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Difficulty in Traffic Analysis (Low Severity):** Without custom headers, distinguishing Vegeta load test traffic from legitimate user traffic in logs and monitoring systems becomes challenging.
    *   **Inefficient Monitoring and Security Analysis (Low Severity):** Lack of clear identification makes filtering and analyzing test-related events in monitoring and security tools less efficient.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Difficulty in Traffic Analysis (Medium):** Significantly improves the ability to identify and isolate Vegeta load test traffic for analysis and troubleshooting.
    *   **Inefficient Monitoring and Security Analysis (Medium):** Makes monitoring and security analysis of load test activities more streamlined and accurate by enabling easy filtering based on custom headers.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Minimal implementation.
    *   Developers might occasionally use the `-user-agent` flag for basic identification, but it's not a consistent practice.
    *   Use of the `-header` flag for adding custom headers is rare.
    *   Location: Test scripts (sporadically).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Standardized and enforced use of the `-user-agent` and `-header` flags for all Vegeta load tests is lacking.
    *   No clear guidelines or templates for defining consistent and informative custom headers.
    *   Communication of custom header usage to security and operations teams is not a standard procedure.
