## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vegeta's Intended Functionality (Abuse Features)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vegeta's_intended_functionality__abuse_features_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage Vegeta's core purpose – generating high volumes of requests – to overwhelm the target application. This path focuses on abusing the intended functionality for malicious purposes, specifically Denial of Service.

    *   **1.1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks - High-Risk Path**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The goal is to make the target application unavailable to legitimate users. Vegeta is used to generate traffic that disrupts the application's normal operation.

            *   **1.1.1. Resource Exhaustion DoS - High-Risk Path**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Overwhelm the target application's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to the point where it becomes unresponsive or crashes.

                    *   **1.1.1.1. Generate Excessive Request Volume - Critical Node & High-Risk Path**
                        *   **Attack Description:**  This is the most straightforward DoS attack using Vegeta. The attacker configures Vegeta to send an extremely high number of requests per second to the target application.
                        *   **Vegeta Usage:** Vegeta's `-rate` and `-duration` flags are used to define a very high request rate and long attack duration.
                        *   **Potential Impact:** Application becomes slow or completely unavailable. Server overload, potential crashes.
                        *   **Key Mitigations:**
                            *   Implement robust **rate limiting** to restrict the number of requests from a single source or in total.
                            *   Use **resource quotas** to limit the resources available to the application, preventing complete resource exhaustion.
                            *   Employ **autoscaling** to automatically increase resources to handle surges in traffic.
                            *   Implement **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** to detect and block malicious traffic patterns.

            *   **1.1.2. Application Logic DoS - High-Risk Path**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Exploit specific vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the application's logic to cause a DoS. This is more targeted than simple resource exhaustion.

                    *   **1.1.2.1. Target Vulnerable Endpoints - Critical Node & High-Risk Path**
                        *   **Attack Description:** Attackers use Vegeta to specifically target application endpoints known to be vulnerable to DoS attacks. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities like:
                            *   **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** Sending crafted inputs that cause regular expression processing to become extremely slow.
                            *   **Slow SQL Queries:** Triggering database queries that are inefficient and consume excessive database resources.
                            *   **Vulnerabilities in application code:** Exploiting bugs that lead to crashes or resource leaks under specific input conditions.
                        *   **Vegeta Usage:** Vegeta is used to send requests with payloads designed to trigger these specific vulnerabilities, targeting the vulnerable endpoints.
                        *   **Potential Impact:** Application crash, prolonged unavailability, data corruption in some vulnerability scenarios.
                        *   **Key Mitigations:**
                            *   **Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing** to identify and fix application vulnerabilities.
                            *   **Secure coding practices** to prevent common vulnerabilities like ReDoS and inefficient queries.
                            *   **Input validation and sanitization** to prevent malicious inputs from reaching vulnerable code paths.
                            *   **Implement request timeouts** to prevent long-running operations from consuming resources indefinitely.
                            *   **Monitor endpoint performance** to detect unusual resource consumption patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Misconfiguration or Misuse of Vegeta](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_misconfiguration_or_misuse_of_vegeta.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from improper setup or usage of Vegeta itself, rather than exploiting Vegeta's intended functionality directly against the target application.

    *   **2.1. Exposed Vegeta Endpoint/Interface - High-Risk Path**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If Vegeta's control interface (if it has one, or configuration files) is unintentionally exposed and not properly secured, attackers can gain unauthorized control over Vegeta.

            *   **2.1.1. Unsecured Vegeta API Access - High-Risk Path**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  If Vegeta is deployed with an API or control interface that lacks proper authentication and authorization, attackers can directly interact with it.

                    *   **2.1.1.1. Attacker Gains Control of Vegeta Configuration - Critical Node & High-Risk Path**
                        *   **Attack Description:** If an attacker gains access to an unsecured Vegeta control interface or configuration files, they can modify attack definitions, target URLs, request rates, and payloads. This essentially allows them to weaponize the organization's own load testing tool against itself or other targets.
                        *   **Vegeta Usage:** Attackers exploit the lack of security on Vegeta's control interface to manipulate its settings.
                        *   **Potential Impact:**  Attackers can launch arbitrary attacks (DoS, injection, etc.) using the compromised Vegeta instance.  Internal network scanning, data exfiltration if Vegeta has access.
                        *   **Key Mitigations:**
                            *   **Secure Vegeta deployment:** Ensure Vegeta's control interfaces (if any) are not exposed to the public internet.
                            *   **Restrict access to Vegeta configuration and control interfaces** to authorized personnel only.
                            *   Implement **strong authentication and authorization** for any Vegeta control interfaces.
                            *   **Regularly audit Vegeta deployment** to ensure it remains securely configured.

            *   **2.1.2. Vegeta Used in Production Environment - High-Risk Path**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Accidental or intentional execution of Vegeta load tests against a production environment can lead to unintended consequences.

                        *   **Attack Description:** Even with benign intentions, running a load test against production can overwhelm the system, causing DoS or significant performance degradation for real users. This is especially risky if the load test is not carefully planned and controlled.
                        *   **Vegeta Usage:**  Accidental or unauthorized execution of Vegeta against production URLs.
                        *   **Potential Impact:** Production application becomes slow or unavailable, impacting real users and business operations.
                        *   **Key Mitigations:**
                            *   **Strict separation of testing and production environments.**
                            *   **Clear procedures and policies** prohibiting load testing in production without explicit authorization and control.
                            *   **Access controls** to prevent unauthorized execution of Vegeta in production environments.
                            *   **Strong warnings and safeguards** in testing scripts and documentation to prevent accidental production testing.

    *   **2.2. Malicious Attack Definition - High-Risk Path**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers with access to define Vegeta attack configurations (e.g., developers, testers with compromised accounts, or insiders) can create malicious attack definitions.

            *   **2.2.1. Injection Attacks via Payloads - High-Risk Path**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers embed malicious payloads (SQL injection, command injection, etc.) within the requests generated by Vegeta.

                    *   **2.2.1.1. SQL Injection - Critical Node & High-Risk Path**
                        *   **Attack Description:** Vegeta is used to send requests containing SQL injection payloads in parameters, headers, or request bodies. If the target application is vulnerable to SQL injection, these payloads can be executed by the database.
                        *   **Vegeta Usage:** Vegeta is configured with attack definitions that include SQL injection payloads in request parameters or body.
                        *   **Potential Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potentially full database server compromise.
                        *   **Key Mitigations:**
                            *   **Input validation and sanitization** on the target application to prevent SQL injection.
                            *   Use **parameterized queries or ORM** to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
                            *   **Regular SQL injection testing** of the target application.
                            *   **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** to detect and block SQL injection attempts.

                    *   **2.2.1.3. Command Injection - Critical Node & High-Risk Path**
                        *   **Attack Description:** In rare cases, if the target application processes request data in a way that leads to command execution on the server, Vegeta can be used to trigger command injection vulnerabilities. This is less common in web applications but can occur in specific scenarios (e.g., processing filenames from requests, insecure deserialization).
                        *   **Vegeta Usage:** Vegeta is configured with attack definitions that include command injection payloads in request parameters or body, targeting vulnerable application logic.
                        *   **Potential Impact:** Full system compromise, remote code execution on the server, data breach, service disruption.
                        *   **Key Mitigations:**
                            *   **Secure coding practices** to avoid command injection vulnerabilities.
                            *   **Input sanitization** to prevent malicious inputs from being used in system commands.
                            *   **Principle of least privilege** for application processes to limit the impact of command injection.
                            *   **Regular security audits and code reviews** to identify potential command injection points.
