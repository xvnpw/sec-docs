# Attack Surface Analysis for tsenart/vegeta

## Attack Surface: [Target URL Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/target_url_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can influence the target URL used by Vegeta to launch attacks against unintended systems.
    *   **How Vegeta Contributes:** Vegeta requires a target URL to function. If this URL is dynamically generated or based on unsanitized user input, it becomes an attack vector *directly through Vegeta's configuration*.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to input a URL for testing, which is then directly used as the target for a Vegeta attack. An attacker inputs an internal IP address, causing Vegeta to flood an internal service with requests.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-service (DoS) against internal infrastructure, information disclosure from internal services, or attacks against third-party systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize any user-provided input used to construct the target URL *for Vegeta*.
        *   Use an allow-list of permitted target domains or IP ranges *within the application's Vegeta integration*.
        *   Avoid dynamic generation of target URLs based on user input if possible *when configuring Vegeta*.

## Attack Surface: [Request Body/Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/request_bodyheader_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious content into the request body or headers used by Vegeta.
    *   **How Vegeta Contributes:** Vegeta allows customization of request bodies and headers. If this customization relies on unsanitized user input, it becomes directly vulnerable to injection attacks *through Vegeta's request construction*.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to customize request headers for Vegeta tests. An attacker injects a malicious `<script>` tag within a custom header, which is then sent by Vegeta and potentially exploited by the target application.
    *   **Impact:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the target application (e.g., XSS, HTTP Response Splitting, command injection), potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user input used to construct request bodies or headers *for Vegeta*.
        *   Use parameterized requests or templating engines that escape special characters *when defining Vegeta attack templates*.

## Attack Surface: [Attack Configuration Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/attack_configuration_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate Vegeta's configuration parameters (e.g., rate, duration, number of workers) to launch excessively aggressive or unusual attacks.
    *   **How Vegeta Contributes:** Vegeta's core functionality involves configurable attack parameters. If these are exposed and modifiable without proper authorization, it's a direct attack vector *on Vegeta's operational parameters*.
    *   **Example:** An application exposes configuration settings for Vegeta tests. An attacker sets an extremely high request rate, causing a DoS on the target application directly via Vegeta's amplified traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-service on the target application or the system running Vegeta, resource exhaustion, potential instability of the testing environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on the configuration parameters *for Vegeta within the application*.
        *   Define reasonable default limits for attack parameters (rate, duration, workers) *when integrating Vegeta*.
        *   Monitor resource usage during Vegeta attacks and implement safeguards against excessive consumption *at the application level*.
