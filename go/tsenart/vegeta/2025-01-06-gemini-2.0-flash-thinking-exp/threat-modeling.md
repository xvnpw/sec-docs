# Threat Model Analysis for tsenart/vegeta

## Threat: [Accidental Production Load Generation](./threats/accidental_production_load_generation.md)

**Description:** An attacker, who could be an internal user or someone who gained unauthorized access to development/testing infrastructure, might intentionally or unintentionally execute a Vegeta attack configured for a production environment. This involves directly using the Vegeta tool with incorrect target parameters.

**Impact:** The production environment could become overloaded due to Vegeta's actions, leading to denial of service for legitimate users, slow response times, application crashes, and potential data inconsistencies.

**Vegeta Component Affected:** Configuration (attack definition, target URL), CLI execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict environment separation and access controls.
* Require explicit confirmation or environment variable checks *within the script calling Vegeta* before targeting production.
* Use distinct and clearly labeled configuration files *specifically for Vegeta* for different environments.
* Implement code review processes for scripts and configurations *that utilize Vegeta*.

## Threat: [Overwhelming Target Infrastructure](./threats/overwhelming_target_infrastructure.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intentionally configure Vegeta with an extremely high attack rate, duration, or number of workers directly within Vegeta's configuration or command-line arguments to overwhelm the target application and its underlying infrastructure.

**Impact:** The target application and infrastructure could become unavailable due to Vegeta's direct actions, leading to denial of service, resource exhaustion, and potential cascading failures.

**Vegeta Component Affected:** Configuration (rate, duration, workers), Execution Engine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the target application and infrastructure *as a defense against Vegeta*.
* Monitor resource utilization on the target infrastructure *to detect Vegeta-induced overload*.
* Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to identify and block malicious traffic patterns *potentially originating from Vegeta*.
* Educate developers and testers on responsible load testing practices *using Vegeta*.
* Consider using a dedicated testing environment that mirrors production capacity for realistic load testing *with Vegeta*.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Attack Definitions](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_attack_definitions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to Vegeta attack definitions (e.g., HTTP request bodies, headers) that are part of Vegeta's configuration and inadvertently contain sensitive information. This directly involves how Vegeta attacks are defined.

**Impact:** Sensitive data within Vegeta's configuration could be exposed, leading to unauthorized access to other systems, data breaches, and compliance violations.

**Vegeta Component Affected:** Attacker (definition of requests), Configuration files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in attack definitions *used by Vegeta*.
* Use placeholder values and replace them with secure methods like environment variables or secrets management tools *when configuring Vegeta attacks*.
* Implement strict access controls for *Vegeta's* configuration files and repositories.
* Utilize secrets scanning tools to detect accidentally committed sensitive data *within Vegeta configuration*.
* Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit *relevant to Vegeta configuration*.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Vegeta Configuration](./threats/manipulation_of_vegeta_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the system running Vegeta could directly modify Vegeta's configuration files or command-line arguments to point the attack towards unintended targets or to inject malicious payloads into the requests generated by Vegeta.

**Impact:** The attack initiated by Vegeta could be redirected to other systems, causing disruption or damage. Malicious payloads within Vegeta's requests could exploit vulnerabilities in the unintended targets.

**Vegeta Component Affected:** Configuration files, CLI arguments.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization controls on the system running Vegeta.
* Restrict access to Vegeta configuration files.
* Regularly review and audit Vegeta configurations.
* Consider running Vegeta in isolated environments or containers.
