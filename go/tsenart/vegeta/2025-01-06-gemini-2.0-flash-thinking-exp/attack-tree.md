## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion via High Request Rate - Uncontrolled Request Volume](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__-_resource_exhaustion_via_high_request_rate_-_uncontrolled_request_volume.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker uses Vegeta to send an extremely high number of requests per second to the target application.

**Impact:** This can overwhelm the application's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), leading to service unavailability for legitimate users.

**Mitigation:** Implement robust rate limiting mechanisms to restrict the number of requests from a single source or within a specific timeframe. Employ resource management techniques to handle spikes in traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Exploiting Application Logic with Targeted Load - Identifying Resource-Intensive Endpoints](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__-_exploiting_application_logic_with_targeted_load_-_identifying_resource-int_235a838e.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker analyzes the application to identify specific endpoints or functionalities that consume significant resources upon request. They then use Vegeta to target these endpoints with high load.

**Impact:** This can lead to the exhaustion of specific resources, potentially bringing down parts of the application or the entire service.

**Mitigation:** Profile the application to identify resource-intensive endpoints. Implement safeguards to handle excessive load on these endpoints, such as request queuing or resource throttling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Exploiting Application Logic with Targeted Load - Triggering Database Bottlenecks](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__-_exploiting_application_logic_with_targeted_load_-_triggering_database_bott_0f3e465f.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts requests using Vegeta that are designed to trigger complex or inefficient database queries. By sending a high volume of these requests, they can overload the database.

**Impact:** This can lead to database slowdowns, connection exhaustion, and ultimately application failure due to database unavailability.

**Mitigation:** Optimize database queries. Implement connection pooling and management to prevent exhaustion. Review database schema and indexing for efficiency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vegeta Configuration or Integration - Maliciously Configuring Vegeta - If Application Allows User-Provided Vegeta Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vegeta_configuration_or_integration_-_maliciously_configuring_vegeta_-_if_application_all_8dc323eb.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application allows users to directly provide or modify Vegeta configuration parameters, an attacker can inject malicious configurations. This could include targeting internal endpoints, sending excessive requests, or including malicious headers.

**Impact:** This grants the attacker significant control over the load testing process, enabling them to launch various attacks against the application or even other systems.

**Mitigation:** **Critical:** Avoid allowing users to directly configure Vegeta parameters. If necessary, provide a highly restricted and validated subset of options.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vegeta Configuration or Integration - Maliciously Configuring Vegeta - If Vegeta Configuration is Stored Insecurely](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vegeta_configuration_or_integration_-_maliciously_configuring_vegeta_-_if_vegeta_configur_0199b340.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application's Vegeta configuration files are stored without proper access controls or encryption, an attacker could gain access and modify them.

**Impact:** This allows the attacker to alter the target URLs, request parameters, or headers used by Vegeta, potentially directing attacks or revealing sensitive information.

**Mitigation:** Store Vegeta configuration files securely with appropriate access controls. Consider encrypting sensitive configuration data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vegeta Configuration or Integration - Vulnerabilities in Application's Vegeta Integration - Command Injection if Vegeta is Executed via System Calls](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vegeta_configuration_or_integration_-_vulnerabilities_in_application's_vegeta_integration_f6155d99.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application executes Vegeta using system calls and incorporates user-provided input into the command without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact:** This is a critical vulnerability that can lead to full system compromise, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Mitigation:** **Critical:** Avoid executing Vegeta through system calls with user-controlled input. Use the library's programmatic interface instead. Sanitize and validate any input used in system calls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vegeta Configuration or Integration - Vulnerabilities in Application's Vegeta Integration - Unvalidated Input Passed to Vegeta](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vegeta_configuration_or_integration_-_vulnerabilities_in_application's_vegeta_integration_2fde6ecc.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application takes user input and directly passes it as parameters to Vegeta (e.g., target URL, headers, request body) without proper validation and sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious values.

**Impact:** This can lead to the application being used to launch attacks against unintended targets, send malicious payloads, or disclose sensitive information.

**Mitigation:** Sanitize and validate any user input that is used to construct Vegeta attack definitions or parameters. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing attack definitions programmatically.
