# Threat Model Analysis for tsenart/vegeta

## Threat: [Threat: Accidental Production DoS via Misconfiguration](./threats/threat_accidental_production_dos_via_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** An internal user (developer, tester, etc.) unintentionally configures `vegeta` to target a production system with a high request rate or long duration.  This could be due to a typo in the target URL, incorrect environment variables, or a copy-paste error. The user *does not intend* to cause harm.
    *   **Impact:** Production service outage, data loss (if writes are interrupted), financial loss, reputational damage.
    *   **Vegeta Component Affected:**
        *   `vegeta attack` command (or the equivalent programmatic API calls).
        *   Target configuration: `-targets` flag (or `Targets` field in the `Attacker` struct).
        *   Rate configuration: `-rate` flag (or `Rate` field in the `Attacker` struct).
        *   Duration configuration: `-duration` flag (or `Duration` field in the `Attacker` struct).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement *strict* input validation on all `vegeta` parameters, especially the target URL. Use a *whitelist* of allowed targets (e.g., a regex that *only* matches test environment URLs).  Reject any input that doesn't match the whitelist.
        *   **Environment Segregation:** Enforce *strict* separation between development, testing, and production environments. Use different credentials, network access controls, and distinct infrastructure for each environment.
        *   **Configuration Management:** Use a configuration management system (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Terraform) to manage `vegeta` configurations and prevent manual errors.  Implement infrastructure-as-code and require code reviews for any changes.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run `vegeta` with the *least privileged* user account possible. This account should *not* have write access to production databases or other critical resources.  Consider a dedicated service account with highly restricted permissions.
        *   **"Dry Run" Mode:** Implement a "dry run" mode that simulates the attack *without* actually sending requests. This allows users to verify their configuration before running a real attack. (Note: `vegeta` doesn't have a built-in dry run; this would be a custom implementation within the application using `vegeta`).
        *   **Kill Switch:** Provide a mechanism to *quickly* stop a running `vegeta` attack (e.g., a separate command, API endpoint, or a process monitoring system that can kill the `vegeta` process).
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor `vegeta` usage and set up *real-time* alerts for unusual activity (e.g., high request rates, unexpected targets, long durations). Integrate with existing monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog).

## Threat: [Threat: Malicious Insider DoS Attack](./threats/threat_malicious_insider_dos_attack.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious insider (e.g., a disgruntled employee) with access to the system running `vegeta` *intentionally* configures it to attack a production system or a critical third-party service. Their goal is to cause disruption or damage.
    *   **Impact:** Production service outage, data loss, financial loss, reputational damage, legal consequences.
    *   **Vegeta Component Affected:** Same as Threat 1.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   All mitigations from Threat 1, *with increased emphasis on access control and auditing*.
        *   **Access Control:** Implement *very strict* access controls and the principle of least privilege. *Minimize* the number of users who have access to `vegeta` and its configuration.  Use role-based access control (RBAC).
        *   **Auditing:** *Log all* `vegeta` commands and configurations, including the user who executed them, timestamps, and all parameters.  Store audit logs securely and monitor them for suspicious activity.  Implement log integrity checks.
        *   **Intrusion Detection:** Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) systems to detect and respond to malicious activity, including unusual `vegeta` usage patterns.
        *   **Background Checks:** Conduct thorough background checks on employees with access to sensitive systems, and implement regular security awareness training.
        * **Two-factor authentication:** Enforce two-factor authentication for accessing systems that can run vegeta.

## Threat: [Threat: Third-Party Service Disruption](./threats/threat_third-party_service_disruption.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker (maliciously or accidentally) configures `vegeta` to target a third-party service (e.g., an API provider, a CDN, a partner's website). This could violate terms of service, cause legal issues, or damage relationships.
    *   **Impact:** Legal repercussions, account suspension, reputational damage, strained business relationships.
    *   **Vegeta Component Affected:**
        *   `vegeta attack` command (or programmatic API).
        *   Target configuration: `-targets` flag (or `Targets` field).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Target Whitelisting:** Implement a *very strict and enforced* whitelist of allowed targets. This whitelist should *only* include internal testing endpoints and be *centrally managed and enforced*.
        *   **Input Validation:** *Rigorously* validate the target URL to ensure it *exactly* matches the whitelist.  Reject any input that doesn't match.  Use a robust URL parsing library to prevent bypasses.
        *   **Education and Training:** Train developers and testers on the responsible use of `vegeta` and the *severe* potential consequences of targeting external services. Include this training as part of onboarding and regular security awareness programs.
        *   **Legal Review:** Have legal counsel review *any* testing plans that *might* involve third-party services, even indirectly.  Obtain explicit written consent from third parties before conducting any load testing against their systems.
