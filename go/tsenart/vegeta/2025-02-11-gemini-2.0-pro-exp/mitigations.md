# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tsenart/vegeta

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Rate Limiting and Control within Vegeta](./mitigation_strategies/strict_rate_limiting_and_control_within_vegeta.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Conservative `-rate`:** Always start `vegeta attack` commands with a very low `-rate` value (e.g., `1/s` or lower).  Never assume a high rate is safe.
2.  **Gradual `-rate` Increase:** Incrementally increase the `-rate` in small, controlled steps.  Monitor the target system *after each increase* before proceeding.  Avoid large jumps.
3.  **Controlled `-duration`:** Use the `-duration` flag to limit the length of attacks.  Start with short durations (seconds) and gradually increase them only as needed.  Never run attacks indefinitely.
4.  **`-max-workers` and `-connections` Management:** Begin with low values for `-max-workers` and `-connections`.  Increase these cautiously, observing the impact on both the target and the machine running `vegeta`.  These control concurrency.
5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Be prepared to *immediately* reduce the `-rate`, `-duration`, `-max-workers`, or `-connections` if the target system shows signs of stress (high latency, errors, resource exhaustion).  Have a plan for quickly stopping or modifying the attack.
6. **Target file usage:** Use target files instead of command line arguments to define targets. This allows for easier management and review of the targets.
7. **Stdin usage:** Use stdin to pipe targets to vegeta. This allows for dynamic generation of targets and avoids storing targets in files.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **DoS/DDoS (caused by `vegeta`):** Severity: High.  Uncontrolled `vegeta` attacks can overwhelm the target.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (on target system):** Severity: Medium to High.  Excessive load can exhaust server resources.
*   **Inaccurate Test Results:** Severity: Medium.  Overloading the system produces misleading data.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS/DDoS:** Risk significantly reduced.  Controlled parameters prevent overwhelming traffic.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.  Gradual increases and monitoring allow for early detection.
*   **Inaccurate Test Results:** Risk reduced.  Controlled testing provides more reliable data.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic `-rate` and `-duration` usage in scripts.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Systematic, gradual increase in `-rate`, `-max-workers`, and `-connections` is not consistently followed.
*   A documented plan for dynamically adjusting `vegeta` parameters during attacks is missing.
*   Target files and stdin usage are not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization and Parameterization within Vegeta Scripts](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_and_parameterization_within_vegeta_scripts.md)

**Description:**
1.  **No Hardcoded Sensitive Data:** *Never* hardcode sensitive data (API keys, tokens, passwords, PII) directly within `vegeta` attack scripts or in files referenced by `-body` or `-header`.
2.  **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to store sensitive values.  Reference these variables within `vegeta` scripts using shell variable substitution (e.g., `echo "GET https://api.example.com/resource" | vegeta attack -header "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" ...`).
3.  **External Files (for non-sensitive data):** Use external files (referenced by `-body` and `-header`) for request bodies and headers, *but ensure these files contain only synthetic or anonymized test data*.
4.  **Stdin for Dynamic Data:** Use stdin (`-`) as the target source to pipe dynamically generated, sanitized data to `vegeta`.  This avoids storing potentially sensitive data in files.  Example: `generate_test_data.sh | vegeta attack -targets=- ...`
5.  **Careful File Handling:** If using `-body` or `-header` with files, meticulously review the file contents *before each run* to confirm they contain only test data.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Severity: High.  Accidental leakage of production data during testing.
*   **Data Breach (through testing):** Severity: High.  Compromised testing environment could expose sensitive data.

**Impact:**
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Risk significantly reduced.  Parameterization and avoiding hardcoding prevent accidental exposure.
*   **Data Breach:** Risk reduced.  Using environment variables and stdin minimizes the impact of a compromise.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Some parameterization of API keys using environment variables.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent use of environment variables for *all* sensitive data.
*   Widespread use of stdin for dynamically generated, sanitized data.
*   A formalized process for reviewing the contents of files used with `-body` and `-header`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Vegeta Resource Management](./mitigation_strategies/vegeta_resource_management.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Start Small:** Begin with low values for `-max-workers` and `-connections` to minimize the initial resource consumption of `vegeta` itself.
2.  **Monitor Vegeta's Host:** While `vegeta` is running, actively monitor the resource usage (CPU, memory, network I/O) of the machine *executing* `vegeta`. Use tools like `top`, `htop`, or system-specific monitoring utilities.
3.  **Adjust Concurrency:** If the `vegeta` host machine shows signs of resource strain (high CPU, memory exhaustion, network saturation), immediately reduce `-max-workers` and `-connections`.
4.  **Rate and Duration Limits:**  Indirectly manage `vegeta`'s resource usage by also controlling the `-rate` and `-duration`.  Lower rates and shorter durations reduce the overall load generated.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion (on testing machine):** Severity: Medium.  The testing machine becoming overloaded leads to inaccurate results.
*   **Inaccurate Test Results:** Severity: Medium.  Bottlenecks on the testing machine skew performance metrics.

**Impact:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.  Monitoring and adjusting concurrency prevent overload.
*   **Inaccurate Test Results:** Risk reduced.  Ensuring the testing machine is not a bottleneck improves data reliability.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Occasional manual checks of resource usage.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Systematic monitoring of the `vegeta` host during *every* test run.
*   A defined process for adjusting `-max-workers`, `-connections`, `-rate`, and `-duration` based on observed resource usage.
