# Attack Surface Analysis for tsenart/vegeta

## Attack Surface: [Outbound Denial of Service (DoS) Attack](./attack_surfaces/outbound_denial_of_service__dos__attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages the application's `vegeta` integration to launch a DoS attack against an external target *using vegeta's core functionality*. This is the most significant risk, stemming directly from `vegeta`'s purpose.

**How Vegeta Contributes:** Vegeta *is* the tool used to generate the HTTP requests that constitute the DoS attack. Its core functionality of sending requests at a specified rate and duration is directly exploited.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates a web form field that controls the `vegeta` target, changing it from `test.internal.example.com` to `victim.example.com`, and sets a high request rate, directly using `vegeta` to flood the target.

**Impact:** The target system (`victim.example.com`) becomes unavailable, disrupting services.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strict Input Validation (Whitelist):**  *Never* allow user input to directly control the target, rate, or duration parameters passed to `vegeta`.  Use a whitelist of pre-approved targets.
*   **Rate Limiting (Application Level):** Implement strict rate limits on the *invocation* of `vegeta` within the application.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:**  Only allow authenticated and authorized users to trigger `vegeta` functionality.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the application using `vegeta` to prevent it from reaching external targets.
*   **Dedicated Testing Environment:**  Run `vegeta` *only* against a dedicated, isolated testing environment.

## Attack Surface: [Application-Level Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/application-level_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates `vegeta` parameters (rate, duration) to cause `vegeta` itself to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network) on the server hosting the application, leading to application unavailability.

**How Vegeta Contributes:** Vegeta's ability to generate high request loads, even against a local or loopback target, is the direct cause of the resource exhaustion. The attack leverages `vegeta`'s core functionality.

**Example:** An attacker sets an extremely high request rate and duration within allowed `vegeta` parameters, causing the `vegeta` process itself (and thus the application) to consume all available CPU or memory.

**Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Resource Limits (cgroups/OS):** Use OS-level resource limits (e.g., `cgroups`) to constrain the resources `vegeta` can consume.
*   **Configuration Limits (Vegeta):**  Set hard limits *within* the application's code that calls `vegeta` for maximum request rate, duration, and concurrent connections, regardless of user input. These limits should be enforced *before* calling `vegeta`.
*   **Monitoring:**  Monitor the host system's resource usage.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Custom Reporters](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_custom_reporters.md)

**Description:** If custom reporters are used and their configuration is controlled by an attacker, the attacker could use *vegeta's reporter mechanism* to execute malicious actions.

**How Vegeta Contributes:** Vegeta's feature of allowing custom reporters is the direct enabler of this attack. The attacker exploits the extensibility point provided by `vegeta`.

**Example:** An attacker provides a malicious configuration for a custom `vegeta` reporter that, when invoked by `vegeta`, writes to a system file or executes a shell command.

**Impact:** Varies, but could include data leakage or arbitrary code execution, depending on the exploited reporter.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Validate Reporter Configuration:** Strictly validate and sanitize any configuration options passed to `vegeta` for custom reporters.
*   **Restrict Reporter Capabilities:** Run `vegeta` (and thus its reporters) in a restricted environment (e.g., a container) to limit potential damage.
*   **Avoid User-Supplied Reporters:** Do not allow users to specify or configure custom reporters for `vegeta`. Use only pre-approved, vetted reporters.
