## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching category for attacks that aim to make the target application unavailable by overwhelming its resources.  It's a critical node because DoS is a common and impactful attack vector.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwhelming Target with Excessive Requests](./attack_tree_paths/overwhelming_target_with_excessive_requests.md)

*   **Description:**  This path focuses on sending a flood of requests to the target, exceeding its capacity to handle them.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High Request Rate (`-rate`)](./attack_tree_paths/high_request_rate___-rate__.md)

*   **Description:** Using Vegeta's `-rate` option to send a large number of requests per second.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit lack of rate limiting on target](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_rate_limiting_on_target.md)

*   **Description:**  The target application does not have any mechanisms to limit the number of requests from a single source, making it highly vulnerable to DoS. This is a *critical* vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on the target's configuration)
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass any existing rate limiting](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_any_existing_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing rate limits, for example by rotating IP addresses.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Long Duration (`-duration`)](./attack_tree_paths/long_duration___-duration__.md)

*   **Description:**  Using Vegeta's `-duration` option to sustain the attack for an extended period.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Sustain high request rate for extended period](./attack_tree_paths/sustain_high_request_rate_for_extended_period.md)

*   **Description:** Keeping up a high request rate for a long time.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Combine with high `-rate` for amplified effect](./attack_tree_paths/combine_with_high__-rate__for_amplified_effect.md)

*   **Description:** Using both high request rate and long duration.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Vegeta Misconfiguration or Exploits](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_vegeta_misconfiguration_or_exploits.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Leaking Sensitive Data in Reports](./attack_tree_paths/leaking_sensitive_data_in_reports.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Unintentional Exposure of API Keys/Tokens in `-header`](./attack_tree_paths/unintentional_exposure_of_api_keystokens_in__-header_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Reports stored insecurely (e.g., public S3 bucket).](./attack_tree_paths/reports_stored_insecurely__e_g___public_s3_bucket_.md)

*   **Description:** Vegeta reports, which might contain sensitive information (API keys, internal URLs, etc.), are stored in a location that is publicly accessible or has insufficient access controls. This is a *critical* configuration error.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (requires negligence)
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (attacker would need to find the insecure location)
