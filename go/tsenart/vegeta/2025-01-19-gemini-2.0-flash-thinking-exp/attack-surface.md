# Attack Surface Analysis for tsenart/vegeta

## Attack Surface: [Target Injection/Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/target_injectionserver-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can control the target URLs that Vegeta is instructed to attack.
    * **How Vegeta Contributes:** Vegeta's core functionality involves making HTTP requests to specified targets. If the application allows user input or internal configuration to define these targets without proper validation, it becomes vulnerable.
    * **Example:** A user interface allows specifying a URL for load testing. A malicious user enters `http://internal-service:8080/admin`. The application, using Vegeta, then makes requests to this internal service, potentially bypassing firewall rules.
    * **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data exfiltration from internal services, potential for further attacks on internal infrastructure, and abuse of the application as a proxy.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict whitelisting of allowed target URLs.
        * Sanitize and validate any user-provided input used to define target URLs.
        * If possible, use internal identifiers instead of direct URLs and resolve them securely within the application.
        * Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the requests made by Vegeta.
    * **How Vegeta Contributes:** Vegeta allows customization of request headers. If the application exposes this functionality without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious headers.
    * **Example:** A configuration setting allows adding custom headers. An attacker injects `X-Forwarded-For: malicious.attacker.com` or headers that could lead to HTTP response splitting.
    * **Impact:** HTTP response splitting, cache poisoning, session fixation, bypassing security controls on the target application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid allowing user-defined headers if possible.
        * If custom headers are necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization to prevent injection of control characters or malicious header names/values.
        * Use libraries that automatically handle header encoding and prevent injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Method Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/method_manipulation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can control the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) used by Vegeta.
    * **How Vegeta Contributes:** Vegeta allows specifying the HTTP method for its requests. If the application exposes this without proper authorization or validation, attackers can choose methods that cause unintended side effects.
    * **Example:** An API endpoint allows configuring the load test. An attacker changes the method from `GET` (intended for read-only tests) to `DELETE` on a resource, potentially deleting data on the target application.
    * **Impact:** Data modification or deletion on the target application, triggering unintended actions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce the intended HTTP method within the application's logic, regardless of the method used by Vegeta.
        * Implement proper authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can specify potentially destructive methods.
        * If possible, limit the allowed HTTP methods to a safe subset.

## Attack Surface: [Body Injection/Data Tampering](./attack_surfaces/body_injectiondata_tampering.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious data into the request body sent by Vegeta (for methods like POST or PUT).
    * **How Vegeta Contributes:** Vegeta allows defining the request body for its attacks. If the application allows user-defined request bodies without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious payloads.
    * **Example:** A user can define the data sent in a POST request for load testing. An attacker injects a malicious SQL query or a script that could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on the target application.
    * **Impact:** Data injection vulnerabilities on the target application, potential for XSS if the target reflects the data, and in some cases, remote code execution if the target application processes the body insecurely.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in the request body.
        * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases on the target application.
        * Implement proper output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities on the target application.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Vegeta Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_vegeta_configuration.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive configuration parameters of Vegeta (e.g., API keys, authentication tokens used in headers) might be exposed if not handled securely.
    * **How Vegeta Contributes:** Vegeta's configuration might include sensitive information needed to interact with the target application. If the application stores or transmits this configuration insecurely, it becomes a risk.
    * **Example:** API keys or authentication tokens used in custom headers are stored in plain text in configuration files or logs accessible to unauthorized users.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, allowing attackers to impersonate the application or gain unauthorized access to the target system.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Store sensitive configuration parameters securely using encryption or secrets management tools.
        * Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the application code.
        * Implement proper access controls to restrict access to configuration files and logs.
