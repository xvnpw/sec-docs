## Attack Tree Path: [Generate Excessive Load (Denial of Service)](./attack_tree_paths/generate_excessive_load__denial_of_service_.md)

**Generate Excessive Load (Denial of Service):**
    * **Exhaust Target Resources (CPU, Memory, Network):**
        * **Send Large Number of Requests Concurrently:** An attacker leverages Vegeta's core functionality to send a massive number of requests to the target application simultaneously. This overwhelms the server's processing capacity, memory, and network resources, leading to slow response times or complete unavailability for legitimate users.
    * **Overwhelm Target Infrastructure:**
        * **Exceed Connection Limits:** Vegeta can be configured to open a large number of concurrent connections to the target server. If the server or its infrastructure has a limited number of allowed connections, this attack can exhaust those limits, preventing new connections from being established, effectively denying service.
        * **Saturate Network Bandwidth:** By sending a high volume of requests, especially those with large payloads (though this specific sub-step wasn't marked as High-Risk in the filtered view), an attacker can consume all available network bandwidth to the target server. This prevents legitimate traffic from reaching the application, causing a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Target Application via Vegeta](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_target_application_via_vegeta.md)

**Compromise Target Application via Vegeta:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the starting point of all potential attack paths. Success here signifies a complete breach of the application's security using Vegeta as the attack tool.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Request Generation Capabilities](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_request_generation_capabilities.md)

**Abuse Request Generation Capabilities:** This node represents the broad category of attacks that leverage Vegeta's ability to craft and send HTTP requests. It's critical because it encompasses various methods of exploiting vulnerabilities in the target application through manipulated requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Target](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_target.md)

**Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Target:** This critical node highlights the danger of insufficient input validation in the target application. Attackers can inject malicious payloads into requests sent by Vegeta, leading to:
    * **SQL Injection via Crafted Payloads:**  Manipulating request parameters or headers to inject malicious SQL queries, potentially allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data in the application's database.
    * **Command Injection via Crafted Payloads:** Injecting operating system commands into request parameters or headers, hoping the application executes them, granting the attacker control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate HTTP Headers for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_http_headers_for_malicious_purposes.md)

**Manipulate HTTP Headers for Malicious Purposes:** This node focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities by crafting malicious HTTP headers in requests sent by Vegeta. This can lead to:
    * **Bypass Authentication/Authorization:** Injecting or manipulating authentication tokens or headers to gain unauthorized access to the application.
    * **Trigger Server-Side Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities like HTTP Request Smuggling or Cache Poisoning by crafting specific header combinations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Response Handling Capabilities (Less Direct, but Possible)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_response_handling_capabilities__less_direct__but_possible_.md)

**Abuse Response Handling Capabilities (Less Direct, but Possible):** While less direct for compromising the target application itself, this node is critical because it represents potential vulnerabilities in the environment where Vegeta is running. Malicious responses from the target application could potentially:
    * **Cause Resource Exhaustion on the Vegeta Host:**  Overwhelming the machine running Vegeta with extremely large or infinite response streams, impacting the load testing process or potentially other services on that host.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Configuration and Control of Vegeta](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_configuration_and_control_of_vegeta.md)

**Abuse Configuration and Control of Vegeta:** This node is critical because it represents the potential for an attacker to directly manipulate Vegeta itself to launch or amplify attacks. If an attacker gains access to Vegeta's configuration or control mechanisms, they could:
    * **Modify Attack Parameters:** Increase the attack rate beyond intended limits, effectively launching a more aggressive Denial of Service attack.
    * **Change Target URL to Malicious Endpoint:** Redirect the load generated by Vegeta to an unintended target, potentially causing harm to a different system.
    * **Inject Malicious Scripts/Commands:** If Vegeta has extensibility features, an attacker might be able to inject and execute arbitrary code on the machine running Vegeta.
