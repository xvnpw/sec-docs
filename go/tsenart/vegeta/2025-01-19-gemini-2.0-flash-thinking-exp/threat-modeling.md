# Threat Model Analysis for tsenart/vegeta

## Threat: [Accidental Denial of Service (DoS) during Development/Testing](./threats/accidental_denial_of_service__dos__during_developmenttesting.md)

*   **Threat:** Accidental Denial of Service (DoS) during Development/Testing
    *   **Description:** An attacker (or even a developer by mistake) might configure Vegeta with an extremely high request rate or duration, targeting a vulnerable endpoint. This overwhelms the target server with requests, consuming resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Downtime of development or testing environments, hindering progress and potentially delaying releases. Inadvertent stress on dependent systems could also cause failures.
    *   **Vegeta Component Affected:** Vegeta's attack configuration (target file, rate parameter, duration parameter) and the core attack execution engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the target application, even in development/testing environments.
        *   Use conservative Vegeta attack rates initially and gradually increase them.
        *   Clearly define and document the purpose and scope of each Vegeta test.
        *   Monitor resource utilization on the target system during Vegeta tests.
        *   Implement safeguards to prevent accidental execution of high-intensity attacks against production environments.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Vegeta Attack Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_vegeta_attack_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Vegeta Attack Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to Vegeta attack configuration files (e.g., target files, header definitions) might find sensitive information like API keys, authentication tokens, or internal endpoint details embedded within the requests.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal systems or data, potential for further attacks using the exposed credentials.
    *   **Vegeta Component Affected:** Vegeta's attack configuration files (target files, header definitions, request body definitions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid embedding sensitive information directly in Vegeta configuration files.
        *   Use environment variables or secure secret management solutions to manage sensitive data used in Vegeta attacks.
        *   Implement strict access controls on Vegeta configuration files and the systems where they are stored.
        *   Regularly review and sanitize Vegeta configuration files.

## Threat: [Malicious Injection of Attacks via Compromised CI/CD Pipeline](./threats/malicious_injection_of_attacks_via_compromised_cicd_pipeline.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Injection of Attacks via Compromised CI/CD Pipeline
    *   **Description:** An attacker who compromises the CI/CD pipeline could inject malicious Vegeta attack commands designed to target production or staging environments, causing disruption or data exfiltration.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service against production systems, potential data breaches if the attack targets specific data retrieval endpoints.
    *   **Vegeta Component Affected:** Vegeta's command-line interface (CLI) and its integration within the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong security measures for the CI/CD pipeline, including multi-factor authentication and access controls.
        *   Regularly audit the CI/CD pipeline configuration and scripts for any unauthorized modifications.
        *   Use code signing and verification for CI/CD pipeline components.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual activity within the CI/CD pipeline.

## Threat: [Compromise of the Machine Running Vegeta Leading to Further Attacks](./threats/compromise_of_the_machine_running_vegeta_leading_to_further_attacks.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromise of the Machine Running Vegeta Leading to Further Attacks
    *   **Description:** If the machine running Vegeta is compromised by an attacker, they could potentially gain access to stored attack configurations, credentials used for testing, or even use Vegeta itself to launch attacks against other systems within the network.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, denial of service attacks against other internal or external systems, further compromise of the infrastructure.
    *   **Vegeta Component Affected:** The entire Vegeta installation and its execution environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the machine running Vegeta with appropriate security measures (firewall, antivirus, regular patching).
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for the machine running Vegeta.
        *   Isolate the machine running Vegeta on a separate network segment if possible.
        *   Regularly monitor the machine running Vegeta for any signs of compromise.
