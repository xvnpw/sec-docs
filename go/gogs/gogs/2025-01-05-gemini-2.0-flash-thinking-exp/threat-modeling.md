# Threat Model Analysis for gogs/gogs

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via Vulnerability](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in Gogs' authentication logic could allow attackers to bypass the login process without valid credentials. This could involve exploiting flaws in session management, token generation, or authentication checks *within Gogs' code*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Gogs instance, unauthorized access to all repositories and user data, potential for data manipulation or deletion.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module, Session Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Gogs updated to the latest version to patch known authentication vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly review Gogs security advisories and apply necessary patches.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization *within Gogs' authentication components* to prevent injection attacks that could lead to authentication bypass.

## Threat: [Repository Access Control Flaw](./threats/repository_access_control_flaw.md)

*   **Description:** A flaw in Gogs' permission model could allow users to access or modify repositories they are not authorized to access. This might involve vulnerabilities in how permissions are assigned, checked, or enforced *by Gogs*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive source code, potential for malicious code injection, data breaches, and disruption of development workflows.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authorization Module, Repository Access Control
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure repository permissions and access control lists *within Gogs' settings*.
        *   Regularly audit user permissions and repository access *within Gogs*.
        *   Keep Gogs updated to address any known authorization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Git Command Injection](./threats/git_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If Gogs improperly handles or sanitizes input when executing Git commands on the server (e.g., in Git hooks or repository management functions), attackers could inject malicious commands that are executed with the server's privileges *by Gogs*.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Gogs server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Git Command Execution, Git Hooks
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in Git commands *within Gogs' code*.
        *   Avoid constructing Git commands using string concatenation with user input *in Gogs' implementation*. Use parameterized commands or secure libraries if available.
        *   Implement strong security measures for Git hooks, limiting their capabilities and carefully reviewing any custom hooks *executed by Gogs*.

## Threat: [API Authentication Bypass](./threats/api_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in Gogs' API authentication mechanisms could allow unauthorized access to API endpoints, potentially enabling attackers to manipulate repositories, user data, or settings *through the Gogs API*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to and modification of Gogs data and configuration, potential for data breaches or disruption of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** API Authentication, API Endpoints
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure API authentication is correctly implemented and enforced for all sensitive endpoints *in Gogs' API*.
        *   Use strong authentication methods like API keys or OAuth 2.0 *as supported by Gogs*.
        *   Regularly review and audit API access controls *within Gogs*.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data](./threats/insecure_storage_of_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:** Gogs might store sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, API keys) in an insecure manner, such as in plain text or with weak encryption *within its data storage mechanisms*.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information if the Gogs server or database is compromised.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Storage, Database Interaction
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure sensitive data is encrypted at rest using strong encryption algorithms *within Gogs' data storage configuration*.
        *   Use secure methods for storing and managing secrets *as implemented by Gogs or the underlying system*.
        *   Limit access to the Gogs database and file system.
