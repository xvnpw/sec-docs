# Attack Surface Analysis for gogs/gogs

## Attack Surface: [Git Hook Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/git_hook_command_injection.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious commands into Git hooks that are executed on the server when certain Git events occur (e.g., push, commit).
- **Gogs Contribution:** Gogs allows administrators to configure custom Git hooks for repositories. If input to these hooks is not properly sanitized *by Gogs*, it can lead to command injection.
- **Example:** An administrator configures a post-receive hook within Gogs. An attacker includes shell commands in their commit message, which are then executed on the Gogs server *because Gogs did not sanitize the input before passing it to the hook*.
- **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developers:** Implement robust input sanitization *within Gogs* for any user-provided data used in Git hooks. Avoid directly executing shell commands with user input *in Gogs' hook execution logic*. Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Issues and Pull Requests](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_issues_and_pull_requests.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into issue descriptions, comments, or pull request content that will be executed in other users' browsers when they view that content.
- **Gogs Contribution:** Gogs renders user-provided content (including Markdown) in issues and pull requests. If this rendering is not properly sanitized *by Gogs*, it can lead to XSS.
- **Example:** An attacker injects a `<script>` tag into an issue description. When another user views the issue *through Gogs*, the script executes in their browser.
- **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developers:** Implement strict output encoding/escaping of user-provided content *within Gogs* before rendering it in HTML. Use a robust and well-maintained HTML sanitization library *integrated into Gogs*. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers *configured by Gogs*.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

- **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Gogs' API authentication or authorization mechanisms could allow attackers to bypass security checks and access or modify data without proper credentials.
- **Gogs Contribution:** Gogs provides an API for programmatic access to its features. Flaws in the design or implementation of API authentication (e.g., token handling, session management) or authorization checks *within Gogs' API implementation* can lead to this vulnerability.
- **Example:** A bug in the API token validation logic *in Gogs* allows an attacker to forge or guess valid API tokens, granting them unauthorized access to repositories or user accounts.
- **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized modification of repositories, account takeover.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developers:** Implement robust and well-tested authentication and authorization mechanisms for the API *within Gogs*. Use strong and unpredictable API tokens *generated and managed by Gogs*. Properly validate all API requests and enforce access controls *in Gogs' API endpoints*. Regularly review and audit API endpoints for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Repository Content (e.g., Malicious Files leading to Code Execution)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_repository_content__e_g___malicious_files_leading_to_code_execution_.md)

- **Description:** Gogs might be vulnerable to attacks where specially crafted files within repositories exploit vulnerabilities in how Gogs processes or renders them, potentially leading to code execution.
- **Gogs Contribution:** Gogs needs to process and potentially render various file types within repositories. Vulnerabilities in *Gogs'* handling of specific file formats (e.g., image processing, rendering Markdown with embedded code) can be exploited.
- **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file to a repository. A vulnerability in *Gogs'* image processing library allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server when Gogs attempts to generate a thumbnail.
- **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developers:**  Use secure and up-to-date libraries for processing and rendering file content. Implement sandboxing or other isolation techniques when processing potentially untrusted file formats. Thoroughly validate and sanitize file content before processing or rendering.
