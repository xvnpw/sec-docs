## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Gogs Web Application Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_gogs_web_application_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This path targets common web application vulnerabilities within the Gogs web interface. These vulnerabilities are often easier to exploit and can have a significant impact.

    * **1.1. Authentication and Authorization Bypass (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - Direct Access)**
        * **Description:** Bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or administrative functions. This is a critical path as it directly leads to compromise.
            * **1.1.1. Exploit Weak Password Policies or Brute-Force Attacks (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - Common & Easy)**
                * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weak password policies or brute-forcing user credentials.
                * **Why High-Risk:** Weak passwords and lack of brute-force protection are common vulnerabilities. Brute-force attacks are relatively easy to execute with readily available tools and can lead to direct account compromise, granting attackers access to repositories and application functionalities.
                * **Recommended Actions:** Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, rotation), implement rate limiting on login attempts, implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts, consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

    * **1.2. Injection Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - Wide Range of Issues)**
        * **Description:** Injection vulnerabilities occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. This can lead to data breaches, code execution, and other severe consequences.
            * **1.2.2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - Common Web Issue)**
                * **Description:** XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, account compromise, and defacement.
                    * **1.2.2.1. Stored XSS (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - Persistent Impact)**
                        * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts that are stored on the server (e.g., in repository descriptions, issue comments) and executed when other users view the affected content.
                        * **Why High-Risk:** Stored XSS has a persistent impact, affecting all users who view the compromised content. It is a common web vulnerability and can be exploited with relatively low skill.
                        * **Recommended Actions:** Sanitize user inputs on both client and server-side, especially for areas where content is stored and displayed to other users. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS even if it occurs.

    * **1.3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - Common Web Issue)**
        * **Description:** CSRF vulnerabilities allow attackers to trick users into performing unintended actions on a web application while they are authenticated.
            * **1.3.1. CSRF in critical actions (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - State Manipulation)**
                * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting CSRF to perform critical actions like changing settings, adding users, or managing repositories without the user's knowledge or consent.
                * **Why High-Risk:** CSRF is a common web vulnerability that can be easily exploited if not properly mitigated. It can lead to unauthorized state changes and compromise application integrity.
                * **Recommended Actions:** Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing requests. Use the `SameSite` cookie attribute to further protect against CSRF attacks.

    * **1.7. Denial of Service (DoS) (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - Availability Impact)**
        * **Description:** DoS attacks aim to make a system or service unavailable to legitimate users.
            * **1.7.1. Resource Exhaustion (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - Easy to Trigger)**
                * **Attack Vector:** Exhausting server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) by sending excessive requests or large file uploads.
                * **Why High-Risk:** Resource exhaustion DoS attacks are relatively easy to trigger, even with low skill and effort. They can disrupt application availability and impact business operations.
                * **Recommended Actions:** Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source. Set input size limits to prevent excessively large uploads. Implement resource quotas to limit resource consumption per user or repository. Ensure proper error handling to prevent resource leaks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Gogs Configuration and Deployment Issues (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_gogs_configuration_and_deployment_issues__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from insecure configuration and deployment practices of the Gogs application itself. Misconfigurations are often overlooked and can create easy entry points for attackers.

    * **3.1. Default Credentials or Weak Default Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - Basic Security Mistake)**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting default credentials or weak default configurations that are often present in new installations if not properly secured.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Using default credentials is a fundamental security mistake that is easily exploitable. Attackers often scan for default installations and attempt to use default credentials for quick access.
        * **Recommended Actions:** Change default administrator credentials immediately upon installation. Review and harden all default configurations, following security best practices and the Gogs documentation.

    * **3.2. Insecure Installation or Deployment Practices (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        * **Description:**  Insecure deployment practices can introduce vulnerabilities that are not inherent in the application code itself.
            * **3.2.1. Running Gogs with excessive privileges (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - Common Misconfig)**
                * **Attack Vector:** Running the Gogs process with unnecessarily high privileges (e.g., as root).
                * **Why High-Risk:** If Gogs is compromised while running with excessive privileges, the attacker can gain full control over the underlying system. This is a common misconfiguration and significantly increases the impact of any vulnerability.
                * **Recommended Actions:** Run Gogs with a dedicated, least privilege user account. Utilize containerization and security contexts to further isolate and restrict Gogs' privileges.

            * **3.2.2. Exposed Admin Panel or Debug Interfaces (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - Easy Target)**
                * **Attack Vector:** Leaving the administrative panel or debug interfaces exposed to the public internet without proper access controls.
                * **Why High-Risk:** Exposed admin panels and debug interfaces are easy targets for attackers. They often contain sensitive information or functionalities that can be exploited for system compromise.
                * **Recommended Actions:** Secure admin panel access by using strong authentication and IP whitelisting to restrict access to authorized networks. Disable debug interfaces in production environments.

            * **3.2.3. Insecure Network Configuration (e.g., exposed to public internet unnecessarily) (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - Network Exposure)**
                * **Attack Vector:** Exposing Gogs to the public internet unnecessarily or without proper network segmentation and firewall rules.
                * **Why High-Risk:** Unnecessary network exposure increases the attack surface and makes Gogs more vulnerable to attacks from the internet.
                * **Recommended Actions:** Implement proper network segmentation to isolate Gogs within a secure network zone. Use firewalls to restrict access to only necessary ports and from trusted networks. Consider using a VPN or bastion host for remote access.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Supply Chain and Dependency Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/4__supply_chain_and_dependency_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This path addresses risks arising from vulnerabilities in the software supply chain, specifically Gogs' dependencies.

    * **4.1. Vulnerabilities in Gogs Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        * **Description:** Gogs relies on various dependencies (Go libraries, database drivers, etc.). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect Gogs.
            * **4.1.1. Outdated Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - Common & Broad)**
                * **Attack Vector:** Using outdated dependencies that contain known security vulnerabilities.
                * **Why High-Risk:** Outdated dependencies are a common source of vulnerabilities. Attackers often target known vulnerabilities in popular libraries. Failing to update dependencies leaves Gogs vulnerable to these exploits.
                * **Recommended Actions:** Regularly update Gogs and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions. Use dependency scanning tools to automatically identify outdated dependencies and known vulnerabilities. Implement a process for promptly patching vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Social Engineering and Phishing (Targeting Gogs Users) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/5__social_engineering_and_phishing__targeting_gogs_users___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This path focuses on attacks that target users of the Gogs application through social engineering and phishing techniques. While not directly a Gogs vulnerability, it's a critical threat vector in the context of application security.

    * **5.1. Phishing for User Credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE - User as Weakest Link)**
        * **Attack Vector:** Tricking users into revealing their login credentials (usernames and passwords) through deceptive emails, websites, or other communication methods.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Users are often the weakest link in security. Phishing attacks are relatively easy to execute and can be very effective in compromising user accounts, even if the application itself is secure.
        * **Recommended Actions:** Educate users about phishing attacks, how to recognize them, and best practices for password security. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security beyond passwords. Regularly conduct security awareness training for users.
