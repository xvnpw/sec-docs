# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gogs/gogs

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong Password Policies
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Gogs Configuration:** Open the Gogs configuration file (`app.ini`).
    2.  **Locate `[security]` Section:** Find the `[security]` section in the configuration file.
    3.  **Configure Password Requirements:** Set the following parameters within the `[security]` section to enforce password complexity:
        *   `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH = 8` (or higher, e.g., 12-16) - Sets the minimum password length.
        *   `PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY = true` - Enables password complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
    4.  **Restart Gogs Service:** Restart the Gogs service for the changes to take effect.
    5.  **Communicate Policy to Users:** Inform users about the new password policy and encourage them to update their passwords.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-force attacks (High Severity):**  Reduces the likelihood of successful brute-force attacks by making passwords harder to guess.
    *   **Credential stuffing (High Severity):** Makes stolen credentials from other breaches less effective if users reuse passwords.
    *   **Dictionary attacks (High Severity):**  Makes dictionary attacks less effective by requiring more complex passwords.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-force attacks (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Credential stuffing (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk, but depends on user password reuse habits.
    *   **Dictionary attacks (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Minimum password length is set to 8 in `app.ini`.
    *   **Location:** `app.ini` configuration file.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Password complexity is not enforced (`PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY = false`). Communication to users about password policy is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_two-factor_authentication__2fa_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable 2FA in Gogs Configuration:** In the `[service]` section of `app.ini`, ensure `ENABLE_CAPTCHA = true` and `ENABLE_TWOFA = true`.
    2.  **User Enablement:** Users need to enable 2FA in their Gogs profile settings. Guide users on how to set up 2FA using a TOTP application (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
    3.  **Enforce 2FA (Optional but Recommended):**  Consider enforcing 2FA for all users or specific roles (e.g., administrators) through organizational policy and communication. Gogs itself doesn't have a built-in enforcement mechanism, but it can be enforced through organizational policies and monitoring.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):**  Significantly reduces the risk of account takeover even if passwords are compromised.
    *   **Phishing attacks (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the impact of phishing attacks as attackers would need both password and 2FA code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Account Takeover (High Impact):**  Drastically reduces the risk.
    *   **Phishing attacks (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the risk, but users can still be tricked into providing 2FA codes in sophisticated phishing attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. 2FA is enabled in `app.ini` and users *can* enable it in their profiles.
    *   **Location:** `app.ini` configuration, User profile settings.
*   **Missing Implementation:** 2FA is not mandatory. User education and encouragement to enable 2FA are missing. Enforcement policy is not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review User Permissions and Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_user_permissions_and_access_control.md)

    2.  **Identify User Roles and Permissions:** Document the different user roles and their required permissions within Gogs.
    3.  **Review User List:**  Go through the list of Gogs users and their assigned roles and repository permissions using the Gogs admin panel.
    4.  **Remove Unnecessary Access:** Revoke access for users who no longer require it (e.g., former employees, users who changed roles) through the Gogs admin panel.
    5.  **Adjust Permissions:** Adjust permissions to adhere to the principle of least privilege using Gogs' permission management features. Ensure users only have the necessary access for their tasks.
    6.  **Document Changes:** Document any changes made to user permissions during the review process.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of unauthorized access to repositories and sensitive data by ensuring users only have necessary permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Repository Webhooks with Secret Tokens](./mitigation_strategies/enable_repository_webhooks_with_secret_tokens.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Repository Webhooks with Secret Tokens
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Secret Token:** When configuring a webhook in Gogs, generate a strong, unique secret token within the Gogs webhook configuration interface.
    2.  **Configure Webhook URL:**  In the webhook configuration in Gogs, include the secret token in the webhook URL (e.g., as a query parameter or in the `Authorization` header, depending on the receiving application's requirements).
    3.  **Verify Token on Receiver Side:**  The receiving application must verify the secret token in the incoming webhook request before processing the webhook event. This is handled in the receiving application's code.
    4.  **Securely Store Token:** Store and manage webhook secret tokens securely. Avoid hardcoding them in code or configuration files. Use environment variables or secrets management solutions outside of Gogs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Webhook Spoofing (Medium Severity):**  Prevents attackers from sending fake webhook requests to the receiving application, potentially triggering malicious actions.
    *   **Unauthorized Actions via Webhooks (Medium Severity):**  Ensures that only legitimate webhook requests from Gogs are processed, preventing unauthorized actions triggered by spoofed webhooks.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Branch protection is not consistently applied to all critical branches (e.g., `develop`, `release`). Review and expansion of branch protection rules (e.g., status checks).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Git Hooks](./mitigation_strategies/secure_git_hooks.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Git Hooks
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Existing Hooks:** Review all server-side Git hooks configured in Gogs, located in the Gogs repositories' `hooks` directory on the server.
    2.  **Restrict Hook Creation/Modification:** Limit who can create or modify server-side Git hooks to authorized administrators. This is typically managed through server access control.
    3.  **Secure Hook Scripts:** Ensure hook scripts are:
        *   Owned by a secure user (e.g., the Gogs user).
        *   Have appropriate file permissions (e.g., read and execute only for the owner).
        *   Written securely to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Do not perform actions with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary and carefully secured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Run Gogs with a Dedicated User Account](./mitigation_strategies/run_gogs_with_a_dedicated_user_account.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Run Gogs with a Dedicated User Account
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Dedicated User:** Create a dedicated, non-privileged user account specifically for running the Gogs application (e.g., `gogs`) on the server.
    2.  **Set Ownership and Permissions:** Ensure that Gogs application files, directories, and configuration files are owned by this dedicated user and have appropriate permissions on the server.
    3.  **Run Gogs Service as Dedicated User:** Configure the Gogs service (e.g., systemd service) to run as the dedicated user. This is a server configuration step.
    4.  **Avoid Running as Root:** Never run Gogs as the root user or an administrator user.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):**  Limits the impact of a security breach in Gogs by preventing attackers from gaining root or administrator privileges on the server.
    *   **System-wide Compromise (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of a system-wide compromise if Gogs is exploited, as the attacker's access is limited to the dedicated user's privileges.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **System-wide Compromise (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Centralized logging system, automated log analysis and alerting, formal log review process, secure log storage (consider log rotation and archiving).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use HTTPS and Enforce TLS within Gogs](./mitigation_strategies/use_https_and_enforce_tls_within_gogs.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Use HTTPS and Enforce TLS within Gogs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain SSL/TLS Certificate:** Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate for the Gogs domain from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or use Let's Encrypt for free certificates.
    2.  **Configure Gogs for HTTPS:** Configure Gogs to use HTTPS by setting the `PROTOCOL = https` and configuring `HTTP_ADDR` and `HTTPS_ADDR` in the `[server]` section of `app.ini`. Specify the paths to your SSL/TLS certificate and private key in the `CERT_FILE` and `KEY_FILE` settings within the `[server]` section.
    3.  **Enforce TLS:** Configure Gogs to enforce TLS (Transport Layer Security) and disable insecure protocols like SSLv3 and TLS 1.0. While Gogs configuration might not directly control TLS versions, ensure your web server or reverse proxy (if used) enforces strong TLS settings.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):**  Protects against MitM attacks by encrypting communication between clients and the Gogs server.
