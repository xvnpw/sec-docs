# Threat Model Analysis for gogs/gogs

## Threat: [Git Command Injection](./threats/git_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious input within Gogs (e.g., in repository names, branch names, commit messages, or webhook configurations) that, when processed by Gogs, leads to the execution of arbitrary Git commands on the server. This is achieved by exploiting insufficient input sanitization before passing user-provided data to Git commands executed by Gogs.
*   **Impact:**  Complete server compromise. Attackers could gain shell access to the Gogs server, read sensitive files, modify system configurations, install backdoors, and potentially pivot to other systems on the network.
*   **Affected Gogs Component:** Git command execution functions within Gogs core, potentially affecting repository management, webhook handling, and Git operations triggered by user actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data that is used in Git commands. Use parameterized commands or libraries that prevent command injection.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Gogs process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful command injection.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct code reviews and penetration testing to identify potential command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Update Gogs Regularly:** Apply security patches and updates released by the Gogs project to address known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Webhook Command Injection via Payload Manipulation](./threats/webhook_command_injection_via_payload_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** If Gogs' webhook handling logic is flawed, an attacker could manipulate webhook payloads or configurations to inject commands that are executed on the Gogs server or systems integrated with webhooks. This could occur if webhook scripts or integrations improperly process data from webhook requests without sufficient validation.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially server compromise or compromise of systems integrated with webhooks. Attackers could execute arbitrary commands, modify data, or disrupt services depending on the webhook integration and vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Gogs Component:** Webhook handling module, webhook execution scripts, and integrations that process webhook data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Webhook Payload Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received in webhook payloads before processing it.
    *   **Secure Webhook Integrations:** Ensure that any scripts or systems processing webhooks are securely designed and implemented, avoiding command execution based on untrusted webhook data.
    *   **Webhook Signature Verification:** Implement and enforce webhook signature verification to ensure that webhooks originate from legitimate sources and have not been tampered with.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Webhook Processing:** Run webhook processing scripts with minimal necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Markdown Rendering Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/markdown_rendering_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the Markdown rendering engine used by Gogs could allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into Markdown content (e.g., in issues, pull requests, repository descriptions). When other users view this content, the malicious script could execute in their browsers, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf.
*   **Impact:**  Account compromise, data theft, defacement, and phishing attacks targeting users of the Gogs instance.
*   **Affected Gogs Component:** Markdown rendering library and functions used throughout the Gogs application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use a Secure Markdown Rendering Library:** Ensure Gogs uses a well-maintained and security-focused Markdown rendering library that is regularly updated.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Properly encode user-generated Markdown content before rendering it in HTML to prevent the execution of injected scripts.
    *   **Regularly Update Gogs and Dependencies:** Keep the Markdown rendering library and Gogs updated to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.
