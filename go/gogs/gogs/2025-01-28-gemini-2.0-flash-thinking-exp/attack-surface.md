# Attack Surface Analysis for gogs/gogs

## Attack Surface: [Brute-force attacks on login](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_attacks_on_login.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess user credentials by repeatedly trying different usernames and passwords on the login form.
*   **Gogs Contribution:** Gogs provides the login functionality. Insufficient rate limiting in Gogs directly contributes to this attack surface by allowing numerous login attempts.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a script to try thousands of password combinations against a valid username on the Gogs login page until they guess the correct password.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially leading to data breaches, repository manipulation, or account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Gogs Configuration:** Configure Gogs with strong rate limiting for login attempts. Refer to Gogs documentation for rate limiting settings.
    *   **Gogs Configuration:** Enable and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) in Gogs to add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
    *   **Gogs Configuration:** Configure account lockout policies in Gogs to automatically disable accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    *   **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring of login attempts to detect and alert on suspicious brute-force activity.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages served by Gogs, which are then executed in other users' browsers when they view those pages.
*   **Gogs Contribution:** Gogs handles and renders user-provided content in various areas like repository descriptions, issue comments, wiki pages, and commit messages. Vulnerabilities in Gogs' input sanitization and output encoding when handling this content directly lead to XSS risks. Gogs' use of Markdown rendering, if not securely implemented, can also introduce XSS.
*   **Example:** A malicious user injects JavaScript code within an issue comment using Markdown. When another user views this issue, the injected script executes in their browser, potentially stealing their session cookies or performing actions on their behalf within Gogs.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, defacement of Gogs pages, redirection to malicious websites, and information theft from users interacting with the compromised content.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Gogs Development/Updates:** Ensure Gogs is updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for known XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Gogs Development/Configuration:**  Gogs developers should rigorously implement input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided content rendered by Gogs.
    *   **Gogs Configuration:** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers in Gogs' web server configuration to restrict the sources of content that the browser is allowed to load, mitigating the impact of some XSS attacks.
    *   **Security Audits:** Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on XSS vulnerabilities within Gogs.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit flaws in Gogs' file handling to access files or directories outside of the intended web root on the server.
*   **Gogs Contribution:** Gogs handles file paths when serving repository files, avatars, and potentially in other file-related functionalities. Improper validation of these paths within Gogs code can allow attackers to traverse the file system.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL when requesting a repository file, using path traversal sequences like `../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to access the server's password file instead of a file within the Git repository.
*   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files on the Gogs server, including configuration files, source code, or system files, potentially leading to further compromise or information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Gogs Development/Updates:** Ensure Gogs is updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Gogs Development:** Gogs developers must implement strict validation and sanitization of all user-provided file paths and any paths constructed internally within Gogs before file system operations.
    *   **Deployment:** Run Gogs with minimal file system permissions. Use a dedicated user account with restricted access to only necessary files and directories.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular code reviews and security testing to identify and eliminate path traversal vulnerabilities in Gogs.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries executed by Gogs, potentially allowing them to manipulate the database.
*   **Gogs Contribution:** Gogs relies on a database to store all its data. If Gogs' database queries are not properly constructed and parameterized, SQL injection vulnerabilities can arise in Gogs' codebase.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input in a search field or another input that is used in a database query within Gogs without proper sanitization. This injected SQL code could allow the attacker to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server in some scenarios.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, data loss, complete compromise of the Gogs application and potentially the underlying database server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Gogs Development/Updates:** Keep Gogs updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Gogs Development:** Gogs developers must use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions to prevent SQL injection. Avoid constructing SQL queries by directly concatenating user input.
    *   **Database Security:** Follow database security best practices, including using least privilege principles for database user accounts used by Gogs and regularly applying database security updates.
    *   **Security Audits:** Perform regular code reviews and penetration testing specifically looking for SQL injection vulnerabilities in Gogs.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands into the system shell through vulnerable parts of Gogs, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Gogs Contribution:** Gogs interacts with the Git command-line tool and potentially other system utilities. If user-provided input or internal data is used to construct shell commands within Gogs without proper sanitization, command injection vulnerabilities can occur in Gogs' code.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious repository name or branch name that, when processed by Gogs in a Git command execution, injects and executes arbitrary system commands on the Gogs server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Gogs Development/Updates:** Ensure Gogs is updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Gogs Development:** Gogs developers should avoid using system calls to execute commands based on user input if possible.
    *   **Gogs Development:** If system calls are necessary, strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input and any internal data used in constructing commands. Use safe APIs and libraries for interacting with external processes instead of directly invoking shell commands.
    *   **Deployment:** Run Gogs with minimal system privileges. Use a dedicated user account with restricted permissions to limit the impact of command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular code reviews and penetration testing to identify and eliminate command injection vulnerabilities in Gogs.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms in the Gogs API to gain unauthorized access to API endpoints and data.
*   **Gogs Contribution:** Gogs provides a REST API for programmatic access. Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Gogs' API authentication and authorization logic directly allow attackers to bypass security controls.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers an API endpoint in Gogs that is intended for administrative actions but lacks proper authorization checks. They can then access this endpoint and perform administrative tasks without proper credentials, potentially by manipulating API requests or exploiting flaws in the authentication mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data through the API, data manipulation, account takeover via API access, denial of service by abusing API endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Gogs Development/Updates:** Ensure Gogs is updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for API security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Gogs Development:** Gogs developers must implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints. Use established security standards like OAuth 2.0 or JWT for API authentication where appropriate.
    *   **Gogs Configuration:** Properly configure API access controls within Gogs to enforce the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Security Audits:** Regularly audit API security configurations and conduct penetration testing specifically targeting API security vulnerabilities in Gogs.
