## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Gogs CVEs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_gogs_cves.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Gogs, often with readily available exploit code. This can include Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or Authentication Bypass vulnerabilities.

**Why High-Risk:** Known CVEs are actively targeted by attackers due to the ease of exploitation once a vulnerability is public. If the Gogs instance is not promptly patched, it becomes a prime target. The impact can range from gaining complete control of the server to stealing sensitive data or manipulating the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries and components that Gogs relies on. This can involve crafting specific inputs or requests that exploit these underlying weaknesses.

**Why High-Risk:** Dependency vulnerabilities are often overlooked and can be difficult to track. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities indirectly through Gogs, making detection more challenging. Successful exploitation can lead to similar outcomes as direct Gogs vulnerabilities, including gaining access or executing code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit insecure configurations of the Gogs instance. This can include using default or weak credentials, having overly permissive access controls, or exposing sensitive information through misconfigured settings.

**Why High-Risk:** Misconfigurations are common and often result from human error or a lack of understanding of secure configuration practices. They provide relatively easy entry points for attackers with basic skills. Weak authentication is a particularly critical misconfiguration as it directly allows unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Targeting Gogs Users](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_targeting_gogs_users.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate Gogs users into revealing their credentials (e.g., through phishing) or performing actions that compromise security (e.g., approving malicious pull requests).

**Why High-Risk:** Social engineering exploits the human element, which is often the weakest link in security. These attacks can be highly effective even against technically secure systems. Successful phishing can grant attackers legitimate access to the Gogs instance, allowing them to perform a wide range of malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Gogs](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_gogs.md)

**Attack Vector:** This represents the successful achievement of the attacker's goal through any of the identified attack paths.

**Why Critical:** This is the ultimate objective and signifies a complete security failure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gogs Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gogs_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Successfully leveraging a flaw in the Gogs codebase or its dependencies.

**Why Critical:** This often provides the initial foothold or significant leverage needed to further compromise the system and the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities (e.g., RCE, XSS, Auth Bypass)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities__e_g___rce__xss__auth_bypass_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Directly using known exploits against a vulnerable Gogs instance.

**Why Critical:** This is a direct and often highly impactful attack vector, potentially leading to immediate control or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Initial Access to Gogs Instance](./attack_tree_paths/gain_initial_access_to_gogs_instance.md)

**Attack Vector:** Successfully authenticating or bypassing authentication to access the Gogs system.

**Why Critical:** This is a fundamental step for many subsequent attacks, allowing the attacker to interact with the system and potentially escalate privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on Gogs Server](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_gogs_server.md)

**Attack Vector:** Achieving the ability to run arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Gogs instance.

**Why Critical:** This grants the attacker complete control over the Gogs server, allowing them to access any data, modify configurations, and potentially pivot to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (e.g., through crafted Git commands, API requests)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies__e_g___through_crafted_git_commands__api_requests_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Indirectly exploiting Gogs by targeting vulnerabilities in its underlying libraries.

**Why Critical:** This can be a less obvious but equally effective way to compromise the system, often bypassing direct Gogs security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Authentication Settings](./attack_tree_paths/weak_authentication_settings.md)

**Attack Vector:**  The presence of easily guessable passwords, lack of multi-factor authentication, or other weak authentication practices.

**Why Critical:** This provides a simple and direct entry point for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to User Accounts and Perform Malicious Actions](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_user_accounts_and_perform_malicious_actions.md)

**Attack Vector:** Successfully compromising a legitimate user account, often through social engineering.

**Why Critical:** This allows attackers to perform actions as a trusted user, making their activities harder to detect and potentially granting access to sensitive resources and functionalities.
