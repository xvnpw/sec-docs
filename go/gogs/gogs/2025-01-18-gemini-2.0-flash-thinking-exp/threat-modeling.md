# Threat Model Analysis for gogs/gogs

## Threat: [Weak or Default Administrator Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_administrator_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker attempts to log in using well-known default credentials (e.g., admin/admin, gogs/gogs) after a default installation. If successful, they gain full administrative access to the Gogs instance.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the Gogs instance. This allows the attacker to: create/delete users, access/modify/delete all repositories, change system settings, potentially execute arbitrary code on the server (depending on Gogs's capabilities and server configuration).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerability](./threats/authentication_bypass_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits a flaw within Gogs's authentication logic to bypass the login process without providing valid credentials. This could involve manipulating requests, exploiting logic errors, or leveraging known vulnerabilities in the Gogs authentication module.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and repositories within Gogs. Attackers can view, modify, or delete code, access sensitive information, and potentially impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Insufficient Authorization Checks Leading to Privilege Escalation](./threats/insufficient_authorization_checks_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits a lack of proper authorization checks within Gogs to perform actions they are not permitted to do. This could involve manipulating API requests or exploiting flaws in Gogs's permission model to gain access to resources or functionalities beyond their assigned privileges (e.g., a regular user gaining admin privileges within Gogs).
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data within Gogs, modification of critical Gogs settings, and potential takeover of the Gogs instance.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Git Hooks](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_git_hooks.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker with write access to a repository within Gogs crafts a malicious Git hook that, when triggered by a Git operation (e.g., push), causes the Gogs server to make requests to internal or external resources. This is a vulnerability within Gogs's hook execution mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure about internal infrastructure accessible from the Gogs server, access to internal services, potential for further exploitation of internal systems via the Gogs server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Git Hooks (Less Likely but Possible)](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_git_hooks__less_likely_but_possible_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits a vulnerability in how Gogs handles and executes Git hook scripts to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Gogs. This is a direct vulnerability in Gogs's hook execution functionality.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Gogs server, allowing the attacker to perform any action on the system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Exposure of Private Repositories due to Access Control Flaws](./threats/exposure_of_private_repositories_due_to_access_control_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** A bug or misconfiguration within Gogs's access control mechanisms allows unauthorized users to view or clone private repositories they should not have access to. This is a direct flaw in Gogs's permission management.
*   **Impact:** Confidential source code and sensitive information within private repositories are exposed to unauthorized individuals.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [API Key Compromise Leading to Unauthorized Actions](./threats/api_key_compromise_leading_to_unauthorized_actions.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains access to a user's API key for Gogs through various means (e.g., phishing, insecure storage). They can then use this key to authenticate to the Gogs API and perform actions on behalf of the compromised user, such as creating/deleting repositories, accessing code, or modifying settings within Gogs.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to and modification of repositories and user data within Gogs. Potential for data breaches and disruption of workflows.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Gogs Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_gogs_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Gogs relies on various third-party libraries and components. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit them *through Gogs* to compromise the Gogs instance. This is a risk introduced by Gogs's choice of dependencies.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service affecting the Gogs instance.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be High or Critical).
