    * **Description:**  Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or defacement.
    * **Exploitation Techniques:**
        * Injecting malicious JavaScript into issue descriptions, commit messages, pull request comments, repository names, or user profile fields that are not properly sanitized.
        * Crafting malicious URLs that, when clicked by a logged-in user, execute JavaScript in their browser within the Gogs context.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Stealing user session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, performing actions on behalf of the user, injecting ransomware into the browser.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Output Encoding:**  Properly encode all user-supplied data before rendering it in HTML. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding, JavaScript encoding, URL encoding).
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        * **Input Validation:**  Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and reject or sanitize potentially malicious input.

* **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    * **Description:**  Injecting malicious SQL queries into database interactions, potentially allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data.
    * **Exploitation Techniques:**
        * Manipulating input fields (e.g., search parameters, user login credentials) to inject SQL commands that bypass authentication or retrieve sensitive data.
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in database interaction logic within Gogs' codebase.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Gaining access to user credentials, source code, repository data, modifying application settings, potentially executing arbitrary commands on the database server (depending on database permissions).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Use parameterized queries for all database interactions to prevent the interpretation of user input as SQL code.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the database user Gogs uses has only the necessary permissions.
        * **Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize user input that is used in database queries.

* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    * **Description:**  Tricking a logged-in user into unknowingly performing actions on the Gogs application on behalf of the attacker.
    * **Exploitation Techniques:**
        * Embedding malicious links or forms in external websites or emails that, when clicked by an authenticated Gogs user, trigger unintended actions (e.g., changing settings, creating repositories, adding users).
    * **Potential Impact:**  Unauthorized modification of user settings, creation of malicious repositories, granting access to attackers, potentially leading to further compromise.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Anti-CSRF Tokens:**  Implement and validate unique, unpredictable tokens in state-changing requests.
        * **SameSite Cookie Attribute:**  Utilize the `SameSite` cookie attribute to restrict when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
