# Attack Surface Analysis for gogs/gogs

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markdown_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into Gogs through user-provided markdown content (e.g., in issue descriptions, comments, repository descriptions). When other users view this content, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **How Gogs Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Gogs renders user-supplied markdown to HTML for display. If the markdown rendering library *used by Gogs* or *Gogs' own sanitization process* has vulnerabilities, it can allow the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   **Example:** A user creates an issue with a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When another user views this issue within Gogs, the alert box pops up, demonstrating the execution of malicious script due to insufficient sanitization by Gogs.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the Gogs interface, and potentially further compromise of user accounts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Utilize a robust and actively maintained markdown rendering library with strong XSS prevention capabilities *within the Gogs application*.
            *   Implement strict input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided markdown content *before Gogs renders it*.
            *   Employ a Content Security Policy (CSP) *configured within Gogs* to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.
            *   Regularly update the markdown rendering library *integrated into Gogs* to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Webhooks](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_webhooks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the webhook configuration to make Gogs send requests to arbitrary internal or external servers.
    *   **How Gogs Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Gogs allows users to define arbitrary URLs for webhook endpoints *within its settings*. If *Gogs* does not properly validate these URLs, an attacker can specify internal network addresses or external malicious servers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker configures a webhook for a repository *in Gogs* that sends a request to `http://localhost:6379` (a common Redis port) potentially allowing them to interact with internal services *accessible from the Gogs server*.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal services, information disclosure from internal systems, port scanning of internal networks, and potentially leveraging internal services for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of webhook URLs *within Gogs*, potentially using a whitelist of allowed domains or IP ranges.
            *   Consider using a dedicated service or library *within the Gogs application* for making external requests that provides SSRF protection.
            *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF by restricting *Gogs'* access to internal resources.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass or Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass_or_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Gogs' authentication mechanisms could allow attackers to bypass login procedures or exploit weaknesses in password management.
    *   **How Gogs Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Gogs implements its own authentication system, and potential flaws *in Gogs'* implementation (e.g., weak password hashing *used by Gogs*, predictable session tokens *generated by Gogs*, vulnerabilities in OAuth or LDAP integration *within Gogs*) can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the password reset functionality *implemented by Gogs* allows an attacker to reset another user's password without proper authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, repositories, and sensitive information *managed by Gogs*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Use strong and well-vetted password hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt) *within Gogs*.
            *   Implement secure session management with strong, unpredictable session tokens and proper expiration *within Gogs*.
            *   Enforce strong password policies for users *within Gogs' settings*.
            *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) *as a feature of Gogs* for enhanced security.
            *   Thoroughly review and test any custom authentication logic or integrations (OAuth, LDAP) *implemented within Gogs*.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Avatar/Attachment Uploads](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_avatarattachment_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can upload files with manipulated filenames that allow them to write to arbitrary locations on the Gogs server's file system.
    *   **How Gogs Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Gogs allows users to upload avatars and attachments. If *Gogs'* application doesn't properly sanitize filenames during the upload process, attackers can use ".." sequences to navigate the file system.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads an avatar named `../../../../etc/cron.d/malicious_job` *through Gogs' upload functionality*, intending to create a cron job for persistent access on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, remote code execution on the Gogs server, and server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust filename sanitization *within Gogs* to remove or replace potentially dangerous characters and sequences (like "..").
            *   Store uploaded files in a dedicated location *configured by Gogs* outside of the webroot with restricted access permissions.
            *   Generate unique, non-user-controlled filenames for uploaded files *within Gogs' upload handling logic*.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Gogs' API authentication mechanisms or authorization logic could allow unauthorized access to API endpoints and data.
    *   **How Gogs Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Gogs provides an API for programmatic interaction. Flaws in how API keys are generated, managed, or validated *by Gogs*, or in the logic that determines access permissions *within Gogs' API*, can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a way to generate valid API keys *through a vulnerability in Gogs' API key generation process* without proper authentication or exploits a flaw to access API endpoints that should be restricted *according to Gogs' authorization rules*.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of repositories *via the Gogs API*, and potential account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement secure API key generation, storage, and revocation mechanisms *within Gogs*.
            *   Enforce proper authentication for all API endpoints *provided by Gogs*.
            *   Implement granular authorization controls *within Gogs' API* to restrict access based on user roles and permissions.
            *   Follow secure API development best practices (e.g., input validation, rate limiting) *in the Gogs API implementation*.
