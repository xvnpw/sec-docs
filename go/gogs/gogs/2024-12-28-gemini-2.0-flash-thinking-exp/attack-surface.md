*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Gogs Contributes:** Gogs renders user-provided content like issue descriptions, comments, pull request descriptions, and repository names, often using Markdown. If this rendering isn't properly sanitized, malicious scripts can be embedded.
    *   **Example:** A user includes a `<script>` tag in an issue description that steals session cookies of other users viewing the issue.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided content rendered in the web interface. Utilize context-aware escaping techniques. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

*   **Git Command Injection**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting Gogs by manipulating input that is used to construct Git commands.
    *   **How Gogs Contributes:** Gogs interacts with the Git binary to perform various operations (clone, push, pull, etc.). If user-provided input (e.g., repository names, branch names, commit messages in certain contexts) is not properly sanitized before being passed to Git commands, it can lead to command injection.
    *   **Example:** A malicious user creates a repository with a name containing shell metacharacters that, when processed by Gogs in a Git command, executes arbitrary system commands.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid constructing Git commands directly from user input. Use parameterized commands or libraries that provide safe abstractions for interacting with Git. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in Git operations. Employ least privilege principles for the Gogs process.

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Webhooks**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can induce the Gogs server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.
    *   **How Gogs Contributes:** Gogs allows users to configure webhooks that trigger HTTP requests to specified URLs when certain events occur. If the webhook URL is controlled by an attacker, they can make the Gogs server interact with internal services or external resources.
    *   **Example:** An attacker configures a webhook to target an internal service not exposed to the public internet, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or triggering actions within that service.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, denial of service of internal services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of webhook URLs. Consider using an allow-list of allowed destination domains or IP ranges. Implement proper network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF. Consider requiring authentication for webhook endpoints.

*   **Authentication and Authorization Flaws**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Gogs verifies user identity and manages access permissions.
    *   **How Gogs Contributes:** Gogs implements its own authentication mechanisms (local accounts, OAuth, etc.) and authorization rules for accessing repositories and features. Flaws in these implementations can allow unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the password reset mechanism allows an attacker to reset another user's password. A flaw in permission checks allows a user to access or modify repositories they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to repositories, data breaches, account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Follow secure coding practices for authentication and authorization. Enforce strong password policies. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). Regularly review and audit the authentication and authorization logic. Ensure proper session management and prevent session fixation or hijacking.

*   **Path Traversal via Repository Import/Export or File Handling**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can access files or directories outside of the intended scope on the server.
    *   **How Gogs Contributes:** Gogs handles repository imports and exports, potentially involving the processing of archive files (e.g., zip, tar). If not properly validated, filenames within these archives could be manipulated to access files outside the intended repository directory.
    *   **Example:** A malicious user crafts a repository archive with filenames like `../../../../etc/passwd` that, when imported by Gogs, could potentially expose sensitive system files.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, potential for arbitrary code execution if write access is gained.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of filenames during import/export operations. Use secure file extraction methods that prevent path traversal. Enforce proper access controls on the file system.
