# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gogs/gogs

## Mitigation Strategy: [app.ini Hardening and Secure Configuration (Gogs-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/app_ini_hardening_and_secure_configuration__gogs-specific_.md)

*   **1. Mitigation Strategy:**  `app.ini` Hardening and Secure Configuration (Gogs-Specific)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Access `app.ini`:** Locate the `app.ini` configuration file for your Gogs installation (usually in `custom/conf`).
        2.  **`RUN_USER`:**  In `app.ini`, set `RUN_USER` to a dedicated, non-root system user with minimal privileges.
        3.  **`SECRET_KEY`:** Generate a strong, random key (e.g., `openssl rand -base64 32`). Set `SECRET_KEY` to this value.
        4.  **Repository Root:** Ensure `[repository] ROOT` points to a directory *outside* the web server's document root.
        5.  **Disable Push Creation:** Set `ENABLE_PUSH_CREATE_ORG = false` and `ENABLE_PUSH_CREATE_USER = false` unless absolutely required.
        6.  **Mailer Security:** If using a mailer (`[mailer]` section), configure it with TLS/SSL and authentication. Prefer environment variables or a secrets manager for credentials.
        7.  **`INSTALL_LOCK`:** After installation, set `INSTALL_LOCK = true` in the `[security]` section.
        8.  **Login Settings:** Adjust `LOGIN_REMEMBER_DAYS` to a reasonable value (e.g., 7). Consider changing `COOKIE_USERNAME` and `COOKIE_REMEMBER_NAME`.
        9.  **Registration Control:** If user registration isn't needed, set `DISABLE_REGISTRATION = true` in the `[service]` section.
        10. **Require Sign-In:** Set `REQUIRE_SIGNIN_VIEW = true` to force login for all views.
        11. **CAPTCHA:** Enable CAPTCHA (`ENABLE_CAPTCHA = true`) for registration and potentially other actions.
        12. **Webhook Restrictions:** In `[webhook]`, set `ALLOWED_HOST_LIST` to specific IP addresses or CIDR ranges (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`). Set `SKIP_TLS_VERIFY = false`.
        13. **Organization Creation:** Consider setting `DISABLE_REGULAR_ORG_CREATION = true` in `[admin]`.
        14. **Logging:** Configure `[log]` with appropriate levels (e.g., `info`) and a secure log location.
        15. **Restart Gogs:** Restart the Gogs service for changes to take effect.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: Critical):** `RUN_USER` setting.
        *   **Session Hijacking (Severity: High):** Strong `SECRET_KEY`.
        *   **Unauthorized Repository Access (Severity: High):** `ROOT` setting.
        *   **Account Creation Abuse (Severity: Medium):** `ENABLE_PUSH_CREATE_*` settings.
        *   **Email Spoofing/Relaying (Severity: Medium):** Secure `[mailer]` configuration.
        *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes (Severity: High):** `INSTALL_LOCK`.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: Medium):** CAPTCHA and login settings.
        *   **Internal Network Scanning/Attacks (Severity: High):** `ALLOWED_HOST_LIST`.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Low-Medium):** `REQUIRE_SIGNIN_VIEW`.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Proper logging and configuration.

    *   **Impact:** (Same as before, but focused on the Gogs-specific aspects)
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced significantly.
        *   **Session Hijacking:** Risk reduced significantly.
        *   **Unauthorized Repository Access:** Risk reduced significantly.
        *   **Account Creation Abuse:** Risk reduced significantly.
        *   **Email Spoofing/Relaying:** Risk reduced significantly.
        *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Risk reduced significantly.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Internal Network Scanning/Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates and Patching (of Gogs)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_and_patching__of_gogs_.md)

*   **2. Mitigation Strategy:**  Regular Updates and Patching (of Gogs)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Monitor for Updates:** Subscribe to Gogs communications (mailing list, GitHub, website) for new releases and security advisories.
        2.  **Test Updates:** Test new Gogs releases in a non-production environment *before* deploying to production.
        3.  **Backup:** Back up your Gogs data (database and repositories) before applying any updates.
        4.  **Apply Updates:** Follow the official Gogs update instructions.
        5.  **Verify:** After updating, verify Gogs functionality and check for regressions.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable, often High or Critical):**  Updates patch security vulnerabilities within Gogs itself.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced significantly (assuming timely patching).

    *   **Currently Implemented:** [Placeholder]

    *   **Missing Implementation:** [Placeholder]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) within Gogs](./mitigation_strategies/two-factor_authentication__2fa__within_gogs.md)

*   **3. Mitigation Strategy:**  Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) within Gogs

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Enable 2FA in Gogs:** Ensure 2FA is enabled in the Gogs configuration (it should be by default).
        2.  **User Education:** Educate users on enabling 2FA in their *Gogs account settings*.
        3.  **Enforcement (Optional):** Consider enforcing 2FA for all users or specific groups (e.g., administrators) within Gogs. This might require custom development or a plugin *if Gogs itself doesn't offer direct enforcement*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Account Takeover (Severity: High):** 2FA within Gogs protects Gogs accounts.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Account Takeover:** Risk reduced significantly.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** [Placeholder]

    *   **Missing Implementation:** [Placeholder]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Webhook Secret Tokens (within Gogs)](./mitigation_strategies/webhook_secret_tokens__within_gogs_.md)

*   **4. Mitigation Strategy:**  Webhook Secret Tokens (within Gogs)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Configure Secret Tokens:** Within the Gogs webhook configuration for *each* webhook, set a strong, unique secret token.
        2.  **Receiver-Side Validation:** (This part is *external* to Gogs, but essential) The webhook receiver *must* validate this secret token to verify the authenticity of the request.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Webhook Forgery (Severity: High):** Secret tokens, *when validated by the receiver*, prevent attackers from sending fake webhook requests to your systems.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Webhook Forgery:** Risk reduced significantly (when combined with receiver-side validation).

    *   **Currently Implemented:** [Placeholder]

    *   **Missing Implementation:** [Placeholder]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unused Features (within Gogs)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unused_features__within_gogs_.md)

* **5. Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unused Features (within Gogs)

    * **Description:**
        1. **Identify Unused Features:** Review the Gogs feature set and identify any features that are not being used by your organization. Examples might include:
            *   The "Explore" page (if all repositories are private).
            *   Specific authentication methods (e.g., LDAP if you only use local accounts).
            *   Webhooks (if you don't use any external integrations).
            *   Issue tracking (if you use a separate issue tracker).
        2. **Disable in Configuration:** Use the `app.ini` file or other relevant configuration mechanisms to disable the unused features. Refer to the Gogs documentation for specific configuration options.
        3. **Test:** After disabling features, thoroughly test Gogs to ensure that the remaining functionality works as expected.

    * **Threats Mitigated:**
        * **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Unused Features (Severity: Variable):** Disabling unused features reduces the attack surface by removing potential entry points for attackers.

    * **Impact:**
        * **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Unused Features:** Risk reduced (from Variable to Low or Negligible, depending on the feature).

    * **Currently Implemented:** [Placeholder - e.g., "We haven't explicitly disabled any unused features."]

    * **Missing Implementation:** [Placeholder - e.g., "We need to review the Gogs feature set and disable any features that are not being used. We should start by disabling the Explore page since all our repositories are private."]
