## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Gogs Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_gogs_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1 RCE (Remote Code Execution) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Gogs codebase to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is the most severe type of vulnerability.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **1.1.1 CVE-XXXX (Unpatched/Zero-Day) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  Exploiting a *newly discovered* or *unpatched* RCE vulnerability.  "CVE-XXXX" is a placeholder for a real CVE identifier.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete system compromise)
            *   **Effort:** High to Very High
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard
        *   **1.1.2 CVE-YYYY (Patched, but system unpatched) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** Exploiting a *known and patched* RCE vulnerability on a system that hasn't been updated.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete system compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leverage Weak Configuration [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__leverage_weak_configuration__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Default/Weak Admin Credentials [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  Gaining administrative access by exploiting weak or default passwords.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **2.1.1 Brute-Force**
            *   **Description:**  Repeatedly guessing the administrator password.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Administrative access)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Beginner
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
        *   **2.1.2 Credential Stuffing**
            *   **Description:** Using credentials stolen from other breaches, hoping the administrator reused the same password.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
            *   **Impact:** High (Administrative access)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Beginner
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **2.1.3 Default Credentials (admin/admin) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  Trying the default administrator credentials (e.g., "admin/admin").
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** High (Administrative access)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
*  **2.2 Exposed Services/APIs**
    *    **2.2.1 Unauthenticated API Access (e.g., /api/v1/...) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Accessing Gogs API endpoints that should require authentication but are mistakenly exposed without it.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Data leakage, potential modification, or even code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Social Engineering/Credential Stuffing [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__social_engineeringcredential_stuffing__high_risk_.md)

*   **3.1 Phishing for Gogs Credentials**
    *   **Description:** Tricking users into revealing their Gogs credentials through deceptive emails or websites that mimic legitimate Gogs interfaces or notifications.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High (Compromised user accounts, potential access to repositories)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
