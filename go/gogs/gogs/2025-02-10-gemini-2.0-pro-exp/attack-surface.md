# Attack Surface Analysis for gogs/gogs

## Attack Surface: [Git Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/git_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Gogs interacts with the underlying Git system to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **How Gogs Contributes:** Gogs directly executes Git commands based on user actions (creating repositories, branches, commits, etc.). Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input is the root cause. This is a *direct* consequence of Gogs' core functionality.
*   **Example:**  A user creates a branch named `;'$(echo "Vulnerable" > /tmp/pwned);'` If Gogs doesn't properly escape the semicolon and shell metacharacters, the command `echo "Vulnerable" > /tmp/pwned` will be executed on the server.
*   **Impact:**  Complete server compromise. An attacker could gain full control of the Gogs server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement *extremely* rigorous input validation for *all* user-supplied data used in Git commands. Use a whitelist approach.
    *   **Parameterization/Escaping:** Use parameterized Git commands or carefully escape user input. Avoid string concatenation.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the Gogs process with the *lowest possible privileges*. Do *not* run Gogs as root.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular code reviews and penetration testing specifically targeting this.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass / Weak Authentication (Specifically Gogs' Implementation)](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass__weak_authentication__specifically_gogs'_implementation_.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing Gogs' *own* authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access, or exploiting weaknesses in Gogs' specific authentication handling.  This excludes general weaknesses like weak user passwords (which are a user responsibility), and focuses on flaws *within Gogs*.
*   **How Gogs Contributes:** Gogs provides its own authentication system. Flaws in *this system's code*, or in how Gogs handles session management, are the direct vulnerabilities. This is distinct from simply having weak user passwords.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Session fixation:** If Gogs does *not* regenerate session IDs after login, an attacker can hijack a session. This is a Gogs implementation flaw.
    *   **Improper 2FA handling:** If Gogs has a bug that allows bypassing its 2FA implementation, this is a direct vulnerability.
    *   **Account enumeration via Gogs' error messages:** If Gogs' login or password reset reveals whether a username exists, this is a Gogs-specific issue.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to repositories and user data. Potentially administrative access if the flaw affects admin accounts.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if administrative access is gained)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Session Management:**
        *   Use HTTPS for *all* communication.
        *   Set `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags on session cookies.
        *   Generate strong, random session IDs.
        *   *Regenerate session IDs after successful login.* (Crucial for preventing fixation).
        *   Implement proper session expiration.
    *   **Robust 2FA Implementation:** Ensure Gogs' 2FA (if used) is implemented securely and cannot be bypassed.
    *   **Generic Error Messages:** Gogs should return generic error messages on login/password reset failures to prevent account enumeration.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review Gogs' authentication and session management code.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Flaws (Privilege Escalation within Gogs)](./attack_surfaces/authorization_flaws__privilege_escalation_within_gogs_.md)

*   **Description:** A user with limited privileges exploiting a vulnerability *within Gogs' authorization logic* to gain higher privileges or access resources they shouldn't.
*   **How Gogs Contributes:** Gogs *implements* the authorization rules that determine which users can access which repositories and features. Bugs in *this Gogs code* are the direct cause.
*   **Example:** A user with read-only access to a repository discovers a way (through a Gogs bug) to modify files or create new branches. This is a failure of Gogs' authorization enforcement.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of repositories, or even control over the Gogs instance.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure users have only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Thorough Access Control Testing:** Extensively test *all* of Gogs' access control mechanisms. Test with different user roles.
    *   **Code Review:** Carefully review Gogs' code related to authorization and access control.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal (within Gogs' File Handling)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal__within_gogs'_file_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** Manipulating file paths *within Gogs' handling of repository files* to access files outside the intended directory.
*   **How Gogs Contributes:** Gogs handles file operations within repositories. Insufficient validation of file paths *within Gogs' code* is the direct vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a file with a name like `../../../../etc/passwd` *through Gogs' interface*, and Gogs fails to prevent this, allowing access to the system's password file.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive files), potentially code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate *all* user-supplied file paths *within Gogs*. Do *not* allow `..` or other path traversal sequences.
    *   **Normalization:** Normalize file paths before using them within Gogs.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run Gogs with minimal file system permissions.
