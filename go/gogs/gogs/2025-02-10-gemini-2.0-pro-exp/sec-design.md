# BUSINESS POSTURE

Gogs is a self-hosted Git service, similar to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. It aims to provide an easy, stable, and extensible way for individuals or organizations to host their own Git repositories.

Business Priorities:

*   Provide a reliable and stable self-hosted Git service.
*   Ensure ease of installation and maintenance.
*   Offer an extensible platform for customization.
*   Enable users to manage their repositories, users, and organizations.
*   Provide a lightweight alternative to heavier Git hosting solutions.

Business Goals:

*   Attract users looking for a simple, self-hosted Git solution.
*   Maintain a vibrant open-source community.
*   Provide a viable alternative to commercial Git hosting platforms.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches leading to unauthorized access to source code.
*   Service unavailability disrupting development workflows.
*   Data loss due to hardware failure, software bugs, or malicious attacks.
*   Vulnerabilities in the software allowing attackers to compromise the server.
*   Inability to scale to meet the demands of growing organizations.
*   Lack of features compared to commercial alternatives, hindering adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: User authentication via built-in forms, LDAP, or other providers. (Implemented in Gogs application logic).
*   security control: Basic access control features to manage repository permissions. (Implemented in Gogs application logic).
*   security control: SSH key management for secure Git operations. (Implemented in Gogs application logic and SSH server configuration).
*   security control: Webhooks for integration with external systems. (Implemented in Gogs application logic).
*   security control: Two-factor authentication (2FA) support. (Implemented in Gogs application logic).
*   security control: Reverse proxy support for SSL/TLS termination. (Described in Gogs documentation, implemented externally).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Limited auditing capabilities compared to enterprise-grade solutions.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on community support for security updates and vulnerability patching.
*   accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration by users leading to security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Limited built-in protection against DDoS attacks.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement comprehensive audit logging to track user actions and system events.
*   Integrate with intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
*   Provide regular security training and documentation for users.
*   Implement rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks and DDoS attempts.
*   Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
*   Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure that fetched resources haven't been tampered with.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support strong password policies.
    *   Enforce two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users, or at least for administrative accounts.
    *   Provide options for integrating with external identity providers (e.g., SAML, OAuth).
    *   Implement account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   Authorization:
    *   Implement granular access control at the repository, branch, and potentially file level.
    *   Support role-based access control (RBAC) with predefined roles (e.g., admin, contributor, reader).
    *   Allow administrators to define custom roles and permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Sanitize all user inputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   Validate all data received from external sources (e.g., webhooks).
    *   Implement appropriate escaping and encoding to prevent injection attacks.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for storing passwords (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt).
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication between clients and the server.
    *   Use secure protocols for Git operations (e.g., SSH with strong key exchange algorithms).
    *   Provide options for encrypting data at rest (e.g., repository encryption).

## BUILD

The Gogs build process typically involves the following steps:

1.  Developer: A developer writes code and pushes changes to a Git repository (e.g., the official Gogs repository on GitHub).
2.  Continuous Integration (CI) System: A CI system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI, Jenkins) detects the changes and triggers a build.
3.  Build Environment: The CI system sets up a build environment (e.g., a Docker container) with the necessary tools (Go compiler, Git).
4.  Dependency Management: The build process fetches project dependencies (Go modules).
5.  Compilation: The Go compiler compiles the source code into an executable binary.
6.  Testing: Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) are executed.
7.  Static Analysis: Static analysis tools (e.g., linters, security scanners) are run to identify potential code quality and security issues. Example: `gosec`.
8.  Artifact Creation: The build process creates build artifacts (e.g., the Gogs executable, Docker images).
9.  Artifact Storage: The build artifacts are stored in a repository (e.g., Docker Hub, a private registry).

```mermaid
graph LR

    BuildEnvironment -- Run tests --> BuildEnvironment
    BuildEnvironment -- Run static analysis --> BuildEnvironment
    BuildEnvironment -- Create artifacts --> BuildEnvironment
    BuildEnvironment -- Store artifacts --> ArtifactRepository
```

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Supply Chain Security: Use dependency management tools to track and verify dependencies. Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   Build Automation: Use a CI system to automate the build process, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
*   Security Checks: Integrate static analysis tools (SAST) and linters into the build process to identify potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
*   Least Privilege: Run the build process with minimal privileges.
*   Reproducible Builds: Ensure that the build process is reproducible, producing the same artifacts from the same source code.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Source code management and version control.
*   Collaboration among developers.
*   Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines (if integrated with Gogs).

Data to Protect:

*   Source code (High sensitivity): This is the core intellectual property of many organizations.
*   User credentials (High sensitivity): Usernames, passwords, SSH keys, API tokens.
*   Repository metadata (Medium sensitivity): Information about repositories, branches, commits.
*   Organization and team data (Medium sensitivity): Information about organizations, teams, and user memberships.
*   Configuration data (Medium sensitivity): Gogs configuration settings.
*   Audit logs (Medium sensitivity): Records of user actions and system events.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What is the expected number of users and repositories? This will impact scalability requirements.
*   What are the specific compliance requirements (if any)? (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
*   What are the existing infrastructure and security policies of the organization?
*   What is the level of expertise of the team managing the Gogs instance?
*   Are there any specific integration requirements with other systems?
*   What is the backup and disaster recovery plan?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The organization has a need for a self-hosted Git solution and is willing to accept the responsibilities of managing their own infrastructure.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The organization has a basic understanding of security best practices and is willing to implement necessary security controls.
*   DESIGN: The Gogs instance will be deployed using Docker containers, with a separate container for the database. A reverse proxy will be used for SSL/TLS termination. The build process will be automated using a CI system.
