# Threat Model Analysis for gogs/gogs

## Threat: [Weak Webhook Secret Leading to Forged Webhook Requests](./threats/weak_webhook_secret_leading_to_forged_webhook_requests.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers or guesses the webhook secret used for a Gogs repository. They craft malicious webhook requests that mimic legitimate events (e.g., a push). These forged requests trigger unintended actions in integrated systems, such as deploying malicious code, deleting resources, or triggering other harmful workflows. This is a *direct* threat to Gogs because Gogs is responsible for generating and managing the webhook secret and sending the signed requests.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise of CI/CD pipelines.
    *   Unauthorized deployment of malicious code.
    *   Data breaches or data loss.
    *   System disruption.
*   **Affected Gogs Component:**
    *   `modules/webhook` (handles webhook processing and validation).
    *   `routers/repo/hook.go` (handles webhook routing and event handling).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Secrets:** *Always* use a strong, randomly generated webhook secret. Gogs should provide a mechanism for generating these. The receiving system *must* verify the `X-Gogs-Signature`.
    *   **IP Whitelisting:** If possible, restrict webhook source IP addresses.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Repository Permissions Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/misconfigured_repository_permissions_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** Repository permissions *within Gogs* are set too broadly (e.g., "public" access when it should be private, or overly permissive write access). An unauthorized user can view, modify, or delete repository content. This is a *direct* threat because Gogs is the system enforcing these permissions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive code or data.
    *   Unauthorized code modifications.
    *   Repository deletion.
*   **Affected Gogs Component:**
    *   `modules/auth` (handles authorization checks).
    *   `modules/repo` (repository access control).
    *   Database tables related to permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the *minimum* necessary permissions.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review and audit repository permissions.
    *   **Protected Branches:** Use Gogs's protected branch feature.

## Threat: [Weak Gogs Administrator Password Leading to Complete System Compromise](./threats/weak_gogs_administrator_password_leading_to_complete_system_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** The Gogs *administrator account* has a weak password. An attacker gains access and can modify Gogs's configuration, create new administrator accounts, disable security features, or access all repositories. This is a *direct* threat because it targets the Gogs administrative interface.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete compromise of the Gogs instance.
    *   Access to all repositories and user data.
    *   Potential for data exfiltration or destruction.
*   **Affected Gogs Component:**
    *   `modules/auth` (administrator authentication).
    *   `routers/admin` (administrator interface routing).
    *   Database tables related to user accounts.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Password:** Enforce a strong, unique password.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** *Require* MFA for the administrator account.
    *   **Access Restriction:** Restrict access to the administration interface.

## Threat: [Unpatched Gogs Vulnerability Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/unpatched_gogs_vulnerability_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** A security vulnerability exists in a *specific version of Gogs* (e.g., a buffer overflow). An attacker exploits this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the Gogs server. This is a *direct* threat because it's a flaw in Gogs's code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete system compromise.
    *   Data exfiltration or destruction.
    *   Potential for lateral movement.
*   **Affected Gogs Component:**
    *   Could be *any* component, depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Patching:** *Keep Gogs up to date with the latest security patches.* This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the Gogs instance.

## Threat: [Direct Database Access Leading to Data Tampering (If Database is Exposed)](./threats/direct_database_access_leading_to_data_tampering__if_database_is_exposed_.md)

*   **Description:** The database used by Gogs is *directly accessible* from the network. An attacker bypasses Gogs and directly modifies the database. While the *exposure* is a configuration issue, the *impact* is directly on Gogs's data, making it relevant here.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data corruption or loss.
    *   Unauthorized modification of user accounts and permissions.
    *   Potential for complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Gogs Component:**
    *   The database itself (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
    *   Gogs's database connection configuration (`conf/app.ini`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** *Never* expose the database directly to the internet.
    *   **Strong Database Credentials:** Use strong passwords.
    *   **Localhost Binding:** Configure the database to listen only on `localhost`.
