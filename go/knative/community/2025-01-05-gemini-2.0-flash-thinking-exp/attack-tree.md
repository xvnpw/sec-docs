## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Knative Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_knative_components.md)

Attackers target weaknesses in the software code, configurations, or extensions that make up the Knative platform. These vulnerabilities could be introduced by community contributions or exist in third-party dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Vulnerabilities Introduced by Community Contributions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_community_contributions.md)

Attackers focus on flaws in the source code of Knative itself, potentially introduced by community members. This includes:
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Core Knative Code:** Targeting vulnerabilities directly within the main codebase of Knative.
            * **Exploit Identified Vulnerability:** Taking advantage of a known or newly discovered flaw.
                * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The attacker's goal is to execute arbitrary commands on the system running Knative, gaining significant control.
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Knative Dependencies Introduced by Community:** Targeting flaws in external libraries or components that Knative relies on, where the introduction or update of these dependencies was influenced by community decisions.
            * **Exploit Identified Dependency Vulnerability:** Exploiting a known vulnerability in a dependency.
                * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Similar to core code exploitation, but the vulnerability lies in a dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities Introduced by Community Examples/Docs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_community_examplesdocs.md)

Attackers exploit insecure default settings or configurations suggested in community examples or documentation that users might implement directly.
        * **Exploit Insecure Configuration:** Taking advantage of a weak or flawed setup.
            * **Unauthorized Access to Resources:** Gaining access to resources or functionalities that should be restricted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Community-Developed Extensions/Add-ons](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_community-developed_extensionsadd-ons.md)

Attackers target security weaknesses in extensions or add-ons created by the Knative community, which might not have the same level of scrutiny as the core project.
        * **Exploit Identified Extension/Add-on Vulnerability:** Exploiting a flaw in a community-developed extension.
            * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Gaining code execution through a vulnerable extension.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Supply Chain Attacks Through Community Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_supply_chain_attacks_through_community_infrastructure.md)

Attackers aim to compromise the processes and infrastructure used to build, test, and distribute Knative, injecting malicious code or components.
        * **Compromise Release Process:** Targeting the steps involved in creating and publishing Knative releases.
            * **Gain Access to Release Infrastructure:** Obtaining unauthorized access to the systems used for building and releasing Knative.
                * **Compromise Maintainer Accounts:** Taking over the accounts of individuals responsible for managing the release process.
            * **Inject Malicious Code into Release Artifacts:** Inserting malicious code into the official Knative releases, affecting all users.
        * **Compromise Dependency Management:** Manipulating the way Knative manages its dependencies.
            * **Introduce Malicious Dependencies:** Adding harmful libraries or components to the project's dependencies.
            * **Modify Existing Dependency Definitions to Point to Malicious Sources:** Changing the locations from which dependencies are downloaded to point to attacker-controlled servers hosting malicious versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering/Account Compromise of Community Members](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineeringaccount_compromise_of_community_members.md)

Attackers manipulate or deceive community members to gain access to their accounts or influence project decisions.
        * **Target Core Maintainers:** Focusing on individuals with significant privileges and control over the project.
            * **Phishing Attacks:** Using deceptive emails or messages to trick maintainers into revealing credentials.
            * **Credential Stuffing:** Using lists of compromised usernames and passwords from other breaches to try and access maintainer accounts.
        * **Target Contributors with Significant Privileges:** Targeting contributors who have write access to repositories or influence over code merges.
            * **Gain Access to Code Repositories:** Obtaining unauthorized access to the source code repositories, allowing for the introduction of malicious code.
