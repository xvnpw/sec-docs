# Attack Surface Analysis for knative/community

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection via Pull Requests](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_via_pull_requests.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious actor submits a pull request containing intentionally vulnerable code (e.g., backdoors, exploits).
    *   **How Community Contributes to Attack Surface:** The open nature of the community allows anyone to propose code changes. Reliance on community code increases the potential for malicious contributions.
    *   **Example:** A pull request introduces a seemingly innocuous feature but includes a hidden backdoor that allows remote code execution when a specific condition is met.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, data breaches, unauthorized access, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mandatory and rigorous code review processes by multiple trusted maintainers.
        *   Utilize automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) on all proposed code changes.
        *   Require contributors to sign off on their contributions (Developer Certificate of Origin - DCO).
        *   Maintain a clear and well-defined contribution policy with security guidelines.
        *   Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in contributions.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks through Community-Introduced Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_through_community-introduced_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** A pull request introduces a dependency on a compromised or malicious third-party library.
    *   **How Community Contributes to Attack Surface:** Community contributions often involve adding or updating dependencies. Lack of thorough vetting of these dependencies can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A pull request adds a dependency on a library that has been compromised and now contains malware that exfiltrates sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities into the application, data breaches, compromised application functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all dependencies.
        *   Implement dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known security flaws.
        *   Pin dependency versions to avoid unexpected updates introducing vulnerabilities.
        *   Favor dependencies with strong security track records and active maintenance.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Community-Developed Tools](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_community-developed_tools.md)

*   **Description:** The community develops and provides tools for interacting with Knative that contain security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Community Contributes to Attack Surface:** Community-developed tools, while beneficial, might not undergo the same rigorous security testing as core Knative components.
    *   **Example:** A community-developed CLI tool for managing Knative services has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to gain control of the cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the Knative environment, unauthorized access to resources, potential data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat community-developed tools with caution and perform independent security assessments before widespread use.
        *   Encourage security audits and vulnerability disclosure programs for community tools.
        *   Document the security status and known limitations of community tools.
        *   Consider using only officially supported and vetted tools where possible.
