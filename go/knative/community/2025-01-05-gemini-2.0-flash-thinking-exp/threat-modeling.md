# Threat Model Analysis for knative/community

## Threat: [Compromised Maintainer Account](./threats/compromised_maintainer_account.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Maintainer Account
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the account of a Knative project maintainer within the `github.com/knative/community` repository. This allows the attacker to modify governance documents, contribution guidelines, security policies, or other crucial information within the repository, potentially weakening the security posture of the entire Knative project. They could use compromised credentials or social engineering targeting maintainers.
    *   **Impact:** Undermining the project's security foundations, manipulating community processes, potentially leading to the acceptance of malicious contributions in other Knative repositories, spreading misinformation about security practices.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `github.com/knative/community` repository itself, specifically its files related to governance, security policies, and maintainer responsibilities (e.g., `OWNERS` files, security documentation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintainers should enforce strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) on their GitHub accounts.
        *   Regularly audit maintainer access and permissions to the `github.com/knative/community` repository.
        *   Implement controls to track and review changes made to critical governance and security documents.
        *   Community should have clear procedures for reporting and handling suspected account compromises within the `github.com/knative/community` repository.

## Threat: [Backdoor Introduced Through Manipulated Contribution Process](./threats/backdoor_introduced_through_manipulated_contribution_process.md)

*   **Threat:** Backdoor Introduced Through Manipulated Contribution Process
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in the contribution process defined within `github.com/knative/community` to introduce a backdoor or vulnerability into the wider Knative ecosystem. This could involve subtly altering contribution guidelines, influencing code review processes documented in the repository, or exploiting ambiguities in the established workflow to sneak in malicious changes to other Knative repositories.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of exploitable code into core Knative components, potentially affecting numerous applications relying on Knative, undermining trust in the community's contribution process.
    *   **Affected Component:** The contribution guidelines and processes documented within the `github.com/knative/community` repository (e.g., pull request templates, contribution workflows).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly review and strengthen the contribution guidelines and code review processes documented in `github.com/knative/community`.
        *   Enforce strict adherence to the defined contribution workflows.
        *   Implement automated checks and security scans as part of the contribution process.
        *   Educate community members on secure contribution practices and the importance of following established guidelines.

## Threat: [Social Engineering of Maintainers Based on Community Trust](./threats/social_engineering_of_maintainers_based_on_community_trust.md)

*   **Threat:** Social Engineering of Maintainers Based on Community Trust
    *   **Description:** An attacker builds trust and rapport with maintainers through interactions within the `github.com/knative/community` repository (e.g., participating in discussions, contributing to documentation). They then leverage this trust to persuade maintainers to accept malicious contributions in other Knative repositories or to make changes that weaken the project's security.
    *   **Impact:** Acceptance of malicious code, weakening of security controls, potential compromise of Knative components and applications using them.
    *   **Affected Component:** The social interactions and trust dynamics fostered within the `github.com/knative/community` repository and its associated communication channels (linked from the repository).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintainers should be aware of the potential for social engineering and exercise caution even with familiar community members.
        *   Emphasize objective code review and security analysis over reliance on personal trust.
        *   Encourage a culture of healthy skepticism and independent verification of contributions, regardless of the contributor's reputation.
        *   Clearly define and enforce security review processes that are difficult to bypass through social influence.
