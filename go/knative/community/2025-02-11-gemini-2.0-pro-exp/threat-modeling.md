# Threat Model Analysis for knative/community

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Compromised Serving Controller (from Community Repository)](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_compromised_serving_controller__from_community_repository_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the Knative Serving controller *within the community repository* (e.g., through a compromised contributor account or a supply chain attack on a Knative dependency) and injects malicious code.  If we pull this compromised version, our deployments will be compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of Knative Services, potential data exfiltration, lateral movement within the Kubernetes cluster, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Knative Serving Controller (`controller` component, specifically, as distributed by the community).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Knative Serving updated to the latest *verified* patched version (verify checksums/signatures if available).
        *   Implement strict Kubernetes RBAC to limit the Serving controller's permissions (even if compromised, limit the blast radius).
        *   Use network policies to restrict network access to the Serving controller.
        *   Employ runtime security monitoring to detect anomalous behavior within the controller.
        *   Regularly audit the Serving controller's configuration and dependencies *after* pulling from the community.
        *   Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool *before* deploying any community-provided code.
        *   Pin dependencies to specific, verified commits, and *audit those commits*.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Autoscaler Manipulation (Vulnerability in Community Code)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_autoscaler_manipulation__vulnerability_in_community_code_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within the Knative Pod Autoscaler (KPA) code itself, as distributed by the community*. This vulnerability could allow for excessive scaling, resource exhaustion, or prevention of scaling, leading to a denial of service. This is distinct from misconfiguration; it's a flaw in the community-provided code.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for Knative Services, increased infrastructure costs, potential cluster instability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Knative Serving Autoscaler (KPA, `autoscaler` component, as distributed by the community).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Knative Serving updated to the latest *verified* patched version.
        *   Carefully configure KPA parameters (minScale, maxScale, concurrency targets) with appropriate limits (this mitigates the *impact* of a vulnerability, but doesn't prevent it).
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for KPA metrics.
        *   Use Kubernetes resource quotas (again, mitigates impact).
        *   Regularly review and audit KPA configurations *and source code* if building from source.
        *   Actively monitor Knative security advisories and community discussions for vulnerability disclosures.

## Threat: [Event Spoofing in Eventing Broker (Vulnerability in Community Code)](./threats/event_spoofing_in_eventing_broker__vulnerability_in_community_code_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within the Knative Eventing Broker code itself (as provided by the community)* to inject forged events. This is distinct from misconfiguration; it's a flaw in the community-provided code that allows for event spoofing.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions triggered by events, potential for privilege escalation, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Knative Eventing Broker (specific broker implementation, e.g., InMemoryChannel, Kafka Broker, *as distributed by the community*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Knative Eventing updated to the latest *verified* patched version.
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for event producers and consumers (this helps, but a vulnerability in the broker itself could bypass this).
        *   Use event filtering and validation (again, helps mitigate the *impact*).
        *   Consider using a secure eventing broker implementation (e.g., Kafka with TLS and authentication).
        *   Monitor eventing logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Implement input validation in event consumers (defense in depth).
        *   Actively monitor Knative security advisories.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attack on Knative Build Templates (Community-Provided Templates)](./threats/dependency_confusion_attack_on_knative_build_templates__community-provided_templates_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name as a private dependency used in a Knative build template *provided by the community*. If we use this template and our build system is misconfigured, it might pull the malicious package. This directly targets the community-provided build resources.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious code during the build process, potential compromise of built Knative components.
    *   **Affected Component:** Knative build templates (any template using external dependencies, *as provided by the community*), our build system configuration (but the vulnerability originates in the community template).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a private package registry for all internal dependencies.
        *   Configure the build system to *only* pull dependencies from the private registry.
        *   Use explicit version pinning for all dependencies *within the community-provided templates*.
        *   Implement dependency verification (e.g., checksums, signatures) *for all dependencies pulled during the build*.
        *   Regularly audit build templates and dependencies *before using them*.
        *   Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool *on the build templates themselves*.
