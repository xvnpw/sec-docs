# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for knative/community

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mandatory Code Reviews with Multiple Approvers (Community-Focused Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/mandatory_code_reviews_with_multiple_approvers__community-focused_aspects_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Community Reviewers:** Actively encourage and recruit community members (beyond core maintainers) to participate in code reviews.  This broadens the pool of reviewers and brings diverse perspectives.
2.  **CODEOWNERS for Community Engagement:**  Use `CODEOWNERS` not just for maintainers, but also to identify and involve knowledgeable community members in reviewing specific areas of the codebase.  This fosters ownership and expertise within the community.
3.  **Public Review Discussions:**  Conduct code review discussions publicly on GitHub pull requests.  This allows for transparency and enables other community members to learn from the review process.
4.  **Reviewer Recognition:**  Acknowledge and appreciate the contributions of community reviewers (e.g., in release notes, community meetings).  This encourages continued participation.
5.  **Mentorship for Reviewers:**  Provide mentorship and guidance to new community reviewers to help them develop their skills and confidence.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection (High Severity):**  A larger, more diverse reviewer pool makes it harder for malicious actors to slip in harmful code.
    *   **Unintentional Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):**  More eyes on the code increase the chances of catching subtle bugs and vulnerabilities.
    *   **"Bus Factor" Reduction (Medium Severity):**  Distributes knowledge and review responsibility across a wider group, reducing reliance on a small number of core maintainers.

3.  **Public Key Sharing:**  Encourage contributors to publicly share their GPG public keys (e.g., on their GitHub profiles, keyservers).
4.  **Community-Based Reputation:**  Foster a culture where contributors build and maintain a positive reputation within the Knative community through consistent, high-quality contributions.  This reputation becomes a factor in assessing the trustworthiness of their code.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection (High Severity):**  Makes impersonation more difficult.
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):**  Provides protection if a contributor's account is compromised (assuming GPG keys are secure).
    *   **Sockpuppet Accounts (Medium Severity):**  Raises the bar for creating fake accounts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection:** Risk reduction: Medium.
    *   **Account Takeover:** Risk reduction: Medium to High.
    *   **Sockpuppet Accounts:** Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **GitHub Verification:** GitHub automatically verifies signatures.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Active Community Education:**  A strong, proactive campaign to educate the community about GPG signing.
    *   **Community Norm Enforcement:**  Making GPG signing a widely accepted and expected practice.
    *   **Public Key Sharing Encouragement:**  Actively promoting the sharing of public keys.
    *   **Formalized Reputation Building:** While informal reputation exists, a more structured approach could be beneficial.
