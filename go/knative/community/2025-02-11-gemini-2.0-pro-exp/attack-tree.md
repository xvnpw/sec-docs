## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Community-Contributed Documentation/Examples [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_community-contributed_documentationexamples__high-risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is a high-risk area because community-provided documentation and examples are often used as starting points for real-world deployments.  If these resources contain security vulnerabilities, they can be easily exploited by attackers.  The focus is on *unintentional* vulnerabilities introduced through oversight or lack of security awareness.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Insecure Configuration Examples {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_insecure_configuration_examples_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical node because it's the most direct way for attackers to exploit community resources.  Users often copy and paste example configurations without fully understanding the security implications.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **1.1.1 Weak Authentication/Authorization Settings [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   **Description:** Examples might include hardcoded credentials, weak default passwords, or overly permissive access control settings (e.g., using `cluster-admin` role unnecessarily).
            *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker finds an example with a hardcoded secret. They use this secret to access a user's Knative deployment that was based on the example.
            *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous review of examples, avoiding hardcoded credentials, using strong password policies, and enforcing least privilege.
        *   **1.1.2 Misconfigured Network Policies [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   **Description:** Example network policies might be too permissive, allowing unauthorized access between services or from external sources.
            *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker exploits an overly permissive ingress policy in an example to gain access to a sensitive service within a user's Knative deployment.
            *   **Mitigation:** Audit example network policies for least privilege, provide clear documentation on secure network configuration, and use network visualization tools.
        *   **1.1.4 Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies [HIGH-RISK] {CRITICAL}**
            *   **Description:** Example projects might include outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities.  Users who copy these projects inherit the vulnerabilities.
            *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker uses a publicly known exploit for a vulnerable dependency included in an example project to gain code execution within a user's Knative deployment.
            *   **Mitigation:** Regularly update dependencies, use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot), and clearly state supported dependency versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Community-Managed Infrastructure (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_community-managed_infrastructure__if_applicable_.md)

*   **3.1 Compromise of CI/CD Pipelines used for community resources {CRITICAL}**
    *   **Description:** This is a critical node because a compromised CI/CD pipeline could allow attackers to inject malicious code into official Knative releases or community-managed resources (e.g., documentation website, container images). This has a very high impact, as it affects all users.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline and modifies the build process to include a backdoor in a Knative component. This backdoor is then distributed to all users who update their Knative installation.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong access controls (least privilege, MFA), monitor pipeline activity for anomalies, regularly audit pipeline configurations, use signed artifacts, and employ infrastructure-as-code with security reviews.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Social Engineering Attacks Targeting Community Members](./attack_tree_paths/4__social_engineering_attacks_targeting_community_members.md)

*   **4.1 Phishing Attacks to Steal Credentials [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Phishing attacks are a common and effective way to steal credentials.  Attackers could target Knative community members to gain access to accounts with privileges to modify code, documentation, or infrastructure.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker sends a phishing email impersonating a Knative maintainer, requesting community members to log in to a fake website to update their account information.  The attacker then uses the stolen credentials to access the official Knative repository.
    *   **Mitigation:** Educate community members about phishing attacks, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all community accounts, use email filtering and security tools, and encourage reporting of suspicious emails.
