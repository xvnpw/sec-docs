# Attack Surface Analysis for knative/community

## Attack Surface: [1. Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Information](./attack_surfaces/1__accidental_exposure_of_sensitive_information.md)

*   **Description:**  Unintentional disclosure of secrets, credentials, internal infrastructure details, or pre-release vulnerability information within the repository's content (issues, PRs, documentation, discussions).
*   **How Community Contributes:**  Community members may inadvertently include sensitive data in bug reports, feature requests, example configurations, or troubleshooting discussions.  The open nature of the repository makes this information publicly accessible.
*   **Example:** A user posts a debugging log containing an API key or a database connection string to a public issue.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of Knative deployments, data breaches, unauthorized access to internal systems, or exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer/User Actions:**
        *   **Sanitize all data** before posting it publicly.  Remove any sensitive information (credentials, IPs, internal URLs, etc.).
        *   Use **private channels** (e.g., Knative Slack's security channel, direct messages) for discussing sensitive issues.
        *   **Review all contributions** carefully before submitting them.
    *   **Community/Maintainer Actions:**
        *   Implement and enforce **strict guidelines** on what information can be shared publicly.
        *   Use **automated scanning tools** (e.g., `git-secrets`, GitHub secret scanning) to detect and prevent accidental commits of secrets.
        *   Provide **security awareness training** to contributors.
        *   Maintain a clear **vulnerability disclosure process**.
        *   Regularly **audit** the repository content for sensitive information.

## Attack Surface: [2.  Insecure Example Configurations or Guidance](./attack_surfaces/2___insecure_example_configurations_or_guidance.md)

*   **Description:**  Example configurations, deployment guides, or tutorials within the repository that, if used without modification, lead to insecure deployments.
*   **How Community Contributes:**  Examples are often simplified for clarity, potentially omitting crucial security settings.  Community-contributed examples may not undergo rigorous security review.
*   **Example:**  An example Knative service configuration that disables authentication to make it easier to understand, but is then directly copied into a production environment.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to Knative services, data breaches, denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer/User Actions:**
        *   **Never use example configurations directly in production** without thorough review and customization.
        *   **Understand the security implications** of each configuration option.
    *   **Community/Maintainer Actions:**
        *   Provide **secure-by-default example configurations**.
        *   Clearly **label examples as "for demonstration only"** and not production-ready.
        *   Include **explicit warnings** about the security implications of disabling security features.
        *   Prioritize **security review** of example configurations.

## Attack Surface: [3.  Compromised Contributor Accounts](./attack_surfaces/3___compromised_contributor_accounts.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gaining control of a contributor's GitHub account and using it to inject malicious content into the repository (documentation, discussions, or linked resources).
*   **How Community Contributes:**  The risk is inherent in any open-source project with multiple contributors.  A larger community increases the number of potential targets.
*   **Example:**  An attacker compromises a contributor's account and modifies a documentation page to include a link to a phishing site or a malicious script.
*   **Impact:**  Users may be tricked into downloading malware, providing credentials, or following insecure instructions, leading to compromised systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer/User Actions:**
        *   **Be cautious of unexpected changes** or suspicious links in the repository.
        *   **Report any suspicious activity** to the Knative security team.
    *   **Community/Maintainer Actions:**
        *   **Require two-factor authentication (2FA)** for all contributors.
        *   Implement **branch protection rules** to prevent unauthorized changes to main branches.
        *   Regularly **audit commit history** for suspicious activity.
        *   Establish a process for **quickly responding to and recovering from** compromised accounts.
        *   Encourage contributors to use **strong, unique passwords**.
