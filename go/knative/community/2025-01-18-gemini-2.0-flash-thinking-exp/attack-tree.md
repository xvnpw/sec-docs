## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Code Injection Vulnerabilities in Controllers/Webhooks [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_code_injection_vulnerabilities_in_controllerswebhooks__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies and exploits vulnerabilities in the code of Knative Serving controllers or webhooks that allow for the injection of malicious code.
*   **Mechanism:** This could involve sending crafted HTTP requests with malicious payloads, manipulating resource configurations to inject code, or exploiting flaws in how user-provided data is processed.
*   **Outcome:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Knative controller, potentially gaining control over the entire Knative installation and the applications running on it.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Community Serving Extensions [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_community_serving_extensions__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  An attacker targets vulnerabilities present in community-developed extensions that enhance or integrate with Knative Serving.
*   **Mechanism:** These vulnerabilities could range from common web application flaws (if the extension exposes web interfaces) to issues specific to the extension's interaction with Knative internals. The attacker might exploit insecure API endpoints, lack of input validation, or insecure handling of data within the extension.
*   **Outcome:**  Successful exploitation can lead to code execution within the extension's context, potentially allowing the attacker to compromise the serving functionality or the applications utilizing the extension.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Introduce Malicious Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/3__introduce_malicious_dependencies.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker attempts to introduce malicious or compromised dependencies into the Knative project's dependency tree.
*   **Mechanism:** This could involve:
    *   **Social Engineering:** Convincing maintainers to include a malicious package.
    *   **Typosquatting:** Creating a package with a similar name to a legitimate dependency, hoping it will be mistakenly included.
    *   **Compromising an existing dependency:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in an upstream library that Knative depends on.
*   **Outcome:** If successful, the malicious dependency will be included in Knative builds and deployed with the application, allowing the attacker to execute code within the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Compromise Build Infrastructure [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4__compromise_build_infrastructure__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the infrastructure used to build and package Knative releases.
*   **Mechanism:** This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the build servers, compromising developer accounts with access to the build system, or using social engineering to gain access.
*   **Outcome:**  Control over the build infrastructure allows the attacker to inject malicious code directly into the official Knative binaries and container images, affecting all users who download and deploy these compromised artifacts.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Compromise Release Artifacts](./attack_tree_paths/5__compromise_release_artifacts.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker intercepts and modifies the Knative release artifacts (binaries, container images) after they are built but before they are distributed to users.
*   **Mechanism:** This could involve compromising the distribution channels, such as repositories or download servers, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the artifact signing or verification processes.
*   **Outcome:** Users who download the compromised artifacts will be deploying and running malicious code, leading to application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Submit Malicious Pull Requests [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/6__submit_malicious_pull_requests__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker, potentially a legitimate contributor or a newly created account, submits a pull request containing malicious code.
*   **Mechanism:** The attacker relies on weaknesses in the code review process, hoping that the malicious code will not be detected by reviewers. This could involve obfuscation techniques or subtle changes that introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Outcome:** If the malicious pull request is merged, the malicious code becomes part of the official Knative codebase, potentially affecting a large number of users in future releases.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Compromise Maintainer Accounts [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/7__compromise_maintainer_accounts__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the accounts of Knative project maintainers.
*   **Mechanism:** This could involve phishing attacks, credential stuffing, exploiting vulnerabilities in maintainers' personal systems, or social engineering.
*   **Outcome:** With control over a maintainer account, the attacker can directly commit malicious code, approve malicious pull requests, and manipulate the project in various ways, leading to widespread compromise.
