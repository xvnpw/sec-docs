# Threat Model Analysis for knative/community

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Pull Requests](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_pull_requests.md)

* **Description:** An attacker, posing as a legitimate contributor, submits a pull request containing malicious code directly to the Knative Community repository. This code could introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or attempt to exfiltrate data when the code is reviewed and merged by maintainers. The attacker might try to obfuscate the malicious intent or target less scrutinized areas.
    * **Impact:** If merged, the malicious code becomes part of the Knative Community repository, potentially affecting anyone using that component. This could lead to application compromise, data breaches, or denial of service for applications relying on the affected code.
    * **Affected Component:** Potentially any code component within the repository (e.g., Go modules, YAML configurations, scripts in `hack/` directory).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement mandatory and thorough code reviews by multiple trusted maintainers for all pull requests.
        * Utilize automated static analysis security testing (SAST) tools on all incoming pull requests.
        * Require signed commits from contributors.
        * Have clear guidelines and processes for code contribution and review.
        * Maintain a strong and active security team within the community.

## Threat: [Compromised Maintainer Account Leading to Malicious Commits](./threats/compromised_maintainer_account_leading_to_malicious_commits.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a maintainer's account on the Knative Community repository (e.g., through phishing, credential stuffing, or malware). They then directly commit malicious code or configurations to the repository, bypassing the usual pull request process.
    * **Impact:**  Direct commits from compromised maintainer accounts can have immediate and widespread impact, as they are often trusted and less scrutinized. This could lead to critical vulnerabilities being introduced quickly into the Knative Community repository.
    * **Affected Component:** Potentially any component within the repository, as maintainers typically have broad access.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all maintainer accounts on the Knative Community repository.
        * Regularly audit maintainer account activity for suspicious behavior on the Knative Community repository.
        * Implement strong password policies and encourage the use of password managers for maintainer accounts.
        * Educate maintainers about phishing and social engineering attacks targeting their Knative Community repository accounts.
        * Have a process for quickly revoking access for compromised accounts on the Knative Community repository.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks via Dependencies of Community Projects](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_via_dependencies_of_community_projects.md)

* **Description:** The Knative Community repository depends on other external libraries or projects. An attacker could compromise one of these upstream dependencies, injecting malicious code that is then pulled into the Knative Community repository and subsequently into applications using it.
    * **Impact:** This can introduce vulnerabilities indirectly, making the source harder to trace. Applications relying on the affected Knative Community components would inherit the vulnerability.
    * **Affected Component:**  `go.mod` files defining dependencies within the Knative Community repository, potentially affecting any module that relies on the compromised dependency.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly scan dependencies of the Knative Community repository for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
        * Pin specific versions of dependencies in the Knative Community repository to avoid automatically pulling in compromised updates.
        * Monitor security advisories for upstream dependencies of the Knative Community repository.
        * Consider using dependency mirroring or vendoring within the Knative Community project to have more control over the supply chain.

## Threat: [Inclusion of Backdoors or Time Bombs](./threats/inclusion_of_backdoors_or_time_bombs.md)

* **Description:** A sophisticated attacker might attempt to introduce hidden backdoors or time-activated malicious code within contributions to the Knative Community repository. These could be designed to remain dormant for a period before being activated, making detection more difficult.
    * **Impact:**  If successful, these backdoors could allow attackers persistent access to systems or trigger malicious actions at a later time for users of the affected Knative Community components.
    * **Affected Component:** Potentially any code component within the Knative Community repository, requiring careful scrutiny of less frequently accessed or complex parts.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rigorous code review processes within the Knative Community, focusing on understanding the purpose and functionality of all code.
        * Utilize automated tools to detect suspicious patterns or obfuscated code within the Knative Community repository.
        * Maintain a history of code changes and contributors for auditing purposes within the Knative Community.
        * Encourage community members to report any suspicious code or behavior within the Knative Community.
