# Attack Surface Analysis for knative/community

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection via Pull Requests](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_via_pull_requests.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Code Injection via Pull Requests
    *   **Description:**  A malicious actor submits a pull request containing intentionally harmful code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities disguised as legitimate improvements or bug fixes.
    *   **How Community Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The open nature of the community allows anyone to submit code, increasing the volume of contributions that need review and potentially masking malicious intent within legitimate-looking changes. Reliance on volunteer maintainers can lead to review fatigue or missed vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A pull request introduces a seemingly innocuous change to a utility function but includes a subtle backdoor that allows remote code execution under specific conditions.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially critical. Could lead to complete compromise of systems running the affected code, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the injected code).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mandatory code review processes with a focus on security.
        *   Utilize automated static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in pull requests.
        *   Require maintainer sign-off for all merges.
        *   Establish clear guidelines for code contribution and security expectations.
        *   Encourage community members to report suspicious pull requests.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks through Community-Managed Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_through_community-managed_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Supply Chain Attacks through Community-Managed Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Community-maintained tooling, scripts, or examples rely on external dependencies that are compromised. Attackers target these dependencies to indirectly inject malicious code.
    *   **How Community Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The community might manage and recommend specific dependencies or provide tooling that bundles them. If these dependencies are compromised, the community's recommendations inadvertently guide users towards vulnerable components.
    *   **Example:** A community-recommended helper library for interacting with the Knative API is compromised, and developers using this library unknowingly introduce the vulnerability into their applications.
    *   **Impact:** High. Could lead to the compromise of applications using the affected dependencies, potentially allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive data or control application behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain a clear inventory of community-recommended dependencies.
        *   Regularly scan these dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   Encourage the use of dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent and known dependency versions.
        *   Promote awareness within the community about supply chain security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Social Engineering Targeting Community Members](./attack_surfaces/social_engineering_targeting_community_members.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Social Engineering Targeting Community Members
    *   **Description:** Attackers target maintainers or active contributors through phishing or other social engineering techniques to gain access to repository credentials or influence development decisions.
    *   **How Community Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The collaborative nature of the community involves public communication and interaction, potentially exposing members to social engineering attempts. The trust inherent in community interactions can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker impersonates a trusted community member to trick a maintainer into granting them write access to the repository or merging a malicious pull request.
    *   **Impact:** High to Critical. Could lead to the introduction of malicious code, compromise of infrastructure, or disruption of the project.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Promote security awareness training within the community, focusing on recognizing and avoiding social engineering attacks.
        *   Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all maintainers and contributors with write access.
        *   Establish clear communication channels and verification procedures for sensitive actions.
        *   Encourage community members to be cautious about unsolicited requests or suspicious communications.
