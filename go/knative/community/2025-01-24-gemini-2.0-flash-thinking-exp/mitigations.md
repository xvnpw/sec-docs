## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Pinning and Version Control](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_pinning_and_version_control.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Dependency Pinning and Version Control
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify `knative/community` Dependencies:** List all direct and transitive dependencies your application uses that originate from the `knative/community` GitHub repository or related Knative projects. This includes specific libraries, tools, or components you've chosen to integrate.
    *   **Step 2: Pin Exact Versions from `knative/community`:** In your project's dependency management file (e.g., `go.mod` for Go, `requirements.txt` for Python, `package.json` for Node.js if applicable), specify exact versions for each identified dependency from `knative/community`.  Use specific version numbers or commit hashes. Avoid version ranges (like `^1.2.3` or `~1.2.x`) which might pull in newer, potentially less vetted versions from the community.
    *   **Step 3: Commit Dependency Files:** Commit the modified dependency files to your version control system (e.g., Git). This ensures that your project builds are consistently using the pinned versions of `knative/community` components.
    *   **Step 4: Controlled Updates of `knative/community` Dependencies:** When considering updates to `knative/community` dependencies, do so deliberately. Monitor `knative/community` release notes and changelogs for security implications and breaking changes before updating. Test updates in a non-production environment first to ensure compatibility and stability.
    *   **Step 5: Utilize Dependency Management Tools:** Leverage dependency management tools appropriate for your project's language to effectively manage and update pinned `knative/community` dependencies in a controlled and auditable manner.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
