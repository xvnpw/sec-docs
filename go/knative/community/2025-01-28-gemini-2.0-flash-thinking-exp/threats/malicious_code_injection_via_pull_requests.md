#### 4.2 Attack Vector Analysis

The attack vector relies on exploiting the trust-based nature of open-source contributions and potential weaknesses in the pull request review process.

*   **Initial Access:** The attacker gains initial access by:
    *   **Creating a GitHub Account:**  This is trivial and requires minimal effort.
    *   **Forking the Knative Repository:**  Standard procedure for contributing to open-source projects.
    *   **Creating a Branch and Committing Malicious Code:**  The attacker crafts a pull request containing malicious code disguised as a legitimate contribution.
*   **Injection Points:** Malicious code can be injected in various forms and locations within a pull request:
    *   **Source Code:**  Directly embedding malicious logic within new or modified code files (Go, YAML, etc.). This could be:
        *   **Backdoors:**  Creating hidden entry points for unauthorized access.
        *   **Exploits:**  Leveraging known or zero-day vulnerabilities in dependencies or Knative itself.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Stealing sensitive data (credentials, application data, etc.) and sending it to attacker-controlled servers.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Introducing code that causes resource exhaustion or crashes.
    *   **Build Scripts and Configuration Files:**  Modifying build scripts (e.g., `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, CI/CD configurations) to:
        *   **Download and Execute Malicious Payloads:**  Fetching and running external scripts during the build process.
        *   **Inject Malicious Dependencies:**  Adding or modifying dependencies to include compromised libraries.
        *   **Alter Build Artifacts:**  Modifying the final binaries or container images to include malicious components.
    *   **Documentation and Examples:**  Subtly injecting malicious code into code examples within documentation, which users might copy and paste into their applications without thorough review.
*   **Social Engineering:**  Attackers might use social engineering tactics to increase the likelihood of their pull request being merged:
    *   **Creating a seemingly legitimate profile:**  Building a history of minor contributions to appear trustworthy.
    *   **Focusing on non-critical areas initially:**  Gaining trust by contributing to less sensitive parts of the codebase before introducing malicious changes.
    *   **Making the pull request appear urgent or important:**  Pressuring maintainers to review and merge quickly without sufficient scrutiny.
    *   **Exploiting maintainer fatigue or burnout:**  Submitting malicious PRs when maintainers are overloaded and less likely to perform thorough reviews.

#### 4.3 Vulnerability Analysis

The success of this threat relies on the introduction of vulnerabilities through malicious code. These vulnerabilities can be diverse:

*   **Code-Level Vulnerabilities:**  Classic software vulnerabilities like:
