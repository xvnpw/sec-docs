# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for knative/community

## Mitigation Strategy: [Community Dependency Scanning and Vulnerability Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/community_dependency_scanning_and_vulnerability_monitoring.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Community Dependency Scanning and Vulnerability Monitoring
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Automated Scanning:** The `knative/community` should implement automated vulnerability scanning tools (like Dependabot, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency-Check) across all project repositories. This includes core components, examples, tools, and sub-projects.
    2.  **Centralized Alerting and Tracking:** Configure these tools to report vulnerabilities to a central security team or designated individuals within the community. Implement a system to track and manage reported vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Regular Review and Remediation Process:** The community should establish a defined process for regularly reviewing vulnerability scan results, prioritizing them based on severity, and coordinating remediation efforts. This includes updating vulnerable dependencies in a timely manner.
    4.  **Public Disclosure Policy:** Define and communicate a clear policy for public disclosure of vulnerabilities found in project dependencies, including timelines and communication channels.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity):** Using outdated or vulnerable libraries and packages within the `knative/community` project itself, which could be exploited to compromise the project's infrastructure or user applications relying on it.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium to High Severity):**  Compromised dependencies introduced into the `knative/community` project, potentially affecting all users of the project's components.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** High risk reduction for the entire ecosystem. Proactive scanning and remediation protects both the project and its users from known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Medium risk reduction. Early detection by community scanning can limit the spread and impact of compromised dependencies within the `knative` ecosystem.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   GitHub's `Dependabot` is likely enabled in some repositories.
    *   The extent of consistent scanning and a formalized community-wide vulnerability response process might be inconsistent.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Ensure consistent and comprehensive dependency scanning across *all* `knative/community` repositories.
    *   Formalize a community security team or working group responsible for vulnerability monitoring and remediation.
    *   Publicly document the community's vulnerability management process and disclosure policy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Community Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Generation and Review](./mitigation_strategies/community_software_bill_of_materials__sbom__generation_and_review.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Community Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Generation and Review
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Standardize SBOM Generation:** The `knative/community` should adopt a standard practice for generating SBOMs for all released components, tools, and examples. Choose a suitable SBOM format (e.g., SPDX, CycloneDX).
    2.  **Automate SBOM Generation in Release Pipeline:** Integrate SBOM generation into the project's release automation pipelines. This ensures SBOMs are automatically created for each release.
    3.  **Publish and Distribute SBOMs:**  Make generated SBOMs publicly available alongside releases. This allows users to easily understand the composition of `knative/community` components they are using.
    4.  **Community Review of SBOMs:** Encourage community members to review SBOMs, potentially as part of the release process, to identify unexpected or problematic dependencies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Shadow Dependencies within Project (Medium Severity):** Undocumented or unexpected dependencies within `knative/community` components that might introduce vulnerabilities or licensing issues into the project itself and for users.
    *   **Supply Chain Visibility for Users (Medium Severity):** Lack of transparency for users regarding the components included in `knative/community` releases, hindering their ability to assess and manage supply chain risks in their own applications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Shadow Dependencies within Project:** Medium risk reduction. SBOMs improve internal visibility and allow the community to identify and manage project dependencies more effectively.
    *   **Supply Chain Visibility for Users:** High risk reduction for users. SBOMs empower users to understand the dependencies they are adopting and perform their own vulnerability assessments.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely not fully implemented project-wide.
    *   SBOM generation is an emerging best practice, and some parts of `knative/community` might be exploring it.
    *   It's unlikely to be a standardized and consistently applied practice across all releases currently.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a project-wide policy requiring SBOM generation for all releases.
    *   Develop tooling and documentation to simplify SBOM generation for maintainers and contributors.
    *   Integrate SBOM publication into the release process and clearly link SBOMs to releases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Community Dependency Pinning and Version Control Enforcement](./mitigation_strategies/community_dependency_pinning_and_version_control_enforcement.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Community Dependency Pinning and Version Control Enforcement
