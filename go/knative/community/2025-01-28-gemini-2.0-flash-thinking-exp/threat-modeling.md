# Threat Model Analysis for knative/community

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Pull Requests](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_pull_requests.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, posing as a community contributor, submits a pull request to a Knative repository. This pull request contains malicious code designed to compromise applications using Knative or the Knative infrastructure itself. The attacker might inject backdoors, exploit existing vulnerabilities, or introduce data exfiltration mechanisms. If the pull request is merged without proper review, the malicious code becomes part of the Knative codebase and can be distributed to users.
    *   **Impact:**  Application compromise, data breach, unauthorized access to systems, denial of service, and potential compromise of the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Community Component:** Knative core components (Serving, Eventing, Functions), Knative extensions, community-developed tools, and potentially even documentation if code examples are affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Knative Community:** Implement mandatory and rigorous code review processes by multiple maintainers, automate security scanning of all pull requests (static analysis, vulnerability scanning), enforce strong contributor identity verification and reputation systems, and maintain strict access control to repository merge permissions.
        *   **Application Developers:** Stay informed about Knative security advisories and patch releases, carefully review any custom Knative components or extensions before deployment, implement robust internal security testing (including static and dynamic analysis), and use dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in Knative components.

## Threat: [Accidental Introduction of Vulnerabilities by Community Contributors](./threats/accidental_introduction_of_vulnerabilities_by_community_contributors.md)

*   **Description:** A well-intentioned but less security-aware community contributor submits code changes to Knative. These changes, while not intentionally malicious, introduce security vulnerabilities due to coding errors, logic flaws, insecure configurations, or lack of understanding of security best practices.  These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers once the code is merged and deployed.
    *   **Impact:** Application vulnerabilities (e.g., unauthorized access, data leaks, denial of service), requiring patching and potential incident response.
    *   **Affected Community Component:**  Any part of the Knative codebase contributed by the community, including core components, extensions, and tools.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Knative Community:** Implement comprehensive code review processes with a focus on security, provide security training and resources for contributors, establish clear security guidelines and best practices documentation, develop and enforce robust testing frameworks including security testing, and encourage security-focused contributions and reviews.
        *   **Application Developers:** Thoroughly test and validate all Knative components used in the application, even if considered "stable," implement security monitoring and vulnerability scanning in their application deployment pipelines, and stay updated with Knative security advisories to apply patches promptly.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attacks Targeting Community-Managed Components](./threats/dependency_confusion_attacks_targeting_community-managed_components.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies community-managed Knative components or extensions hosted in public repositories. They then upload malicious packages with the same or similar names to public package registries (like PyPI, npm, etc.). If application developers or build processes are not configured to prioritize official Knative repositories or private registries, they might inadvertently download and use the attacker's malicious packages instead of the legitimate Knative components.
    *   **Impact:** Installation of malicious dependencies, leading to application compromise, data theft, or supply chain attacks.
    *   **Affected Community Component:** Community-managed Knative extensions, tools, or libraries distributed through public package registries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Knative Community:** Provide clear guidelines on dependency management, strongly recommend using official Knative repositories or private registries, communicate best practices for dependency security, and establish secure hosting for official Knative components and extensions.
        *   **Application Developers:** Pin dependencies to specific versions in dependency management files, use private package registries to host and manage dependencies where possible, implement dependency scanning and vulnerability checks in build pipelines, carefully verify the source and integrity of all dependencies, and use repository prioritization in package managers to favor trusted sources.

## Threat: [Compromise of Community-Managed Build or CI/CD Infrastructure](./threats/compromise_of_community-managed_build_or_cicd_infrastructure.md)

*   **Description:** If the Knative community manages build systems, CI/CD pipelines, or infrastructure used for building and distributing Knative components (especially extensions or tools), attackers could target this infrastructure. A successful compromise could allow them to inject malicious code into Knative components during the build process, leading to the distribution of compromised software to users. (Less likely for core Knative, but more relevant for community-developed extensions or tools).
    *   **Impact:** Distribution of backdoored or vulnerable Knative components, widespread application compromise for users who adopt these compromised components, and damage to the Knative community's reputation.
    *   **Affected Community Component:** Community-managed build systems, CI/CD pipelines, artifact repositories, and any infrastructure involved in the software supply chain for Knative components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Knative Community:** Implement strong security measures for all community-managed infrastructure (access control, intrusion detection, regular security audits, vulnerability scanning), enforce secure CI/CD practices, use code signing and artifact verification mechanisms, and develop incident response plans for infrastructure compromise.
        *   **Application Developers:** Verify the integrity of downloaded Knative components using checksums or digital signatures provided by the Knative project, monitor for security advisories related to Knative infrastructure, and consider using trusted mirrors or private repositories for Knative components if concerns about community infrastructure security arise.
