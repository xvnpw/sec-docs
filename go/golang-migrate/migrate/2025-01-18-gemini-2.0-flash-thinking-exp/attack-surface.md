# Attack Surface Analysis for golang-migrate/migrate

## Attack Surface: [Malicious SQL Injection within Migration Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_sql_injection_within_migration_files.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into migration files.

**How Migrate Contributes:** `migrate` executes the SQL statements within these files directly against the database. If these files are compromised or sourced from untrusted locations, `migrate` will unknowingly execute the malicious code.

**Example:** A migration file contains `INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('attacker', 'pwned'); DROP TABLE users;`. When `migrate` runs this migration, it will insert a malicious user and then drop the entire `users` table.

**Impact:** Complete database compromise, data loss, data manipulation, unauthorized access.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store migration files in secure locations with restricted access.
* Implement code reviews for all migration changes.
* Utilize parameterized queries or ORM features within migrations where possible to avoid direct SQL string concatenation.
* Employ static analysis tools to scan migration files for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* Ensure migration files are version-controlled and changes are auditable.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Database Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_database_credentials.md)

**Description:** Database connection details (username, password, host) are exposed, allowing unauthorized access.

**How Migrate Contributes:** `migrate` requires database connection details to function. If these details are stored insecurely (e.g., hardcoded in the application configuration that `migrate` reads, exposed in logs generated by `migrate`), it becomes an attack vector.

**Example:** The database connection string `postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname?sslmode=disable` is directly embedded in the application's configuration file that `migrate` uses.

**Impact:** Unauthorized database access, data breaches, data manipulation, potential for further system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store database credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or encrypted configuration files.
* Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code or configuration files used by `migrate`.
* Ensure that configuration files containing credentials are not committed to version control without proper encryption.
* Restrict access to environments where credentials are stored.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in Migration File Loading](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_in_migration_file_loading.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths to access or execute files outside the intended migration directory.

**How Migrate Contributes:** If `migrate` doesn't properly sanitize or validate the paths to migration files specified through its configuration options or command-line arguments, an attacker might be able to load and execute arbitrary files.

**Example:**  Instead of loading `001_initial_schema.sql`, an attacker could configure `migrate` to load a malicious script by providing a path like `../../../../malicious.sh`.

**Impact:** Arbitrary file access, potential code execution, server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure `migrate` (or the application configuring it) strictly validates and sanitizes all input related to migration file paths.
* Use absolute paths or restrict the base directory for migration files in `migrate`'s configuration.
* Avoid allowing user-controlled input to directly determine migration file paths used by `migrate`.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via CLI Arguments (Directly Involving `migrate`'s Execution)](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_cli_arguments__directly_involving__migrate_'s_execution_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands through command-line arguments used to invoke the `migrate` tool.

**How Migrate Contributes:** If the application or scripts directly execute the `migrate` CLI tool with unsanitized user-provided input as arguments, it could lead to command injection.

**Example:** A script executes `migrate -database "postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname?options=$(malicious_command)" up`. The `malicious_command` would be executed on the server during `migrate`'s execution.

**Impact:** Server compromise, arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid constructing `migrate` CLI commands by directly concatenating user-controlled input.
* If user input is necessary for `migrate`'s execution, implement strict input validation and sanitization before passing it as arguments.
* Consider using programmatic interfaces or APIs if available to interact with `migrate` instead of relying solely on CLI execution with external input.
