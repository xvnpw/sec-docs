## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Migration Source

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "Compromise Migration Source" within the context of an application utilizing the `golang-migrate/migrate` library for database migrations.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks, potential attack vectors, and impact associated with an attacker gaining control over the source of database migration files used by the `golang-migrate/migrate` library. We aim to identify effective mitigation strategies and best practices to prevent such compromises.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where an attacker successfully compromises the location where migration files are stored and managed. This includes, but is not limited to:

* **Version Control Systems (e.g., Git):**  Compromising the repository where migration files are stored.
* **File Systems:** Gaining unauthorized access to the directory or storage location where migration files reside on the server or development machines.
* **Cloud Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage):**  Compromising the storage bucket or access credentials used to store migration files.
* **Internal Artifact Repositories:**  Compromising repositories used to store and distribute migration scripts.

The analysis will consider the implications for the application's security, data integrity, and availability. It will also touch upon the interaction between the `golang-migrate/migrate` library and the compromised source.

**Out of Scope:**

* Detailed analysis of vulnerabilities within the `golang-migrate/migrate` library itself (unless directly related to the compromised source).
* Analysis of other attack paths within the broader application security landscape.
* Specific implementation details of the application's database or infrastructure (unless directly relevant to the migration process).

### 3. Methodology

This deep analysis will employ the following methodology:

* **Threat Modeling:** Identifying potential threat actors, their motivations, and the techniques they might use to compromise the migration source.

* **Best Practices Review:**  Recommending secure development and operational practices related to managing database migrations.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Migration Source

**Attack Tree Path:** Compromise Migration Source (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Enabler)

**Description:** Gaining control over where migration files are stored (e.g., Git repository, file system) is a crucial step for injecting malicious migrations. This allows attackers to persistently introduce malicious code.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

This attack path hinges on the attacker's ability to manipulate the migration files that the `golang-migrate/migrate` library will execute against the database. The consequences of a successful compromise can be severe, as these migrations have direct access to the database schema and data.

**Potential Attack Vectors:**

* **Compromising the Version Control System (e.g., Git):**
    * **Stolen Credentials:** Attackers could obtain developer credentials through phishing, malware, or social engineering, allowing them to push malicious commits.
    * **Compromised Developer Machines:** If a developer's machine is compromised, attackers could directly modify the local repository and push changes.
    * **Vulnerabilities in the Git Server:** Exploiting security flaws in the Git server software itself.
    * **Weak Access Controls:** Insufficient branch protection or lack of multi-factor authentication on the Git platform.
    * **Insider Threats:** Malicious insiders with legitimate access could introduce malicious migrations.

* **Gaining Unauthorized Access to the File System:**
    * **Server Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application server or deployment environment to gain shell access and modify files.
    * **Misconfigured Permissions:** Incorrect file system permissions allowing unauthorized users to read or write migration files.
    * **Compromised Deployment Pipelines:** Attackers could inject malicious code into the deployment process, allowing them to modify migration files before they are deployed.
    * **Insecure Storage:** Storing migration files on publicly accessible or poorly secured storage.

* **Compromising Cloud Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage):**
    * **Stolen Access Keys/Credentials:** Obtaining AWS access keys or Google Cloud service account credentials through various means.
    * **Misconfigured Bucket Policies:**  Overly permissive bucket policies allowing unauthorized write access.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Cloud Provider Services:** Exploiting security flaws in the cloud storage service itself (less common but possible).

* **Compromising Internal Artifact Repositories:**
    * **Stolen Credentials:** Similar to Git, obtaining credentials for accessing the artifact repository.
    * **Vulnerabilities in the Repository Software:** Exploiting security flaws in the artifact repository management software.
    * **Weak Access Controls:** Insufficient access controls allowing unauthorized modification of artifacts.

**Impact of Successful Compromise:**

* **Malicious Code Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL commands into migration files, leading to:
    * **Data Breaches:** Stealing sensitive data by querying and exfiltrating information.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting critical data, leading to data corruption or loss.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Creating new administrative users or granting elevated privileges to existing accounts within the database.
    * **Application Backdoors:** Introducing persistent backdoors within the database or application logic.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious migrations could intentionally disrupt database operations, causing application downtime.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** If the compromised migrations are part of a shared library or component, the attack could propagate to other applications using that component.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Compliance Violations:** Data breaches resulting from compromised migrations can lead to regulatory fines and penalties.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Secure Version Control Practices:**
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce multi-factor authentication for all Git accounts and implement robust access controls with the principle of least privilege.
    * **Branch Protection:** Utilize branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes to critical branches and require code reviews for all changes.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular audits of Git repository access and permissions.
    * **Secret Scanning:** Implement tools to scan repositories for accidentally committed secrets (API keys, passwords).

* **Secure File System Management:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to access the directory containing migration files.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Review file system permissions and access logs.
    * **Secure Deployment Pipelines:** Implement secure CI/CD pipelines with proper authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized modifications during deployment.
    * **File Integrity Monitoring:** Use tools to detect unauthorized changes to migration files.

* **Secure Cloud Storage Configuration:**
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Utilize strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and principle of least privilege for accessing cloud storage.
    * **Restrictive Bucket Policies:** Configure bucket policies to allow only authorized access and prevent public write access.
    * **Encryption at Rest and in Transit:** Encrypt migration files stored in the cloud and ensure secure communication channels.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Review bucket policies and access logs.

* **Secure Internal Artifact Repository Management:**
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the repository.
    * **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Define granular access controls for managing and accessing migration artifacts.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the artifact repository software for known vulnerabilities.

* **General Security Best Practices:**
    * **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews for all migration changes to identify potentially malicious or erroneous code.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While migrations primarily involve SQL, ensure any dynamic generation of migration code is properly validated and sanitized.
    * **Regular Security Training:** Educate developers and operations teams about the risks associated with compromised migration sources.
    * **Incident Response Plan:** Have a well-defined incident response plan to address potential compromises.
    * **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect suspicious activity related to migration file access and modification.
    * **Immutable Infrastructure:** Consider using immutable infrastructure principles where changes are deployed as new versions, reducing the risk of in-place modifications.

**Specific Considerations for `golang-migrate/migrate`:**

* **Secure Configuration:** Ensure the `migrate` tool is configured to access the migration source securely, using appropriate authentication mechanisms if required (e.g., SSH keys for Git over SSH).
* **Limited Permissions:** Run the `migrate` tool with the least privileges necessary to perform its tasks. Avoid running it with root or overly permissive database credentials.
* **Checksum Verification (Potential Enhancement):** While not currently a built-in feature, consider implementing a mechanism to verify the integrity of migration files before execution (e.g., storing and verifying checksums). This could help detect tampering.

**Conclusion:**

Compromising the migration source is a critical attack path with potentially severe consequences for applications using `golang-migrate/migrate`. Attackers gaining control can inject malicious code directly into the database, leading to data breaches, manipulation, and service disruption. Implementing robust security measures across the entire lifecycle of migration file management, from development to deployment, is crucial. This includes securing version control systems, file systems, cloud storage, and internal artifact repositories, along with adopting secure development practices and regular security audits. By proactively addressing the risks associated with this attack path, development teams can significantly enhance the security posture of their applications.
