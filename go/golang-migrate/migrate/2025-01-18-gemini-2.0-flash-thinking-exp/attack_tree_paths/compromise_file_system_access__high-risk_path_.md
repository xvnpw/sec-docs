### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise File System Access

**Attack Tree Path:** Compromise File System Access (High-Risk Path)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the server's file system where migration files are stored. This can be achieved through exploiting application vulnerabilities (like file upload flaws) or infrastructure weaknesses (like SSH key compromise).

**Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1. **Initial Access:** The attacker needs to gain an initial foothold on the server. This can occur through various means:

    * **Exploiting Application Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Unrestricted File Upload:** A vulnerability allowing attackers to upload arbitrary files to the server. They could upload malicious scripts or backdoors directly into the migration file directory or a location from which they can then move files.
        * **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  A vulnerability allowing attackers to include local files on the server. While not directly granting write access, it could allow them to read migration files and potentially extract sensitive information or understand the migration logic for later manipulation.
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  A severe vulnerability allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. This grants them full control, including the ability to modify or access any file.
        * **SQL Injection (Indirect):** While not directly related to file system access, a successful SQL injection could potentially be leveraged to manipulate data that influences file system operations or reveals file paths.

    * **Exploiting Infrastructure Weaknesses:**
        * **Compromised SSH Keys:** If an attacker gains access to valid SSH keys, they can directly log into the server and access the file system.
        * **Weak Passwords:**  Guessing or brute-forcing weak passwords for server accounts.
        * **Vulnerabilities in Server Software:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the operating system, web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx), or other installed services.
        * **Misconfigured Security Groups/Firewall Rules:** Allowing unauthorized access to the server's file system through network vulnerabilities.

2. **Locating Migration Files:** Once initial access is gained, the attacker needs to locate the migration files. Common locations and strategies include:

    * **Default Locations:**  Attackers will often target common default locations where migration files are stored, based on typical project structures or documentation for `golang-migrate/migrate`.
    * **Configuration Files:** Examining application configuration files or environment variables that might specify the migration directory.
    * **Process Inspection:**  Analyzing running processes to identify the arguments passed to the `migrate` command, which might reveal the migration directory.
    * **Web Server Configuration:**  Checking web server configurations for any aliases or virtual directories that might point to the migration file location.

3. **Exploiting Compromised Migration Files:** With access to the migration files, the attacker can perform various malicious actions:

    * **Data Manipulation:**
        * **Injecting Malicious SQL:** Modifying existing migration files or creating new ones to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to data breaches, data corruption, or privilege escalation within the database.
        * **Altering Data Structures:**  Modifying migrations to change table schemas in a way that benefits the attacker or disrupts the application's functionality.

    * **Code Injection:**
        * **Embedding Malicious Code:**  Injecting code into migration files that gets executed during the migration process. This could involve running system commands, installing backdoors, or exfiltrating data.

    * **Downgrade Attacks:**
        * **Reverting to Vulnerable States:**  Modifying or creating migrations to downgrade the database schema to an older version known to have vulnerabilities, which can then be exploited.

    * **Information Disclosure:**
        * **Reading Sensitive Information:**  Migration files might inadvertently contain sensitive information like database credentials (though this is a bad practice), API keys, or internal application details.

**Potential Impacts:**

* **Data Breach:**  Attackers can steal sensitive data by injecting malicious SQL or altering data structures.
* **Data Corruption:**  Malicious migrations can corrupt the database, leading to application errors and data loss.
* **Application Downtime:**  Failed or malicious migrations can cause the application to become unstable or unusable.
* **Security Compromise:**  Injected code can create backdoors, allowing persistent access for the attacker.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Financial Loss:**  Recovery from a successful attack can be costly, involving data recovery, system remediation, and potential legal repercussions.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk of this attack path, a multi-layered security approach is crucial:

**1. Secure Application Development Practices:**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities like file upload flaws and LFI.
* **Secure File Upload Mechanisms:** Implement robust file upload controls, including whitelisting allowed file types, limiting file sizes, and storing uploaded files outside the webroot with restricted access.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the application code.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only necessary permissions to application components and users.

**2. Secure Infrastructure Configuration:**

* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong and unique passwords for all server accounts.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA for SSH and other critical access points.
* **Regular Security Patching:**  Keep the operating system, web server, and all other server software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* **Secure SSH Configuration:** Disable password authentication for SSH and rely on key-based authentication. Regularly rotate SSH keys.
* **Network Segmentation and Firewall Rules:**  Restrict network access to the server and its components based on the principle of least privilege.
* **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Monitor network traffic and system activity for suspicious behavior.

**3. Secure Migration Management:**

* **Restrict Access to Migration Files:**  Limit file system permissions to the migration directory, allowing only the necessary processes (e.g., the application user running the migration tool) to access them.
* **Code Reviews for Migration Files:**  Treat migration files as code and subject them to code reviews to identify potential security issues or malicious injections.
* **Integrity Checks for Migration Files:**  Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of migration files before execution. This could involve using checksums or digital signatures.
* **Version Control for Migration Files:**  Store migration files in a version control system (like Git) to track changes and allow for rollback in case of unauthorized modifications.
* **Secure Storage of Database Credentials:**  Avoid storing database credentials directly in migration files. Use secure methods like environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
* **Regular Backups:**  Maintain regular backups of the database and migration files to facilitate recovery in case of a successful attack.

**4. Monitoring and Alerting:**

* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Implement FIM tools to detect unauthorized changes to migration files.
* **Security Logging:**  Enable comprehensive logging of system and application events, including file access attempts.
* **Alerting on Suspicious Activity:**  Configure alerts for suspicious activities, such as unauthorized file access or modifications in the migration directory.

**Conclusion:**

Compromising file system access to manipulate migration files presents a significant risk to applications using `golang-migrate/migrate`. Attackers can leverage this access to directly impact the database, inject malicious code, and potentially gain persistent control over the system. A robust security strategy encompassing secure development practices, secure infrastructure configuration, careful migration management, and continuous monitoring is essential to mitigate this threat effectively. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this high-risk attack path.
