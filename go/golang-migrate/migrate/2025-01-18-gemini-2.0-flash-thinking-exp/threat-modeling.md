# Threat Model Analysis for golang-migrate/migrate

## Threat: [Malicious Migration Files](./threats/malicious_migration_files.md)

- **Description:** An attacker with write access to the migration file directory could create or modify migration files to execute arbitrary SQL or Go code *when `migrate` is run*. This could involve inserting malicious data, deleting tables, granting unauthorized access, or even executing operating system commands if using Go-based migrations.
- **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, data breaches, data corruption, denial of service, potential compromise of the server if Go migrations are used to execute system commands *through `migrate`*.
- **Affected Component:** Migration File Loading, `migrate` CLI execution.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict access control on the migration file directory, allowing only authorized personnel to modify files.
    - Use code review processes for all migration files before they are applied *by `migrate`*.
    - Employ static analysis tools to scan migration files for potential malicious code or SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    - Consider using SQL-based migrations over Go-based migrations if system command execution is not required, reducing the attack surface *exposed through `migrate`*.
    - Implement a robust version control system for migration files to track changes and revert malicious modifications.

## Threat: [Exposed Database Credentials in Configuration](./threats/exposed_database_credentials_in_configuration.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gaining access to the `migrate` configuration (e.g., through compromised environment variables, configuration files, or command-line arguments) could retrieve the database connection string, including credentials. This allows them to directly access and manipulate the database *bypassing application logic*.
- **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, data breaches, data manipulation, data deletion.
- **Affected Component:** Configuration Loading, `migrate` CLI execution.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Store database credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management systems (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or encrypted configuration files *used by `migrate`*.
    - Avoid storing credentials directly in code or plain text configuration files *used by `migrate`*.
    - Implement proper access control on the systems and files where configuration *for `migrate`* is stored.
    - Regularly rotate database credentials.
    - Avoid passing credentials directly as command-line arguments *to `migrate`* where they might be visible in process listings.

## Threat: [Insecure Migration Path Configuration](./threats/insecure_migration_path_configuration.md)

- **Description:** If the path to the migration files is configurable *within `migrate`'s settings* and not properly validated, an attacker might be able to manipulate the configuration to point `migrate` to a directory containing malicious migration files.
- **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary SQL or Go code leading to database compromise, data breaches, data corruption, or denial of service *when `migrate` is executed*.
- **Affected Component:** Configuration Loading, Migration File Loading.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Hardcode the migration path or use a strongly validated configuration mechanism *for `migrate`*.
    - If the migration path must be configurable, implement strict input validation to ensure it points to the intended location and prevent path traversal vulnerabilities *within `migrate`'s configuration handling*.
    - Ensure the directory containing migration files has appropriate access controls.

## Threat: [Tampering with Migration State](./threats/tampering_with_migration_state.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could potentially tamper with the mechanism used by `migrate` to track applied migrations (e.g., the `schema_migrations` table in the database). This could involve marking migrations as applied when they haven't been, or vice versa, leading to inconsistent database states or the re-application of migrations with unintended consequences *when `migrate` operates*.
- **Impact:** Database schema inconsistencies, application errors, potential data corruption if migrations are re-applied incorrectly *by `migrate`*.
- **Affected Component:** Database Interaction (specifically the migration tracking mechanism *used by `migrate`*).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Ensure the database user used by `migrate` has restricted privileges, limiting its ability to modify the migration tracking table beyond its intended purpose.
    - Implement database auditing to detect unauthorized modifications to the migration tracking table.
    - Consider using checksums or other integrity checks on migration files to detect if they have been altered since they were last applied *by `migrate`*.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Migrations](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_migrations.md)

- **Description:** If the database user used by `migrate` has overly broad privileges, a malicious migration could be crafted to escalate privileges within the database, granting unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities *when executed by `migrate`*.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to modify database structure and data beyond the intended scope *through `migrate`*.
- **Affected Component:** Database Interaction *initiated by `migrate`*.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Apply the principle of least privilege to the database user used by `migrate`, granting only the necessary permissions to manage schema changes.
    - Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to the `migrate` user.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in `migrate` or its Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_vulnerabilities_in__migrate__or_its_dependencies.md)

- **Description:** A vulnerability could be present in the `golang-migrate/migrate` library itself or in one of its dependencies. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the application uses the affected version of the library.
- **Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution *within the context of `migrate`'s execution*.
- **Affected Component:** `migrate` library, its dependencies.
- **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly update the `golang-migrate/migrate` library and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Use dependency management tools (like Go modules) to track and manage dependencies.
    - Employ vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the `migrate` library and its dependencies.
    - Subscribe to security advisories for `golang-migrate/migrate` and its ecosystem.

## Threat: [Accidental Data Loss due to Incorrect Migrations](./threats/accidental_data_loss_due_to_incorrect_migrations.md)

- **Description:** Developers might create and apply migration files that unintentionally delete or modify data in a way that leads to data loss *when executed by `migrate`*. This is often due to human error or insufficient testing.
- **Impact:** Permanent data loss, application downtime, business disruption.
- **Affected Component:** Migration File Content, `migrate` CLI execution.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement a rigorous testing process for all migration files in non-production environments before applying them to production *using `migrate`*.
    - Use database backups and restore procedures as a safety net.
    - Encourage the use of reversible migrations (migrations that have a corresponding rollback) *supported by `migrate`*.
    - Implement code review processes for all migration files.
    - Consider using database schema comparison tools to verify the intended changes of a migration.
