## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via golang-migrate/migrate (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_golang-migratemigrate__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within the `golang-migrate/migrate` process to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Migration Process (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_migration_process__critical_node_.md)

Attackers aim to gain control over the execution of database migrations. This allows them to introduce malicious changes, revert to vulnerable states, or disrupt the application's database schema.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Migrations (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_migrations__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers introduce SQL code within migration files that can compromise the database or the application. This can involve creating new users, modifying data, or executing arbitrary commands on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Migration Source (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Enabler)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_migration_source__critical_node__high-risk_path_enabler_.md)

Gaining control over where migration files are stored (e.g., Git repository, file system) is a crucial step for injecting malicious migrations. This allows attackers to persistently introduce malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Version Control System (e.g., Git) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_version_control_system__e_g___git___high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit weaknesses in the version control system to gain unauthorized commit access. This can involve using compromised credentials, exploiting software vulnerabilities in the VCS, or social engineering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Commit Access (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_commit_access__critical_node_.md)

Successfully obtaining the ability to commit changes to the migration repository. This allows direct injection of malicious migration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise File System Access (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_file_system_access__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers gain unauthorized access to the server's file system where migration files are stored. This can be achieved through exploiting application vulnerabilities (like file upload flaws) or infrastructure weaknesses (like SSH key compromise).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Vulnerabilities (e.g., File Upload) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_vulnerabilities__e_g___file_upload___high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in the application itself, such as insecure file upload functionalities, to gain access to the server's file system and modify migration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Migrations Directly (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_migrations_directly__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers bypass the intended source of migrations and directly introduce malicious files into the deployment process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Deployment Pipeline (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Enabler)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_deployment_pipeline__critical_node__high-risk_path_enabler_.md)

Attackers target the CI/CD pipeline to inject malicious migrations during the build or deployment process. This can involve exploiting vulnerabilities in CI/CD tools or compromising build artifacts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CI/CD Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cicd_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit weaknesses in the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools to inject malicious code or modify the deployment process to include malicious migrations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Force Rollback/Forward to Malicious State (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/force_rollbackforward_to_malicious_state__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers manipulate the migration history to execute specific, attacker-controlled migrations. This can involve reverting to an older, vulnerable state or applying a crafted migration that introduces vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Migration Version Table (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Enabler)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_migration_version_table__critical_node__high-risk_path_enabler_.md)

Attackers directly modify the database table that tracks applied migrations. This requires direct database access and allows them to control which migrations are considered applied.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Direct Database Access (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Enabler)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_direct_database_access__critical_node__high-risk_path_enabler_.md)

Attackers obtain direct access to the application's database. This is a critical step that enables various malicious activities, including manipulating the migration version table.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Database Credentials Leakage (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_database_credentials_leakage__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers obtain database credentials through insecure storage or accidental exposure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Configuration Files (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_configuration_files__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers gain access to configuration files where database credentials might be stored, often in plain text or easily decryptable formats.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Environment Variable Exposure (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_environment_variable_exposure__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers discover database credentials stored insecurely as environment variables, which can be accessed through various means depending on the environment configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration and Storage Weaknesses (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_and_storage_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

This encompasses vulnerabilities related to how `migrate` is configured and how its associated data (like connection strings and migration file locations) is stored. Insecure practices in this area can lead to credential exposure or the ability to manipulate the migration process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose/Compromise Database Credentials (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Enabler)](./attack_tree_paths/exposecompromise_database_credentials__critical_node__high-risk_path_enabler_.md)

Attackers successfully uncover or gain access to the database credentials used by `migrate`. This is a fundamental step towards compromising the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Credentials Stored in Plain Text (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/credentials_stored_in_plain_text__high-risk_path_.md)

Database credentials are stored directly in configuration files or other locations without any encryption or obfuscation, making them easily accessible to attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Configuration Files (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/access_configuration_files__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers gain unauthorized access to the configuration files where database credentials might be stored in plain text.

## Attack Tree Path: [Credentials Leaked in Logs/Error Messages (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/credentials_leaked_in_logserror_messages__high-risk_path_.md)

Database credentials are inadvertently included in application logs or error messages, making them accessible to attackers who can access these logs.
