## Attack Tree Path: [1. Modify Database Schema Maliciously (CRITICAL NODE - High Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/1__modify_database_schema_maliciously__critical_node_-_high_impact_.md)

This represents the attacker's primary goal. Success here means the attacker has altered the database schema for malicious purposes, leading to potential data breaches, corruption, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Influence Migration Files (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2__influence_migration_files__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on compromising the migration files themselves.
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the source code repository (e.g., weak access controls, compromised credentials).
            * Compromising deployment pipeline credentials, allowing modification of files during the deployment process.
            * Exploiting file system permission vulnerabilities on servers where migration files are stored.
            * Social engineering deployment personnel to gain unauthorized access to migration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Gain Unauthorized Access to Migration File Storage (CRITICAL NODE - Enables multiple attacks)](./attack_tree_paths/3__gain_unauthorized_access_to_migration_file_storage__critical_node_-_enables_multiple_attacks_.md)

Successful compromise of the storage location for migration files is a critical step, enabling subsequent attacks.
        * **Attack Vectors:** (Same as "Influence Migration Files" - these are the methods to gain access)
            * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the source code repository.
            * Compromising deployment pipeline credentials.
            * Exploiting file system permission vulnerabilities.
            * Social engineering deployment personnel.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Inject Malicious Code into Migration Files (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/4__inject_malicious_code_into_migration_files__high-risk_path_.md)

Once access to migration files is gained, attackers can inject malicious code.
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * Directly editing migration files with malicious SQL statements.
            * Injecting code that executes arbitrary commands on the database server (if the migration process allows).
            * Introducing schema changes that create backdoors or persistence mechanisms (e.g., adding new administrative users).

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Inject SQL to Modify Data or Structure for Malicious Purposes (CRITICAL NODE - Direct database manipulation)](./attack_tree_paths/5__inject_sql_to_modify_data_or_structure_for_malicious_purposes__critical_node_-_direct_database_ma_8b81600f.md)

This is a direct and impactful attack vector where malicious SQL code is injected into migration files.
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * Inserting SQL to exfiltrate sensitive data.
            * Updating data to manipulate application logic or user accounts.
            * Deleting data to cause denial of service.
            * Altering the schema to create vulnerabilities or backdoors.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Manipulate `migrate` Execution Parameters (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/6__manipulate__migrate__execution_parameters__high-risk_path_.md)

This path involves influencing how the `migrate` tool is executed.
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * Compromising the server environment to directly execute `migrate` with malicious arguments.
            * Modifying configuration files used by `migrate` (e.g., changing the database connection string).
            * Intercepting and modifying API calls to deployment tools that execute `migrate`.
            * Exploiting weaknesses in scripting or automation tools used to run `migrate`.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Compromise Server Environment Running `migrate` (CRITICAL NODE - Broad impact)](./attack_tree_paths/7__compromise_server_environment_running__migrate___critical_node_-_broad_impact_.md)

Gaining control of the server running `migrate` provides a wide range of attack possibilities.
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * Exploiting remote access vulnerabilities (e.g., RDP, SSH).
            * Leveraging compromised credentials to log in remotely.
            * Exploiting vulnerabilities in server software or operating system.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Gain Remote Access to Server (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/8__gain_remote_access_to_server__high-risk_path_.md)

This is a common initial step for many server-based attacks.
        * **Attack Vectors:** (Same as "Compromise Server Environment Running `migrate`")
            * Exploiting remote access vulnerabilities.
            * Leveraging compromised credentials.
            * Exploiting vulnerabilities in server software or operating system.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Manipulate Data Source Configuration Used by `migrate` (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/9__manipulate_data_source_configuration_used_by__migrate___high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on manipulating the database connection details used by `migrate`.
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * Exploiting vulnerabilities in configuration management systems where database credentials are stored.
            * Compromising environment variables or secrets management solutions.
            * Accessing hardcoded credentials in application code or configuration files (a poor security practice).
            * Modifying the data source string to point to a malicious database controlled by the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Obtain Database Credentials Used by `migrate` (CRITICAL NODE - Enables database access)](./attack_tree_paths/10__obtain_database_credentials_used_by__migrate___critical_node_-_enables_database_access_.md)

Obtaining the database credentials allows the attacker to bypass `migrate` altogether and directly access the database.
        * **Attack Vectors:** (Same as "Manipulate Data Source Configuration Used by `migrate`")
            * Exploiting vulnerabilities in configuration management systems.
            * Compromising environment variables or secrets management solutions.
            * Accessing hardcoded credentials.
