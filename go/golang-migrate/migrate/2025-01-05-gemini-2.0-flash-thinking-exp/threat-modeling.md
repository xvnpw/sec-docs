# Threat Model Analysis for golang-migrate/migrate

## Threat: [Malicious SQL Injection in Migration Files](./threats/malicious_sql_injection_in_migration_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to migration files injects malicious SQL statements into a migration file. When `migrate` runs this file, the `migrate` tool directly executes the malicious SQL on the database.

**Impact:** Complete database compromise, including data exfiltration, data modification, data deletion, or the execution of arbitrary database commands, all facilitated by `migrate`'s execution of the crafted migration file.

**Affected Component:** `migrate`'s SQL execution logic, the migration file reading module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access control and code review processes for migration files before they are used by `migrate`.
*   While direct parameterization might be limited for schema changes, carefully sanitize any dynamic SQL generation within migrations before `migrate` executes it.
*   Employ static analysis tools to scan migration files for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities before `migrate` processes them.

## Threat: [Schema Manipulation Leading to Data Loss/Corruption via `migrate`](./threats/schema_manipulation_leading_to_data_losscorruption_via__migrate_.md)

**Description:** An attacker, or even a negligent developer, creates or modifies a migration file that, when executed by `migrate`, unintentionally or maliciously alters the database schema in a way that causes data loss or corruption. `migrate` faithfully applies these changes.

**Impact:** Permanent data loss, data inconsistency, application errors as a direct result of the schema changes applied by `migrate`.

**Affected Component:** `migrate`'s schema alteration logic, the migration file reading module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement a robust backup and restore strategy for the database before running `migrate` in production.
*   Enforce a rigorous code review process for all migration files before they are processed by `migrate`, focusing on schema changes.
*   Use a development/staging environment to thoroughly test migrations executed by `migrate` before applying them to production.
*   Utilize `migrate`'s rollback functionality or implement custom rollback mechanisms to revert unintended changes applied by `migrate`.

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials in `migrate` Configuration or Migration Files](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials_in__migrate__configuration_or_migration_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to `migrate` configuration files or migration files where database credentials (username, password, connection string) are hardcoded or stored insecurely. `migrate` uses these credentials to connect to the database.

**Impact:** Direct unauthorized access to the database using the credentials intended for `migrate`, allowing the attacker to perform any operation the compromised credentials permit.

**Affected Component:** `migrate`'s configuration loading mechanism, the migration file reading module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never hardcode database credentials in `migrate` configuration files or migration files.
*   Configure `migrate` to retrieve database credentials securely from environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools, rather than directly from files.
*   Ensure that configuration files used by `migrate` have restricted access permissions.

## Threat: [Connection String Injection via `migrate` Configuration](./threats/connection_string_injection_via__migrate__configuration.md)

**Description:** If the database connection string used by `migrate` is dynamically constructed based on untrusted input within its configuration (e.g., environment variables not properly sanitized before being used by `migrate`), an attacker could manipulate these inputs to inject malicious connection parameters that `migrate` then uses.

**Impact:** `migrate` could be tricked into connecting to an attacker-controlled database, potentially leading to the exfiltration of sensitive data intended for the legitimate database, or `migrate` could execute commands on an unintended database.

**Affected Component:** `migrate`'s database connection logic, its configuration parsing and handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid dynamically constructing connection strings for `migrate` based on untrusted input.
*   If dynamic construction is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* `migrate` uses the constructed string.
*   Favor explicit and static configuration of database connection details for `migrate`.

## Threat: [Compromised `migrate` Binary or Dependencies](./threats/compromised__migrate__binary_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker substitutes the legitimate `migrate` binary with a malicious version or compromises one of its dependencies. When the application or deployment process uses this compromised binary, the malicious `migrate` tool could execute malicious code during the migration process, potentially targeting the database.

**Impact:**  Unpredictable and potentially severe impact directly related to database operations performed by the compromised `migrate` tool, ranging from data manipulation to complete database takeover.

**Affected Component:** The `migrate` binary itself, its dependency loading mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Verify the integrity of the `migrate` binary using checksums or digital signatures before using it.
*   Use a dependency management tool (like Go modules) to track and manage `migrate`'s dependencies and regularly scan them for known vulnerabilities.
*   Obtain the `migrate` binary from trusted and official sources.
