# Attack Surface Analysis for golang-migrate/migrate

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Migration File Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_migration_file_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain write access to the directory containing migration files and inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **How `migrate` Contributes:** `migrate` executes the SQL code contained within these files, providing a direct path for attackers to interact with the database *through the tool's intended functionality*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker replaces a legitimate migration file with one containing `DROP TABLE users;` or SQL injection to extract data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise (data loss, modification, exfiltration), potential for privilege escalation on the database server and potentially the host system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrictive File System Permissions:** The migration directory should have the *strictest* possible permissions. Only the application's user (and ideally a dedicated, low-privilege user) should have write access.
        *   **Mandatory Code Review:** *All* migration files *must* undergo rigorous code review by multiple developers before deployment.
        *   **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:** Automate checks in the CI/CD pipeline to prevent unreviewed or unauthorized migrations from being applied. Include static analysis for dangerous SQL patterns.
        *   **Digital Signatures (Ideal, but Requires Custom Implementation):** Sign migration files and verify signatures before execution using `migrate`.
        *   **Version Control Auditing:** Use Git (or similar) to track all changes and provide an audit trail.
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Implement pre-migration hooks to calculate and verify checksums of migration files, integrating this check with `migrate`'s execution flow.

## Attack Surface: [Database Connection String Exposure](./attack_surfaces/database_connection_string_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** The database connection string, containing credentials, is leaked or exposed.
    *   **How `migrate` Contributes:** `migrate` *requires* a database connection string to operate. This string is a direct input to the tool. If this string is compromised, it provides direct access to the database, bypassing application-level security.
    *   **Example:** The connection string is hardcoded in the source code, accidentally committed to a public repository, or logged to an insecure location accessible to an attacker who then uses it with `migrate`.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise (data loss, modification, exfiltration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Use a secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, environment variables with *very* restricted access). *Never* hardcode credentials, especially those used by `migrate`.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** The database user in the connection string provided to `migrate` should have *only* the necessary permissions for migrations, *not* full administrative access.
        *   **Credential Rotation:** Regularly rotate database credentials used by `migrate`.
        *   **Environment Variable Security:** If using environment variables with `migrate`, ensure they are set securely and only accessible to the application process.

## Attack Surface: [Forced Migration to Vulnerable Versions](./attack_surfaces/forced_migration_to_vulnerable_versions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the application or `migrate` command directly to force a rollback to an older, known-vulnerable database schema.
    *   **How `migrate` Contributes:** `migrate` *provides the functionality* to specify the target migration version. If this control is exposed or misused, it can be abused. This is a direct feature of the tool.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an exposed API endpoint that allows setting the migration version used by `migrate`, forcing a rollback to a version with a known SQL injection vulnerability in a previous migration.
    *   **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in older schema versions, leading to data breaches or other security issues.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Version Control:** Do *not* expose the ability to arbitrarily set the migration version used by `migrate` to untrusted users. Migrations should be applied sequentially and automatically as part of a controlled deployment.
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** If version control *is* exposed for `migrate` commands, implement rigorous input validation to accept only valid version numbers.
        *   **Auditing:** Log all `migrate` operations, including the version, timestamp, and initiating user/process.

## Attack Surface: [Driver-Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/driver-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the database drivers used by `migrate`.
    *   **How `migrate` Contributes:** `migrate` relies on external database drivers (e.g., `pgx` for PostgreSQL) to interact with the database. `migrate` directly uses these drivers.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the `pgx` driver allows for SQL injection, even if the migration files themselves are secure. The attacker uses `migrate` to trigger the vulnerable code path.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the driver vulnerability; could range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution on the database server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific driver vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Drivers Updated:** Regularly update database drivers used by `migrate` to the latest patched versions.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify and address known driver vulnerabilities that could be triggered via `migrate`.
