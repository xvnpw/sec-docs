# Attack Tree Analysis for golang-migrate/migrate

Objective: Gain unauthorized control over the database schema and/or data, or cause denial of service, by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the `golang-migrate/migrate` library or its usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Gain unauthorized control over DB schema/data, or cause DoS]***](./attack_tree_paths/_gain_unauthorized_control_over_db_schemadata__or_cause_dos_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. All other nodes and paths are steps towards achieving this goal.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Complete compromise of the database, including data theft, modification, deletion, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Manipulate Migration Files/Execution]***](./attack_tree_paths/_manipulate_migration_filesexecution_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the primary attack vector, focusing on manipulating the migration process itself. This is the gateway to the most likely and impactful attacks.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Enables various sub-attacks that lead to database compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - Depending on the security measures in place.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Depending on the specific attack.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Alter Existing Migration Files]***](./attack_tree_paths/_alter_existing_migration_files_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains write access to the directory containing migration files and modifies existing files to include malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Allows execution of arbitrary SQL, leading to complete database compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - Depends on file permissions, deployment pipeline security, and potential server-side vulnerabilities.
*   **Effort:** Low (if weak file permissions) to Medium (if exploiting a vulnerability).
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires basic scripting and SQL knowledge.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with file system auditing) to Hard (without auditing).

## Attack Tree Path: [[Inject Malicious Migrations]***](./attack_tree_paths/_inject_malicious_migrations_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker adds *new* migration files containing malicious SQL code to the migration directory.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Same as altering existing files: execution of arbitrary SQL.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Similar conditions to altering existing files.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Similar to altering existing files.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Similar to altering existing files.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard - Similar to altering existing files.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Control Migration Source]*](./attack_tree_paths/_control_migration_source_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains control over the source from which `migrate` retrieves migration files. This could be a file system path, a network share, or even an `io/fs.FS` implementation in Go.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Allows the attacker to completely control the content of migrations, leading to arbitrary SQL execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Depends heavily on the specific source used and its security configuration.
*   **Effort:** Medium to High - Depends on the source and the method used to gain control.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard - Depends on monitoring and security controls around the source.

## Attack Tree Path: [[SQL Injection]***](./attack_tree_paths/_sql_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits SQL injection vulnerabilities *within* the migration files themselves. This occurs if the migration files are written in a way that allows user-supplied data (or data from any untrusted source) to be directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High - Allows data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Can lead to complete database compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends heavily on the coding practices used when writing the migration files. Unfortunately, SQL injection is a common vulnerability.
*   **Effort:** Low - If vulnerabilities exist, exploiting them is often straightforward.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with proper input validation and web application firewalls) to Hard (without input validation).

## Attack Tree Path: [[Execute Arbitrary Commands]](./attack_tree_paths/_execute_arbitrary_commands_.md)

*   **Description:** If the migration files or the `migrate` tool itself allows for the execution of arbitrary commands.
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete system compromise).
*   **Effort:** High (requires finding a significant vulnerability or misconfiguration).
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with system monitoring) to Hard (if attacker covers tracks).
