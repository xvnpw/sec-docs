# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for golang-migrate/migrate

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Execution via `migrate` Command Flags and Environment Variables](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_execution_via__migrate__command_flags_and_environment_variables.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Available Flags:** Familiarize yourself with the command-line flags provided by `migrate`. Key flags for security include:
        *   `-source`: Specifies the location of the migration files.  This can be used to control which set of migrations is applied.
        *   `-database`: Specifies the database connection string.  This is crucial for ensuring migrations are applied to the correct database.
        *   `-path`: Similar to `-source`, but often used for relative paths.
        *   `-prefetch`: Controls how many migrations are loaded into memory.  This can have performance implications, but generally doesn't have direct security implications unless extremely large numbers of migrations are involved.
        *   `-version`: Allows applying migrations up to a specific version.  This can be useful for controlled rollouts and preventing unintended application of later migrations.
        *   `-force`: *Avoid using this flag in production*. It bypasses safety checks and can lead to data loss if used incorrectly.
    2.  **Use Environment Variables:** Leverage environment variables to control the behavior of `migrate`. This is particularly important for:
        *   Database connection strings (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`).  *Never* hardcode these in scripts or configuration files.
        *   Flags that control the execution environment (e.g., `MIGRATE_ALLOW_DOWN=false` to disable "down" migrations in production).
    3.  **Wrapper Scripts:** Create wrapper scripts (e.g., shell scripts, Makefiles) around the `migrate` command.  These scripts should:
        *   Set environment variables appropriately for the target environment (development, staging, production).
        *   Use specific flags to control the execution (e.g., only allow "up" migrations in production).
        *   Include error handling and logging.
    4.  **Controlled Rollouts:** Use the `-version` flag to apply migrations incrementally.  This allows you to test migrations in stages and roll back if necessary.
    5.  **Avoid `-force`:**  Do not use the `-force` flag in production environments. It bypasses version checks and can lead to unexpected behavior or data loss.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Migration Execution (Partial):** (Severity: High) - By controlling the execution environment and using specific flags, you can limit the scope of what migrations can be run.
    *   **Downgrade Attacks / Reversible Migrations:** (Severity: Medium) - By controlling the `-version` flag or disallowing "down" migrations via environment variables, you can prevent rollbacks to vulnerable states.
    *   **Sensitive Data in Migrations (Partial):** (Severity: Medium) - By using environment variables for database connection strings, you avoid hardcoding secrets in scripts.
    * **Incorrect Database:** (Severity: High) - Using the correct `-database` flag, populated by environment variable, prevents applying migrations to the wrong database.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Provides granular control over the execution of migrations, reducing the risk of unintended or malicious actions.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Environment variables are used for database connection strings. Basic wrapper scripts exist, but they don't fully leverage all relevant flags or include comprehensive error handling.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of environment variables to control all relevant `migrate` flags.
    *   More robust wrapper scripts with comprehensive error handling and logging.
    *   Formalized process for controlled rollouts using the `-version` flag.
    *   Explicit prohibition of the `-force` flag in production scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Version Control and Explicit Migration Ordering](./mitigation_strategies/version_control_and_explicit_migration_ordering.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Sequential Versioning:** Ensure that your migration files use a consistent, sequential versioning scheme (e.g., timestamps or incrementing numbers).  `migrate` relies on this ordering to apply migrations correctly.
    2.  **Avoid Manual Ordering Changes:** Do *not* manually reorder or rename migration files after they have been created.  This can lead to inconsistencies and errors.
    3.  **Atomic Migrations:** Design each migration file to perform a single, well-defined change.  Avoid combining multiple unrelated changes into a single migration. This makes it easier to understand, review, and revert individual changes.
    4.  **Use `migrate create`:** Always use the `migrate create` command to generate new migration files. This ensures that the files are created with the correct naming convention and structure.  Do *not* manually create migration files.
    5. **Understand `dirty` state:** If a migration fails, `migrate` may mark the database as `dirty`. Understand how to resolve this state, usually by either fixing the failed migration and re-running it, or manually adjusting the `schema_migrations` table (with extreme caution).

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Incorrect Migration Application Order:** (Severity: Medium) - Ensures that migrations are applied in the correct sequence, preventing unexpected schema changes or data corruption.
    *   **Downgrade Attacks (Partial):** (Severity: Medium) - By maintaining a clear and consistent version history, it's easier to track and control which migrations have been applied.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Ensures the integrity and predictability of the migration process.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Mostly implemented. Sequential versioning is used, and `migrate create` is generally used. However, there isn't explicit documentation or enforcement of the "atomic migrations" principle.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal documentation and enforcement of the "atomic migrations" principle.
    *   Training for developers on best practices for creating and managing migration files.
