Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Control Migration Source" attack tree path for applications using `golang-migrate/migrate`.

## Deep Analysis: Control Migration Source (golang-migrate/migrate)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Control Migration Source" attack vector, identify specific vulnerabilities and attack scenarios, evaluate the associated risks, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for developers using `golang-migrate/migrate` to prevent this attack.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack path where an attacker gains control over the source of migration files used by `golang-migrate/migrate`.  This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **File System Sources:**  Local directories, network shares (SMB, NFS), mounted volumes.
*   **Embedded Sources:**  Migration files embedded within the application binary using `io/fs.FS`.
*   **Custom Source Implementations:**  Any custom implementation of the `migrate.Source` interface.
*   **Version Control Systems:**  Git repositories or other VCS used as a source (indirectly, through a local checkout).
*   **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, etc., if used as a migration source.

We will *not* cover attacks that target the database connection itself (e.g., SQL injection through other application vulnerabilities) or attacks that compromise the application's runtime environment *without* first controlling the migration source.  We also won't cover vulnerabilities within the `migrate` library itself, assuming it's used correctly.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use a threat modeling approach to identify specific attack scenarios based on different source types.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  We will analyze potential vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to gain control of the migration source.
3.  **Risk Assessment:**  We will evaluate the likelihood and impact of each identified vulnerability and attack scenario.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  We will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies to prevent or reduce the risk of this attack.
5.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):** We will consider how secure coding practices and code review could identify and prevent these vulnerabilities.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**2.1. Threat Modeling and Attack Scenarios:**

Let's break down the attack scenarios based on different source types:

*   **Scenario 1: Local File System (Unprivileged Access)**

    *   **Attacker Goal:**  Modify migration files in a directory the application reads from.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The application runs with excessive privileges, allowing it to read/write to a directory that an unprivileged user can also modify.  This could be a shared directory, a directory with overly permissive permissions (e.g., `777`), or a directory owned by a user the attacker has compromised.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Attacker gains access to the system (e.g., through phishing, exploiting another vulnerability).
        2.  Attacker identifies the directory used for migration files.
        3.  Attacker modifies existing migration files or adds new malicious ones.
        4.  The application runs the migrations, executing the attacker's SQL code.
    *   **Example:**  The application runs as `root`, and the migration directory is `/opt/myapp/migrations` with permissions `777`.  An attacker with a low-privilege account can modify the files.

*   **Scenario 2: Local File System (Privilege Escalation)**

    *   **Attacker Goal:** Gain write access to a protected migration directory.
    *   **Vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the system (e.g., a kernel exploit, a misconfigured service) that allows the attacker to escalate their privileges.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Attacker gains initial low-privilege access.
        2.  Attacker exploits the privilege escalation vulnerability.
        3.  Attacker modifies the migration files.
        4.  The application runs the migrations.
    *   **Example:**  A zero-day kernel vulnerability allows the attacker to gain root access, even though the migration directory is owned by a dedicated user.

*   **Scenario 3: Network Share (SMB/NFS)**

    *   **Attacker Goal:**  Modify migration files on a network share.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The network share is misconfigured, allowing unauthorized access (e.g., weak authentication, guest access enabled, overly permissive share permissions).
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Attacker gains network access (potentially through a compromised machine on the same network).
        2.  Attacker discovers the network share.
        3.  Attacker connects to the share and modifies the migration files.
        4.  The application runs the migrations.
    *   **Example:**  An SMB share is configured with "Everyone" having read/write access.

*   **Scenario 4: Embedded Source (`io/fs.FS`) - Supply Chain Attack**

    *   **Attacker Goal:**  Inject malicious migration files into the application's build process.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The attacker compromises a dependency or build tool used to create the application binary.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Attacker compromises a third-party library or build script.
        2.  The compromised component injects malicious migration files into the embedded filesystem during the build process.
        3.  The application is built and deployed.
        4.  The application runs the malicious migrations.
    *   **Example:**  A compromised Go module injects a malicious migration file during the `go build` process.

*   **Scenario 5: Version Control System (Git)**

    *   **Attacker Goal:**  Push malicious migration files to a Git repository.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The attacker gains write access to the Git repository (e.g., compromised credentials, weak repository permissions).
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Attacker gains access to the repository.
        2.  Attacker pushes a commit containing malicious migration files.
        3.  The application pulls the latest changes (or a specific compromised commit).
        4.  The application runs the migrations.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker phishes a developer's Git credentials and pushes a malicious migration.

*   **Scenario 6: Cloud Storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)**

    *   **Attacker Goal:** Modify migration files stored in cloud storage.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Misconfigured access control policies (e.g., public read/write access, overly permissive IAM roles), compromised access keys.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1. Attacker obtains access to the cloud storage (e.g., through leaked credentials, misconfigured bucket policies).
        2. Attacker modifies or adds migration files.
        3. The application retrieves and runs the migrations.
    *   **Example:** An S3 bucket used for migrations is accidentally made publicly writable.

**2.2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

The core vulnerability across all scenarios is **insufficient access control** to the migration source.  This can manifest in various ways:

*   **Operating System Permissions:**  Incorrect file or directory permissions on the local filesystem.
*   **Network Share Configuration:**  Weak authentication or authorization on network shares.
*   **Version Control System Permissions:**  Inadequate access controls on the repository.
*   **Cloud Storage Policies:**  Misconfigured access control lists (ACLs) or IAM policies.
*   **Supply Chain Security:**  Vulnerabilities in dependencies or build tools.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application might not validate the source path, potentially allowing directory traversal attacks.
* **Lack of integrity checks:** The application does not verify the integrity of the migration files before executing them.

**2.3. Risk Assessment:**

*   **Impact:** Very High.  Successful exploitation allows arbitrary SQL execution, leading to complete database compromise, data breaches, data modification, and denial of service.
*   **Likelihood:**  Variable (Low to Medium), depending on the specific source and its configuration.  Local filesystem attacks with privilege escalation are less likely than attacks on misconfigured network shares or cloud storage.  Supply chain attacks are also less likely but have a very high impact.
*   **Overall Risk:**  High to Very High.  The combination of high impact and potentially moderate likelihood makes this a critical vulnerability to address.

**2.4. Mitigation Recommendations:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Run the application with the *minimum* necessary privileges.  Do *not* run as `root` or an administrator.
    *   Create a dedicated user account for the application with restricted access.
    *   Ensure the migration directory is owned by this dedicated user and has restrictive permissions (e.g., `700` or `750`).

*   **Secure Network Shares:**
    *   Use strong authentication (e.g., Kerberos, Active Directory) for network shares.
    *   Restrict access to the share to only the necessary users and machines.
    *   Use the most secure protocol available (e.g., SMBv3 with encryption).

*   **Secure Version Control:**
    *   Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for repository access.
    *   Implement branch protection rules to require code reviews before merging changes.
    *   Regularly audit repository permissions.

*   **Secure Cloud Storage:**
    *   Use IAM roles and policies to grant the minimum necessary permissions to the application.
    *   Never make buckets publicly writable.
    *   Use server-side encryption.
    *   Enable logging and monitoring to detect unauthorized access.

*   **Supply Chain Security:**
    *   Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to identify and track dependencies.
    *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use signed commits and verify signatures.
    *   Consider using a private package repository.

*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Validate the migration source path to prevent directory traversal attacks.  Use a whitelist approach if possible.

*   **Integrity Checks:**
    *   **Checksums/Hashes:**  Generate a checksum (e.g., SHA-256) for each migration file and store it securely (e.g., in a separate file, in a database).  Before running a migration, verify the checksum.
    *   **Digital Signatures:**  Digitally sign migration files using a private key.  The application can then verify the signature using the corresponding public key. This provides stronger assurance than checksums.
    *   **Embedded Checksums (for `io/fs.FS`):**  If using embedded migrations, include the checksums within the embedded filesystem itself.

*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   Monitor file system activity for changes to the migration directory.
    *   Monitor network share access logs.
    *   Monitor cloud storage access logs.
    *   Set up alerts for suspicious activity.

*   **Code Review:**
    *   Thoroughly review code that handles migration sources and file access.
    *   Look for potential vulnerabilities related to permissions, input validation, and integrity checks.

* **Separate environments:**
    * Use separate environments (development, staging, production) with distinct databases and migration sources. This prevents accidental execution of development migrations in production.

**2.5. Code Review (Hypothetical):**

During code review, pay close attention to:

*   How the migration source is configured (environment variables, configuration files, hardcoded paths).
*   How the application interacts with the migration source (reading files, listing directories).
*   Any error handling related to file access or source configuration.
*   The use of any security-sensitive functions (e.g., `os.Open`, `filepath.Walk`).
*   The presence of any input validation or integrity checks.

Example of a potential vulnerability in code (Go):

```go
// VULNERABLE CODE - DO NOT USE
func getMigrationDir() string {
	dir := os.Getenv("MIGRATION_DIR") // Reads from environment variable
	if dir == "" {
		dir = "/opt/myapp/migrations" // Hardcoded fallback
	}
	return dir
}
```
This code is vulnerable if the `MIGRATION_DIR` environment variable is not set, and the `/opt/myapp/migrations` directory has overly permissive permissions.

A more secure approach:

```go
// MORE SECURE CODE
func getMigrationDir() (string, error) {
	dir := os.Getenv("MIGRATION_DIR")
	if dir == "" {
		return "", errors.New("MIGRATION_DIR environment variable not set")
	}

    // Basic validation to prevent directory traversal
    if strings.Contains(dir, "..") {
        return "", errors.New("invalid migration directory path")
    }

	// Check if the directory exists and is accessible
	_, err := os.Stat(dir)
	if err != nil {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("migration directory error: %w", err)
	}

	return dir, nil
}
```

This improved version:

1.  Returns an error if `MIGRATION_DIR` is not set.
2.  Performs basic input validation to prevent directory traversal.
3.  Checks if the directory exists and is accessible.

This is still not fully secure (it doesn't check permissions), but it's a significant improvement.  The *best* approach would be to combine this with the Principle of Least Privilege and ensure the directory has restrictive permissions.  Adding integrity checks would further enhance security.

### 3. Conclusion

The "Control Migration Source" attack vector is a serious threat to applications using `golang-migrate/migrate`.  By understanding the various attack scenarios and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this attack and protect their applications and data.  A layered approach, combining secure configuration, access controls, integrity checks, and monitoring, is crucial for effective defense.  Regular security audits and code reviews are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
