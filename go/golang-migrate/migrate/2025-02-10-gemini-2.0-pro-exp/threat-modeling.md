# Threat Model Analysis for golang-migrate/migrate

## Threat: [Unauthorized Migration Execution](./threats/unauthorized_migration_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Migration Execution

    *   **Description:** An attacker, without proper authorization, triggers the execution of database migrations. This is done by directly interacting with the `migrate` tool or any exposed application interfaces that wrap it, bypassing intended access controls.  The attacker might use command-line access or exploit an improperly secured endpoint.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unintended schema changes.
        *   Data loss or corruption.
        *   Application instability or downtime.
        *   Potential for complete database compromise if the attacker can execute arbitrary migrations.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `migrate` CLI tool.
        *   Any exposed HTTP endpoints that wrap `migrate` functionality (if applicable).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure any HTTP endpoints that interact with `migrate` using strong authentication and authorization.  These endpoints should *never* be exposed to untrusted networks.
        *   Implement strict access control on the server/environment where `migrate` is executed.  Only authorized personnel should be able to run the tool.
        *   Integrate migration execution into a secure CI/CD pipeline with mandatory approvals and reviews.  Migrations should *not* be run manually in production.
        *   Do not expose migration functionality directly to end-users.

## Threat: [Injection of Malicious SQL in Migration Files](./threats/injection_of_malicious_sql_in_migration_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Injection of Malicious SQL in Migration Files

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to modify or create migration files, injecting malicious SQL code *that will be executed by `migrate`*. This is a direct attack on the input that `migrate` processes. The malicious SQL could drop tables, steal data, modify data, or even execute operating system commands (if the database allows it).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data loss, corruption, or unauthorized disclosure.
        *   Complete database compromise.
        *   Application downtime.
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Migration files (e.g., `.sql` files) – the direct input to `migrate`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mandatory code reviews for *all* migration files, with a strong focus on security and identifying potentially malicious SQL.
        *   Use static analysis tools (SQL linters) to scan migration files for dangerous SQL patterns (e.g., `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE TABLE`, dynamic SQL without proper sanitization).  Integrate these tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Employ a "least privilege" database user for `migrate`, limiting its permissions to the absolute minimum required for the specific migrations.  This limits the damage potential of injected SQL.

## Threat: [Migration State Table Tampering](./threats/migration_state_table_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Migration State Table Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to *directly modify* the migration state table (e.g., `schema_migrations`) that `migrate` uses to track applied migrations. This is a direct attack on a data structure managed by `migrate`.  They could mark migrations as applied when they haven't been, or vice-versa, leading to inconsistencies or allowing the re-execution of potentially harmful migrations.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Inconsistent database schema.
        *   Data corruption or loss.
        *   Application malfunction.
        *   Potential for re-execution of malicious migrations (if the attacker can also inject malicious SQL).
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   The migration state table (usually `schema_migrations` or a similar name) within the database – a core component managed by `migrate`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly limit direct database access. *Only* the `migrate` tool (running with appropriate credentials) and authorized DBAs should have write access to the migration state table.  Application code should *never* directly modify this table.
        *   Implement database auditing to track all changes to the migration state table, allowing for detection and investigation of unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource-Intensive Migrations](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource-intensive_migrations.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource-Intensive Migrations

    *   **Description:** An attacker repeatedly triggers migrations *using the `migrate` tool* (or an exposed interface to it) that consume significant database resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O). This is a direct attack leveraging `migrate`'s functionality to cause a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Database unavailability.
        *   Application downtime.
        *   Potential for data corruption if migrations are interrupted mid-execution.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `migrate` CLI tool.
        *   Any exposed HTTP endpoints that wrap `migrate` functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and other DoS protection mechanisms on any endpoints that trigger migrations *through `migrate`*.
        *   Carefully design and thoroughly test migrations to ensure they are efficient and do not consume excessive resources.  This is a preventative measure to reduce the effectiveness of a DoS attack.
        *   Break down large migrations into smaller, more manageable steps, reducing the impact of any single migration.
