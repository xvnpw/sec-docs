### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Migration File Handling Vulnerabilities

#### 4.1. Sub-Vector: Malicious Migration File Injection

This sub-vector focuses on attackers injecting malicious migration files into the application's migration source, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled code during database migration processes.

##### 4.1.1. Path: Compromised Development/Deployment Pipeline

*   **Vulnerability:** The development or deployment pipeline is compromised, allowing unauthorized modification of the migration source. This is a critical vulnerability as it bypasses normal security controls and injects malicious code at a trusted stage.

*   **Exploitation:** An attacker can compromise various components of the pipeline:
    *   **Developer Machines:**  Compromising a developer's workstation through phishing, malware, or social engineering can grant access to source code repositories and potentially the ability to push malicious migrations.
    *   **Version Control Systems (e.g., Git):** If access controls are weak or credentials are leaked, attackers can directly commit malicious migration files to the repository. This could involve creating rogue branches, directly modifying protected branches (if permissions are misconfigured), or even compromising the VCS server itself.
    *   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Systems:**  CI/CD systems often have elevated privileges to build, test, and deploy applications. Compromising a CI/CD server or its configuration can allow attackers to inject malicious steps into the pipeline, including replacing legitimate migration files with malicious ones. This is particularly dangerous as CI/CD systems often automate deployments to production environments.
    *   **Artifact Repositories/Deployment Servers:** If migration files are stored in artifact repositories or directly on deployment servers before being processed by `migrate`, compromising these systems allows for direct replacement of legitimate files with malicious versions.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** In more complex scenarios, attackers might compromise upstream dependencies or tooling used in the pipeline, indirectly leading to the injection of malicious migrations.

*   **Impact:** The impact of successful malicious migration file injection via a compromised pipeline is **Critical**.  This is because migration files are executed with database privileges, often administrative or highly privileged.  Consequences can include:
    *   **Full Database Compromise:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, data deletion, and creation of backdoors within the database.
    *   **Application Takeover:** Malicious migrations can modify application logic stored in the database (e.g., stored procedures, functions) or create new administrative users, effectively granting attackers control over the application.
    *   **Data Manipulation and Exfiltration:** Attackers can modify sensitive data, inject malicious content, or exfiltrate valuable information from the database.
    *   **Backdoors and Persistence:**  Attackers can create persistent backdoors within the database or application, allowing for long-term unauthorized access and control even after the initial vulnerability is patched.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Malicious migrations could corrupt database schemas, leading to application failures and denial of service.
    *   **Lateral Movement:**  Database compromise can be a stepping stone for lateral movement within the network, potentially leading to compromise of other systems and data.

*   **Mitigation:**  Securing the development and deployment pipeline is paramount to prevent malicious migration file injection.  Mitigation strategies should be implemented across the entire pipeline:

    *   **Secure the entire development and deployment pipeline:** This is a holistic approach requiring multiple layers of security.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Apply the principle of least privilege to all accounts and systems within the pipeline. Limit access to only what is strictly necessary for each role and process.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Segment the development, staging, and production environments to limit the impact of a compromise in one environment.
        *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the entire pipeline to identify and remediate vulnerabilities proactively.
        *   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and maintain an incident response plan specifically for pipeline compromises to ensure swift and effective response in case of an attack.

    *   **Implement strong access controls for repositories, CI/CD systems, and deployment environments:**
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all accounts accessing critical systems like repositories, CI/CD platforms, and deployment servers.
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to manage permissions based on roles and responsibilities. Regularly review and update access controls.
        *   **Regular Credential Rotation:**  Implement a policy for regular password and API key rotation for all service accounts and users.
        *   **Audit Logging and Monitoring:**  Enable comprehensive audit logging for all actions within the pipeline and implement monitoring to detect suspicious activities.

    *   **Use code signing and integrity checks for migration files to ensure they haven't been tampered with:**
        *   **Digital Signatures:**  Sign migration files using cryptographic signatures to verify their origin and integrity.  Verify signatures before execution in the deployment pipeline.
        *   **Checksums/Hashes:**  Generate checksums or cryptographic hashes of migration files and store them securely. Verify these hashes before execution to detect any unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Consider using immutable infrastructure where components are replaced rather than modified, reducing the window for tampering.

    *   **Regularly audit the pipeline for vulnerabilities and unauthorized access:**
        *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:**  Implement automated vulnerability scanning for all systems and applications within the pipeline.
        *   **Code Review of Pipeline Configurations:**  Regularly review CI/CD pipeline configurations and scripts for security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
        *   **Security Training for Development and Operations Teams:**  Provide regular security training to development and operations teams to raise awareness of pipeline security risks and best practices.

#### 4.2. Sub-Vector: Vulnerabilities in Migration File Parsing/Execution

This sub-vector focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how `migrate` parses and executes migration files, specifically highlighting the risk of SQL injection.

##### 4.2.1. Path: SQL Injection via Migration Files

*   **Vulnerability:** Migration files, especially those written in SQL, can contain dynamically constructed SQL queries without proper parameterization. This creates a classic SQL injection vulnerability, even within the context of database migrations. While direct user input into migration files is unlikely, the vulnerability arises from developers writing insecure dynamic SQL within the migration scripts themselves.

*   **Exploitation:**  While not directly exploitable by external user input in the typical web application sense, SQL injection in migration files can be exploited in several ways:
    *   **Developer Error:** Developers might unintentionally introduce dynamic SQL construction in migration scripts, especially when dealing with variable table names, column names, or data transformations within migrations. For example, using string concatenation to build SQL queries based on configuration values or environment variables.
    *   **Configuration Injection:** If migration scripts rely on external configuration files or environment variables that are not properly sanitized, attackers who can control these configurations could inject malicious SQL fragments.
    *   **Indirect Injection via Data:** In rare cases, if migration scripts process data from an untrusted source (e.g., reading data from a file or external system to populate the database during migration) and this data is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries, it could lead to injection.
    *   **Exploiting Existing Application Vulnerabilities:** If the application itself has vulnerabilities that allow attackers to modify database data, and migration scripts rely on this data without proper sanitization, attackers could indirectly trigger SQL injection during migration execution.

*   **Impact:** The impact of SQL injection vulnerabilities in migration files is **High**. While potentially less directly exploitable than web application SQL injection, successful exploitation can still lead to significant damage:
    *   **Database Compromise:** Similar to pipeline compromise, SQL injection allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and data exfiltration.
    *   **Data Manipulation and Exfiltration:** Attackers can modify or steal sensitive data through injected SQL queries.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Injected SQL could be used to create new administrative users or grant elevated privileges to existing users within the database.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Malicious SQL can corrupt database schemas or data integrity.

*   **Mitigation:** Preventing SQL injection in migration files requires secure coding practices and thorough review:

    *   **Thoroughly review and audit all migration files for SQL injection vulnerabilities:**
        *   **Manual Code Review:** Conduct thorough manual code reviews of all migration files, specifically looking for dynamic SQL construction and potential injection points.
        *   **Security-Focused Code Review:** Ensure code reviews are performed by developers with security awareness and knowledge of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

    *   **Avoid dynamic SQL construction in migration files whenever possible:**
        *   **Static SQL:**  Prefer static SQL queries whenever possible. Design migrations to minimize the need for dynamic query generation.
        *   **Configuration-Driven Migrations (with caution):** If configuration is necessary, carefully validate and sanitize any configuration values used in SQL queries. Avoid directly embedding unsanitized configuration values into SQL strings.

    *   **Use parameterized queries or ORM features within migration scripts to prevent SQL injection:**
        *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Utilize parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) provided by the database driver or ORM. Parameterized queries separate SQL code from data, preventing injection by treating data as data, not executable code.  Most database drivers in Go support parameterized queries.
        *   **ORM Features:** If using an ORM within migration scripts (though less common for migrations themselves, but possible for data seeding or complex migrations), leverage the ORM's built-in features for query building and parameterization.

    *   **Employ static analysis tools to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in migration files:**
        *   **SAST Tools:** Utilize Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools that can analyze code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically scan migration files.
        *   **Database-Specific Linters:** Some databases or database drivers might offer linters or static analysis tools that can detect potential SQL injection risks in SQL code.

    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (if dynamic SQL is unavoidable):**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** If dynamic SQL is absolutely necessary, implement strict input validation on any data used to construct SQL queries. Validate data types, formats, and ranges.
        *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  If string concatenation is unavoidable, use database-specific escaping or encoding functions to sanitize data before embedding it into SQL queries. However, parameterized queries are always the preferred approach.
