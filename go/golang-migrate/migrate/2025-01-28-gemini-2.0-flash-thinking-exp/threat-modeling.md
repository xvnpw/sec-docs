# Threat Model Analysis for golang-migrate/migrate

## Threat: [Tampering with Migration Files](./threats/tampering_with_migration_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized write access to the migration file storage location and modify migration files. When `golang-migrate/migrate` reads and executes these tampered files, it will apply the attacker's malicious changes to the database schema. This could involve injecting malicious SQL, altering schema in unintended and harmful ways, or disrupting the migration process leading to application instability. The attacker might compromise developer machines or version control systems to achieve this.

**Impact:** Database corruption, data manipulation, denial of service, application downtime, potential for unauthorized access if malicious schema changes are introduced that create backdoors or expose data.

**Affected Component:** Migration File Loading (within `golang-migrate/migrate` core), Migration Files (as input to `migrate`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store migration files in a secure version control system with robust access controls, limiting write access to authorized personnel only.
* Implement mandatory code review processes for all migration file changes before they are applied.
* Consider using checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of migration files before `golang-migrate/migrate` executes them.
* Restrict write access to the migration file directory in production environments to only the migration process itself, and ideally, only during controlled migration execution.
* Implement monitoring and alerting for unauthorized modifications to migration files in storage.

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials.md)

**Description:** `golang-migrate/migrate` requires database credentials to connect and perform migrations. If these credentials are exposed due to insecure configuration practices (e.g., hardcoding, insecure storage in configuration files), logging, or accidental leaks, an attacker can obtain them. With these credentials, the attacker can directly access the database, bypassing application security layers, and perform arbitrary database operations, including data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

**Impact:** Database compromise, data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service, complete loss of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Loading (within `golang-migrate/migrate` core), Database Connection (initiated by `golang-migrate/migrate`)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never hardcode database credentials** directly in code or configuration files used by `golang-migrate/migrate`.
* Utilize **environment variables** or **secure secret management systems** (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets) to store and retrieve database credentials for `golang-migrate/migrate`.
* Implement **strict access controls** on configuration files and environment variable storage to prevent unauthorized access to credentials.
* **Avoid logging database connection strings or credentials** in application logs generated by `golang-migrate/migrate` or the application itself.
* **Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest and in transit** where possible, especially when using configuration files.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `golang-migrate/migrate` Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__golang-migratemigrate__library.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities might be discovered within the `golang-migrate/migrate` library itself. If exploited, these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to compromise the migration process or the application using `migrate`. Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, attackers could potentially achieve remote code execution during migration, bypass security controls enforced by `migrate`, or cause a denial of service by exploiting flaws in `migrate`'s execution logic.

**Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution on the migration execution environment, denial of service of the migration process or application, information disclosure related to migration process or database configuration, bypassing intended security mechanisms of `migrate`.

**Affected Component:** `golang-migrate/migrate` Library (Core modules, Parsing logic, Execution Engine, Dependency handling)

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep the `golang-migrate/migrate` library updated to the latest version** to ensure that known vulnerabilities are patched promptly.
* **Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases** (e.g., GitHub Security Advisories, CVE databases) for reported issues in `golang-migrate/migrate` and its dependencies.
* **Perform regular security testing and code audits** of the application and its dependencies, including `golang-migrate/migrate`, to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Subscribe to security mailing lists or vulnerability notification services** related to Go and relevant libraries to stay informed about potential security issues affecting `golang-migrate/migrate`.
* When choosing a specific version of `golang-migrate/migrate`, **review release notes and changelogs** for any mentioned security fixes or improvements.
