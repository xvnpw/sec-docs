## Deep Analysis: Craft Malicious File Paths in API Calls (Wails Application)

This analysis delves into the attack tree path: **Craft malicious file paths in API calls to read, write, or delete sensitive files.** This path highlights a critical vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate file paths sent from the frontend to the Go backend of a Wails application, leading to unauthorized file system access.

**Understanding the Attack Tree Path:**

* **Craft malicious file paths in API calls to read, write, or delete sensitive files. [HR]** - This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. They aim to leverage vulnerabilities in the application to interact with the file system in an unauthorized manner. The "[HR]" signifies this is a High Risk vulnerability.
* **OR: Exploit Frontend Vulnerabilities Related to Wails Integration [HR]** - This indicates the attack originates from the frontend of the Wails application. The attacker will manipulate the frontend to send malicious API calls.
* **AND: Local File Access Manipulation via Wails API [HR]** - This clarifies the nature of the exploitation. The attacker isn't targeting network resources directly but rather manipulating the application's ability to access the local file system through the Wails API.
* **OR: Manipulating File Paths in Wails API Calls [HR]** - This specifies the core technique used by the attacker. They are focusing on manipulating the file path parameters within the API calls.
* **Craft malicious file paths in API calls to read, write, or delete sensitive files. [HR]** - This reiterates the attacker's objective and the specific method: crafting malicious file paths within API calls.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack:**

This attack leverages the communication bridge between the frontend (typically HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and the backend (Go code) in a Wails application. Here's how the attacker might proceed:

1. **Identify Vulnerable API Endpoints:** The attacker will analyze the JavaScript code on the frontend to identify Wails API calls that accept file paths as arguments. These calls are likely associated with functionalities like:
    * File uploading/downloading
    * File saving/opening
    * Configuration file management
    * Log file access
    * Any feature that interacts with the local file system.

2. **Manipulate Frontend Input:** The attacker will find ways to control the input that populates the file path parameters in these API calls. This could involve:
    * **Directly manipulating input fields:** If the file path is based on user input, the attacker can enter malicious paths.
    * **Intercepting and modifying network requests:** Using browser developer tools or proxy software, the attacker can intercept the API call before it's sent and modify the file path parameter.
    * **Exploiting other frontend vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that modifies the API calls.

3. **Craft Malicious File Paths:** The attacker will craft file paths designed to access sensitive files or directories outside the intended scope. Common techniques include:
    * **Path Traversal (../):** Using ".." sequences to navigate up the directory structure and access files outside the intended directory. For example, if the application expects a file in `/app/data/`, the attacker might send `../../../etc/passwd`.
    * **Absolute Paths:** Providing absolute paths to sensitive files, bypassing any intended directory restrictions. For example, `/etc/shadow` on Linux or `C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM` on Windows.
    * **Filename Manipulation:**  Using special characters or reserved filenames that might cause unexpected behavior in the backend file handling logic.
    * **Symbolic Links (Symlinks) and Junction Points:**  Creating or leveraging existing symbolic links or junction points to redirect file access to unintended locations.

4. **Trigger the API Call:** The attacker triggers the manipulated API call, sending the malicious file path to the Go backend.

5. **Exploitation on the Backend:** The Go backend, upon receiving the API call, will attempt to process the provided file path. If proper validation and sanitization are missing, the backend might directly use the malicious path in file system operations (read, write, delete).

**Technical Implications and Vulnerabilities in Wails Context:**

* **Direct Binding of Go Functions:** Wails allows direct binding of Go functions to the frontend. If these functions accept file paths without proper validation, they become prime targets.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The Go backend might not adequately sanitize or validate the file paths received from the frontend, allowing malicious characters and sequences to be processed.
* **Insufficient Path Normalization:** The backend might not normalize file paths (e.g., resolving ".." sequences) before using them, leading to path traversal vulnerabilities.
* **Missing Access Controls:** The backend logic might not enforce proper access controls based on the user or the intended functionality, allowing access to sensitive files.
* **Error Handling and Information Disclosure:** Poor error handling could reveal information about the file system structure or existence of files, aiding the attacker.

**Potential Impacts:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:** Reading sensitive files like configuration files, database credentials, user data, or private keys.
* **Remote Code Execution (in some scenarios):** If the attacker can write to executable files or configuration files that are later executed by the application or the system.
* **Denial of Service:** Deleting critical system or application files, rendering the application unusable.
* **Privilege Escalation:** If the application runs with elevated privileges, the attacker could potentially manipulate system files or gain access to other resources.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization behind it.

**Mitigation Strategies for Development Team:**

To prevent this attack, the development team should implement the following security measures:

* **Strict Input Validation on the Backend:**
    * **Whitelist Allowed Characters:**  Only allow a predefined set of safe characters in file paths.
    * **Regular Expression Matching:** Use regular expressions to enforce expected file path formats.
    * **Reject Suspicious Characters:**  Explicitly reject characters like "..", "/", "\", ":", "*", "?", "<", ">", "|".
* **Path Sanitization and Normalization:**
    * **Canonicalization:**  Use functions provided by the operating system or libraries to canonicalize file paths, resolving symbolic links and ".." sequences.
    * **Absolute Path Resolution:**  Convert relative paths to absolute paths and verify they fall within the expected directory.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Backend Process Permissions:** Ensure the Go backend process runs with the minimum necessary privileges to perform its tasks. Avoid running with root or administrator privileges.
    * **Restrict File System Access:**  Limit the application's access to specific directories required for its functionality.
* **Secure API Design:**
    * **Avoid Exposing Raw File Paths:**  Instead of directly accepting file paths from the frontend, consider using identifiers or indices to represent files on the backend.
    * **Abstraction Layers:**  Implement an abstraction layer between the frontend and the file system operations. This layer can handle validation and access control.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Use Safe File I/O Functions:**  Utilize secure file I/O functions provided by the Go standard library or trusted third-party libraries.
    * **Avoid String Concatenation for Paths:**  Use path manipulation functions provided by the `path/filepath` package in Go to construct file paths safely.
* **Frontend Security Measures:**
    * **Input Sanitization on the Frontend:** While backend validation is crucial, sanitizing input on the frontend can prevent simple attacks.
    * **Prevent XSS Vulnerabilities:** Implement robust measures to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which could be used to manipulate API calls.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools to automatically detect potential security flaws.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing and identify vulnerabilities in a realistic attack scenario.
* **Error Handling and Logging:**
    * **Avoid Exposing Sensitive Information in Error Messages:**  Generic error messages should be returned to the frontend.
    * **Comprehensive Logging:** Log file access attempts and errors on the backend for auditing and incident response.

**Code Examples (Illustrative - Go Backend):**

**Vulnerable Code (Directly using user input):**

```go
func handleReadFile(filePath string) (string, error) {
    data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filePath) // Vulnerable!
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    return string(data), nil
}
```

**Secure Code (Using validation and path manipulation):**

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"path/filepath"
	"strings"
)

func handleReadFileSecure(userProvidedPath string) (string, error) {
	// Define the allowed base directory
	baseDir := "/app/data/"

	// Sanitize and normalize the path
	cleanPath := filepath.Clean(userProvidedPath)

	// Prevent path traversal
	if strings.Contains(cleanPath, "..") {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("invalid file path: path traversal detected")
	}

	// Construct the absolute path within the allowed base directory
	fullPath := filepath.Join(baseDir, cleanPath)

	// Check if the file is within the allowed directory
	if !strings.HasPrefix(fullPath, baseDir) {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("access denied: file outside allowed directory")
	}

	data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(fullPath)
	if err != nil {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("error reading file: %w", err)
	}
	return string(data), nil
}
```

**Conclusion:**

The ability to craft malicious file paths in API calls represents a significant security risk for Wails applications. By understanding the attack vectors and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation. Prioritizing input validation, path sanitization, and the principle of least privilege are crucial steps in securing the application against this type of attack. Regular security assessments and code reviews are essential to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
