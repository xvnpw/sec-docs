## Deep Analysis: Manipulating File Paths in Wails API Calls

As a cybersecurity expert working with your development team, I've conducted a deep analysis of the attack tree path: **Manipulating File Paths in Wails API Calls**. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and actionable mitigation strategies for your Wails application.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

This attack path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how your Wails application handles file paths passed from the frontend (JavaScript/HTML/CSS) to the backend (Go) through Wails API calls. The core issue lies in the potential for attackers to inject malicious file paths that, when processed by the backend, can lead to unintended and harmful actions.

Let's break down each stage of the attack tree path:

**1. Exploit Frontend Vulnerabilities Related to Wails Integration:**

* **Description:** This is the initial entry point. Attackers leverage weaknesses in the frontend code that interacts with the Wails API. This could involve:
    * **Lack of Input Validation:** Frontend forms or user interactions that allow arbitrary file paths to be entered without proper sanitization or validation.
    * **JavaScript Manipulation:** Attackers might directly manipulate JavaScript code to craft malicious API calls with altered file paths.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  If your application is vulnerable to XSS, attackers could inject malicious scripts that execute in the user's browser and make API calls with manipulated file paths.

**2. Local File Access Manipulation via Wails API:**

* **Description:** Once a vulnerability in the frontend allows for the injection of potentially malicious file paths, the attacker can then target Wails API calls that interact with the local file system. Wails provides mechanisms for the frontend to trigger backend Go functions, and if these functions handle file paths without proper security measures, they become vulnerable.

**3. Manipulating File Paths in Wails API Calls:**

* **Description (Detailed Focus):** This is the crux of the vulnerability. Attackers craft malicious file paths within the arguments of Wails API calls intended for file system operations. These malicious paths can exploit weaknesses in how the backend Go code processes them.

**Specific Attack Vectors within "Manipulating File Paths in Wails API Calls":**

* **Directory Traversal (Path Traversal):**
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers use special characters like `../` to navigate up the directory structure, potentially accessing files and directories outside the intended scope.
    * **Example:**  Imagine a Wails API call to read a user's profile picture. An attacker could manipulate the file path to something like `../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to read sensitive system files.
    * **Impact:** Reading sensitive configuration files, application source code, or even system files.

* **Absolute Path Injection:**
    * **Mechanism:** Instead of relative paths, attackers provide absolute paths to files they want to access or manipulate.
    * **Example:** If the API expects a filename within a specific user directory, an attacker could provide `/etc/shadow` as the path.
    * **Impact:** Similar to directory traversal, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive system files.

* **Filename Injection/Overwriting:**
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers might be able to inject or manipulate the filename itself in API calls related to file writing or creation.
    * **Example:** An API call to save a user's document could be manipulated to save the document as a different filename or in a different location, potentially overwriting critical application files or user data.
    * **Impact:** Data loss, application malfunction, or even the introduction of malicious files.

* **File Deletion:**
    * **Mechanism:** If an API call allows for file deletion based on a provided path, attackers could manipulate this path to delete critical application files or user data.
    * **Example:** An API call intended to delete temporary files could be manipulated to delete important user documents.
    * **Impact:** Data loss, denial of service, or application instability.

* **Symbolic Link Exploitation:**
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers could potentially create or leverage existing symbolic links on the user's system to redirect file operations to unintended locations.
    * **Example:** An API call to read a file in a specific directory could be redirected via a symlink to a sensitive system file.
    * **Impact:** Similar to other path manipulation attacks, leading to unauthorized access or modification.

**Potential Impact of Successful Attacks:**

* **Data Breaches:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive user data, configuration files, or even application source code.
* **System Compromise:** Potentially gaining access to system files or executing arbitrary code if the application runs with elevated privileges.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Deleting critical application files or causing the application to malfunction.
* **Reputation Damage:** Loss of user trust and negative publicity due to security breaches.
* **Malware Installation:** In some scenarios, attackers could potentially write malicious files to the user's system.

**Mitigation Strategies for the Development Team:**

To effectively defend against this attack path, implement the following security measures:

* **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Frontend:** Implement strict validation on the frontend to ensure that user-provided file paths conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious characters or sequences (e.g., `../`, absolute paths).
    * **Backend:** **Crucially**, never rely solely on frontend validation. Implement thorough validation and sanitization of all file paths received from the frontend within your Go backend code.
    * **Whitelist Approach:**  Whenever possible, define a whitelist of allowed characters, file extensions, and directory structures. Only accept paths that strictly adhere to this whitelist.
    * **Regular Expression Matching:** Use regular expressions to enforce allowed path patterns and reject suspicious inputs.

* **Path Canonicalization:**
    * **Backend:** Use Go's `path/filepath` package functions like `filepath.Clean()` and `filepath.Abs()` to normalize and resolve file paths. This helps eliminate relative path components and ensures you are working with the intended file.

* **Restrict File System Access (Principle of Least Privilege):**
    * **Backend:** Design your backend logic so that it only accesses the necessary files and directories. Avoid granting broad file system access to the application.
    * **Sandboxing:** Consider using sandboxing techniques to isolate the application's file system operations.

* **Avoid Constructing File Paths from User Input Directly:**
    * **Backend:** Instead of directly using user-provided file paths, use them as identifiers to look up the actual file path from a predefined and controlled mapping or configuration.

* **Secure API Design:**
    * **Backend:** Design your Wails API calls so that they don't directly expose file system operations based on arbitrary user input. Consider using higher-level abstractions or specific commands instead of raw file paths.

* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    * **Regularly review your frontend and backend code, especially the parts that handle file paths and interact with the Wails API.** Look for potential vulnerabilities and ensure that security best practices are followed.
    * **Consider penetration testing to identify potential weaknesses in your application's security.**

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Frontend:** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks, which could be used to manipulate API calls.

* **Update Dependencies:**
    * **Keep your Wails library and other dependencies up to date.** Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched in these libraries.

* **Educate Developers:**
    * **Ensure your development team is aware of the risks associated with file path manipulation vulnerabilities and understands how to implement secure coding practices.**

**Illustrative Code Example (Go Backend - Basic Sanitization):**

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
	"strings"
)

// Wails exposed function to read a file
func (a *App) ReadFile(filePath string) (string, error) {
	// Basic sanitization - prevent directory traversal
	if strings.Contains(filePath, "..") {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("invalid file path: directory traversal detected")
	}

	// Construct the expected path (assuming files are within a specific directory)
	baseDir := "/path/to/your/allowed/files/"
	fullPath := filepath.Join(baseDir, filepath.Clean(filePath))

	// Check if the resolved path is still within the allowed directory
	if !strings.HasPrefix(fullPath, baseDir) {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("invalid file path: outside allowed directory")
	}

	content, err := os.ReadFile(fullPath)
	if err != nil {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to read file: %w", err)
	}
	return string(content), nil
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

* The provided code example is a basic illustration. Real-world scenarios may require more sophisticated validation and sanitization techniques.
* Always prioritize a whitelist approach over a blacklist approach for input validation.
* Regularly review and update your security measures as new vulnerabilities are discovered.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

1. **Prioritize input validation and sanitization at both the frontend and backend levels.**
2. **Implement path canonicalization in your backend Go code.**
3. **Restrict file system access based on the principle of least privilege.**
4. **Avoid directly using user-provided file paths in file system operations.**
5. **Conduct thorough security audits and code reviews, focusing on Wails API interactions and file handling.**
6. **Stay updated with the latest security advisories and best practices for Wails development.**

By understanding the mechanisms of this attack path and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, you can significantly strengthen the security of your Wails application and protect your users from potential harm. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and continuous vigilance is crucial.
