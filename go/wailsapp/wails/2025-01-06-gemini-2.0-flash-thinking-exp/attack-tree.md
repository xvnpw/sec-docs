## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Tampering via Bridge](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_tampering_via_bridge.md)

* **Exploit Backend Vulnerabilities via Wails Bridge:**
    * **Insecurely Implemented Backend Functions Exposed via Wails Bridge:**
        * **Parameter Tampering via Bridge:**
            * Attackers intercept and modify data sent from the frontend to the backend via the Wails bridge.
            * This can lead to unintended backend behavior, such as unauthorized data modification, bypassing access controls, or triggering unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Input Validation on Backend Exposed Functions](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_input_validation_on_backend_exposed_functions.md)

* **Exploit Backend Vulnerabilities via Wails Bridge:**
    * **Insecurely Implemented Backend Functions Exposed via Wails Bridge:**
        * **Lack of Input Validation on Backend Exposed Functions:**
            * Backend functions exposed through the Wails bridge do not properly validate input received from the frontend.
            * Attackers can send malicious input to exploit vulnerabilities like:
                * **Command Injection:** Injecting shell commands into input fields that are executed by the backend.
                * **Path Traversal:** Manipulating file paths to access files or directories outside the intended scope.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abusing Exposed Go Functions through JavaScript](./attack_tree_paths/abusing_exposed_go_functions_through_javascript.md)

* **Exploit Frontend Vulnerabilities Related to Wails Integration:**
    * **Manipulation of Wails API Calls from Frontend:**
        * **Abusing Exposed Go Functions through JavaScript:**
            * Attackers call backend functions in unexpected sequences or with malicious arguments from the frontend JavaScript.
            * This can lead to unintended backend actions, data manipulation, or even denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Wails renders backend data in the frontend.](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_how_wails_renders_backend_data_in_the_frontend.md)

* **Exploit Frontend Vulnerabilities Related to Wails Integration:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Wails-Specific Contexts:**
        * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Wails renders backend data in the frontend:**
            * Wails does not properly sanitize data received from the backend before displaying it in the frontend.
            * Attackers inject malicious scripts through backend data, which are then executed in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulating File Paths in Wails API Calls](./attack_tree_paths/manipulating_file_paths_in_wails_api_calls.md)

* **Exploit Frontend Vulnerabilities Related to Wails Integration:**
    * **Local File Access Manipulation via Wails API:**
        * **Manipulating File Paths in Wails API Calls:**
            * Attackers craft malicious file paths in API calls intended for file system access.
            * This can allow them to read, write, or delete sensitive files on the user's system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Function Call Injection via Bridge](./attack_tree_paths/function_call_injection_via_bridge.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Function Call Injection via Bridge:**
    * Attackers craft malicious function calls through the Wails bridge.
    * If the bridge doesn't properly sanitize or validate function names and arguments, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the backend server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Wails Bridge Communication](./attack_tree_paths/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_wails_bridge_communication.md)

* **Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Wails Bridge Communication:**
    * Wails uses serialization and deserialization to exchange data between the frontend and backend.
    * Vulnerabilities in the deserialization process (e.g., using insecure libraries or not validating data) allow attackers to send malicious serialized data.
    * Upon deserialization, this can lead to remote code execution on the backend.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing Restrictions on File System Access](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_restrictions_on_file_system_access.md)

* **Bypassing Restrictions on File System Access:**
    * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Wails' file system access API.
    * This allows them to bypass intended access controls and access files outside the designated scope, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive user data or application files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Wails Core](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__in_wails_core.md)

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Wails Core:**
    * Attackers discover and exploit vulnerabilities within the Wails Go runtime or its dependencies.
    * Successful exploitation allows them to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine, leading to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Privilege Escalation via Wails Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/privilege_escalation_via_wails_functionality.md)

* **Privilege Escalation via Wails Functionality:**
    * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within the Wails framework.
    * This allows them to gain higher privileges on the operating system than they are intended to have, enabling them to perform administrative tasks or access restricted resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Wails](./attack_tree_paths/memory_corruption_vulnerabilities_in_wails.md)

* **Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Wails:**
    * Attackers exploit memory management issues within the Wails runtime.
    * This can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or, critically, the ability to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Wails Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_wails_dependencies.md)

* **Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Wails Dependencies:**
    * Attackers compromise dependencies used by Wails (either Go modules or frontend libraries).
    * This allows them to inject malicious code into the application during the build process, potentially affecting all users of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Handling of Updates or Auto-Updates](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_handling_of_updates_or_auto-updates.md)

* **Insecure Handling of Updates or Auto-Updates:**
    * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application's update mechanism.
    * This allows them to deliver malicious updates to users, potentially installing malware or backdoors on their systems.
