# Threat Model Analysis for wailsapp/wails

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Exposed Go Function](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_exposed_go_function.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious input to an exposed Go function, exploiting a lack of input validation or a vulnerability in the function's logic. This could involve sending unexpected data types, overly long strings, or specially crafted payloads. The attacker might leverage this to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the application.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's system, including data theft, malware installation, and system disruption.
    *   **Affected Wails Component:**  `Exposed Go Functions` (specifically, the individual functions exposed via the `Bind` method).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all parameters of exposed Go functions.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when exposing functions; only expose necessary functionality.
        *   Use type checking and data validation libraries in Go to ensure input conforms to expected formats.
        *   Consider using a well-defined API schema and validation framework.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration through Exposed Go Function](./threats/data_exfiltration_through_exposed_go_function.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could call an exposed Go function in a way that reveals sensitive information not intended for frontend access. This might involve exploiting functions that return internal application state or database query results without proper filtering.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, potentially leading to privacy breaches, financial loss, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Wails Component:** `Exposed Go Functions` (specifically, functions that return data to the frontend).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review the data returned by exposed functions and ensure it does not contain sensitive information.
        *   Implement access control and authorization checks within Go functions to restrict data access based on user roles or permissions.
        *   Sanitize and filter data before returning it to the frontend.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization Leading to Code Execution](./threats/insecure_deserialization_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could send a maliciously crafted serialized payload from the frontend to the Go backend. If the deserialization process is vulnerable, this payload could be interpreted as executable code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's system, similar to arbitrary code execution via exposed functions.
    *   **Affected Wails Component:** `Wails Bridge` (specifically, the serialization/deserialization mechanism used for communication).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using insecure deserialization libraries or default serialization methods with known vulnerabilities.
        *   Prefer using data formats like JSON, which are generally safer for deserialization.
        *   If using binary serialization, ensure the library is up-to-date and has no known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement integrity checks on serialized data to detect tampering.

## Threat: [Data Injection into Go Backend](./threats/data_injection_into_go_backend.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate data sent from the frontend to the Go backend, injecting malicious content that is then processed without proper sanitization. This could lead to vulnerabilities like command injection (if the data is used in system calls) or SQL injection (if the data is used in database queries).
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the injection type, impacts can range from arbitrary code execution on the server to unauthorized data access or modification in the database.
    *   **Affected Wails Component:** `Wails Bridge` (data transfer between frontend and backend) and the specific Go functions processing the data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the Go backend for all data received from the frontend.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Avoid directly executing system commands based on user input. If necessary, use secure alternatives and sanitize input thoroughly.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Insecure OS Interaction](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_insecure_os_interaction.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in the Go backend's code that interacts with the operating system could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges. This could happen if the application executes commands with higher privileges than necessary or if there are vulnerabilities in the way the application interacts with system APIs.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the user's system, allowing the attacker to perform actions with administrative or root privileges.
    *   **Affected Wails Component:** `Go Backend` (specifically, code interacting with the operating system).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the need for direct OS interactions.
        *   Run the application with the least necessary privileges.
        *   Carefully review and audit all code that interacts with the operating system.
        *   Use secure APIs provided by the operating system whenever possible.
        *   Avoid executing external commands based on user input without thorough sanitization.

## Threat: [Arbitrary File System Access via Insecure OS Interaction](./threats/arbitrary_file_system_access_via_insecure_os_interaction.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the Go backend's file system operations could allow an attacker to read, write, or delete arbitrary files on the user's system. This might involve improper path handling, lack of access control checks, or the use of insecure file system APIs.
    *   **Impact:**  Data theft, data corruption, or denial of service by deleting critical system files.
    *   **Affected Wails Component:** `Go Backend` (specifically, code performing file system operations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all file paths provided by users or external sources.
        *   Use absolute paths instead of relative paths whenever possible.
        *   Implement strict access control checks to ensure users can only access authorized files.
        *   Avoid using functions that operate on arbitrary file paths without careful validation.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Insecure OS Interaction](./threats/command_injection_via_insecure_os_interaction.md)

*   **Description:** If the Go backend executes external commands based on user input or data from the frontend without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious commands that are executed on the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the server with the privileges of the application.
    *   **Affected Wails Component:** `Go Backend` (specifically, code executing external commands).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid executing external commands based on user input whenever possible.
        *   If necessary, sanitize and validate all input used in commands using robust escaping techniques.
        *   Use libraries or functions specifically designed for safe command execution.
        *   Consider using alternative approaches that don't involve executing external commands.
