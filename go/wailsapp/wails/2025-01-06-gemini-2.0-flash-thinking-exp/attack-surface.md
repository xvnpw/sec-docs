# Attack Surface Analysis for wailsapp/wails

## Attack Surface: [Insecurely Implemented Bound Functions](./attack_surfaces/insecurely_implemented_bound_functions.md)

*   **Description:** Go functions exposed to the frontend via the `Bind` mechanism that contain vulnerabilities due to lack of input validation, insecure logic, or unsafe operations.
    *   **How Wails Contributes:** Wails provides the explicit mechanism (`Bind`) to expose backend functionality to the frontend, making these functions a direct entry point.
    *   **Example:** A bound function that takes a filename as input from the frontend and directly opens the file without proper path sanitization, allowing access to arbitrary files on the system.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, arbitrary file access, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data received from the frontend in bound functions.
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing bound functions, limiting their capabilities to the necessary actions.
            *   Avoid performing sensitive operations directly based on frontend input without thorough validation.
            *   Regularly review and audit bound function code for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Bindings](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_bindings.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing too many Go functions or functions with broad capabilities to the frontend, increasing the potential attack surface.
    *   **How Wails Contributes:** The ease of binding functions can lead to over-exposure of backend logic.
    *   **Example:** Binding a function that allows execution of arbitrary shell commands without restriction.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Only bind the necessary functions required for the frontend functionality.
            *   Restrict the capabilities of bound functions to the minimum required.
            *   Carefully consider the potential impact of each bound function if compromised.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Backend Data in the Frontend](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_backend_data_in_the_frontend.md)

*   **Description:**  Frontend code failing to properly sanitize or escape data received from the Go backend via bound functions before rendering it in the DOM, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Wails Contributes:** Wails facilitates the transfer of data from the Go backend to the frontend, and if this data is not handled securely in the frontend, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A bound function returns user-provided text, and the frontend directly renders this text in the HTML without escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser, session hijacking, data theft, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Always sanitize and escape data received from the backend before rendering it in the DOM.
            *   Utilize frontend frameworks and libraries that provide built-in protection against XSS.
            *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the application's update process allowing attackers to distribute malicious updates.
    *   **How Wails Contributes:** If a Wails application implements its own update mechanism, it introduces this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An update process that downloads updates over HTTP without verifying the signature of the update file.
    *   **Impact:** Installation of malware, complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement secure update mechanisms that verify the integrity and authenticity of updates using digital signatures.
            *   Use HTTPS for downloading updates.
            *   Consider using established and secure update frameworks or services.
