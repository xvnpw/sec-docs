Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on "Custom Go Code Vulnerabilities" within a Wails application.

## Deep Analysis: Custom Go Code Vulnerabilities in Wails Applications

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the potential for and impact of vulnerabilities introduced within the custom Go code of a Wails application, specifically focusing on the identified attack vectors: Command Injection, Path Traversal, Insecure Deserialization, and SQL Injection.  The goal is to identify mitigation strategies and provide actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the application's security posture.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the Go backend code of the Wails application.  It does *not* cover:

*   **Frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript) vulnerabilities:**  While the frontend can be a source of malicious input, this analysis concentrates on how the Go backend *handles* that input.  Frontend security is a separate, albeit related, concern.
*   **Wails framework vulnerabilities:** We assume the Wails framework itself is reasonably secure and up-to-date.  The focus is on *misuse* of the framework or vulnerabilities in code *layered on top* of Wails.
*   **Third-party Go library vulnerabilities:** While important, this analysis focuses on the application's *own* Go code.  Third-party library vulnerabilities should be addressed through regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning.
*   **Deployment environment vulnerabilities:**  This analysis focuses on the application code itself, not the server or infrastructure it runs on.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  A manual review of the Go source code will be the primary method.  This will involve:
    *   Identifying all entry points where user-supplied data enters the Go backend (e.g., Wails bindings, API endpoints).
    *   Tracing the flow of this data through the application logic.
    *   Examining how this data is used, particularly in security-sensitive operations (e.g., file system access, command execution, database queries, deserialization).
    *   Looking for patterns known to be vulnerable (e.g., direct use of user input in `os.Exec`, `filepath.Join` without sanitization, `gob` decoding of untrusted data, string concatenation in SQL queries).

2.  **Automated Static Analysis (SAST):**  Employing static analysis tools to automatically scan the Go code for potential vulnerabilities.  Tools like:
    *   **`go vet`:**  The standard Go vet tool catches many common errors.
    *   **`staticcheck`:**  A more advanced linter that finds potential bugs and style issues.
    *   **`gosec`:**  A security-focused linter specifically designed to find security vulnerabilities in Go code.
    *   **Semgrep:** A general-purpose static analysis tool that can be configured with custom rules to detect specific vulnerability patterns.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing - Optional but Recommended):**  If feasible, fuzzing can be used to test the application's resilience to unexpected input.  This involves:
    *   Creating a fuzzer that generates a large number of random or semi-random inputs.
    *   Feeding these inputs to the application's Go backend (through Wails bindings or API endpoints).
    *   Monitoring the application for crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior that might indicate a vulnerability.
    *   Tools like `go-fuzz` can be used for this purpose.

4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Consider the application's specific functionality and data flows to identify the most likely and impactful attack scenarios.  This helps prioritize mitigation efforts.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Vectors

Now, let's dive into each specific attack vector:

#### 4.1 Command Injection

*   **Description:**  The attacker injects operating system commands into input fields that are then executed by the Go application.

*   **Wails-Specific Considerations:**  Wails bindings are a primary vector.  If a binding exposes a Go function that takes a string as input and uses it directly in `os.Exec` (or similar functions like `exec.Command`), it's highly vulnerable.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Identify all uses of `os.Exec`, `exec.Command`, and related functions.
    *   Trace the origin of the arguments passed to these functions.  Are they derived from user input?
    *   Check for any sanitization or validation of the input *before* it's used in the command.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `os.Exec` whenever possible:**  If the task can be accomplished using Go's standard library functions (e.g., file system operations, network requests), use those instead.
    *   **Use `exec.Command` with separate arguments:**  Instead of constructing a single command string, use `exec.Command` with separate arguments.  This prevents the shell from interpreting special characters.
        ```go
        // VULNERABLE:
        cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "ls -l "+userInput)
        // SAFER:
        cmd := exec.Command("ls", "-l", userInput)
        ```
    *   **Whitelisting:**  If possible, restrict the allowed commands or arguments to a predefined, safe set.
    *   **Input Validation:**  If you must use user input, rigorously validate it.  Use regular expressions to ensure it conforms to the expected format (e.g., a valid filename).  *Never* trust user input.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the lowest possible privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve command execution.

*   **Example (Vulnerable Code):**

    ```go
    // Wails binding
    func (a *App) RunCommand(command string) string {
        out, err := exec.Command("sh", "-c", command).CombinedOutput()
        if err != nil {
            return err.Error()
        }
        return string(out)
    }
    ```
    An attacker could call this binding with `RunCommand("ls -l; rm -rf /")`.

*   **Example (Mitigated Code):**

    ```go
    // Wails binding - only allows listing files in a specific directory
    func (a *App) ListFiles(dir string) string {
        // Validate that 'dir' is a subdirectory of the allowed base directory
        baseDir := "/path/to/allowed/directory"
        absDir, err := filepath.Abs(filepath.Join(baseDir, dir))
        if err != nil || !strings.HasPrefix(absDir, baseDir) {
            return "Invalid directory"
        }

        out, err := exec.Command("ls", "-l", absDir).CombinedOutput()
        if err != nil {
            return err.Error()
        }
        return string(out)
    }
    ```

#### 4.2 Path Traversal

*   **Description:** The attacker manipulates file paths provided as input to access files or directories outside the intended scope.

*   **Wails-Specific Considerations:**  Bindings that expose file system operations (reading, writing, deleting files) are prime targets.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Identify all functions that use user-provided input to construct file paths (e.g., `os.Open`, `os.Create`, `ioutil.ReadFile`, `filepath.Join`).
    *   Check for proper sanitization and validation of the input to prevent ".." sequences or absolute paths.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use `filepath.Join` carefully:**  While `filepath.Join` helps with platform compatibility, it *doesn't* prevent path traversal on its own.
    *   **Normalize paths with `filepath.Clean`:**  This removes redundant separators and "." and ".." elements, but it *doesn't* prevent escaping the base directory.
    *   **Validate against a base directory:**  The most robust approach is to:
        1.  Define a base directory that the application is allowed to access.
        2.  Join the user-provided path with the base directory using `filepath.Join`.
        3.  Get the absolute path using `filepath.Abs`.
        4.  Check if the resulting absolute path starts with the base directory's absolute path using `strings.HasPrefix`.
    *   **Whitelisting:**  If possible, restrict the allowed filenames or directories to a predefined set.
    *   **Avoid user-controlled filenames:**  If possible, generate filenames internally (e.g., using UUIDs) rather than relying on user input.

*   **Example (Vulnerable Code):**

    ```go
    // Wails binding
    func (a *App) ReadFile(filename string) string {
        data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filename)
        if err != nil {
            return err.Error()
        }
        return string(data)
    }
    ```
    An attacker could call this with `ReadFile("../../../etc/passwd")`.

*   **Example (Mitigated Code):**

    ```go
    // Wails binding
    func (a *App) ReadFile(filename string) string {
        baseDir := "/path/to/allowed/directory"
        absPath, err := filepath.Abs(filepath.Join(baseDir, filename))
        if err != nil || !strings.HasPrefix(absPath, baseDir) {
            return "Invalid file path"
        }

        data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(absPath)
        if err != nil {
            return err.Error()
        }
        return string(data)
    }
    ```

#### 4.3 Insecure Deserialization

*   **Description:** The application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

*   **Wails-Specific Considerations:**  If the Go backend receives data from the frontend (e.g., through bindings) and deserializes it using `gob`, `encoding/json`, `encoding/xml`, or other serialization formats, it's potentially vulnerable.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Identify all uses of deserialization functions (e.g., `gob.NewDecoder().Decode()`, `json.Unmarshal()`, `xml.Unmarshal()`).
    *   Determine the source of the data being deserialized.  Is it coming from the frontend?
    *   Check for any type validation or whitelisting *before* deserialization.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid deserializing untrusted data:**  If possible, avoid sending complex data structures from the frontend to the backend.  Use simple data types (strings, numbers, booleans) whenever possible.
    *   **Use a safe deserialization library:**  Some libraries offer more secure deserialization options.  For example, `encoding/json` is generally safer than `gob` for untrusted data.
    *   **Type validation:**  Before deserializing, validate that the data conforms to the expected type.  Use a schema validation library if necessary.
    *   **Whitelisting:**  If you must deserialize complex objects, create a whitelist of allowed types and reject any data that doesn't match.
    *   **Consider alternatives:**  Explore alternatives to serialization, such as using a well-defined API with simple data types.

*   **Example (Vulnerable Code - `gob`):**

    ```go
    // Wails binding
    func (a *App) ProcessData(data []byte) string {
        var obj interface{}
        decoder := gob.NewDecoder(bytes.NewReader(data))
        err := decoder.Decode(&obj)
        if err != nil {
            return err.Error()
        }
        // ... process the object ...
        return "Data processed"
    }
    ```
    An attacker could craft a malicious `gob` payload to execute arbitrary code.

*   **Example (Mitigated Code - `json` with type validation):**

    ```go
    type MyData struct {
        Name string `json:"name"`
        Age  int    `json:"age"`
    }

    // Wails binding
    func (a *App) ProcessData(data []byte) string {
        var myData MyData
        err := json.Unmarshal(data, &myData)
        if err != nil {
            return "Invalid data format"
        }

        // Validate the data
        if myData.Age < 0 || myData.Age > 120 {
            return "Invalid age"
        }
        if len(myData.Name) > 100 {
            return "Name too long"
        }

        // ... process the validated data ...
        return "Data processed"
    }
    ```

#### 4.4 SQL Injection

*   **Description:** If the application interacts with a database, the attacker injects SQL code into input fields to manipulate database queries.

*   **Wails-Specific Considerations:**  Any Wails binding that takes user input and uses it to construct SQL queries is vulnerable.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Identify all database interactions (e.g., using `database/sql`, `gorm`, `xorm`).
    *   Examine how SQL queries are constructed.  Are they using string concatenation with user input?
    *   Check for the use of parameterized queries or prepared statements.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use parameterized queries (prepared statements):**  This is the *most important* mitigation.  Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the data, preventing the database from interpreting user input as code.
        ```go
        // VULNERABLE:
        rows, err := db.Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'")

        // SAFE (using database/sql):
        rows, err := db.Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", username)

        // SAFE (using GORM):
        var user User
        db.Where("username = ?", username).First(&user)
        ```
    *   **Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):**  ORMs like GORM and Xorm often handle parameterized queries automatically, reducing the risk of SQL injection.  However, *always* verify that the ORM is used correctly and doesn't have any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation:**  While not a primary defense, validate user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format (e.g., a valid username or email address).
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Grant the database user only the necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve SQL injection.
    *   **Stored Procedures:** Consider using stored procedures for complex queries. This can help encapsulate the SQL logic and reduce the risk of injection.

*   **Example (Vulnerable Code):**

    ```go
    // Wails binding
    func (a *App) GetUser(username string) string {
        rows, err := a.DB.Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'")
        // ... process the results ...
    }
    ```
    An attacker could call this with `GetUser("admin' OR '1'='1")`.

*   **Example (Mitigated Code):**

    ```go
    // Wails binding
    func (a *App) GetUser(username string) string {
        rows, err := a.DB.Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", username)
        // ... process the results ...
    }
    ```

### 5. Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Mitigation:** Address the most critical vulnerabilities first. Command injection and SQL injection are typically the highest priority due to their potential for severe impact.
2.  **Secure Coding Training:** Provide secure coding training to the development team, focusing on Go-specific vulnerabilities and best practices.
3.  **Regular Code Reviews:** Implement a mandatory code review process for all changes, with a specific focus on security.
4.  **Automated Security Testing:** Integrate SAST tools (like `gosec` and Semgrep) into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect vulnerabilities early in the development process.
5.  **Fuzzing (Optional but Recommended):**  If resources permit, implement fuzzing to test the application's resilience to unexpected input.
6.  **Dependency Management:** Regularly update all Go dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `dependabot` to automate this process.
7.  **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the lowest possible privileges, both in the operating system and the database.
8.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for *all* user-supplied data.
9.  **Error Handling:**  Implement proper error handling.  Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages.
10. **Documentation:** Document all security-related decisions and mitigations.
11. **Penetration Testing:** Consider periodic penetration testing by external security experts to identify vulnerabilities that might have been missed during internal reviews.
