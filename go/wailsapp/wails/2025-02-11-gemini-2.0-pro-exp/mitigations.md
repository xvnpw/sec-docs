## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation (Wails Bridge)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation__wails_bridge_.md)

**1. Strict Input Validation (Wails Bridge)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Backend (Go):**
        *   Treat *all* data received from the frontend (via Wails bindings) as untrusted.
        *   Implement rigorous validation *in Go* for *every* piece of data received. This is your primary defense.
        *   Validate:
            *   **Type:** Ensure data is the expected type (string, int, etc.) using Go's type system and `strconv`.
            *   **Length:** Enforce maximum string lengths using `len()`.
            *   **Format:** Use regular expressions (`regexp`) for email, URLs, etc.
            *   **Range:** Check numerical values for acceptable ranges.
            *   **Whitelist:** Define allowed values and reject anything else. *Never blacklist*.
        *   Return clear, non-revealing error messages to the frontend on failure.
        *   Log validation failures.
    2.  **Frontend (JavaScript):**
        *   Use HTML5 form validation attributes (`required`, `pattern`, `min`, `max`, `type`).
        *   Implement JavaScript validation *before* sending data. Use libraries or custom functions.
        *   Provide immediate user feedback.
        *   *Never* rely solely on frontend validation; it's a convenience, not a security measure.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Prevents malicious JavaScript injection via the Wails bridge.
    *   **SQL Injection (Severity: High):** Prevents manipulation of database queries if data from the bridge is used in queries.
    *   **Command Injection (Severity: High):** Prevents execution of arbitrary commands if data from the bridge is used in system calls.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Prevents large inputs from overwhelming the Go backend.
    *   **Data Corruption (Severity: Medium):** Ensures data integrity.
    *   **Business Logic Errors (Severity: Variable):** Prevents unexpected behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS, SQL Injection, Command Injection:** Significantly reduces risk (backend validation is crucial).
    *   **DoS, Data Corruption:** Reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Frontend: Basic HTML5 validation on some forms. JavaScript validation for email in `userRegistration.js`.
    *   Backend: Type checking and length limits in `CreateUser` (`user.go`). Regex for email.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Frontend: Comprehensive JavaScript validation is incomplete. Missing validation for phone/address.
    *   Backend: Missing range checks (age, quantity). Missing whitelisting (user roles). No centralized validation; logic is scattered.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Exposed Functionality (Wails Bindings)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_exposed_functionality__wails_bindings_.md)

**2. Minimize Exposed Functionality (Wails Bindings)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Bindings:** Carefully examine *all* Go functions exposed to the JavaScript frontend via Wails bindings.
    2.  **Identify Essentials:** Determine which functions are *absolutely necessary* for frontend operation.
    3.  **Remove Unnecessary:** Remove or comment out any non-essential bindings.  Each exposed function is a potential attack vector.
    4.  **Refactor for Least Privilege:** Split large functions into smaller, specific ones with minimal privileges.
    5.  **Document:** Clearly document the purpose and behavior of each exposed function.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Severity: High):** Reduces the attack surface by limiting entry points.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Reduces risk of exposing sensitive data via unintended calls.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Reduces risk of unauthorized access to sensitive operations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Reduces overall attack surface and likelihood of exploitation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some effort to limit functions, but no comprehensive review.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Thorough review of all Wails bindings needed.  `utils.go` has exposed, seemingly unused functions.
    *   No clear documentation of the exposed API.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Wails-Specific Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/wails-specific_configuration.md)

**3. Wails-Specific Configuration**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `wails.json`:** Carefully examine all options in the `wails.json` configuration file.
    2.  **Review `options` Struct:** Understand the security implications of each option in the `options` struct used when creating the Wails application.
    3.  **Disable Unneeded Features:** Disable any Wails features you don't require.
    4.  **Disable Developer Tools (Production):** Ensure developer tools (browser console) are disabled in production builds. Wails provides options for this.
    5. **Hide Wails Version:** Remove or obfuscate information revealing the Wails version.
    6. **Frontend: Disable Node.js Integration (if not needed):** If your frontend does *not* require Node.js integration, disable it explicitly in the Wails configuration. This reduces the attack surface significantly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Prevents attackers from gaining information about the Wails version and configuration.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Severity: High):** Disabling developer tools prevents attackers from using them to inject code. Disabling Node.js integration (if not used) removes a large attack surface.
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable):** Hiding the Wails version makes it harder to target known vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces risk.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Significantly reduces risk if developer tools are disabled and Node.js integration is not needed and disabled.
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Developer tools are disabled in production builds.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No explicit hiding of the Wails version.
    *   Node.js integration is enabled, but the frontend doesn't actually use it. This should be disabled.
    *   A full review of `wails.json` and the `options` struct for security implications hasn't been done.
