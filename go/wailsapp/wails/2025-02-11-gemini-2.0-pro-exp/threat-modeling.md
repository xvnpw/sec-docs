## Threat: [Frontend Input Manipulation to Exploit Backend Go Functions](./threats/frontend_input_manipulation_to_exploit_backend_go_functions.md)

*   **Threat:** Frontend Input Manipulation to Exploit Backend Go Functions

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input in the frontend (JavaScript) that is passed to an exposed Go function *through the Wails binding mechanism*. The attacker leverages a lack of input validation or sanitization in the Go function to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or cause a denial-of-service.  The *Wails bridge* is the direct conduit for this attack. For example, an attacker might send a specially crafted string that, when processed by a vulnerable Go function, triggers a buffer overflow or SQL injection (if the Go function interacts with a database).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete application compromise.
        *   Data breach (sensitive data exposure).
        *   System compromise (if the Go function has access to system resources).
        *   Application crash (denial of service).
    *   **Wails Component Affected:**
        *   `runtime.EventsOn/Emit` (if event-based communication is used without proper validation, *this is a Wails-specific API*).
        *   Exposed Go functions (specifically, the function parameters and the code within the function that handles the input).  The vulnerability is in *how* the Go function handles input received *via Wails*.
        *   Wails binding mechanism (the bridge itself is the *essential* conduit; without Wails, this attack vector wouldn't exist in this form).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Backend Input Validation:** Implement *strict* input validation in *every* exposed Go function *that is accessible through Wails*. Use type checking, length restrictions, whitelisting (preferred over blacklisting), and regular expressions. Validate *all* data received from the frontend, regardless of any frontend-side validation. This is crucial because the data is coming *through Wails*.
        *   **Use of Structs:** Define Go structs to represent the expected data format for each exposed function *called via Wails*. This enforces type safety and makes validation easier. Unmarshal JSON data from the frontend directly into these structs. This is a best practice specifically for the Wails communication pattern.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** If the Go function (exposed through Wails) interacts with a database, *always* use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in Go. Do *not* return detailed error messages to the frontend *via Wails*. Log errors securely on the backend.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Expose only the absolute minimum necessary Go functionality to the frontend *through the Wails binding*.

## Threat: [Frontend Code Modification to Bypass Security Controls and Attack via Wails](./threats/frontend_code_modification_to_bypass_security_controls_and_attack_via_wails.md)

*   **Threat:** Frontend Code Modification to Bypass Security Controls and Attack via Wails

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's files and modifies the frontend JavaScript code *to directly interact with the Wails binding mechanism*. They bypass frontend-side validation, directly call exposed Go functions (via Wails) with malicious parameters, or inject code that interacts with the backend in unintended ways *using the Wails bridge*. The attack *relies* on the ability to call Go functions through Wails.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application compromise.
        *   Data breach.
        *   System compromise (potentially, if Go functions exposed through Wails have system access).
    *   **Wails Component Affected:**
        *   Frontend JavaScript code (specifically, the parts that interact with the Wails runtime).
        *   Wails binding mechanism (this is the *essential* component being abused).
        *   Exposed Go functions (the ultimate target, *accessed via Wails*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Integrity Checks:** Implement runtime checks to verify the integrity of the frontend code *that interacts with Wails*. Calculate a hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the relevant frontend files and compare it to a known good hash stored securely (e.g., in the Go backend, signed). This is to protect the code that uses the Wails bridge.
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Digitally sign the frontend code (and the entire application bundle) to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering. This helps prevent modification of the code that calls Wails functions.
        *   **Minimize Frontend Security Logic:** Do *not* rely solely on frontend validation. All critical security checks *must* be performed in the Go backend, *especially for functions exposed through Wails*.
        *   **Obfuscation (Limited):** Obfuscate the frontend JavaScript code, *particularly the parts that interact with the Wails runtime*, to make it more difficult to understand and modify.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Local Resource Access via Exposed Go Functions (through Wails)](./threats/unauthorized_local_resource_access_via_exposed_go_functions__through_wails_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Local Resource Access via Exposed Go Functions (through Wails)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a Go function *exposed through the Wails binding mechanism* that interacts with local system resources (files, network, hardware) without proper authorization or validation. The *Wails bridge* is the attack vector. For example, a function intended to read a specific configuration file might be tricked into reading arbitrary files on the system (path traversal) *because it's exposed and callable via Wails*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data leakage (reading sensitive files).
        *   Data modification/deletion (writing to arbitrary files).
        *   System compromise (executing commands, accessing hardware).
        *   Network compromise (connecting to malicious servers).
    *   **Wails Component Affected:**
        *   Exposed Go functions that interact with the `os`, `net`, `io/ioutil` (or `io`), and other system-level packages, *specifically those functions made available through the Wails binding*.
        *   Wails binding mechanism (the *essential* pathway for the attack).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Path Validation:** If dealing with file paths *in functions exposed through Wails*, *always* validate them rigorously. Use absolute paths, avoid relative paths, and check for path traversal attempts. Use functions like `filepath.Clean` and `filepath.Abs` in Go.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Filesystem):** Run the application with the minimum necessary file system permissions. Avoid running as an administrator or root user. This limits the damage even if a Wails-exposed function is compromised.
        *   **Network Restrictions:** If the application needs to make network connections *via functions exposed through Wails*, restrict the allowed destinations (e.g., using a whitelist).
        *   **User Confirmation:** For sensitive operations *triggered through Wails* (e.g., accessing hardware, deleting files), require explicit user confirmation through a native dialog box (using Wails' dialog API).
        *   **Sandboxing (OS-Specific):** Explore OS-specific sandboxing to limit the application's access to system resources, *especially for functionality exposed through Wails*.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in the Wails Framework Itself](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_the_wails_framework_itself.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in the Wails Framework Itself

    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability in the Wails framework code, *specifically targeting the binding mechanism, the runtime, or other core components that facilitate the Go-JavaScript communication*. This is a direct attack on Wails.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Potentially severe, as it could affect *all* Wails applications and bypass application-level security.
        *   Could lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Wails Component Affected:**
        *   The Wails framework itself (various modules and functions, *especially the binding and runtime*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Wails Updated:** Update to the latest stable version of Wails as soon as possible after releases, *especially* if security fixes are included. This is the *primary* defense against Wails framework vulnerabilities.
        *   **Monitor Wails Releases:** Subscribe to Wails release announcements and security advisories.
        *   **Contribute to Security:** If possible, contribute to Wails security audits or testing.
        *   **Defense in Depth:** Implement the other mitigations listed above (input validation, etc.). Even if a Wails vulnerability exists, strong application-level security can limit the impact.
