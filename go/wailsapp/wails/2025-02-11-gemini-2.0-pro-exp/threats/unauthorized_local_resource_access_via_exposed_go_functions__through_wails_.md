# Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Local Resource Access via Exposed Go Functions (Wails)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the threat of "Unauthorized Local Resource Access via Exposed Go Functions (through Wails)," identify specific vulnerabilities within a Wails application, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview provided in the initial threat model.  This analysis aims to provide developers with a clear understanding of the attack surface and how to secure their Wails applications against this specific threat.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on Go functions exposed through the Wails binding mechanism that interact with local system resources.  It covers:

*   **File System Access:**  Reading, writing, and deleting files.  This includes path traversal vulnerabilities and improper handling of symbolic links.
*   **Network Access:**  Making network connections (e.g., TCP, UDP) and potential vulnerabilities related to uncontrolled destination addresses or ports.
*   **System Command Execution:**  Executing external commands or processes.
*   **Hardware Access:**  Interacting with hardware devices (if applicable, and exposed through Go functions).
*   **Wails Binding Mechanism:**  How the attacker leverages the JavaScript-to-Go bridge to exploit vulnerable functions.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General JavaScript vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) *unless* they directly contribute to exploiting the Go functions exposed through Wails.
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party Go libraries *unless* those vulnerabilities are directly exploitable through the Wails binding.
*   Operating system vulnerabilities.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the Go code for functions exposed to the frontend via Wails.  Identify functions that interact with the `os`, `net`, `io/ioutil` (or `io`), `syscall`, and related packages.
2.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Analyze the identified functions for potential vulnerabilities, including:
    *   **Path Traversal:**  Checking for insufficient validation of file paths, allowing attackers to access files outside the intended directory.
    *   **Uncontrolled Network Connections:**  Identifying functions that make network connections without proper destination validation.
    *   **Command Injection:**  Looking for functions that execute system commands based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization.
    *   **Improper Permission Handling:**  Checking if the application runs with excessive privileges.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:**  Analyzing all inputs to exposed functions for proper type checking, length limits, and character restrictions.
3.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  Create realistic scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Provide detailed, code-specific recommendations for mitigating the identified vulnerabilities, building upon the initial threat model's suggestions.
5.  **Testing Recommendations:** Suggest specific testing strategies to verify the effectiveness of the mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1 Vulnerability Identification (Examples)

Let's consider some common scenarios and how they manifest as vulnerabilities in Wails applications.

**Scenario 1: Path Traversal in File Reading**

```go
// Exposed Go function
func ReadFileContent(filename string) (string, error) {
	content, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filename) // Vulnerable: No path validation
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}
	return string(content), nil
}
```

*   **Vulnerability:** The `ReadFileContent` function takes a filename as input without any validation. An attacker could pass a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` to read arbitrary files on the system.  The Wails binding allows the frontend JavaScript to call this function directly.
*   **Exploit Scenario:**  An attacker crafts a malicious request from the frontend JavaScript: `window.go.main.App.ReadFileContent("../../../../etc/passwd")`.  The Wails bridge executes the Go function with the malicious path, leaking the contents of `/etc/passwd`.

**Scenario 2: Uncontrolled Network Connection**

```go
// Exposed Go function
func ConnectToServer(host string, port int) (string, error) {
	conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", host+":"+strconv.Itoa(port)) // Vulnerable: No host/port validation
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}
	defer conn.Close()
	return "Connected!", nil
}
```

*   **Vulnerability:** The `ConnectToServer` function allows connecting to any host and port specified by the frontend.  An attacker could use this to connect to internal services, scan the network, or connect to malicious external servers.
*   **Exploit Scenario:** An attacker calls `window.go.main.App.ConnectToServer("192.168.1.1", 22)` to attempt an SSH connection to an internal server.  Or, they could use it to connect to a command-and-control server.

**Scenario 3: Command Injection**

```go
// Exposed Go function
func ExecuteCommand(command string) (string, error) {
	cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", command) // Vulnerable: Command injection
	output, err := cmd.Output()
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}
	return string(output), nil
}
```

*   **Vulnerability:** The `ExecuteCommand` function directly executes a shell command provided by the frontend.  An attacker can inject arbitrary commands.
*   **Exploit Scenario:** An attacker calls `window.go.main.App.ExecuteCommand("rm -rf /; echo 'owned'")`. This could lead to severe system damage.

**Scenario 4:  Improper Use of `filepath.Join` (Subtle Path Traversal)**

```go
// Exposed Go function
func ReadConfig(filename string) (string, error) {
    baseDir := "/opt/myapp/config/"
    fullPath := filepath.Join(baseDir, filename) // Potentially Vulnerable
    content, err := ioutil.ReadFile(fullPath)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    return string(content), nil
}
```

*   **Vulnerability:** While `filepath.Join` is generally safer than direct string concatenation, it's *still* vulnerable if the `filename` component starts with `/`.  `filepath.Join` will then treat `filename` as an absolute path, ignoring `baseDir`.
*   **Exploit Scenario:** An attacker calls `window.go.main.App.ReadConfig("/etc/passwd")`.  `filepath.Join` will return `/etc/passwd`, bypassing the intended `baseDir`.

### 2.2 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Building on the initial threat model, here are more detailed and code-specific mitigation strategies:

1.  **Strict Path Validation (Enhanced):**

    *   **Use `filepath.Abs` and `filepath.Clean`:**  Always convert user-provided paths to absolute paths using `filepath.Abs` and then clean them using `filepath.Clean`. This removes `..` components and resolves symbolic links.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Directories:**  If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed directories and verify that the cleaned absolute path starts with one of the whitelisted prefixes.
    *   **Avoid `filepath.Join` with Untrusted Leading `/`:**  If using `filepath.Join`, *always* ensure that the user-supplied filename component does not start with a `/`.  Sanitize the input to remove any leading `/` characters.
    *   **Example (Fix for Scenario 1):**

        ```go
        func ReadFileContent(filename string) (string, error) {
        	// 1. Make absolute and clean the path
        	absPath, err := filepath.Abs(filename)
        	if err != nil {
        		return "", err
        	}
        	cleanedPath := filepath.Clean(absPath)

        	// 2. Whitelist allowed directory (example)
        	allowedDir := "/opt/myapp/data/"
        	if !strings.HasPrefix(cleanedPath, allowedDir) {
        		return "", errors.New("invalid file path")
        	}

        	content, err := ioutil.ReadFile(cleanedPath)
        	if err != nil {
        		return "", err
        	}
        	return string(content), nil
        }
        ```
    * **Example (Fix for Scenario 4):**
        ```go
        func ReadConfig(filename string) (string, error) {
            baseDir := "/opt/myapp/config/"
            // Sanitize filename to remove leading /
            safeFilename := strings.TrimPrefix(filename, "/")
            fullPath := filepath.Join(baseDir, safeFilename)
            // Further validation: Ensure fullPath is still within baseDir
            absPath, err := filepath.Abs(fullPath)
            if err != nil {
                return "", err
            }
            cleanedPath := filepath.Clean(absPath)
            if !strings.HasPrefix(cleanedPath, baseDir) {
                return "", errors.New("invalid file path")
            }

            content, err := ioutil.ReadFile(cleanedPath)
            if err != nil {
                return "", err
            }
            return string(content), nil
        }
        ```

2.  **Network Restrictions (Enhanced):**

    *   **Whitelist Allowed Hosts and Ports:**  Maintain a strict whitelist of allowed hostnames/IP addresses and ports.  Use regular expressions or other string matching techniques to validate the user-provided input against the whitelist.
    *   **Use a Dedicated Network Library:** Consider using a dedicated network library that provides built-in security features, such as connection pooling and timeout management.
    *   **Example (Fix for Scenario 2):**

        ```go
        var allowedHosts = map[string]bool{
        	"example.com": true,
        	"192.168.1.10": true,
        }

        func ConnectToServer(host string, port int) (string, error) {
        	if !allowedHosts[host] {
        		return "", errors.New("disallowed host")
        	}
        	if port < 1 || port > 65535 {
        		return "", errors.New("invalid port")
        	}

        	conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", host+":"+strconv.Itoa(port))
        	if err != nil {
        		return "", err
        	}
        	defer conn.Close()
        	return "Connected!", nil
        }
        ```

3.  **Command Injection Prevention:**

    *   **Avoid `exec.Command` with User Input:**  If possible, avoid using `exec.Command` with user-supplied input altogether.  Find alternative ways to achieve the desired functionality using Go's standard library or safer libraries.
    *   **Use `exec.Command` with Separate Arguments:** If you *must* use `exec.Command`, *never* concatenate user input directly into the command string.  Pass each argument separately to `exec.Command`.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Commands:** If you need to execute a limited set of commands, create a whitelist of allowed commands and their arguments.
    *   **Example (Fix for Scenario 3 - Using a whitelist):**

        ```go
        var allowedCommands = map[string][]string{
        	"date":  {}, // No arguments allowed for 'date'
        	"ls":    {"-l", "-a"}, // Only -l and -a allowed for 'ls'
        }

        func ExecuteCommand(command string, args []string) (string, error) {
        	allowedArgs, ok := allowedCommands[command]
        	if !ok {
        		return "", errors.New("disallowed command")
        	}

        	// Check if provided arguments are allowed
        	for _, arg := range args {
        		allowed := false
        		for _, allowedArg := range allowedArgs {
        			if arg == allowedArg {
        				allowed = true
        				break
        			}
        		}
        		if !allowed {
        			return "", errors.New("disallowed argument")
        		}
        	}

        	cmd := exec.Command(command, args...)
        	output, err := cmd.Output()
        	if err != nil {
        		return "", err
        	}
        	return string(output), nil
        }
        ```

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Filesystem & Network):**

    *   **Run as a Non-Root User:**  Configure the application to run as a dedicated user with limited privileges.  Avoid running as root or an administrator.
    *   **Use OS-Specific Tools:** Utilize OS-specific tools like `chroot` (Linux), `jails` (FreeBSD), or AppArmor/SELinux to further restrict the application's access to the file system and network.
    *   **Capabilities (Linux):** On Linux, consider using capabilities to grant the application only the specific permissions it needs, rather than granting broad privileges.

5.  **User Confirmation (Enhanced):**

    *   **Use Wails' Dialog API:**  For sensitive operations, use Wails' built-in dialog API (`runtime.MessageDialog`, `runtime.QuestionDialog`) to prompt the user for confirmation before executing the action.  This provides a clear visual indication to the user and helps prevent accidental or malicious execution.
    *   **Example:**

        ```go
        // Exposed Go function
        func DeleteFile(filename string) (bool, error) {
            // ... (Path validation as described above) ...

            // Ask for confirmation
            confirmed, err := runtime.QuestionDialog(ctx, runtime.QuestionDialogOptions{
                Title:   "Confirm Deletion",
                Message: fmt.Sprintf("Are you sure you want to delete '%s'?", filename),
            })
            if err != nil {
                return false, err
            }
            if !confirmed {
                return false, nil // User cancelled
            }

            // Proceed with deletion
            err = os.Remove(filename)
            return err == nil, err
        }
        ```

6. **Input Validation:**
    *   **Type checking:** Ensure that input parameters to exposed functions are of the expected type.
    *   **Length limits:** Set reasonable length limits on string inputs to prevent buffer overflows or denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Character restrictions:** Restrict the allowed characters in input strings to prevent injection attacks. For example, if an input is expected to be a number, only allow digits.
    *   **Regular expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate input against expected patterns.

### 2.3 Testing Recommendations

1.  **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for each exposed Go function, specifically testing the input validation and security mitigations.  Include test cases for:
    *   Valid inputs.
    *   Invalid inputs (e.g., path traversal attempts, disallowed hosts, invalid commands).
    *   Boundary conditions (e.g., empty strings, very long strings).
    *   Edge cases (e.g., symbolic links, special characters).

2.  **Integration Tests:**  Test the interaction between the frontend JavaScript and the exposed Go functions through the Wails binding.  Use a testing framework like Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium to simulate user interactions and verify that the security mitigations are effective in a real-world scenario.

3.  **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzz testing to automatically generate a large number of random inputs and feed them to the exposed Go functions.  This can help uncover unexpected vulnerabilities. Tools like `go-fuzz` can be used for this purpose.

4.  **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to scan the Go code for potential security vulnerabilities.  Tools like `gosec` can identify common security issues.

5.  **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct penetration testing by a security expert to simulate real-world attacks and identify any remaining vulnerabilities.

## 3. Conclusion

The threat of "Unauthorized Local Resource Access via Exposed Go Functions" in Wails applications is significant.  By carefully reviewing code, identifying vulnerabilities, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and thoroughly testing the application, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation.  The key is to treat all input from the frontend (via the Wails binding) as untrusted and to apply the principle of least privilege throughout the application.  Regular security audits and updates are crucial to maintaining a secure Wails application.
