## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on Host (RCE) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_host__rce___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker, granting them complete control over the system running the Wails application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Go-Side Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_go-side_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Custom Go Code Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced by the application developer within the Go code. This is the most common source of exploitable weaknesses.
    *   **Specific Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Command Injection:**
            *   The attacker injects operating system commands into input fields that are then executed by the Go application.
            *   Example: If the application takes a filename as input and uses it in a `os.Exec` call without proper sanitization, the attacker could inject commands.
        *   **Path Traversal:**
            *   The attacker manipulates file paths provided as input to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
            *   Example: If the application reads files based on user input, the attacker could use "../" sequences to access sensitive system files.
        *   **Insecure Deserialization:**
            *   The application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
            *   Example: If the application uses Go's `gob` package to deserialize data from the frontend, an attacker could craft a malicious payload.
        *   **SQL Injection (If applicable):**
            *   If the application interacts with a database, the attacker injects SQL code into input fields to manipulate database queries.
        *   **Other Vulnerabilities:** This category also includes other common Go vulnerabilities like integer overflows, race conditions, and improper error handling that could lead to exploitable behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Frontend-Backend Bridge (IPC)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_frontend-backend_bridge__ipc_.md)

*   **Wails Runtime Binding Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the core mechanism that Wails uses to facilitate communication between the Go backend and the JavaScript frontend.
    *   **Specific Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Flaws in Serialization/Deserialization:**
            *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in how data is converted between Go and JavaScript representations. This could involve type confusion or buffer overflows.
        *   **Bypassing Security Checks:**
            *   Finding ways to circumvent any security checks implemented within the Wails binding layer (e.g., authentication, authorization).
        *   **Exploiting Internal Wails Functions:**
            *   Gaining access to internal Wails functions that are not intended to be exposed to the frontend.

*   **Message Tampering [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker intercepts and modifies messages sent between the frontend and backend.
    *   **Specific Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Missing Input Validation:**
            *   The Go backend fails to properly validate the data received from the frontend, allowing the attacker to send malicious values.
        *   **Incorrect Data Type Handling:**
            *   The Go backend expects a specific data type but doesn't enforce it, leading to unexpected behavior when the attacker sends a different type.
        *   **Parameter Manipulation:**
            *   Changing the values of parameters within a message to trigger unintended actions or bypass security checks.

*   **Message Injection [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker injects entirely new messages into the communication stream.
    *   **Specific Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Sending Crafted Messages:**
            *   Creating messages that are not expected by the Go backend, potentially triggering vulnerabilities or unexpected code paths.
        *   **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization:**
            *   Injecting messages that bypass authentication or authorization checks, allowing the attacker to perform actions they shouldn't be allowed to.
        *   **Replay Attacks (If applicable):**
            *   Replaying previously valid messages to trigger actions multiple times or out of sequence.
