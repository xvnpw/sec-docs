*   **Threat:** Unintended Backend Function Exposure
    *   **Description:** An attacker could identify and call Go functions exposed through Wails bindings that were not intended for public access. This could be due to developer oversight or misconfiguration within the Wails binding setup. The attacker might enumerate available functions or guess function names based on application logic exposed through the bindings.
    *   **Impact:**  Access to sensitive data, unauthorized modification of application state, or even execution of arbitrary code on the backend system, depending on the functionality of the exposed function.
    *   **Affected Component:** `bindings` (specifically the Go code and the generated JavaScript/TypeScript bindings).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review all functions exposed via Wails bindings.
        *   Use explicit whitelisting for functions intended for frontend access within the Wails binding configuration.
        *   Employ clear naming conventions to distinguish public and private backend functions.
        *   Consider using a dedicated "API" layer in the Go backend to manage interactions with the frontend and then selectively expose this API through Wails bindings.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Data Handling in Bound Functions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could send crafted or malicious data through Wails bindings to backend functions that lack proper input validation and sanitization. This exploits the data transfer mechanism provided by Wails.
    *   **Impact:**  Backend crashes, data corruption, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution if the backend logic is vulnerable to injection attacks (though less common in compiled Go).
    *   **Affected Component:** `bindings` (data serialization/deserialization between Go and JavaScript/TypeScript handled by Wails) and the specific Go functions handling the data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data received from the frontend *within the bound functions*.
        *   Use type checking and data validation libraries in Go.
        *   Avoid directly using raw input data in critical operations without validation.

*   **Threat:** Lack of Authorization for Bound Functions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could bypass intended frontend workflows and directly call sensitive backend functions via Wails bindings without proper authorization checks on the backend. This directly leverages the Wails binding mechanism to access protected functions.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to data, privilege escalation, or the ability to perform actions that should be restricted to certain users or roles.
    *   **Affected Component:** `bindings` and the Go functions that should enforce authorization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement an authorization mechanism in the Go backend to verify the frontend's right to call specific functions *before* executing the bound function logic.
        *   Consider using session management or tokens to identify and authenticate the frontend, passing these through the Wails binding calls.
        *   Avoid relying solely on frontend logic for access control.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Frontend Code Injecting Backend Calls
    *   **Description:** If the frontend is compromised, malicious JavaScript/TypeScript code could be injected that directly calls backend functions via Wails bindings. This is a direct exploitation of the Wails communication bridge.
    *   **Impact:**  The injected code could perform any action that a legitimate frontend could, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `bindings` and the frontend codebase interacting with the Wails runtime.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of executable code in the frontend.
        *   Regularly audit and update frontend dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external resources.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the Wails Runtime
    *   **Description:** Bugs or security flaws within the Wails framework itself (the Go runtime components that manage the webview and the binding mechanism) could be exploited.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution within the application context, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** The Wails `runtime` package and potentially the underlying webview integration managed by Wails.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay up-to-date with the latest Wails releases and security patches.
        *   Monitor the Wails project's security advisories and issue tracker.
        *   Consider contributing to the Wails project by reporting any discovered vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** WebView Related Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Wails applications rely on an embedded webview (typically based on Chromium). Vulnerabilities in the underlying webview engine, as integrated and managed by Wails, can be exploited.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution within the webview context, cross-site scripting (XSS) if not properly mitigated within the frontend, or other browser-related attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** The embedded `webview` component as integrated by Wails.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the Wails framework and its dependencies include up-to-date webview components with the latest security patches.
        *   Implement security best practices for webview usage, such as restricting permissions and disabling unnecessary features.
        *   While the prompt excludes general web app threats, be mindful of XSS risks within the frontend code running in the webview.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks on Wails Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Malicious code could be introduced into the application through compromised dependencies of the Wails framework itself. This directly impacts the security of the Wails components used in the application.
    *   **Impact:**  The malicious code could have full access to the application's resources and capabilities, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Wails dependencies (Go modules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use dependency management tools with vulnerability scanning capabilities.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies.
        *   Regularly audit and update Wails and its dependencies.
        *   Consider using a software bill of materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
