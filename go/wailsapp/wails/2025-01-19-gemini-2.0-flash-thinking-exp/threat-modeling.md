# Threat Model Analysis for wailsapp/wails

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Go Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_go_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits known vulnerabilities in third-party Go libraries used by the Wails backend. This could involve sending crafted requests or exploiting known attack vectors for the vulnerable library.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the backend, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Go Backend (third-party libraries).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for data breaches or DoS).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update Go dependencies, use vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., `govulncheck`), carefully select and vet third-party libraries.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Frontend Input in Backend](./threats/insecure_handling_of_frontend_input_in_backend.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input in the frontend (e.g., through form fields or direct JavaScript calls) that is not properly validated or sanitized by the Go backend. This input is then used in a way that leads to vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Command injection (executing arbitrary OS commands), path traversal (accessing unauthorized files).
*   **Affected Component:** Go Backend (input handling logic, specific functions processing frontend data).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (command injection).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the backend for all data received from the frontend, use parameterized queries for database interactions, avoid direct execution of user-provided input as commands.

## Threat: [Exploiting Weaknesses in the IPC Bridge](./threats/exploiting_weaknesses_in_the_ipc_bridge.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits vulnerabilities within the Wails framework's IPC bridge itself. This could involve sending specially crafted messages or exploiting parsing errors.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security measures, executing arbitrary code in either the frontend or backend context, disrupting application functionality.
*   **Affected Component:** Wails IPC bridge.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution is possible), High (for other security bypasses).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Stay updated with Wails releases and security advisories, report potential vulnerabilities to the Wails team, consider using stable releases of Wails.

## Threat: [Tampering with the Application Bundle](./threats/tampering_with_the_application_bundle.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies the application bundle after it's built but before it's installed, potentially injecting malicious code into the frontend or backend binaries.
*   **Impact:** Compromised application functionality, data theft, malware distribution.
*   **Affected Component:** Application bundle (all files within the bundle).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Code signing of the application bundle, integrity checks during installation, secure distribution channels (e.g., using HTTPS for downloads, trusted app stores).

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Wails Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_wails_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** A dependency used by Wails itself is compromised, introducing vulnerabilities into applications built with it. This could happen through malicious code injection into a dependency's repository.
*   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications built with the affected Wails version.
*   **Affected Component:** Wails framework, its dependencies.
