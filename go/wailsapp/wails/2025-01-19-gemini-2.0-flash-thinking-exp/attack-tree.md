## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Wails Application (Execute Arbitrary Code) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_wails_application__execute_arbitrary_code___critical_node_.md)

*   **Compromise Wails Application (Execute Arbitrary Code) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of executing arbitrary code on the host system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Go Backend Vulnerabilities Introduced by Wails [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_go_backend_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_wails__critical_node_.md)

*   **Exploit Go Backend Vulnerabilities Introduced by Wails [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This node represents a category of attacks that target vulnerabilities in the Go backend code that are specific to how Wails exposes Go functionality to the frontend. Success here allows attackers to leverage native system capabilities for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Function Implementation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_function_implementation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Exploit Insecure Function Implementation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This node represents a critical weakness where exposed Go functions are implemented in a way that allows for exploitation, such as through command injection or path traversal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Exposed Function [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_exposed_function__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Command Injection via Exposed Function [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If an exposed Go function takes user-provided input and uses it to execute system commands without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands.
    *   **Actionable Insight:** Developers must meticulously sanitize all user inputs passed to system commands within exposed Go functions. Use parameterized commands or libraries designed for safe command execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Frontend Vulnerabilities Specific to Wails Interaction [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_frontend_vulnerabilities_specific_to_wails_interaction__critical_node_.md)

*   **Exploit Frontend Vulnerabilities Specific to Wails Interaction [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This node encompasses vulnerabilities that arise from the unique interaction between the frontend (HTML/JavaScript) and the backend (Go) within the Wails framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Handling of Backend Data in Frontend [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_handling_of_backend_data_in_frontend__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Exploit Insecure Handling of Backend Data in Frontend [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the Go backend sends data to the frontend that is then directly used in a way that allows code execution (e.g., using `eval()` on a backend response), an attacker can inject malicious code through the backend.
    *   **Actionable Insight:** Avoid using `eval()` or similar functions on data received from the backend. Sanitize and validate all data received from the backend before using it in the frontend. Use templating engines or safe DOM manipulation methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Messages to Backend [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_messages_to_backend__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Messages to Backend [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** While Wails provides a communication bridge, vulnerabilities can exist in how this bridge is implemented or used. An attacker might try to intercept communication and inject malicious messages.
    *   **Actionable Insight:** While Wails handles the underlying communication, developers should be mindful of the data being exchanged. Avoid sending sensitive information directly through the bridge without proper encryption or obfuscation. Consider the potential for message spoofing if not handled carefully.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerable Go Dependencies Used by Wails [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerable_go_dependencies_used_by_wails__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerable Go Dependencies Used by Wails [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Wails relies on various Go dependencies. If any of these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to exploit them if the application uses the vulnerable functionality.
    *   **Actionable Insight:** Regularly update Wails and its Go dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address potential risks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposing Internal Wails APIs or Debug Endpoints (If Enabled in Production) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exposing_internal_wails_apis_or_debug_endpoints__if_enabled_in_production___high-risk_path___critica_7f14b9bb.md)

*   **Exposing Internal Wails APIs or Debug Endpoints (If Enabled in Production) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If debug or internal APIs are accidentally left enabled in production builds, attackers might be able to access and abuse them for malicious purposes.
    *   **Actionable Insight:** Ensure that debug and development features are disabled in production builds. Implement proper authentication and authorization for any internal APIs.
