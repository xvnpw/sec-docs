# Attack Surface Analysis for wailsapp/wails

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Backend Functions via Bindings](./attack_surfaces/exposed_backend_functions_via_bindings.md)

*   **Description:** Go functions are made accessible to the frontend JavaScript code through the `wails.Bind` mechanism. If not carefully managed, this can expose sensitive logic or functionalities.
*   **How Wails Contributes:** Wails' core functionality relies on this binding mechanism to enable communication between the frontend and backend.
*   **Example:** A Go function `GetUserProfile(userID string)` is bound without proper authorization checks. A malicious frontend could call this function with arbitrary user IDs to access other users' profiles.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential for data manipulation, or execution of unintended backend logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict authorization checks within bound Go functions to ensure only authorized frontend code can access them.
    *   **Developers:** Carefully review all functions exposed via `wails.Bind` and only expose necessary functionalities.
    *   **Developers:** Perform thorough input validation and sanitization within bound functions to prevent injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Filesystem Access via `wails.WriteFile` and `wails.ReadFile`](./attack_surfaces/filesystem_access_via__wails_writefile__and__wails_readfile_.md)

*   **Description:** Wails provides functions to read and write files on the user's system. Improper use can lead to significant security risks.
*   **How Wails Contributes:** These functions are specific to Wails and provide direct filesystem interaction from the frontend.
*   **Example:** A frontend feature allows users to save files, but the path is constructed based on user input without sanitization, allowing a path traversal attack to overwrite critical system files.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary file read or write, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or execution of malicious code.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Avoid using `wails.WriteFile` and `wails.ReadFile` directly from user input if possible.
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict path sanitization and validation to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Developers:** Enforce authorization checks to ensure only authorized users or frontend components can access specific files or directories.
    *   **Developers:** Consider using application-specific storage locations instead of allowing arbitrary file system access.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** The process of updating the Wails application itself can be a point of attack if not implemented securely.
*   **How Wails Contributes:** Wails applications often need a mechanism to update themselves, and the security of this mechanism is crucial.
*   **Example:** The application downloads updates over an insecure HTTP connection without verifying the integrity of the downloaded file. An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack and inject a malicious update.
*   **Impact:** Installation of compromised application versions, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement secure update mechanisms using HTTPS for downloads.
    *   **Developers:** Digitally sign updates and verify the signature before applying them.
    *   **Developers:** Consider using established and secure update frameworks or services.
    *   **Users:** Ensure the application's update settings are configured to use secure channels.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Protocol Handlers](./attack_surfaces/custom_protocol_handlers.md)

*   **Description:** Wails applications can register custom URL protocol handlers. Vulnerabilities in these handlers can be exploited.
*   **How Wails Contributes:** Wails allows registering custom protocols that the application can handle.
*   **Example:** A custom protocol handler is registered to open files, but it doesn't properly sanitize the file path from the URL, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious URL to open arbitrary files.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands, access to local files, or other unintended actions based on the crafted URL.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any input received through custom protocol handlers.
    *   **Developers:** Avoid performing sensitive actions directly based on data from custom protocol URLs.
    *   **Developers:** Follow the principle of least privilege when handling custom protocols.
