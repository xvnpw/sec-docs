## Mitigation Strategy: [Bridge Security: Input Validation and Sanitization on Go Backend (Wails Bridge Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/bridge_security_input_validation_and_sanitization_on_go_backend__wails_bridge_focus_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization on Go Backend (Wails Bridge Focus)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Wails Exposed Functions:**  Specifically review all Go functions exposed to the frontend *via `wails.Bind`*. These are the entry points from the WebView into the Go backend.
        2.  **Focus on Bridge Data:** Concentrate validation and sanitization efforts on data received *through the Wails bridge* from the frontend.
        3.  **Go Backend Implementation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization *within the Go backend functions* that are bound to the frontend. Do not rely on frontend validation as it can be bypassed.
        4.  **Wails Contextual Sanitization:** Sanitize data based on how it will be used *within the Go backend* and potentially when sent back to the frontend *via the Wails bridge*. Consider the context of data flow through Wails.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Command Injection via Wails Bridge (High Severity): Prevents command injection by validating and sanitizing inputs received from the frontend through the Wails bridge, especially if these inputs are used in system commands in the Go backend.
        *   SQL Injection via Wails Bridge (High Severity - if database interaction exists): Prevents SQL injection by validating and sanitizing inputs from the Wails bridge used in database queries in the Go backend.
        *   Path Traversal via Wails Bridge (Medium Severity): Prevents path traversal by validating and sanitizing file paths received from the frontend via the Wails bridge, ensuring the Go backend only accesses authorized files.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Command Injection via Wails Bridge: High Risk Reduction
        *   SQL Injection via Wails Bridge: High Risk Reduction
        *   Path Traversal via Wails Bridge: Moderate Risk Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in `backend/handlers/user.go` for user registration and login functions, specifically for data received via Wails bridge calls.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Missing for file upload functionality in `backend/handlers/file.go` (data from Wails bridge file selection), data processing in `backend/report_generation.go` (inputs from Wails bridge), and other exposed Go functions in `backend/handlers/app.go` and `backend/handlers/settings.go` that are called from the Wails frontend.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Bridge Security: Principle of Least Privilege for Exposed Go Functions (Wails Binding Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/bridge_security_principle_of_least_privilege_for_exposed_go_functions__wails_binding_focus_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Exposed Go Functions (Wails Binding Focus)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Review Wails Bindings:**  Specifically audit all functions bound using `wails.Bind`.  These are the functions directly accessible from the frontend WebView via the Wails bridge.
        2.  **Minimize Exposed Wails Functions:**  Reduce the number of Go functions exposed via `wails.Bind` to the absolute minimum necessary for the frontend application's functionality.
        3.  **Wails Bridge Access Control:**  Consider implementing access control *within the Go backend* for functions exposed via `wails.Bind`. Even if a function is exposed, ensure proper authorization checks are performed before executing sensitive operations when called from the Wails frontend.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access to Backend Functionality via Wails Bridge (Medium to High Severity): Prevents malicious or compromised frontend code from invoking backend functions through the Wails bridge that it should not have access to, due to over-exposure via `wails.Bind`.
        *   Data Breaches due to Overexposed Wails Functions (Medium to High Severity): Reduces the risk of data breaches by limiting the attack surface exposed through the Wails bridge and preventing unintended or malicious access to sensitive data via over-bound functions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access to Backend Functionality via Wails Bridge: Moderate to High Risk Reduction
        *   Data Breaches due to Overexposed Wails Functions: Moderate to High Risk Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Access control checks are in place for some sensitive functions in `backend/handlers/admin.go` that are exposed via Wails Bind, using role-based access control.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Missing for many functions in `backend/handlers/app.go` and `backend/handlers/settings.go` that are currently bound via Wails. Need to review and restrict the functions bound via `wails.Bind` and add access control to more bound functions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Frontend WebView Security: Content Security Policy (CSP) (Wails WebView Context)](./mitigation_strategies/frontend_webview_security_content_security_policy__csp___wails_webview_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Content Security Policy (CSP) Implementation (Wails WebView Context)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Wails WebView Specific CSP:** Implement CSP specifically for the WebView context within the Wails application. This is crucial because the frontend runs within a desktop application, but still uses web technologies.
        2.  **Restrict WebView Sources:** Configure CSP to restrict the sources from which the Wails WebView can load resources. This is important even in a desktop context to mitigate potential XSS and data injection risks within the WebView.
        3.  **Meta Tag in Wails Frontend:** Implement CSP using a `<meta>` tag in the main HTML file of your Wails frontend (`index.html` or similar), as this is the most common way to apply CSP in a Wails application.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Wails WebView (High Severity): Significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks within the Wails WebView by preventing the execution of malicious scripts injected into the frontend from untrusted sources *within the Wails application context*.
        *   Data Injection Attacks in Wails WebView (Medium Severity): Helps mitigate certain data injection attacks within the Wails WebView by controlling the sources from which the frontend can load data *within the Wails application context*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Wails WebView: High Risk Reduction
        *   Data Injection Attacks in Wails WebView: Moderate Risk Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not currently implemented. No CSP is configured for the Wails WebView.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in the `frontend/index.html` file of the Wails application. Needs to be implemented by adding a `<meta>` tag with a properly configured CSP for the Wails WebView.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Frontend WebView Security: Restrict WebView Capabilities (Wails Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/frontend_webview_security_restrict_webview_capabilities__wails_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict WebView Capabilities (Wails Configuration)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Review Wails WebView Configuration:** Investigate if Wails provides options to configure or restrict the capabilities of the underlying WebView engine. Consult the Wails documentation for WebView configuration options.
        2.  **Disable Unnecessary WebView Features:** If possible, disable WebView features that are not required by the application. This could include features like JavaScript execution in certain contexts, access to local storage if not needed, or other browser functionalities that increase the attack surface within the Wails WebView.
        3.  **Wails Specific WebView Settings:** Explore if Wails exposes any framework-specific settings to control WebView behavior and security.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Exploitation of WebView Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity): Reducing WebView capabilities can limit the potential impact of vulnerabilities within the WebView engine itself, by reducing the attack surface available to exploit.
        *   Unintended Feature Abuse in WebView (Medium Severity): Prevents potential abuse of WebView features that are not necessary for the application's core functionality, which could be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exploitation of WebView Vulnerabilities: Moderate to High Risk Reduction
        *   Unintended Feature Abuse in WebView: Moderate Risk Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not currently implemented. WebView capabilities are at their default settings as configured by Wails.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Missing. Need to research Wails documentation and configuration options to determine if and how WebView capabilities can be restricted within a Wails application. This requires investigation into Wails' WebView integration.
