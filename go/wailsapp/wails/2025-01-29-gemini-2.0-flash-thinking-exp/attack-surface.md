# Attack Surface Analysis for wailsapp/wails

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Go Backend Functions via Bindings - Unintended Function Exposure](./attack_surfaces/exposed_go_backend_functions_via_bindings_-_unintended_function_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might unintentionally expose sensitive Go functions to the frontend JavaScript code through Wails bindings.
*   **Wails Contribution:** Wails' core feature of binding Go functions to the frontend directly creates this attack surface. The ease of binding can lead to over-exposure if not carefully managed.
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally binds a `GetUserAdminDetails(userID string)` function, intended only for internal server-side use, to the frontend. A malicious frontend script could then call this function to retrieve sensitive admin details for any user ID.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, backend logic bypass.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only bind Go functions that are absolutely necessary for frontend functionality.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all function bindings to ensure no sensitive or internal functions are inadvertently exposed.
    *   **Access Control in Backend:** Implement robust authorization checks within bound Go functions to verify if the caller (even if from the frontend) is authorized to perform the action.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Go Backend Functions via Bindings - Insecure Function Implementation (Input Validation)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_go_backend_functions_via_bindings_-_insecure_function_implementation__input_validation_.md)

*   **Description:** Bound Go functions might lack proper input validation, making them vulnerable to injection attacks or other input-related exploits when called from the frontend.
*   **Wails Contribution:** Wails facilitates direct frontend-to-backend function calls, increasing the attack surface if backend functions are not designed with frontend input in mind and lack input sanitization.
*   **Example:** A bound Go function `ProcessUserInput(input string)` directly executes the `input` string as a system command without sanitization. A malicious frontend could call this function with `"; rm -rf /"` to execute a dangerous command on the server.
*   **Impact:** Command injection, path traversal, SQL injection (if database interaction), denial of service, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all input received from the frontend within bound Go functions. Use allow-lists and escape/encode user-provided data appropriately.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Backend Execution):**  Avoid executing system commands or directly interacting with databases based on raw frontend input. If necessary, use parameterized queries or secure libraries to interact with external systems.
    *   **Security Testing:** Conduct thorough input fuzzing and penetration testing on bound Go functions to identify input validation vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Bridge Vulnerabilities - Message Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/inter-process_communication__ipc__bridge_vulnerabilities_-_message_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** The IPC channel between the frontend and Go backend might be vulnerable to message injection or manipulation, allowing attackers to bypass frontend security or tamper with data in transit.
*   **Wails Contribution:** Wails relies on IPC for communication between the frontend and backend. The security of this IPC mechanism is crucial and any weakness here is directly related to Wails' architecture.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts IPC messages and injects a crafted message to the backend that triggers an administrative function call, bypassing frontend authentication checks. Or, an attacker modifies a message containing user data in transit to alter the data processed by the backend.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data tampering, bypassing frontend security controls, unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure IPC Mechanism:** Ensure Wails uses a secure and robust IPC mechanism. (While Wails handles this internally, developers should be aware of potential underlying vulnerabilities in the chosen IPC method and keep Wails updated).
    *   **Message Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks (e.g., digital signatures or HMAC) on IPC messages to detect and prevent tampering. (This might require custom implementation on top of Wails' default IPC).
    *   **Minimize Sensitive Data in IPC:** Reduce the amount of sensitive data transmitted over IPC. If possible, process sensitive data primarily in the backend and only send necessary identifiers or non-sensitive data over IPC.

## Attack Surface: [Frontend (WebView/Chromium) Specific Issues within Wails Context - Context Isolation Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/frontend__webviewchromium__specific_issues_within_wails_context_-_context_isolation_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:**  While WebView/Chromium provides context isolation, vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within Wails could potentially weaken this isolation, allowing malicious frontend JavaScript to access backend resources or escape the sandbox.
*   **Wails Contribution:** Wails' integration of the frontend and backend within a single application context introduces potential complexities that could, in theory, lead to context isolation issues if not handled correctly by Wails or if underlying WebView vulnerabilities are present.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in Wails' internal JavaScript bridge or a misconfiguration allows malicious JavaScript code in the frontend to access Go backend memory or execute arbitrary code on the host system.
*   **Impact:** Backend compromise, system-level compromise, data breach, complete application takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (though less likely to be *directly* caused by Wails itself, more by underlying WebView/Chromium issues or Wails integration flaws)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Wails and Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Wails and its dependencies, including the underlying WebView/Chromium components, to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Follow Wails Security Best Practices:** Adhere to any security guidelines provided by the Wails team regarding frontend and backend interaction.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Wails application, including both frontend and backend components, to identify potential context isolation weaknesses or misconfigurations.
