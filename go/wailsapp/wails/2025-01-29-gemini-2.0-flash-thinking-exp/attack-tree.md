## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Backend Vulnerabilities via Exposed Go Functions - [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_backend_vulnerabilities_via_exposed_go_functions_-__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector Category:** Backend Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within the Go backend code that is exposed to the frontend via Wails' bridge. Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences due to backend's privileged access.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rigorous input validation and sanitization in Go functions.
        *   Secure coding practices in Go, focusing on memory safety and concurrency.
        *   Regular security audits and code reviews of Go backend code.
        *   Principle of least privilege in backend logic.

**1.1. Injection Vulnerabilities in Exposed Go Functions - [CRITICAL NODE]**

*   **Attack Vector Category:** Injection Attacks
*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or commands through frontend inputs that are not properly sanitized and are then processed by vulnerable Go functions.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Treat all frontend data as untrusted. Implement strict validation and sanitization in Go functions.
        *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Execution:**  Avoid directly executing shell commands based on frontend input. If necessary, use secure alternatives and strict input validation.
        *   **Path Sanitization:** For file system operations, sanitize file paths and use whitelisting for allowed directories.

    *   **1.1.1. Command Injection via Go Function - [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Critical
