## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization on Both Sides (Go-JS Bridge)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_on_both_sides__go-js_bridge_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization on Both Sides (Go-JS Bridge)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all Wails bridge data exchange points:**  Map out every function call and data flow between the JavaScript frontend and the Go backend that utilizes the Wails bridge.
    2.  **Define validation rules (Go backend for Wails bridge inputs):** For each Go function exposed via Wails bindings and receiving data from JavaScript, define strict validation rules based on expected data types, formats, and ranges.
        *   Use Go's built-in validation capabilities or libraries like `go-playground/validator`.
        *   Reject invalid data received through the Wails bridge with clear error messages and prevent further processing.
    3.  **Sanitize data (Go backend to JS frontend via Wails bridge):** Before sending data from the Go backend to the JavaScript frontend *through the Wails bridge*, sanitize it to prevent potential injection attacks in the frontend context.
        *   For HTML content passed via the Wails bridge, use Go libraries to escape HTML entities.
        *   For JavaScript code snippets (if absolutely necessary to pass via the Wails bridge), carefully sanitize or avoid passing code directly.
    4.  **Define validation rules (JS frontend for Wails bridge outputs):**  Implement client-side validation in JavaScript as a first line of defense and to provide immediate feedback to the user *before sending data through the Wails bridge*.
        *   Use JavaScript's built-in validation or libraries for form validation.
        *   Match client-side validation rules with server-side rules for consistency in Wails bridge communication.
    5.  **Sanitize data (JS frontend to Go backend via Wails bridge):** Before sending data from the JavaScript frontend to the Go backend *through the Wails bridge*, sanitize it to prevent potential injection attacks in the backend context.
        *   While backend validation is primary, frontend sanitization adds a layer of defense for Wails bridge interactions.
        *   Consider encoding or escaping data based on the expected backend processing after it's received via the Wails bridge.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Wails Bridge (High Severity):** Prevents malicious JavaScript code injection into the frontend via data from the backend (sent through the Wails bridge) or user input processed and returned via the bridge.
    *   **Backend Injection Attacks via Wails Bridge (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.) (High Severity):** Prevents malicious code injection into the Go backend via data from the frontend (sent through the Wails bridge).
    *   **Data Integrity Issues in Wails Bridge Communication (Medium Severity):** Ensures data exchanged between frontend and backend via the Wails bridge is in the expected format and range, preventing unexpected application behavior due to bridge communication issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS via Wails Bridge:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Backend Injection Attacks via Wails Bridge:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Integrity Issues in Wails Bridge Communication:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Backend validation is in place for critical data inputs in the `user registration` and `data processing` Go packages, specifically for functions exposed via Wails. Frontend validation is implemented for user forms in `src/components/Forms.js` that interact with Wails backend functions.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Sanitization of data from Go to JS *via the Wails bridge* is not consistently applied across all data points. Frontend sanitization before sending data to Go *through the Wails bridge* is missing. Validation rules need to be reviewed and expanded to cover all data exchange points *over the Wails bridge*, especially in newer features like `real-time updates` and `plugin integrations` that heavily rely on the bridge.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Exposed Go Functions (Wails API Surface)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_exposed_go_functions__wails_api_surface_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Exposed Go Functions (Wails API Surface)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review all Wails-exposed Go functions:**  List all Go functions currently exposed to the JavaScript frontend via Wails bindings. This defines the Wails API surface.
    2.  **Assess necessity for Wails exposure:** For each function exposed via Wails, evaluate if it is absolutely necessary to be directly accessible from the JavaScript frontend *through the Wails bridge*.
        *   Consider if the functionality can be achieved through a different, less direct approach that minimizes the Wails API surface.
        *   Question if the function unnecessarily exposes internal Go logic or sensitive operations directly to the frontend via Wails.
    3.  **Reduce Wails API surface:**  Remove or refactor Go functions exposed via Wails that are not essential or expose excessive functionality through the Wails bridge.
        *   Combine multiple Wails-exposed functions into fewer, more generalized functions with controlled parameters, reducing the overall Wails API surface.
        *   Move sensitive logic to internal Go functions *not directly accessible from the frontend via Wails*.  Expose only necessary, sanitized interfaces through the Wails bridge.
    4.  **Implement access control for Wails-exposed functions (if needed):** If certain Wails-exposed functions are necessary but should only be accessible under specific conditions from the frontend, implement access control mechanisms in Go.
        *   Check user roles or permissions in Go *within the Wails-exposed functions* before executing sensitive operations triggered from the frontend via the bridge.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Backend Functionality via Wails Bridge (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces the attack surface of the Wails application by limiting the number of Go functions attackers can potentially exploit from the frontend *through the Wails bridge*.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Wails API (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental exposure of internal Go logic or sensitive data through an overly permissive Wails API surface.
    *   **Abuse of Wails-Exposed Functionality (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential for malicious actors to misuse Wails-exposed functions for unintended purposes by reducing the available attack vectors through the Wails bridge.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access via Wails Bridge:** Medium to High Risk Reduction
    *   **Information Disclosure via Wails API:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Abuse of Wails-Exposed Functionality:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Initial design focused on exposing only necessary functions via Wails. However, recent feature additions in `reporting` and `admin panel` modules might have introduced new Wails-exposed functions that need review.
*   **Missing Implementation:** A comprehensive review and audit of all currently Wails-exposed Go functions is needed. Specifically, the functions exposed in the `reporting` and `admin panel` Go packages via Wails bindings need to be assessed for necessity and potential over-exposure through the Wails API. Access control mechanisms are not yet implemented for any Wails-exposed functions.  The principle of least privilege for the Wails API surface needs to be enforced more rigorously.
