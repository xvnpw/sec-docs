### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Incorrect Quantile Calculation after Merging Streams
- Description:
    1. An attacker cannot directly trigger this vulnerability. It is a logic error in the `Merge` function of the `quantile` package.
    2. If a system uses the `quantile` package to merge multiple data streams, for example from different servers or data sources, to calculate quantiles over the combined data, the `Merge` function will produce incorrect results.
    3. The documentation and tests explicitly mark the `Merge` function as broken and state that "The underlying algorithm is not capable of merging streams correctly."
    4. When `Merge` is called, it attempts to combine samples from another stream into the current stream. However, due to a flaw in the merging logic within the `stream.merge` function, the combined stream does not accurately represent the merged data distribution, leading to incorrect quantile calculations when `Query` is called afterwards.
- Impact:
    - Applications relying on the `quantile` package for accurate quantile calculations after merging data streams will receive incorrect results.
    - In security contexts, such as monitoring or anomaly detection, this can lead to misinterpretation of data, potentially causing missed security threats (false negatives) or unnecessary alerts (false positives).
    - The integrity of data analysis is compromised when merging streams.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The code contains comments explicitly stating that the `Merge` function is broken in `/code/quantile/stream.go` and `/code/quantile/example_test.go`.
    - The tests related to merging are marked as "BrokenTest" in `/code/quantile/stream_test.go` indicating that they are expected to fail.
    - Documentation within the `Merge` function itself warns about the issue in `/code/quantile/stream.go`.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - The `Merge` function should be fixed to correctly merge streams, or it should be removed or clearly marked as not recommended for use in scenarios requiring accurate merging.
    - A warning or error should be raised if `Merge` is called to alert users to the potential for incorrect results.
    - Clear documentation should advise users against relying on `Merge` for accurate quantile calculations.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must use the `quantile` package and utilize the `Merge` function to combine data from multiple streams.
    - The application must rely on the accuracy of quantile calculations after merging streams for its functionality, especially in security-sensitive scenarios.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. Open `/code/quantile/stream.go`.
    2. Locate the `Merge` function within the `Stream` struct:
    ```go
    // Merge merges samples into the underlying streams samples. This is handy when
    // merging multiple streams from separate threads, database shards, etc.
    //
    // ATTENTION: This method is broken and does not yield correct results. The
    // underlying algorithm is not capable of merging streams correctly.
    func (s *Stream) Merge(samples Samples) {
        sort.Sort(samples)
        s.stream.merge(samples)
    }
    ```
    3. Note the `ATTENTION` comment explicitly stating the function is broken.
    4. Examine the `stream.merge` function called by `Stream.Merge`:
    ```go
    func (s *stream) merge(samples Samples) {
        // TODO(beorn7): This tries to merge not only individual samples, but
        // whole summaries. The paper doesn't mention merging summaries at
        // all. Unittests show that the merging is inaccurate. Find out how to
        // do merges properly.
        var r float64
        i := 0
        for _, sample := range samples {
            for ; i < len(s.l); i++ {
                c := s.l[i]
                if c.Value > sample.Value {
                    // Insert at position i.
                    s.l = append(s.l, Sample{})
                    copy(s.l[i+1:], s.l[i:])
                    s.l[i] = Sample{
                        sample.Value,
                        sample.Width,
                        math.Max(sample.Delta, math.Floor(s.Æ’(s, r))-1),
                        // TODO(beorn7): How to calculate delta correctly?
                    }
                    i++
                    goto inserted
                }
                r += c.Width
            }
            s.l = append(s.l, Sample{sample.Value, sample.Width, 0})
            i++
        inserted:
            s.n += sample.Width
            r += sample.Width
        }
        s.compress()
    }
    ```
    5. The `TODO` comment within `stream.merge` further confirms that the implementation is known to be inaccurate and that the approach of merging summaries might be incorrect.
    6. The merging logic attempts to insert samples while maintaining sorted order, but the comment indicates a fundamental issue with the algorithm's ability to correctly merge quantile stream summaries.
    7. Review the broken tests in `/code/quantile/stream_test.go` like `BrokenTestTargetedMerge`, `BrokenTestLowBiasedMerge`, and `BrokenTestHighBiasedMerge`. These tests are designed to verify the `Merge` function but are marked as broken because they are expected to fail, demonstrating the known inaccuracy of the merging process.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a test Go application that imports the `github.com/beorn7/perks/quantile` package.
    2. Initialize two `quantile.Stream` instances, `stream1` and `stream2`, using `quantile.NewTargeted` with the same target quantiles (e.g., `map[float64]float64{0.90: 0.01}`).
    3. Populate `stream1` with a set of numerical data, for example, integers from 1 to 100.
    4. Populate `stream2` with a different set of numerical data, for example, integers from 101 to 200.
    5. Query the 90th percentile from `stream1` and `stream2` individually using `stream1.Query(0.9)` and `stream2.Query(0.9)`, and record these values as `quantile1` and `quantile2`.
    6. Merge `stream2` into `stream1` using `stream1.Merge(stream2.Samples())`.
    7. Query the 90th percentile from the merged `stream1` using `stream1.Query(0.9)`, and record this value as `mergedQuantile`.
    8. Create a combined dataset by concatenating the data used to populate `stream1` and `stream2`.
    9. Sort the combined dataset and calculate the true 90th percentile. Let's call this `trueQuantile`.
    10. Compare `mergedQuantile` with `trueQuantile`. If `mergedQuantile` deviates significantly from `trueQuantile` (more than the expected error margin defined by the epsilon in `NewTargeted`, and significantly more than `quantile1` and `quantile2` deviated from their respective true quantiles), then the test confirms the inaccuracy of the `Merge` function.
    11. For example, print the values of `trueQuantile`, `mergedQuantile`, `quantile1`, and `quantile2` and observe the significant difference between `trueQuantile` and `mergedQuantile`, demonstrating the vulnerability.
