```python
# Placeholder for potential code snippets related to Asynq configuration or task submission
# This is illustrative and would need to be adapted to the specific application

# Example of potentially vulnerable task submission (Illustrative - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
# from asynq import enqueue_task

# def submit_task(task_type, payload):
#     enqueue_task(task_type, payload) # Missing authentication/authorization

# Example of a more secure approach (Illustrative)
# from asynq import enqueue_task
# from your_app.auth import is_authorized

# def submit_task(user, task_type, payload):
#     if is_authorized(user, task_type):
#         enqueue_task(task_type, payload)
#     else:
#         raise PermissionError("User not authorized to submit this task type.")
