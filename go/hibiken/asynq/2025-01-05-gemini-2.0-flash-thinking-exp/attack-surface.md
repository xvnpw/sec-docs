# Attack Surface Analysis for hibiken/asynq

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Redis Connection](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_redis_connection.md)

**Description:** The Redis instance used by Asynq is not properly secured, allowing unauthorized access.

**How Asynq Contributes:** Asynq relies on Redis as its message broker. If the connection between the Asynq server/client and Redis is not secured, it becomes a point of attack.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the unprotected Redis instance and can read task payloads, inject malicious tasks, or delete existing tasks.

**Impact:** Data breach (exposure of task data), denial of service (queue manipulation), arbitrary code execution (if tasks trigger vulnerable code).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable authentication on the Redis instance and configure Asynq to use the authentication credentials.
*   Use TLS/SSL to encrypt the communication between Asynq and Redis.
*   Restrict network access to the Redis instance to only authorized hosts (e.g., the Asynq server).
*   Avoid exposing the Redis port directly to the internet.

## Attack Surface: [Task Payload Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/task_payload_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Task payloads are deserialized by worker processes, and if an insecure serialization format is used (e.g., pickle in Python) without proper validation, malicious payloads can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**How Asynq Contributes:** Asynq passes data between the client and worker through task payloads. The choice of serialization format and the way workers handle deserialization is critical.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious task payload using `pickle` that, when deserialized by a worker, executes arbitrary system commands on the worker's host.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on worker machines, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or lateral movement within the network.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using insecure deserialization formats like `pickle` in Python. Prefer safer alternatives like JSON or Protocol Buffers.
*   If `pickle` is absolutely necessary, implement robust input validation and sanitization before deserialization.
*   Consider using digital signatures or message authentication codes (MACs) to verify the integrity and authenticity of task payloads.
*   Run worker processes with minimal privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Attacks via Task Payloads](./attack_surfaces/injection_attacks_via_task_payloads.md)

**Description:** Data from task payloads is used directly in downstream systems (e.g., database queries, system commands) without proper sanitization, leading to injection vulnerabilities.

**How Asynq Contributes:** Asynq facilitates the transfer of data that might be used in vulnerable operations within the worker processes.

**Example:** A task payload contains unsanitized user input that is directly used in an SQL query within the task handler, leading to SQL injection.

**Impact:** Data breaches (reading or modifying database data), arbitrary code execution (if used in system commands), or other unintended consequences.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize and validate data received from task payloads before using it in external systems.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
*   Avoid constructing system commands directly from task payload data; use safe APIs or libraries.
*   Implement input validation rules based on expected data types and formats.

## Attack Surface: [Worker Process Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/worker_process_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker enqueues a large number of resource-intensive tasks, overwhelming the worker processes and causing a denial of service.

**How Asynq Contributes:** Asynq is the mechanism for enqueuing and processing these tasks.

**Example:** An attacker floods the queue with tasks that perform computationally expensive operations or access external resources excessively, causing the workers to become unresponsive.

**Impact:** Denial of service, impacting application availability and potentially other dependent services.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting on task enqueueing to prevent flooding.
*   Set appropriate concurrency limits for worker processes.
*   Monitor worker resource usage (CPU, memory) and implement alerts.
*   Design tasks to be efficient and avoid unnecessary resource consumption.
*   Implement queue size limits and backpressure mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Task Payloads](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_task_payloads.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information is stored directly within task payloads without proper encryption, making it vulnerable if the Redis instance is compromised.

**How Asynq Contributes:** Asynq handles the transportation and storage (in Redis) of these payloads.

**Example:** Task payloads contain personally identifiable information (PII) or API keys in plain text, which are exposed if an attacker gains access to the Redis database.

**Impact:** Data breach, compliance violations, reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in task payloads.
*   If sensitive data must be included, encrypt it before enqueuing and decrypt it within the worker process.
*   Use secure key management practices for encryption keys.
*   Consider using references to data stored securely elsewhere instead of embedding the data in the payload.
