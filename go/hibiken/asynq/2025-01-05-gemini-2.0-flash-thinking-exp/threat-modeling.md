# Threat Model Analysis for hibiken/asynq

## Threat: [Malicious Payload Injection](./threats/malicious_payload_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious data within a task payload during enqueueing via the Asynq client. When an Asynq worker processes this task, the malicious payload could be interpreted and executed by the task handler, potentially leading to unintended actions. This exploits the inherent trust in the data being processed by the worker.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access to resources accessible by the worker, remote code execution on worker machines, application malfunction, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Asynq Client (enqueueing functionality), Asynq Worker (task processing).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all data received within task handlers. This should occur *within the application code* that defines and handles the tasks.
    *   Avoid using dynamic code execution or deserialization of untrusted data within task handlers.
    *   Adhere to secure coding practices when developing task handlers.
    *   Consider using message signing or encryption *before* passing data to the Asynq client for enqueueing to verify integrity at the worker.

## Threat: [Task Queue Flooding / Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/task_queue_flooding__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could leverage the Asynq client to enqueue a large number of tasks, potentially legitimate but resource-intensive, or specifically crafted to consume excessive resources. This can overwhelm the Asynq worker processes and the underlying Redis instance, preventing legitimate tasks from being processed or causing system outages. The vulnerability lies in the ability to enqueue tasks without sufficient rate limiting or validation at the Asynq level.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, delayed processing of critical tasks, resource exhaustion on worker machines and the Redis instance, and potential system crashes.
*   **Affected Component:** Asynq Client (enqueueing functionality), Asynq Worker (resource consumption).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on task enqueueing within the application logic *before* using the Asynq client. Asynq itself doesn't provide built-in rate limiting on enqueueing.
    *   Implement queue size limits and monitoring. While Asynq provides queue monitoring, the limits need to be enforced by the application or Redis configuration.
    *   Use priority queues to ensure critical tasks are processed even under load. This is a feature of Asynq, so proper configuration is key.
    *   Monitor resource usage of worker processes and the Redis instance.

## Threat: [Asynq Web UI Vulnerabilities (If Enabled)](./threats/asynq_web_ui_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If the optional `asynq` web UI is enabled, it could be susceptible to common web application vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), or insecure authentication/authorization. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the UI, manipulate task queues (e.g., delete, retry), or potentially execute malicious scripts in the context of other users accessing the UI. This directly involves the code within the Asynq project for the web UI.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to task management and monitoring, manipulation of task queues potentially leading to data loss or service disruption, potential for further attacks on users accessing the UI.
*   **Affected Component:** Asynq Web UI (provided by the `asynq` library).
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `asynq` library updated to benefit from security patches in the web UI.
    *   Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the web UI. The default UI might have basic protection, but robust measures might be needed.
    *   Implement standard web security measures like input sanitization and output encoding to prevent XSS.
    *   Use anti-CSRF tokens to prevent CSRF attacks.
    *   Consider disabling the web UI if it's not strictly necessary to reduce the attack surface.
