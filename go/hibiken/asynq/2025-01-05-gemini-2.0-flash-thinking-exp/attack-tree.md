## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Task Queue Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_task_queue_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- This represents the broad category of attacks targeting the task queue itself. Success here allows attackers to manipulate the application's workflow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Task Submission (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_task_submission__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attackers inject malicious tasks into the queue without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attackers circumvent security measures to submit tasks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Authentication Mechanisms (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_authentication_mechanisms__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- Leveraging easily guessable passwords, default credentials, or flawed authentication logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Task Data Manipulation (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/task_data_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attackers alter the content of tasks in the queue to cause harm.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payloads (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payloads__high-risk_path_.md)

- Embedding harmful data within task parameters.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_applicable___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

-  Exploiting flaws in how task data is converted back into objects, potentially leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Payloads Leading to Code Execution (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_payloads_leading_to_code_execution__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

-  Designing task data to directly trigger the execution of malicious code when processed by a worker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Existing Task Data](./attack_tree_paths/modify_existing_task_data.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Underlying Queue (e.g., Redis) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_underlying_queue__e_g___redis___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- Directly accessing and altering the task queue backend, bypassing Asynq's intended controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Worker Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_worker_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- Targeting the processes that execute tasks, aiming to gain control or cause disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection via Task Payload (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_via_task_payload__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- Injecting malicious code through the data provided in the task.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Deserialization of Task Arguments (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_deserialization_of_task_arguments__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

-  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how task arguments are deserialized by the worker, leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_input_sanitizationvalidation__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

-  Failing to properly clean and check task data before processing, allowing for the injection of malicious commands or scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection through Task Parameters (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_through_task_parameters__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

-  Using task parameters directly in system commands without proper escaping, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the worker's system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Underlying Infrastructure (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_underlying_infrastructure__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- Targeting the systems that support Asynq, primarily the task queue backend (e.g., Redis).

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Redis Instance (if used as backend) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_redis_instance__if_used_as_backend___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- Gaining control of the Redis server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Access to Redis (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_access_to_redis__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- Accessing the Redis instance without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- Using the default username and password for Redis, which are often publicly known.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Authentication (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_authentication__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- Using easily guessable or insecure passwords for Redis.

## Attack Tree Path: [Network Exposure (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/network_exposure__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- Making the Redis instance accessible from untrusted networks without proper access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Redis Command Injection (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/redis_command_injection__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- Exploiting vulnerabilities to inject and execute arbitrary Redis commands, potentially leading to code execution or data manipulation within Redis.
