# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for hibiken/asynq

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Payload Validation (with Asynq Context)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_payload_validation__with_asynq_context_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Schema:** Create a formal schema for *each* task type, defining allowed fields, data types, and constraints. Use Go structs with validation tags (e.g., `go-playground/validator`) or JSON Schema.
2.  **Validate *Before* Enqueue:** *Before* calling `client.Enqueue()`, validate the task payload against the defined schema. Reject invalid tasks *immediately*.
3.  **Whitelist:** Define what is *allowed*, not what is blocked.
4.  **Task Definition Struct:** Create a separate Go struct representing validated task data. Populate this struct *after* validation and pass *that* to `asynq`.
5. **Context:** Use the `context.Context` passed to the `asynq.HandlerFunc` to access request-scoped data (e.g., user ID, request ID) *if and only if* that data has been securely authenticated and authorized *before* the task was enqueued.  Do *not* rely on data passed directly in the task payload for authorization decisions within the handler.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Task Poisoning/Malicious Task Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents injection of arbitrary code or data.
    *   **Data Corruption (Severity: High):** Ensures data conforms to expected formats.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior (Severity: Medium):** Reduces unexpected behavior from malformed data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Task Poisoning:** Risk reduced by 90-95%.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced by 80-90%.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Risk reduced by 70-80%.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `handlers/task_handlers.go`. Basic presence checks, but no rigorous type/value constraints or schema validation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing comprehensive schema validation.
    *   Missing strict type/value constraints.
    *   Missing a separate "task definition" struct.
    *   Missing validation *before* enqueuing in *all* client code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Idempotency (Using Asynq Task IDs)](./mitigation_strategies/idempotency__using_asynq_task_ids_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Unique Task IDs:** Leverage the unique task IDs automatically generated by `asynq`.
2.  **Tracking Store:** Create a persistent store (e.g., database table) to track task status (at least task ID and status: "pending", "processing", "completed", "failed").
3.  **Check Before Processing:** *Before* a worker (within the `asynq.HandlerFunc`) starts processing, check the tracking store using the `asynq.Task.ID()` to see if it's already "completed".
4.  **Skip if Completed:** If already "completed", skip processing and `return nil` (acknowledge the task).
5.  **Atomic Updates:** Ensure atomic updates to the tracking store.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Replay Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Prevents duplicate execution.
    *   **Accidental Duplicate Enqueuing (Severity: Low):** Mitigates duplicate enqueuing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Risk reduced by 90-95%.
    *   **Accidental Duplicate Enqueuing:** Risk reduced by 95-99%.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No idempotency mechanisms.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing *all* aspects of idempotency.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Task Expiration (Using Asynq Deadlines)](./mitigation_strategies/task_expiration__using_asynq_deadlines_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Set Deadlines:** When enqueuing tasks, *always* use `asynq.ProcessIn()` or `asynq.ProcessAt()` to set reasonable deadlines. Choose deadlines appropriate for the task type.
2.  **Handle Expired Tasks:** Monitor `asynq`'s dead letter queue (where expired tasks go) and investigate why tasks are expiring.  This is handled by `asynq` itself.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Replay Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Limits the replay attack window.
    *   **Stale Tasks (Severity: Low):** Prevents processing of irrelevant tasks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Risk reduced by 50-70% (depends on deadlines).
    *   **Stale Tasks:** Risk reduced by 90-95%.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Inconsistent use of `asynq.ProcessIn()`; deadlines not always appropriate.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing consistent deadlines for *all* task types.
    *   Missing a strategy for handling expired tasks in the dead letter queue.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Priority Queues (Using Asynq Priorities)](./mitigation_strategies/priority_queues__using_asynq_priorities_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Priorities:** Assign priorities to different task types using `asynq.Queue()` with the `:priority` option (e.g., `asynq.Queue("critical:10")`, `asynq.Queue("default:5")`, `asynq.Queue("low:1")`).  Higher numbers indicate higher priority.
2.  **Configure Workers:** Configure your `asynq.Server` to process queues in the desired order of priority.  This is done when starting the server.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DoS (Severity: High):** Ensures critical tasks are processed even under heavy load.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium):** Prioritizes important tasks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced by 40-50% (helps ensure critical tasks get through).
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced by 60-70%.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No priority queues are used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing *all* aspects of priority queue implementation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Error Handling with Retries and Dead Letter Queue (Using Asynq Features)](./mitigation_strategies/error_handling_with_retries_and_dead_letter_queue__using_asynq_features_.md)

**Description:**
1. **MaxRetry:** Use the `asynq.MaxRetry()` option when enqueuing tasks to specify the maximum number of retries for a failed task.
2. **RetryDelay:** Customize the retry delay using `asynq.RetryDelay()` option. Consider using exponential backoff.
3. **Dead Letter Queue:** Monitor and manage the dead letter queue. Tasks that exceed their maximum retry count are automatically moved here by `asynq`. Investigate and potentially requeue or discard tasks from the dead letter queue.
4. **Error Handling in Handler:** Within your `asynq.HandlerFunc`, handle errors gracefully. Return an error to trigger a retry (up to `MaxRetry`).  Log the error *securely*, avoiding sensitive information.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Transient Errors (Severity: Low):** Handles temporary failures (e.g., network glitches).
    * **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Prevents infinite retries from consuming resources.
    * **Poison Messages (Severity: Medium):** Moves persistently failing tasks to the dead letter queue, preventing them from blocking the queue.

* **Impact:**
     * **Transient Errors:** Risk reduced by 80-90%.
     * **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced by 90-95%.
     * **Poison Messages:** Risk reduced by 95-99%.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * `asynq.MaxRetry()` is used in some places, but not consistently.
    * No custom `RetryDelay` is configured.
    * No monitoring or management of the dead letter queue.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Consistent use of `asynq.MaxRetry()` for all tasks.
    * Configuration of appropriate `RetryDelay` (e.g., exponential backoff).
    * A process for monitoring and managing the dead letter queue.
    * Secure and robust error logging within the handler.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring (Using Asynq's Built-in Capabilities)](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring__using_asynq's_built-in_capabilities_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`asynqmon`:** Use the `asynqmon` command-line tool to monitor queue statistics, worker activity, and task status in real-time.  This tool is provided by `asynq`.
2.  **Programmatic Access:** Use `asynq`'s Go API to programmatically access queue and worker information for integration with custom monitoring solutions.  (Refer to `asynq` documentation for specific API calls).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Detection of Attacks (Severity: Variable):** Enables early detection of anomalies.
    *   **Troubleshooting (Severity: Medium):** Helps diagnose performance issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Detection of Attacks:** Improves detection capabilities.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Simplifies troubleshooting.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `asynqmon` is not being used.
    *   No programmatic monitoring.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing use of `asynqmon`.
    *   Missing programmatic monitoring integration.
