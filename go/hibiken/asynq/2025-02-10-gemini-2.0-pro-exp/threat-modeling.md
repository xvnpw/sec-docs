# Threat Model Analysis for hibiken/asynq

## Threat: [Malicious Task Injection](./threats/malicious_task_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious task payload and injects it into the queue *via the asynq client*. This bypasses application-level input validation (if any exists at the point of task creation) and relies on exploiting vulnerabilities in how `asynq` handles task deserialization or how the *user has configured* `asynq` to handle serialization. The malicious payload contains code to be executed by the worker upon deserialization.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the worker server, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `asynq.Client` (specifically, the `Enqueue` and related methods), `asynq.Worker` (the task processing and deserialization logic), any custom `asynq.PayloadConverter` implementations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation (Pre-Enqueue):**  Even though this is an `asynq`-focused threat model, *always* validate and sanitize data *before* it's passed to `asynq.Client.Enqueue`. This is the first line of defense.  Don't rely solely on `asynq` for security.
    *   **Safe Serialization (Asynq Config):** Use the default `encoding/json` serializer provided by `asynq`.  *Avoid* custom serializers unless absolutely necessary and you are *extremely* confident in their security. If a custom serializer *must* be used, it must be rigorously audited and hardened against deserialization attacks.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Worker):** Run worker processes with the absolute minimum necessary privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve code execution.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) (If Applicable):** If tasks involve rendering any content (highly unusual, but possible), use CSP to restrict the sources of executable code. This is a defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [Task Starvation (via Asynq Client)](./threats/task_starvation__via_asynq_client_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, *using the `asynq.Client`*, floods the queue with a large number of tasks.  This is distinct from a general DoS attack on the application; it's specifically targeting the `asynq` queueing mechanism. The attacker might use a large number of low-priority tasks or a smaller number of tasks designed to consume excessive resources on the worker.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service for legitimate users; application becomes unresponsive or significantly degraded because legitimate tasks are delayed or never processed.
*   **Affected Component:** `asynq.Client` (the `Enqueue` and related methods), `asynq.Server` (the queue multiplexer), `asynq.Worker` (task processing).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (Pre-Enqueue):** Implement rate limiting *before* calls to `asynq.Client.Enqueue`. This is the most effective mitigation. Limit the number of tasks a user or IP address can enqueue within a given time period.
    *   **Priority Queues (Asynq Config):** Utilize `asynq`'s priority queue feature (`asynq.QueuePriority`) to ensure that critical tasks are processed before less important ones. This helps mitigate the impact of a flood of low-priority tasks.
    *   **Resource Limits (Asynq Config):** Set reasonable timeouts and retry limits for tasks using `asynq.Config` options like `Timeout` and `Retry`. This prevents individual malicious tasks from consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Queue Monitoring (Asynq & External):** Continuously monitor queue length and worker activity using `asynq`'s built-in metrics and external monitoring tools.  Set up alerts for high queue lengths and worker resource exhaustion.

## Threat: [Unpatched Asynq Vulnerability](./threats/unpatched_asynq_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability is discovered and publicly disclosed in the `asynq` library itself.  This is distinct from vulnerabilities in Redis or in user-provided worker code. An attacker exploits this `asynq`-specific vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability within `asynq`, but could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution *if the vulnerability is in a critical component like the client or server*.
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially any component of the `asynq` library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Variable (but could be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the `asynq` library updated to the latest stable version. This is the primary mitigation.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for announcements related to `asynq`.
    *   **Rapid Patching:** Have a process in place to quickly apply security patches to `asynq` when they are released.
