Okay, let's create a design document for the Asynq project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Asynq is a Go library for asynchronous task processing.  It's designed to be a robust, scalable, and reliable alternative to other task queue systems.  It appears to be targeted at developers and organizations building applications that require background job processing.  The project's maturity suggests a focus on stability and production-readiness, rather than rapid feature iteration.

Priorities:

- Reliability: Ensuring tasks are processed, even in the face of failures.
- Scalability: Handling a large volume of tasks and workers.
- Performance: Processing tasks efficiently with minimal overhead.
- Operability:  Providing tools for monitoring and managing the system.
- Maintainability:  Keeping the codebase clean and easy to understand.
- Security: Protecting against unauthorized access and malicious tasks.

Goals:

- Provide a stable and reliable task queue system for Go applications.
- Offer a simple and intuitive API for developers.
- Support a variety of use cases, from simple background jobs to complex workflows.
- Be a viable alternative to existing task queue solutions.

Business Risks:

- Data Loss:  Loss of tasks due to system failures or vulnerabilities. This is a critical risk, as lost tasks can represent lost business operations (e.g., unsent emails, unprocessed orders).
- Data Corruption:  Modification or corruption of task data, leading to incorrect processing.
- Service Disruption:  Denial-of-service attacks or system overloads that prevent task processing.
- Unauthorized Access:  Unauthorized access to the task queue, allowing attackers to submit malicious tasks or steal sensitive data.
- Supply Chain Attacks: Vulnerabilities introduced through compromised dependencies.
- Code Injection:  Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious code into tasks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Input Validation: The library likely performs some input validation on task data, although the extent is not immediately clear from a cursory review.  (Needs further investigation in the codebase).
- security control: Error Handling:  The library includes robust error handling to prevent crashes and data loss. (Visible throughout the codebase).
- security control: Testing:  The project has a comprehensive test suite, which helps to identify and prevent security vulnerabilities. (Visible in the test files).
- security control: Dependency Management: Go modules are used for dependency management, allowing for version pinning and vulnerability scanning. (go.mod file)
- security control: Atomic Operations: Uses Redis atomic operations to prevent race conditions. (Visible in the codebase using Redis commands like `LMOVE`, `SADD`, etc.)

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Reliance on Redis Security: The security of Asynq is heavily dependent on the security of the underlying Redis instance.  If Redis is compromised, Asynq is also compromised.
- accepted risk: Limited Built-in Authentication/Authorization: Asynq itself does not appear to provide built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms.  It relies on the application using it to implement these controls.
- accepted risk: Potential for Code Injection: If task payloads are not properly sanitized by the application, there is a potential for code injection vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all task data. This should include checks for data type, length, and format.
- security control: Consider adding support for task signing and verification to prevent task tampering.
- security control: Provide documentation and guidance on securing the Redis instance used by Asynq.
- security control: Integrate with security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, SCA) to identify vulnerabilities in the codebase and dependencies.
- security control: Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity, such as a high rate of failed tasks or unusual task payloads.
- security control: Consider adding support for encryption of task data at rest and in transit.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication:  Asynq itself does not require authentication, but the applications using it should implement appropriate authentication mechanisms to control access to the task queue.
- Authorization:  Applications should implement authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can submit, retrieve, or modify tasks.  This might involve restricting access to certain task types or queues based on user roles.
- Input Validation:  All task data should be validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. This includes:
    - Type checking
    - Length restrictions
    - Format validation (e.g., using regular expressions)
    - Whitelisting allowed characters
- Cryptography:
    - If sensitive data is included in task payloads, it should be encrypted at rest (in Redis) and in transit (between the application and Redis).
    - Consider using digital signatures to verify the integrity and authenticity of tasks.
    - Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    - Securely manage cryptographic keys.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

- Asynchronous task execution: The core business process is the reliable and efficient execution of background tasks. Failure to execute tasks can lead to significant business disruption.

Data Sensitivity:

- Task Payloads: The data within task payloads can range from non-sensitive to highly sensitive, depending on the application using Asynq.  This is the primary data to protect.
- Queue Metadata:  Metadata about the queues (e.g., queue names, task IDs) is generally less sensitive, but could be used in reconnaissance attacks.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What are the specific security requirements of applications that are expected to use Asynq? (This will vary widely.)
- What level of security auditing has been performed on the Asynq codebase?
- Are there any plans to add built-in authentication or authorization features to Asynq?
- What is the expected threat model for typical Asynq deployments? (e.g., internal applications, public-facing services)
- What are the specific data retention policies for task data?

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE:  It is assumed that users of Asynq prioritize reliability and performance, and are willing to implement necessary security controls in their applications.
- SECURITY POSTURE: It is assumed that users will properly secure their Redis instances, including authentication and network access control. It is also assumed that users will perform input validation on task data within their applications.
- DESIGN: It is assumed that a Kubernetes-based deployment is a common and representative deployment model for Asynq.  Other deployment models are possible, but the security principles remain similar.
