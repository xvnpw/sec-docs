# Attack Surface Analysis for hibiken/asynq

## Attack Surface: [1. Redis Exposure and Access Control Breaches](./attack_surfaces/1__redis_exposure_and_access_control_breaches.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the Redis instance used by `asynq`.
*   **How Asynq Contributes:** `asynq` *requires* Redis for its operation.  The security of the Redis instance is *directly* tied to the security of the `asynq` system.  `asynq`'s reliance on Redis makes this a critical concern.
*   **Example:** An attacker scans for open Redis ports (default 6379) and finds an unauthenticated instance used by an `asynq` application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete control over task queues:  The attacker can read, modify, delete, and inject tasks.
    *   Data exfiltration: Sensitive data passed as task arguments can be stolen.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS):  The attacker can flood the queue or delete all tasks.
    *   Potential for further compromise:  The attacker might use access to Redis to pivot to other parts of the system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Require Authentication:**  *Always* enable Redis authentication with a strong, unique password.  This is non-negotiable.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Restrict network access to Redis using firewalls or security groups.  Only allow connections from trusted application servers and workers.  This is crucial.
    *   **Use TLS:**  Encrypt communication between `asynq` clients/workers and Redis using TLS.  This protects data in transit.
    *   **Redis ACLs:** Implement Redis Access Control Lists (ACLs) to grant the `asynq` user only the *necessary* permissions.  Avoid `allcommands`.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Periodically review Redis configuration and network access rules.

## Attack Surface: [2. Malicious Task Injection](./attack_surfaces/2__malicious_task_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker successfully enqueues a task with a malicious payload designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the task handler.
*   **How Asynq Contributes:** `asynq` is the *mechanism* by which the malicious task is delivered and executed.  The attacker leverages `asynq`'s core functionality (running tasks) to achieve code execution.  This is a direct exploitation of `asynq`'s purpose.
*   **Example:** An application has a web form that takes user input and uses it to create an `asynq` task.  The form lacks proper input validation, allowing an attacker to inject a command into a task argument that will be executed by the worker (e.g., `"; rm -rf /; #"`).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the worker server.  This is the worst-case scenario.
    *   Data Breach:  The attacker can steal sensitive data from the worker or connected systems.
    *   System Compromise:  The attacker can gain full control of the worker server.
    *   DoS: The attacker can disrupt the worker or the entire application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  *Thoroughly* validate and sanitize *all* inputs used to construct task payloads *before* enqueuing the task.  This is the *primary* and most critical defense.  No exceptions.
    *   **Schema Validation:** Use a schema validation library (e.g., `jsonschema` in Python, `Joi` in Node.js) to enforce the expected structure and data types of task arguments.  This adds a strong layer of defense.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run worker processes with the *minimum* necessary privileges.  *Never* run workers as root.
    *   **Sandboxing:** *Strongly consider* running workers in isolated environments (e.g., containers, sandboxes) to limit the impact of a successful exploit. This is a crucial mitigation for RCE.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines within task handlers to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, SQL injection, path traversal).

## Attack Surface: [3. Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Payloads or Excessive Tasks](./attack_surfaces/3__denial_of_service__dos__via_large_payloads_or_excessive_tasks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the `asynq` system by submitting tasks with excessively large payloads or by enqueuing a massive number of tasks.
*   **How Asynq Contributes:** `asynq`'s performance and stability are directly affected by the volume and size of tasks it processes.  The attacker exploits `asynq`'s resource consumption.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends thousands of tasks, each with a multi-megabyte payload, causing Redis to run out of memory and the workers to become unresponsive.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Service Outage:  The application becomes unavailable.
    *   Resource Exhaustion:  Redis and worker servers may crash or become unusable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Payload Size Limits:**  Enforce strict limits on the size of task payloads *at the point of task creation*.  Reject tasks that exceed the limit.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Limit the rate at which tasks can be enqueued, both globally and per user/IP address.  This is essential to prevent flooding.
    *   **Queue Length Monitoring:**  Monitor the length of the `asynq` queues.  Alert on unusually long queues.  This provides early warning.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor Redis memory usage, worker CPU and memory usage, and network traffic.  Alert on high resource utilization.
    *   **Horizontal Scaling:**  Use multiple Redis instances and worker processes to distribute the load.  This increases resilience.

## Attack Surface: [4. Dependency Vulnerabilities (in Asynq Itself)](./attack_surfaces/4__dependency_vulnerabilities__in_asynq_itself_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the `asynq` library itself.
*   **How Asynq Contributes:** This is a *direct* vulnerability in the core component being analyzed.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in `asynq`'s task deserialization logic allows an attacker to craft a malicious task payload that triggers remote code execution when the task is processed, even if the task handler itself is secure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the worker server.
    *   Data Breach: The attacker can steal sensitive data.
    *   System Compromise: The attacker can gain full control of the worker.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan `asynq` itself for known vulnerabilities. Use tools that specifically target the language and package manager used (e.g., `pip-audit` for Python).
    *   **Prompt Updates:** Apply security updates to `asynq` *immediately* when they are released. This is the most important mitigation.
    *   **Vendor Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories from the `asynq` developers (Hibiken). Subscribe to any relevant mailing lists or notification channels.
