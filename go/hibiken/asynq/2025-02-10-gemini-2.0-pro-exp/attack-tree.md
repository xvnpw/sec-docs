## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Goal:** Prevent the application from processing legitimate tasks.

    *   **1a. Queue Overflow [HR]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker floods the Redis queue with an overwhelming number of tasks, exceeding capacity or configured limits. This blocks legitimate tasks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Depends on rate limiting and queue size configuration.)
        *   **Impact:** High (Application unavailability, potential data loss.)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Simple scripts can generate many requests.)
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Unusual queue growth is detectable, but distinguishing malicious traffic can be hard.)

    *   **1b. Worker Exhaustion [HR]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker submits tasks that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, I/O) on worker nodes, preventing them from processing other tasks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on task complexity and resource limits.)
        *   **Impact:** High (Application unresponsive/slow, potential data loss.)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires crafting resource-intensive tasks.)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (High resource usage detectable, but identifying malicious tasks can be difficult.)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Unauthorized Task Execution/Modification [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2__unauthorized_task_executionmodification__cn_.md)

*   **Goal:** Execute arbitrary code or modify the behavior of existing tasks. This is the *most critical* threat.

    *   **2a. Inject Malicious Tasks [CN]**
        *   **Goal:** Enqueue tasks with malicious payloads to achieve code execution.

        *   **2a1. Forge Task Payloads [HR]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker crafts a task payload that, when processed, executes arbitrary code or performs unintended actions. This exploits weaknesses in input validation or deserialization.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Highly dependent on input validation quality.)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete system compromise.)
            *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires understanding task handler logic and bypassing validation.)
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard (Well-crafted payloads may be indistinguishable from legitimate data.)

        *   **2a2. Exploit Vulnerable Task Handler [CN] [HR]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) in an existing task handler.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on the presence of vulnerabilities.)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete system compromise.)
            *   **Effort:** High to Very High (Requires vulnerability research and exploitation.)
            *   **Skill Level:** Expert
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard (Requires advanced intrusion detection.)
    *   **2b. Modify Existing Tasks**
        *   **Goal:** Alter task in queue to change application behavior.
        *   **2b2. Tamper with Task Payload [HR]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker modifies the data within a task payload in the queue, causing the task handler to perform an unintended action, potentially leading to code execution.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires bypassing Redis security.)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Potential for code execution or data corruption.)
            *   **Effort:** High (Requires bypassing Redis security and crafting a modified payload.)
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires monitoring for unauthorized Redis access and data anomalies.)
