## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Task Creation/Enqueueing -> Inject Malicious Task Payload -> Inject Code for Deserialization Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_task_creationenqueueing_-_inject_malicious_task_payload_-_inject_code_for_deserialization_vu_a152b317.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application uses insecure deserialization methods (like Python's `pickle` without proper safeguards) to handle task payloads, an attacker can craft a malicious serialized object. When the worker process deserializes this object, it can execute arbitrary code on the worker's machine. This is a high-risk path because it directly leads to code execution, granting the attacker significant control.

**Critical Nodes:**
*   **Application uses insecure deserialization:** This is the fundamental vulnerability that enables the entire attack path.
*   **Attacker crafts malicious payload to execute code upon deserialization:** This is the crucial step where the attacker leverages their knowledge of the deserialization process and the application's environment to create a payload that achieves code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Task Processing (Worker) -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Task Handler Code -> Standard Code Injection (SQLi, Command Injection) within task handler](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_task_processing__worker__-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_task_handler_code_-_standard_code_inje_6967dcc1.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the code within the task handler functions does not properly sanitize or validate input received from the task payload, it can be vulnerable to standard code injection attacks. For example, if task data is directly used in SQL queries without parameterization, it can lead to SQL injection. Similarly, if task data is used to construct system commands without proper escaping, it can lead to command injection. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries or system commands with the privileges of the worker process.

**Critical Node:**
*   **Standard Code Injection (SQLi, Command Injection) within task handler:** This is the point where the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code or queries, leading to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Task Processing (Worker) -> Exploit Dependencies of Task Handler -> Vulnerable libraries used by the task handler code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_task_processing__worker__-_exploit_dependencies_of_task_handler_-_vulnerable_libraries_used__b6ff5ad3.md)

**Attack Vector:** Task handlers often rely on external libraries. If these libraries have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker can potentially exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting task payloads that trigger the vulnerable code paths within the dependencies. This can lead to various outcomes, including remote code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Critical Node:**
*   **Vulnerable libraries used by the task handler code:** The presence of vulnerable dependencies creates an exploitable entry point into the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asynq Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Insecure Default Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asynq_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_insecure_default_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** If Asynq or its related components (like Redis) have insecure default configurations (e.g., default passwords, no authentication), an attacker can exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access or control over the system. This is a high-risk path because it often requires minimal effort from the attacker if the defaults are not changed.

**Critical Node:**
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** This is the fundamental weakness that makes the system vulnerable from the outset.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asynq Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Exposure of Configuration Details](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asynq_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_exposure_of_configuration_details.md)

**Attack Vector:** If configuration files or environment variables containing sensitive information (like Redis credentials) are exposed (e.g., through insecure file permissions, public repositories, or unencrypted storage), an attacker can gain access to these credentials. This allows them to bypass authentication and directly interact with the underlying infrastructure, leading to a full compromise of the Asynq system and potentially the application's data.

**Critical Node:**
*   **Exposure of Configuration Details:** This is a critical point as it provides the attacker with the keys to the kingdom, allowing them to bypass security measures.
