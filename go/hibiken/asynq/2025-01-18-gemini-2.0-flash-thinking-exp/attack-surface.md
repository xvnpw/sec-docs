# Attack Surface Analysis for hibiken/asynq

## Attack Surface: [Task Payload Injection](./attack_surfaces/task_payload_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious or unexpected data is injected into the task payload when enqueuing tasks.
    *   **How Asynq Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Asynq facilitates the transmission of arbitrary data as the task payload from the client to the server for processing. It doesn't inherently sanitize or validate this data.
    *   **Example:** A user-provided string intended for processing is crafted to include shell commands. If the task handler directly executes this string without sanitization, it could lead to command injection.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially critical. Could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server processing the task, data breaches, or system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of all data within the task payload on the server-side *before* processing.
        *   **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize task payload data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or sequences.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the task handler processes have the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Secure Deserialization Practices:** If using custom serialization, ensure it's done securely to prevent deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Task Handler Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/task_handler_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist within the code of the task handlers that process the enqueued tasks.
    *   **How Asynq Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Asynq provides the framework for executing these handlers. If the handler code is insecure, Asynq becomes the vehicle for exploiting those vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A task handler interacts with a database using data from the task payload without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially critical. Could result in data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines when developing task handlers (e.g., input validation, output encoding, avoiding hardcoded secrets).
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security reviews and penetration testing of task handler code.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Keep all dependencies used by task handlers up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to Redis (Asynq's Data Store)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_redis__asynq's_data_store_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the underlying Redis instance used by Asynq to store task queues and metadata.
    *   **How Asynq Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Asynq relies on Redis for its core functionality. If Redis is compromised, the integrity and confidentiality of Asynq's operations are at risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Redis instance due to weak authentication or network exposure and can manipulate task queues, view task payloads (potentially containing sensitive data), or even execute arbitrary commands on the Redis server.
    *   **Impact:** High. Could lead to data breaches, manipulation of task processing, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Configure a strong password or use authentication mechanisms provided by Redis.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the Redis instance to only authorized clients (Asynq servers).
        *   **TLS Encryption:** Encrypt the connection between Asynq clients/servers and the Redis instance using TLS.
        *   **Regular Security Audits of Redis Configuration:** Ensure Redis is configured according to security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Task Flooding](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_task_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Asynq queues with a large number of tasks, potentially overwhelming the server's resources and leading to denial of service.
    *   **How Asynq Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Asynq's design allows for the asynchronous processing of tasks, making it susceptible to queue flooding if not properly protected.
    *   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly enqueues a large number of computationally intensive tasks, causing the Asynq server to consume excessive CPU and memory, impacting the performance of other tasks or the entire application.
    *   **Impact:** High. Can lead to service disruption and impact application availability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on task enqueuing to prevent excessive task submissions.
        *   **Queue Size Limits:** Configure maximum queue sizes to prevent unbounded growth.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor queue lengths and server resource usage to detect and respond to potential flooding attacks.
        *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure only authorized users or systems can enqueue tasks.
