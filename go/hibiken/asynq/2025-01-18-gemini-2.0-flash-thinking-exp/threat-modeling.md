# Threat Model Analysis for hibiken/asynq

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Task Payloads](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_task_payloads.md)

**Description:** If task payloads are serialized using formats prone to deserialization vulnerabilities (e.g., `encoding/gob` without careful handling of types), an attacker could craft malicious payloads that, when deserialized by the worker *using Asynq's task handling mechanism*, execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the worker process and potentially the underlying system. The attacker could gain control of the server, access sensitive data, or launch further attacks.

**Affected Component:** `asynq.TaskHandler` (specifically the deserialization logic within the handler).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using insecure serialization formats. Prefer safer alternatives like JSON or Protocol Buffers.
*   If using `encoding/gob` or similar formats is unavoidable, carefully sanitize and validate the data after deserialization and before using it within the `asynq.TaskHandler`.
*   Consider using a type registry with `encoding/gob` to restrict the types that can be deserialized by Asynq.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Task Payloads](./threats/command_injection_via_task_payloads.md)

**Description:** Task payloads, processed by the `asynq.TaskHandler`, contain data that is directly used in commands executed by the worker process without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could craft malicious payloads containing shell commands or SQL queries that Asynq passes to the handler.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the worker server, potentially leading to system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `asynq.TaskHandler` (specifically the logic within the handler that processes the payload received from Asynq).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all data received from task payloads *within the `asynq.TaskHandler`* before using it in any commands or operations.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases *within the `asynq.TaskHandler`*.
*   Avoid directly executing shell commands based on user-provided input received via Asynq. If necessary, use safe APIs or libraries that prevent command injection.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure in Task Payloads](./threats/information_disclosure_in_task_payloads.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, user credentials, personal data) is included in task payloads that are managed and processed by Asynq, without proper encryption or redaction. An attacker with access to the Redis instance used by Asynq or monitoring tools could read these payloads.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Task payload data managed by Asynq, interaction with Redis.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in task payloads managed by Asynq.
*   If sensitive data must be included, encrypt it before adding it to the payload and decrypt it within the worker process *handling the Asynq task*.
*   Consider using references (e.g., IDs) to securely stored data instead of embedding the data itself in Asynq tasks.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Task Enqueueing](./threats/unauthenticated_task_enqueueing.md)

**Description:** The application using Asynq allows anyone to enqueue tasks *through the Asynq client* without proper authentication or authorization checks. An attacker could exploit Asynq's enqueueing mechanism by sending arbitrary tasks to the queue.

**Impact:** The attacker could flood the queue with malicious or unnecessary tasks, leading to resource exhaustion on worker servers managed by Asynq and potentially delaying the processing of legitimate tasks. They could also enqueue tasks that trigger unintended or harmful actions by the worker processes *handling Asynq tasks*.

**Affected Component:** `asynq.Client` (enqueueing functionality).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for task enqueueing *using the Asynq client*.
*   Restrict who can enqueue which types of tasks based on user roles or permissions *before calling the Asynq enqueue function*.

## Threat: [Task Queue Poisoning](./threats/task_queue_poisoning.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects a large number of invalid or malicious tasks into the queue *that Asynq manages*. These tasks might be designed to crash workers managed by Asynq, consume excessive resources, or exploit vulnerabilities in the task processing logic handled by `asynq.TaskHandler`.

**Impact:** Worker processes managed by Asynq may become overloaded or crash, leading to denial of service. Legitimate tasks may be delayed or never processed.

**Affected Component:** Redis queue managed by Asynq, worker processes managed by Asynq.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation on task payloads before enqueueing *using the Asynq client*.
*   Monitor the queue managed by Asynq for unusual activity (e.g., a sudden surge in tasks or a high number of failed tasks).
*   Implement mechanisms to discard or quarantine suspicious tasks *before they are processed by Asynq workers*.
*   Set limits on the number of retries for failed tasks *within Asynq's configuration* to prevent infinite loops.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion by Workers](./threats/resource_exhaustion_by_workers.md)

**Description:** Malicious or poorly designed tasks, processed by `asynq.TaskHandler`, consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network) on the worker nodes managed by Asynq. This could be due to infinite loops, memory leaks, or excessive network requests within the task processing logic of the `asynq.TaskHandler`.

**Impact:** Worker processes managed by Asynq may become unresponsive or crash, impacting the processing of other tasks and potentially leading to application instability.

**Affected Component:** Worker processes managed by Asynq, `asynq.TaskHandler` implementation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement resource limits for worker processes *running Asynq workers* (e.g., CPU and memory limits).
*   Monitor resource utilization of worker processes managed by Asynq.
*   Implement timeouts for task processing *within the `asynq.TaskHandler` or Asynq's configuration* to prevent tasks from running indefinitely.
*   Design tasks to be efficient and avoid resource-intensive operations where possible *within the `asynq.TaskHandler`*.
