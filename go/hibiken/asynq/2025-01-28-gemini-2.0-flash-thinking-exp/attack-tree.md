## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) against Asynq Server - Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK PATH - Availability Impact]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__against_asynq_server_-_resource_exhaustion__high_risk_path_-_availability_im_97b542d0.md)

**Attack Vector:** Flooding the Asynq queue with a massive number of tasks or tasks with excessively large payloads.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Relatively easy to execute if application is exposed).
*   **Impact:** High (Application unavailability, service disruption).
*   **Effort:** Low (Simple scripting, readily available tools).
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Script Kiddie).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (High task enqueue rate, resource spikes).
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on task enqueueing.
    *   Set limits on queue sizes.
    *   Monitor Asynq server resource usage and set up alerts.
    *   Enforce limits on task payload size.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Redis Instance - Redis Authentication Bypass [HIGH RISK PATH - Critical Impact]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_redis_instance_-_redis_authentication_bypass__high_risk_path_-_critical_impact_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting the lack of or weak authentication on the Redis instance used by Asynq.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration, especially in development/testing).
*   **Impact:** Critical (Full access to task queue, data manipulation, potential for further application compromise).
*   **Effort:** Low (Simple network scan, readily available Redis clients).
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Script Kiddie).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (Unusual Redis connections, command patterns if monitored).
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Strongly recommended:** Enable Redis authentication with a strong password.
    *   Restrict network access to the Redis instance using firewalls.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege for Asynq server's Redis access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Tasks via Asynq Client - Exploit input validation weaknesses in task handlers [HIGH RISK PATH - Code Execution] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_tasks_via_asynq_client_-_exploit_input_validation_weaknesses_in_task_handlers__high_2d641efb.md)

**Attack Vector:** Crafting malicious task data when enqueuing tasks through the Asynq client to exploit vulnerabilities in task handlers.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Common application vulnerability, task handlers are often complex).
*   **Impact:** High (Code execution in task handler context, data breach, application compromise).
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Standard web application attack techniques, readily available tools).
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Script Kiddie to Competent Hacker).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Depends on logging and monitoring of task handler actions).
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Crucial:** Implement thorough input validation and sanitization in all task handlers.
    *   Treat task data as potentially untrusted input.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege for task handlers.
    *   Use secure serialization methods.

        *   Avoid executing system commands based on task data if possible.
        *   If necessary, use safe command execution libraries and carefully sanitize inputs.
