# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for hibiken/asynq

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encrypt Sensitive Task Payloads](./mitigation_strategies/encrypt_sensitive_task_payloads.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify task payloads that contain sensitive data processed by Asynq task handlers.
2.  Choose an encryption library suitable for your application's language.
3.  Implement encryption of sensitive data *before* calling `asynq.Client.EnqueueTask` in your task enqueuing code.
4.  Store encryption keys securely, outside of the application code and version control.
5.  In the Asynq task handler function, decrypt the payload data *immediately upon receiving the task* before processing it.
6.  Ensure proper error handling for encryption and decryption within your application logic interacting with Asynq.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Breach via Redis Compromise (High Severity):** If the Redis instance used by Asynq is compromised, attackers could access task payloads stored by Asynq and potentially extract sensitive information.
*   **Data Leakage via Logs (Medium Severity):** Logs generated by Asynq workers or your application might inadvertently capture sensitive data from task payloads if not encrypted.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Breach via Redis Compromise:** Significantly reduces risk by making payload data unreadable without the decryption key, even if an attacker gains access to the Redis data store used by Asynq.
*   **Data Leakage via Logs:** Partially reduces risk. While the payload content is encrypted in logs, metadata related to Asynq tasks might still be logged. Requires additional log sanitization for complete mitigation.

**Currently Implemented:** No

**Missing Implementation:** Encryption is not currently implemented for tasks that handle user data or API keys within the Asynq task processing pipeline. This needs to be implemented in the task enqueuing and handler functions for all relevant task types managed by Asynq.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Data in Task Payloads](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_data_in_task_payloads.md)

**Description:**
1.  Review the data being passed in Asynq task payloads.
2.  Refactor task design to pass only essential identifiers (IDs) or minimal data required for the task handler to function.
3.  Modify Asynq task handlers to retrieve necessary data from a secure data store (database, API) using the identifiers passed in the payload, instead of passing large datasets directly through Asynq.
4.  Ensure efficient data retrieval within Asynq task handlers to avoid performance bottlenecks.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Breach via Redis Compromise (Medium Severity):** Reducing the amount of sensitive data stored in Asynq's Redis queues minimizes the potential impact if the Redis instance is compromised.
*   **Data Leakage via Logs (Low Severity):** Less data in Asynq payloads reduces the risk of sensitive information being logged by Asynq or application components.
*   **Increased Attack Surface (Low Severity):** Smaller payloads in Asynq queues reduce the overall attack surface by limiting the data potentially exposed or manipulated within the Asynq system.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Breach via Redis Compromise:** Partially reduces risk by limiting the sensitive data exposed if Asynq's Redis is compromised.
*   **Data Leakage via Logs:** Minimally reduces risk, as metadata and task identifiers related to Asynq might still be logged.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:** Minimally reduces risk, primarily by simplifying potential attacks related to payload manipulation within Asynq.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented

**Missing Implementation:** Some Asynq tasks, particularly those related to bulk data processing and reporting, still pass relatively large datasets in their payloads. These should be refactored to minimize payload size and retrieve data within the Asynq task handlers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Logging of Task Data](./mitigation_strategies/secure_logging_of_task_data.md)

**Description:**
1.  Review logging configurations for Asynq worker processes and application components interacting with Asynq.
2.  Identify areas where Asynq task payloads or parts of payloads are being logged.
3.  Configure logging mechanisms to filter or redact sensitive data from Asynq task payloads before logging.
4.  If logging payload data is necessary for debugging Asynq tasks, use structured logging and explicitly exclude sensitive fields or mask them in log configurations.
5.  Regularly audit logs generated by Asynq workers and related application components to ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently being logged.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Leakage via Logs (Medium Severity):** Logs generated by Asynq workers and related application components can be accessed by various personnel and systems. If these logs contain sensitive data from Asynq tasks, it can lead to unauthorized disclosure.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Leakage via Logs:** Significantly reduces risk by preventing sensitive payload data from Asynq tasks from being written to logs, limiting potential exposure through logging systems.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented

**Missing Implementation:** Basic logging is configured for Asynq workers, but payload data is not systematically sanitized or excluded from logs. Payload sanitization or structured logging with explicit exclusion of payload data needs to be implemented in logging configurations for Asynq worker processes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation in Task Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_in_task_handlers.md)

**Description:**
1.  For each Asynq task handler function, define the expected schema and data types for the incoming task payload.
2.  At the beginning of each Asynq task handler, implement validation logic to check if the received payload conforms to the defined schema and data types.
3.  Validate data ranges, formats, and any other constraints relevant to the specific Asynq task.
4.  If validation fails within an Asynq task handler, reject the task, log the validation error (without logging sensitive payload data), and potentially use Asynq's retry or dead-letter queue mechanisms to handle invalid tasks.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Malicious Task Injection (Medium Severity):** Attackers might attempt to enqueue Asynq tasks with malformed or malicious payloads to exploit vulnerabilities in Asynq task handlers.
*   **Application Errors due to Invalid Data (Medium Severity):** Invalid data in Asynq payloads can cause unexpected errors and crashes within Asynq task handlers and the application.

**Impact:**
*   **Malicious Task Injection:** Significantly reduces risk by preventing Asynq task handlers from processing potentially harmful or unexpected data injected through malicious tasks.
*   **Application Errors due to Invalid Data:** Significantly reduces risk by ensuring Asynq task handlers operate on valid and expected data, improving the stability and reliability of Asynq-based workflows.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented

**Missing Implementation:** Input validation is implemented for some critical Asynq task handlers, but not consistently across all task types. Comprehensive input validation needs to be implemented for all Asynq task handlers, especially those dealing with external data or user inputs processed by Asynq.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authorization and Access Control for Task Enqueuing](./mitigation_strategies/authorization_and_access_control_for_task_enqueuing.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify which application components or users are authorized to enqueue tasks into Asynq queues.
2.  Implement an authentication mechanism to verify the identity of entities attempting to enqueue Asynq tasks (e.g., API keys, JWTs, OAuth).
3.  Implement an authorization mechanism to check if the authenticated entity has the necessary permissions to enqueue the specific type of Asynq task being requested.
4.  Enforce authorization checks *before* calling `asynq.Client.EnqueueTask`. Reject unauthorized requests and log the unauthorized attempts (without logging sensitive credentials).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Task Enqueuing (Medium Severity):** Unauthorized users or services could enqueue tasks into Asynq, potentially leading to abuse, resource exhaustion of Asynq workers and Redis, or execution of malicious tasks within the Asynq framework.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Malicious actors could flood Asynq queues with tasks, leading to denial of service by overwhelming Asynq workers and Redis resources.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Task Enqueuing:** Significantly reduces risk by preventing unauthorized entities from adding tasks to Asynq queues, controlling access to task processing resources.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Partially reduces risk by limiting the sources that can enqueue tasks into Asynq, making it harder for attackers to flood Asynq queues and exhaust resources.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented

**Missing Implementation:** API endpoints for enqueuing Asynq tasks are currently protected by basic API keys. However, more granular authorization based on task type and user roles for Asynq task enqueuing is missing. Role-based access control for enqueuing specific types of Asynq tasks needs to be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Task Signing and Verification (Advanced)](./mitigation_strategies/task_signing_and_verification__advanced_.md)

**Description:**
1.  Choose a digital signature algorithm and library suitable for your application.
2.  Generate a signing key pair. Securely store the private signing key and distribute the public verification key to Asynq task handlers.
3.  In the task enqueuing code, before calling `asynq.Client.EnqueueTask`, generate a digital signature of the task payload using the private signing key. Include the signature in the Asynq task payload or metadata.
4.  In the Asynq task handler code, after receiving a task, verify the signature using the public verification key and the received payload.
5.  Reject Asynq tasks with invalid signatures and log the verification failure (without logging sensitive keys).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Task Tampering (High Severity):** If an attacker gains access to the Redis queues used by Asynq, they could potentially modify task payloads in transit or at rest, compromising the integrity of Asynq task processing.
*   **Task Forgery (High Severity):** An attacker could attempt to inject forged tasks into Asynq queues, bypassing authorization or input validation mechanisms within the Asynq system.

**Impact:**
*   **Task Tampering:** Significantly reduces risk by ensuring the integrity of Asynq task payloads. Any modification will invalidate the signature, and the task will be rejected by the Asynq handler.
*   **Task Forgery:** Significantly reduces risk by ensuring the authenticity of Asynq tasks. Only entities with access to the private signing key can create valid, processable tasks within the Asynq system.

**Currently Implemented:** No

**Missing Implementation:** Task signing and verification are not currently implemented for Asynq tasks. This advanced security measure should be considered for Asynq tasks with high security requirements, especially those involving sensitive operations or data processed by Asynq.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Redis Authentication for Asynq Client](./mitigation_strategies/redis_authentication_for_asynq_client.md)

**Description:**
1.  Enable Redis authentication using `requirepass` in the Redis configuration file used by Asynq.
2.  Configure the Asynq client (when creating `asynq.Client` and `asynq.Server` instances) to use the same authentication credentials (password) when connecting to the Redis instance.
3.  Ensure that the Redis password used by the Asynq client is securely stored and managed, avoiding hardcoding it in the application code.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Redis Access (High Severity):** If Redis authentication is not enabled and the Asynq client connects to an unsecured Redis instance, unauthorized individuals could potentially interact with the Redis instance used by Asynq, potentially reading task data, manipulating Asynq queues, or disrupting Asynq task processing.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Redis Access:** Significantly reduces risk by preventing unauthorized access to the Redis instance used by Asynq, protecting task data and the integrity of Asynq queues from unauthorized manipulation.

**Currently Implemented:** Yes

**Currently Implemented Location:** Redis authentication (`requirepass`) is enabled in the Redis server configuration used by Asynq in the production environment. The Asynq client is configured with the Redis password via environment variables.

**Missing Implementation:** While basic password authentication is enabled, consider using Redis ACLs for more fine-grained control over Asynq client access to Redis commands and keys. ACLs are not currently implemented for the Asynq client's Redis connection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Redis Configuration for Asynq](./mitigation_strategies/secure_redis_configuration_for_asynq.md)

**Description:**
1.  Review the Redis configuration used by Asynq (`redis.conf`) and apply security hardening measures relevant to Asynq's operation.
2.  Disable potentially dangerous or unnecessary Redis commands using the `rename-command` directive that are not required for Asynq's functionality (e.g., `FLUSHDB`, `FLUSHALL`, `CONFIG`, `EVAL`).
3.  Limit Redis resource usage using directives like `maxmemory` and `maxclients` to prevent resource exhaustion attacks that could impact Asynq's performance.
4.  Consider enabling TLS encryption for communication between Asynq and Redis using `tls-port` and related TLS configuration directives if sensitive data is processed by Asynq tasks and network security is a concern for the Asynq-Redis communication channel.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Redis Command Abuse (Medium Severity):** Attackers with unauthorized Redis access (even if authenticated as Asynq client) could potentially abuse dangerous Redis commands to disrupt Asynq service or gain unauthorized access if these commands are not properly restricted in the Redis configuration used by Asynq.
*   **Resource Exhaustion Attacks (Medium Severity):** Attackers could attempt to exhaust Redis resources used by Asynq, leading to denial of service for Asynq task processing.
*   **Data Interception in Transit (Low to Medium Severity):** If communication between Asynq and Redis is unencrypted, network eavesdroppers could potentially intercept data related to Asynq tasks being transmitted between Asynq workers/client and Redis.

**Impact:**
*   **Redis Command Abuse:** Significantly reduces risk by limiting the attack surface within Redis and preventing abuse of dangerous commands that could impact Asynq's operation.
*   **Resource Exhaustion Attacks:** Partially reduces risk by limiting resource usage within Redis, making it harder to exhaust resources and disrupt Asynq, but might not fully prevent sophisticated DoS attacks targeting Redis.
*   **Data Interception in Transit:** Minimally to Partially reduces risk depending on the sensitivity of data and the network environment. TLS encryption for Redis communication used by Asynq provides confidentiality in transit.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented

**Currently Implemented Location:** `rename-command` is used to disable `FLUSHDB` and `FLUSHALL` in the production Redis configuration used by Asynq. `maxmemory` is configured to limit memory usage for Redis used by Asynq.

**Missing Implementation:** Further command renaming (e.g., `CONFIG`, `EVAL`) could be implemented in the Redis configuration used by Asynq. TLS encryption for Redis communication used by Asynq is not currently enabled. Resource limits (`maxclients`) could be reviewed and potentially tightened in the Redis configuration for Asynq.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Task Enqueuing](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_task_enqueuing.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify Asynq task types that are susceptible to abuse or could cause resource exhaustion if enqueued excessively.
2.  Implement rate limiting logic in the application code that enqueues these specific Asynq task types *before* calling `asynq.Client.EnqueueTask`.
3.  Use a rate limiting algorithm to control the number of Asynq tasks enqueued within a specific time window, potentially per user, API key, or source IP address, for vulnerable task types.
4.  When rate limits are exceeded for Asynq task enqueuing, reject the task enqueuing requests and return appropriate error responses to the client.
5.  Monitor rate limiting metrics for Asynq task enqueuing to detect potential abuse attempts and adjust rate limits as needed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service via Task Flooding (High Severity):** Attackers or misbehaving components could flood Asynq queues with a large number of tasks, overwhelming Asynq worker resources and Redis, leading to denial of service for Asynq-based functionalities.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service via Task Flooding:** Significantly reduces risk by limiting the rate at which tasks can be enqueued into Asynq queues, preventing queue flooding and resource exhaustion of Asynq workers and Redis.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented

**Currently Implemented Location:** Basic rate limiting is implemented for user registration tasks enqueued into Asynq to prevent signup abuse.

**Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting is not implemented for other Asynq task types that could be targets of DoS attacks, such as report generation, data export, or API integration tasks managed by Asynq. Rate limiting needs to be expanded to cover more vulnerable Asynq task types.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Queue Size Limits and Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/queue_size_limits_and_monitoring.md)

**Description:**
1.  Implement monitoring for Asynq queue sizes. Use Asynq's monitoring capabilities or Redis monitoring tools to track queue lengths for different Asynq queues.
2.  Set up alerts to notify administrators when Asynq queue sizes exceed predefined thresholds, indicating potential issues like DoS attacks or system overload impacting Asynq.
3.  Consider implementing application-level queue size limits *before* calling `asynq.Client.EnqueueTask`. When an Asynq queue size reaches a certain threshold, reject new task enqueuing requests for that specific Asynq queue.
4.  Implement a mechanism to handle rejected Asynq tasks gracefully, such as logging the rejection and potentially moving tasks to a dead-letter queue or notifying the enqueuing component.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Queue Growth (Medium Severity):** An excessively large Asynq queue can consume significant memory and disk space in Redis, potentially leading to performance degradation or crashes of Redis and impacting Asynq's operation.
*   **Denial of Service (Medium Severity):** An extremely large Asynq queue can delay the processing of legitimate tasks by Asynq workers and contribute to denial of service for functionalities relying on Asynq.

**Impact:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Queue Growth:** Partially reduces risk by setting alerts and potentially limiting Asynq queue size, preventing uncontrolled resource consumption in Redis due to excessively large Asynq queues.
*   **Denial of Service:** Partially reduces risk by preventing Asynq queues from growing indefinitely, but might not fully prevent DoS if attackers can still enqueue tasks up to the defined queue size limit.

**Currently Implemented:** Yes

**Currently Implemented Location:** Asynq queue size monitoring is implemented using Prometheus and Grafana, with alerts set up for critical Asynq queues.

**Missing Implementation:** Application-level queue size limits for enqueuing new Asynq tasks are not currently implemented. Logic to reject new `asynq.Client.EnqueueTask` requests when queue sizes reach predefined limits for critical Asynq queues needs to be implemented. Handling of rejected Asynq tasks (e.g., dead-letter queue) also needs to be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Priority Queues and Task Prioritization](./mitigation_strategies/priority_queues_and_task_prioritization.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify critical Asynq tasks that require timely processing, even under heavy load or potential DoS attacks targeting Asynq.
2.  Utilize Asynq's priority queue feature to assign higher priority levels to these critical tasks when enqueuing them using `asynq.Client.EnqueueTask` with the `asynq.Priority` option.
3.  Configure Asynq worker processes to prioritize processing tasks from higher priority queues first, ensuring critical tasks are handled promptly by Asynq workers.
4.  Monitor the processing times and queue lengths for different priority Asynq queues to ensure that high-priority tasks are being processed promptly by Asynq workers as intended.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service Impact on Critical Tasks (Medium Severity):** During a DoS attack or high load on Asynq, less important tasks might consume Asynq worker resources and delay the processing of critical tasks, impacting essential application functionality reliant on timely Asynq task completion.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service Impact on Critical Tasks:** Partially reduces risk by ensuring that critical Asynq tasks are prioritized and processed even under load, mitigating the impact of DoS on essential functions that depend on Asynq.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented

**Currently Implemented Location:** Priority queues are used for email sending tasks in Asynq to prioritize transactional emails over marketing emails.

**Missing Implementation:** Priority queues are not consistently used across all Asynq task types. Review all Asynq task types and identify other critical tasks that should be prioritized using Asynq's priority queue feature. Tasks related to payment processing and security alerts handled by Asynq should be considered for prioritization.
