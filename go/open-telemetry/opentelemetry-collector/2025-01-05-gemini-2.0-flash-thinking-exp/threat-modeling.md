# Threat Model Analysis for open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering](./threats/configuration_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Collector's configuration files or management interface and modifies settings. This could involve redirecting telemetry data, disabling security features, adding malicious processors or exporters, or exposing sensitive information.

**Impact:**
*   Loss of telemetry data by redirecting it to attacker-controlled destinations.
*   Compromise of security by disabling authentication or authorization mechanisms.
*   Injection of malicious code or logic through compromised processors or exporters.
*   Exposure of sensitive information contained within the configuration (e.g., API keys, credentials).

**Affected Component:** Configuration Loading and Management components, potentially affecting all modules depending on the configuration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the Collector's configuration files with appropriate file system permissions.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing and modifying the Collector's configuration (if a management interface is exposed).
*   Store sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys) securely, potentially using secrets management solutions and referencing them within the Collector configuration.
*   Regularly audit and monitor changes to the Collector's configuration.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Collector Components](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_collector_components.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Collector's core code, processors, exporters, or extensions.

**Impact:**
*   Remote code execution on the host running the Collector.
*   Data breaches or manipulation within the Collector's processing pipeline.
*   Denial of service of the Collector.
*   Privilege escalation within the Collector's process.

**Affected Component:** Any component of the Collector (core, receivers, processors, exporters, extensions).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update the OpenTelemetry Collector to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Subscribe to security advisories and announcements related to the OpenTelemetry Collector.
*   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing of the Collector deployment.
*   Minimize the use of unnecessary extensions to reduce the attack surface.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Collector Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_collector_dependencies.md)

**Description:**  An attacker compromises a dependency used by the OpenTelemetry Collector, injecting malicious code that is then included in the Collector's build or runtime environment.

**Impact:** Similar to exploiting vulnerabilities, this can lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service affecting the Collector's functionality.

**Affected Component:** All components, indirectly through compromised dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the Collector's dependencies.
*   Implement software composition analysis (SCA) to track and manage dependencies.
*   Pin dependency versions in build configurations to ensure consistent and controlled dependency usage.
*   Monitor for security advisories related to the Collector's dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Collector Extensions](./threats/insecure_collector_extensions.md)

**Description:** If the Collector is configured to use extensions, a malicious or vulnerable extension could be used to compromise the Collector or the systems it interacts with.

**Impact:**  Similar to exploiting vulnerabilities, this can lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service, specifically within the context of the extension's functionality and the Collector's overall operation.

**Affected Component:** Extensions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully vet and review any third-party extensions before deploying them.
*   Only use extensions from trusted sources.
*   Keep extensions up-to-date.
*   Implement appropriate security controls around the deployment and execution of extensions.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Telemetry Overload](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_telemetry_overload.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the Collector with a massive volume of telemetry data, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network) and causing it to become unresponsive or crash.

**Impact:**
*   Loss of observability data, hindering monitoring and incident response.
*   Potential cascading failures if other systems depend on the Collector's availability.
*   Resource exhaustion on the host system running the Collector, potentially impacting other services.

**Affected Component:** Receivers, Processors, Internal Buffering mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting and request size limits on receivers.
*   Configure appropriate resource limits (CPU, memory) for the Collector process.
*   Utilize load balancing if multiple Collector instances are deployed.
*   Implement backpressure mechanisms within the Collector to handle bursts of data.

## Threat: [Weak Authentication/Authorization for Collector Management](./threats/weak_authenticationauthorization_for_collector_management.md)

**Description:** If the Collector exposes a management interface (e.g., for configuration or health checks) and uses weak or default credentials, or lacks proper authorization mechanisms, attackers could gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized modification of the Collector's configuration.
*   Exposure of sensitive information about the Collector's state and configuration.
*   Potential for further attacks by leveraging compromised management access.

**Affected Component:** Management Interface (if exposed).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS) for accessing the Collector's management interface.
*   Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to management functions based on user roles.
*   Avoid exposing management interfaces publicly if possible. If necessary, secure them with network firewalls and VPNs.
