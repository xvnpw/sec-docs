## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit parsing vulnerabilities in receiver protocols (e.g., OTLP, Prometheus) (Potential High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities_in_receiver_protocols__e_g___otlp__prometheus___potential_high-risk__f30da68b.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft specific telemetry data payloads that exploit weaknesses in how the OpenTelemetry Collector's receiver components parse data in protocols like OTLP or Prometheus.
    * **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes, including denial of service, code execution on the collector, or the ability to inject malicious data into the telemetry pipeline.
    * **Why High-Risk:** While the likelihood depends on the specific vulnerabilities present, the potential for code execution makes this a significant risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Configuration Injection (Processor) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_configuration_injection__processor___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If the OpenTelemetry Collector allows for dynamic configuration of processors and this mechanism is not properly secured, attackers can inject malicious configurations.
    * **Potential Impact:** This can allow attackers to manipulate how telemetry data is processed, potentially dropping crucial information, corrupting data, or even introducing malicious logic into the processing pipeline.
    * **Why Critical:**  Compromising the processing stage can have cascading effects on the integrity and reliability of the entire telemetry system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Processor Vulnerabilities (Potential High-Risk Path and Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_processor_vulnerabilities__potential_high-risk_path_and_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) present in specific processor components used by the OpenTelemetry Collector.
    * **Potential Impact:** Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to code execution, denial of service, or other forms of compromise depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Why High-Risk and Critical:** Known vulnerabilities are easier to exploit, and successful exploitation can have a significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Reconfigure exporter to send data to attacker-controlled destination (High-Risk Path and part of Data Exfiltration Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/reconfigure_exporter_to_send_data_to_attacker-controlled_destination__high-risk_path_and_part_of_dat_eba0fe95.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If the exporter configuration can be modified without proper authorization (due to insecure management or vulnerabilities), attackers can change the destination where telemetry data is sent.
    * **Potential Impact:** This allows attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data being collected by the application.
    * **Why High-Risk:**  Even with a potentially lower likelihood due to security measures, the critical impact of data exfiltration makes this a major concern.

## Attack Tree Path: [Downstream System Compromise (Potential High-Risk Path and Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/downstream_system_compromise__potential_high-risk_path_and_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious telemetry data that, when exported by the OpenTelemetry Collector, exploits vulnerabilities in the systems receiving the data (e.g., logging systems, monitoring backends).
    * **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to the compromise of other systems within the infrastructure, using the collector as a stepping stone.
    * **Why High-Risk and Critical:**  This represents a significant escalation of the attack, potentially impacting systems beyond the application itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Exporter Vulnerabilities (Potential High-Risk Path and Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_exporter_vulnerabilities__potential_high-risk_path_and_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific exporter components used by the OpenTelemetry Collector.
    * **Potential Impact:** This can lead to code execution, denial of service, or other forms of compromise affecting the collector's ability to export data or potentially impacting downstream systems.
    * **Why High-Risk and Critical:** Similar to processor vulnerabilities, known exporter vulnerabilities are easier to exploit and can have a significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access configuration files with default or weak credentials (High-Risk Path and part of Unauthorized Access to Configuration Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/access_configuration_files_with_default_or_weak_credentials__high-risk_path_and_part_of_unauthorized_cdb93095.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit the use of default or easily guessable credentials to gain unauthorized access to the OpenTelemetry Collector's configuration files.
    * **Potential Impact:** This provides attackers with the ability to view sensitive configuration details and potentially modify the configuration for malicious purposes.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This is a common security oversight with a high potential impact as it opens the door for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Configuration Injection (High-Risk Path and Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_configuration_injection__high-risk_path_and_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Once unauthorized access to the configuration is gained (through methods like exploiting weak credentials or interface vulnerabilities), attackers can inject malicious configurations.
    * **Potential Impact:** This allows attackers to redirect data flow, disable security features, introduce malicious components into the collector's pipeline, or otherwise compromise the collector's functionality.
    * **Why High-Risk:** The ability to directly manipulate the collector's behavior has a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit default or weak credentials on management endpoints (High-Risk Path and part of Unauthorized Access Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_or_weak_credentials_on_management_endpoints__high-risk_path_and_part_of_unauthorized_93f9c242.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit the use of default or weak credentials to gain unauthorized access to the OpenTelemetry Collector's management interface.
    * **Potential Impact:** This provides attackers with administrative control over the collector, allowing them to perform actions like reconfiguring it, stopping services, or potentially gaining access to underlying systems.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Similar to configuration access, this is a common and easily exploitable weakness with severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious commands via management interface parameters (High-Risk Path and part of Command Injection Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands_via_management_interface_parameters__high-risk_path_and_part_of_command_in_30cbc952.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If the OpenTelemetry Collector's management interface does not properly sanitize or validate user input, attackers can inject malicious commands into parameters.
    * **Potential Impact:** This can lead to arbitrary command execution on the server hosting the OpenTelemetry Collector, potentially allowing attackers to gain full control of the system.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Command injection is a critical vulnerability that can lead to complete system compromise.
