# Attack Surface Analysis for open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Receiver Protocol Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_receiver_protocol_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the protocols used by the collector's receivers (e.g., gRPC, HTTP).
    * **How OpenTelemetry Collector Contributes:** By implementing and exposing these receiver protocols, the collector inherits any inherent vulnerabilities within those protocols or their specific implementations.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in the gRPC library used by the OTLP/gRPC receiver allows for remote code execution when processing a specially crafted request.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the collector host, leading to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or further attacks on the internal network.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Collector and Dependencies Updated: Regularly update the OpenTelemetry Collector and its dependencies (including underlying protocol libraries) to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the collector's configuration and deployment.
        * Web Application Firewall (WAF): For HTTP-based receivers, a WAF can help detect and block malicious requests targeting protocol vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Processor Configuration or Logic](./attack_surfaces/malicious_processor_configuration_or_logic.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in custom processors to manipulate or exfiltrate telemetry data.
    * **How OpenTelemetry Collector Contributes:** The collector's extensibility allows for custom processors, which, if not developed and configured securely, can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A custom processor designed to redact sensitive data has a flaw that allows an attacker to bypass the redaction logic, exposing sensitive information in exported telemetry.
    * **Impact:** Data exfiltration, data manipulation, potential compromise of backend systems if processed data is used for critical decisions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure Processor Development Practices: Follow secure coding practices when developing custom processors, including thorough input validation and output encoding.
        * Principle of Least Privilege: Grant processors only the necessary permissions to access and modify telemetry data.
        * Configuration Validation: Implement mechanisms to validate processor configurations and prevent the deployment of insecure configurations.
        * Regular Review of Processor Logic: Periodically review the logic of custom processors to identify potential vulnerabilities or unintended behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Exporter Credential Compromise](./attack_surfaces/exporter_credential_compromise.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain access to the credentials used by exporters to send telemetry data to backend systems.
    * **How OpenTelemetry Collector Contributes:** The collector stores and uses credentials for various exporters (e.g., API keys, database credentials). If these are not stored securely, they become a target.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the collector's configuration file where exporter credentials are stored in plain text, allowing them to access the backend monitoring system.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend monitoring systems, potential data manipulation or deletion in those systems, and further lateral movement within the infrastructure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure Credential Storage: Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to store exporter credentials. Avoid storing them directly in configuration files.
        * Principle of Least Privilege: Grant exporters only the necessary permissions to write data to the backend systems.
        * Regular Credential Rotation: Implement a policy for regularly rotating exporter credentials.
        * Encryption at Rest: Encrypt the collector's configuration files and any persistent storage used for secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Exporter Connections](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_exporter_connections.md)

* **Description:** An attacker intercepts and potentially modifies telemetry data in transit between the collector and its export destinations.
    * **How OpenTelemetry Collector Contributes:** The collector initiates connections to export data, and if these connections are not properly secured, they are vulnerable to MitM attacks.
    * **Example:** An attacker intercepts the connection between the collector and a logging backend, injecting malicious log entries or altering existing ones.
    * **Impact:** Data manipulation, injection of false information, potential compromise of backend systems if they rely on the integrity of the telemetry data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enable TLS/SSL for Exporter Connections: Ensure that all exporter connections utilize TLS/SSL encryption to protect data in transit.
        * Verify Server Certificates: Configure the collector to verify the server certificates of the export destinations to prevent connecting to rogue servers.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Collector Configuration Exposure](./attack_surfaces/insecure_collector_configuration_exposure.md)

* **Description:** The collector's configuration file, which may contain sensitive information, is exposed to unauthorized access.
    * **How OpenTelemetry Collector Contributes:** The configuration file dictates the collector's behavior and can contain sensitive data like API keys, connection strings, and other secrets.
    * **Example:** The collector's configuration file is left with default permissions allowing any user on the system to read it, exposing exporter credentials.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potential compromise of backend systems, and the ability for attackers to manipulate the collector's behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict File System Permissions: Ensure that the collector's configuration file has appropriate file system permissions, limiting access to authorized users and processes.
        * Externalize Configuration: Consider using environment variables or dedicated configuration management tools to manage sensitive configuration data instead of storing it directly in the file.
        * Encrypt Configuration Files: Encrypt the collector's configuration files at rest.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Collector Extensions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_collector_extensions.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities present in community or custom extensions loaded by the collector.
    * **How OpenTelemetry Collector Contributes:** The collector's extension mechanism allows for adding functionality, but these extensions might contain security vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A third-party extension used for enriching telemetry data has a vulnerability that allows for remote code execution when processing specific input.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the collector's context, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully Evaluate Extensions: Thoroughly vet and audit any third-party extensions before using them in production.
        * Keep Extensions Updated: Regularly update extensions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Principle of Least Privilege for Extensions: Grant extensions only the necessary permissions to perform their intended functions.
        * Monitor Extension Activity: Monitor the behavior of extensions for any suspicious or unexpected activity.
