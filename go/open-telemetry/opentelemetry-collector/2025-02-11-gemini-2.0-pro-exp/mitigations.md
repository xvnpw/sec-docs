# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Rate Limiting (Receiver Level - Collector Config)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_rate_limiting__receiver_level_-_collector_config_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Receiver Configuration:** Within your `config.yaml` (or equivalent), locate the configuration for each active receiver (e.g., `otlp`, `jaeger`, `zipkin`).
    2.  **Data Size Limits:**
        *   **`otlp` Receiver:** Use the `max_allowed_size` setting (if available) within the `protocols` section (e.g., `grpc` or `http`) to limit the size of individual spans and log entries in bytes.
        *   **Other Receivers:** Consult the documentation for each receiver to find equivalent settings for limiting message sizes.
    3.  **Attribute Count Limits:** Within the receiver configuration, if supported, set limits on the number of attributes per span, metric, or log entry.  Look for settings like `max_attributes` or similar.
    4.  **Data Type Validation:** Most receivers perform basic data type validation against the OpenTelemetry specification by default.  Confirm this in the receiver's documentation.
    5.  **Rate Limiting (Collector-Side):** Check if your receivers have built-in rate limiting options (e.g., `max_requests_per_second`, `rate_limiting` configurations). If available, configure limits per client IP address or other identifying information *within the receiver's configuration*.
    6. **Custom Receiver (If Necessary):** If a built-in receiver lacks crucial validation or rate limiting, and external solutions are not feasible, consider developing a *custom receiver* that implements these features. This is an advanced option.
    7. **Testing:** Use a load-testing tool to send high volumes of data and oversized/malformed payloads to the collector. Verify that the configured limits are enforced and the collector remains stable.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High Severity:** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the collector with excessive data.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion - High Severity:** Limits resource consumption.
    *   **Data Injection (Partial) - Medium Severity:** Provides some protection against large malicious payloads.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces risk (if rate limiting and size limits are properly configured).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Data Injection:** Provides partial mitigation.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   `max_allowed_size` is set for the `otlp/grpc` receiver.
    *   No attribute count limits are configured.
    *   No collector-side rate limiting is configured.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   Attribute count limits are missing for all receivers.
    *   Collector-side rate limiting is missing (where supported by the receiver).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization (Receiver Level - Collector Config & Extensions)](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization__receiver_level_-_collector_config_&_extensions_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Receiver Configuration:** Within your `config.yaml`, examine each receiver's configuration for authentication options.
    2.  **mTLS (Recommended):**
        *   If the receiver supports mTLS (e.g., `otlp` with `grpc` or `http`), configure it:
            *   Specify the path to the collector's server certificate and key (`cert_file`, `key_file`).
            *   Specify the path to the CA certificate used to verify client certificates (`ca_file`).
            *   Enable client authentication (e.g., `client_auth: require`).
    3.  **API Keys/Tokens (Less Secure):**
        *   If the receiver supports API key/token authentication, configure it:
            *   Define a mechanism for validating API keys (e.g., a static list in the configuration, or a custom authenticator extension).
            *   Specify the expected header containing the API key (e.g., `X-API-Key`).
    4.  **Custom Authenticator Extension:** If built-in authentication mechanisms are insufficient, develop a *custom authenticator extension*. This extension would:
        *   Implement the `configauth.Authenticator` interface.
        *   Authenticate incoming requests based on your chosen method (mTLS, API keys, custom logic).
        *   Be referenced in the receiver's configuration.
    5.  **Custom Authorizer Extension (Optional):** For fine-grained authorization, develop a *custom extension* that:
        *   Implements an appropriate interface (likely a custom one you define).
        *   Receives authentication information (from the authenticator) and the incoming data.
        *   Makes authorization decisions (allow/deny) based on your policies.
        *   Integrates with the collector's pipeline (potentially as a processor).
    6. **Testing:** Send requests with valid, invalid, and expired credentials. Verify that only authenticated and authorized requests are processed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Injection - High Severity:** Prevents unauthorized data submission.
    *   **Data Tampering - High Severity:** Ensures data integrity.
    *   **Unauthorized Access - High Severity:** Prevents unauthorized connections.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Injection:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   No authentication is configured on any receivers.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   **Critical Gap:** No authentication mechanism is implemented.
    *   No custom authenticator or authorizer extensions are developed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Masking/Redaction (Processor Level - Collector Config & Extensions)](./mitigation_strategies/data_maskingredaction__processor_level_-_collector_config_&_extensions_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Analyze your telemetry data to identify sensitive fields.
    2.  **Processor Configuration:** Within your `config.yaml`, configure processors in the pipeline:
        *   **`attributes` Processor:** Use this to modify or remove attributes:
            *   `insert`, `update`, `upsert`: Use these actions with regular expressions or other logic to replace sensitive data with masked values (e.g., `***`).
            *   `delete`: Remove entire attributes containing sensitive data.
        *   **`resource` Processor:** Similar to `attributes`, but for resource attributes.
        *   **`filter` Processor:** Use this to drop entire spans, metrics, or logs based on the presence of sensitive data (less precise).
    3.  **Custom Processor (Recommended for Complex Logic):** Develop a *custom processor* that:
        *   Implements the appropriate processor interface (e.g., `component.TracesProcessor`, `component.MetricsProcessor`, `component.LogsProcessor`).
        *   Contains your specific redaction logic (regular expressions, hashing, encryption, custom rules).
        *   Is referenced in the `pipelines` section of your `config.yaml`.
    4.  **Testing:** Send test data containing sensitive information. Verify that the processors correctly mask or remove the sensitive data before it is exported.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage - High Severity:** Prevents sensitive data exposure.
    *   **Compliance Violations - High Severity:** Helps meet compliance requirements.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Leakage:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Significantly reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   No data masking/redaction is implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   **Critical Gap:** No data masking/redaction is in place.
    *   No custom processors for redaction are developed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Communication (Exporter Level - Collector Config)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_communication__exporter_level_-_collector_config_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Exporter Configuration:** Within your `config.yaml`, locate the configuration for each active exporter.
    2.  **TLS:**
        *   For each exporter, configure TLS encryption:
            *   Specify the path to the CA certificate (or the server certificate) used to verify the backend's identity (`ca_file` or equivalent).
            *   Enable TLS (e.g., `tls: { enabled: true }` or equivalent).  The exact configuration depends on the exporter.
    3.  **mTLS (If Supported):**
        *   If the backend and exporter support mTLS, configure it:
            *   Specify the path to the collector's client certificate and key (`cert_file`, `key_file`).
            *   Enable client authentication on the backend (if you control it).
    4. **Testing:** Use network analysis tools (e.g., `tcpdump`, Wireshark) to verify that communication between the collector and backends is encrypted.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks - High Severity:** Prevents data interception.
    *   **Data Tampering (in transit) - High Severity:** Ensures data integrity.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MitM Attacks:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Data Tampering (in transit):** Significantly reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   TLS is enabled for the `otlp` exporter.
    *   No mTLS is configured.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   mTLS is not used, even where supported.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Hardening (Collector Config)](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_hardening__collector_config_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Least Privilege:** In your `config.yaml`, disable any receivers, processors, exporters, and extensions that are not absolutely required.
    2.  **Configuration Review:** Regularly review the entire `config.yaml` for any unnecessary or insecure settings.
    3.  **Disable Debugging in Production:** Ensure that debugging features (e.g., `service::telemetry::logs::level: debug`) are disabled in production. Set the log level to `info` or `warn`.
    4.  **Secure Configuration Storage:**  *Do not* store sensitive information (API keys, credentials) directly in `config.yaml`. Use environment variables or a secrets management system, and reference them in the configuration.
    5. **Testing:** After making configuration changes, thoroughly test the collector in a non-production environment.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Configuration Errors - Medium Severity:** Reduces the risk of misconfigurations.
    *   **Information Disclosure - Medium Severity:** Prevents sensitive data leaks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Configuration Errors:** Reduces risk.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   Some unused receivers are disabled.
    *   Debugging is enabled in production.
    *   API keys are stored directly in `config.yaml`.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   A comprehensive configuration review is needed.
    *   Debugging needs to be disabled in production.
    *   **Critical:** Sensitive information needs to be removed from `config.yaml`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Extension Security (Collector Extensions)](./mitigation_strategies/extension_security__collector_extensions_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inventory:** List all custom or third-party extensions used by your collector.
    2.  **Source Verification:**
        *   Prefer extensions from the official OpenTelemetry project or reputable vendors.
        *   For community extensions, *carefully review the source code* for potential security issues (input validation, error handling, secure coding practices).
    3.  **Least Privilege (Within Extension Code):** If you are developing *custom extensions*, ensure they only access the necessary resources and data. Avoid granting broad permissions.
    4.  **Regular Updates:** Keep extensions up-to-date.  Monitor for security advisories.
    5. **Testing (For Custom Extensions):** Thoroughly test custom extensions, focusing on security aspects:
        *   Input validation: Test with invalid and malicious inputs.
        *   Error handling: Ensure errors are handled gracefully and do not expose sensitive information.
        *   Resource usage: Monitor resource consumption to prevent DoS vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Extensions - Medium to High Severity:** Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in extensions.
    *   **Malicious Extensions - High Severity:** Helps prevent the use of malicious code.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Extensions:** Reduces risk.
    *   **Malicious Extensions:** Reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   Only official OpenTelemetry extensions are used.
    *   No formal code review process for extensions is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   A documented process for managing and vetting extensions is needed.
    *   Code review of custom extensions (if any) is essential.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Observability of the Collector (Collector Config)](./mitigation_strategies/observability_of_the_collector__collector_config_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Metrics:** In your `config.yaml`, ensure the collector is configured to expose its internal metrics.  The most common way is to use the `prometheus` exporter:
        ```yaml
        exporters:
          prometheus:
            endpoint: "0.0.0.0:8889" # Or a specific interface/port
            # ... other prometheus exporter settings ...
        service:
          pipelines:
            metrics:
              receivers: [ ... ]
              processors: [ ... ]
              exporters: [prometheus, ... ] # Include prometheus in your metrics pipeline
        ```
    2.  **Logging:** Configure the collector's logging within the `service::telemetry::logs` section of `config.yaml`:
        ```yaml
        service:
          telemetry:
            logs:
              level: info  # Or warn, error - avoid debug in production
              # ... other logging settings ...
        ```
    3. **Testing:** Verify that metrics are being exposed correctly (e.g., by querying the Prometheus endpoint) and that logs are being generated at the configured level.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Undetected Issues - Medium Severity:** Allows for early detection of problems.
    *   **Delayed Response to Incidents - Medium Severity:** Facilitates faster response.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Undetected Issues:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Delayed Response to Incidents:** Significantly reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   Metrics are exposed via the `prometheus` exporter.
    *   Logging is enabled, but the log level is set to `debug` in production.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   The log level should be changed to `info` or `warn` in production.
