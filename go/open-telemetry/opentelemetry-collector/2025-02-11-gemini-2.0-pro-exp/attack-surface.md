# Attack Surface Analysis for open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector

## Attack Surface: [Receiver Protocol Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/receiver_protocol_exploitation.md)

*Description:* Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the protocol handling logic *within the OpenTelemetry Collector's receiver implementations* (OTLP, Jaeger, Zipkin, Prometheus, etc.) to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or execute arbitrary code.
*OpenTelemetry Collector Contribution:* The Collector's *own code* implementing these receiver protocols is the direct source of the vulnerability. This is *not* about vulnerabilities in the protocols themselves, but in the Collector's handling of them.
*Example:* A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Collector's OTLP receiver's gRPC handling code (written as part of the Collector project) allows an attacker to send a crafted OTLP payload, crashing the Collector or potentially gaining control.
*Impact:* Denial of service, remote code execution, data corruption, information disclosure.
*Risk Severity:* Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the Collector updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches to the Collector's receiver code.
    *   **Input Validation:** The Collector's receiver code must implement rigorous input validation and sanitization.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Limit the network exposure of receivers; only expose necessary receivers.
    *   **Protocol-Specific Security:** The Collector's implementation must adhere to security best practices for each protocol.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Conduct fuzz testing on the Collector's receiver implementations.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) against Receivers](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__against_receivers.md)

*Description:* Attackers flood the OpenTelemetry Collector's receivers with a high volume of requests or specially crafted data, overwhelming the Collector and preventing legitimate data processing.
*OpenTelemetry Collector Contribution:* The Collector's receivers, as implemented in the Collector's code, are the direct targets of the DoS attack. The Collector's resource management capabilities are directly relevant.
*Example:* An attacker sends a massive number of OTLP requests to the Collector's OTLP receiver, exhausting the Collector's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) as allocated and managed by the Collector.
*Impact:* Denial of service, preventing legitimate telemetry data from being collected and processed by the Collector.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Rate Limiting:** The Collector should implement rate limiting on its receivers.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** The Collector should allow configuration of resource quotas (CPU, memory) for its receivers.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Use a load balancer in front of multiple Collector instances (this is external, but mitigates the impact on any single Collector).
    *   **Timeouts:** The Collector should implement appropriate timeouts for connections and processing.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor the Collector's receiver resource consumption and set up alerts.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Authentication/Authorization on Receivers](./attack_surfaces/weak_authenticationauthorization_on_receivers.md)

*Description:* Insufficient or improperly configured authentication and authorization mechanisms *within the OpenTelemetry Collector's receiver implementations* allow unauthorized clients to send data to the Collector.
*OpenTelemetry Collector Contribution:* The Collector's code provides and manages the authentication and authorization mechanisms for its receivers. Flaws in this code, or misconfiguration, create the vulnerability.
*Example:* The Collector's OTLP receiver is configured with a weak or default API key, allowing an attacker to inject malicious telemetry data into the Collector.
*Impact:* Data injection, data corruption, potential for further attacks (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in the Collector's processors).
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strong Credentials:** The Collector should enforce the use of strong, unique credentials.
    *   **TLS/SSL:** The Collector should enforce TLS/SSL with strong ciphers and proper certificate validation.
    *   **Granular Authorization:** The Collector should implement granular authorization policies.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the Collector's authentication and authorization configurations.
    *   **Well-Vetted Extensions:** Use well-vetted and actively maintained authentication/authorization extensions *within the Collector*.

## Attack Surface: [Data Exfiltration via Exporters](./attack_surfaces/data_exfiltration_via_exporters.md)

*Description:* An attacker who compromises the OpenTelemetry Collector reconfigures the Collector's exporters to send telemetry data to a malicious destination.  This requires compromising the Collector's configuration or runtime.
*OpenTelemetry Collector Contribution:* The Collector's exporters, as implemented in the Collector's code, are the mechanism for sending data.  The vulnerability lies in the ability to reconfigure them maliciously.
*Example:* An attacker modifies the Collector's OTLP exporter configuration (through a configuration vulnerability or direct access to the Collector) to point to an attacker-controlled server.
*Impact:* Data leakage, loss of sensitive information.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement strict access controls to the Collector's configuration and runtime environment.
    *   **Configuration Monitoring:** Monitor the Collector's configuration changes and set up alerts.
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Use a secure configuration management system.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the Collector's exporter configurations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Collector with the least privilege necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/extension_vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities in extensions (health_check, pprof, zpages, custom extensions) *that are part of the OpenTelemetry Collector* are exploited to gain information, cause denial of service, or potentially execute code.
*OpenTelemetry Collector Contribution:* The Collector's code includes and runs these extensions. The vulnerability exists within the extension code that is part of the Collector.
*Example:* The Collector's `zpages` extension is exposed on a public interface without authentication, allowing an attacker to view internal Collector state. A custom extension, bundled with the Collector, has a remote code execution vulnerability.
*Impact:* Information disclosure, denial of service, remote code execution (depending on the extension).
*Risk Severity:* Medium to Critical (depending on the extension and vulnerability, but we're filtering for High/Critical).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Minimize Extensions:** Only enable necessary extensions within the Collector.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update the Collector to get the latest versions of extensions.
    *   **Custom Extension Audits:** Thoroughly vet and audit any custom extensions bundled with the Collector.
    *   **Access Control:** Restrict access to the Collector's extensions (e.g., using network policies).
    *   **Secure Configuration:** Carefully configure the Collector's extensions, avoiding defaults that expose information.
