## Attack Tree Path: [1. Receiver Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__receiver_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1.1.1/1.1.2/1.2 Authentication/Authorization Bypass (OTLP, Jaeger):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker sends specially crafted requests to the receiver, exploiting a lack of authentication or a flaw in the authorization mechanism. This allows them to either inject malicious data or extract existing data without proper credentials.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication (e.g., mTLS) and authorization for all receivers.  Enforce least privilege.  Validate all input.
*   **1.1.4/1.2 RCE (OTLP, Jaeger):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker sends a malicious request that exploits a vulnerability like a buffer overflow or format string vulnerability in the receiver's code, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the Collector host.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Keep the Collector and its dependencies up-to-date.  Use memory-safe languages where possible.  Perform rigorous code reviews and security testing.
*   **1.4 Custom/Contrib Receiver Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:**  Custom receivers may have unique vulnerabilities due to implementation flaws (e.g., insecure deserialization, improper input validation, SQL injection if interacting with a database).
    *   **Mitigation:**  Thoroughly review and test any custom receiver code.  Follow secure coding practices.  Use a linter and static analysis tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Processor Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__processor_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **2.5 Custom/Contrib Processor Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:** Similar to custom receivers, custom processors can introduce vulnerabilities due to coding errors.
    *   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly review and test any custom processor code. Follow secure coding practices.
*   **2.6 Configuration Errors in Processors:**
    *   **Description:** Misconfigurations, such as overly permissive filters or incorrect sampling rates, can lead to data leakage or denial of service.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use configuration validation tools.  Follow the principle of least privilege.  Regularly review configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exporter Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__exporter_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **3.1.1 OTLP Exporter Authentication Bypass:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the exporter's authentication to send data to an attacker-controlled backend instead of the legitimate one.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement strong authentication (e.g., mTLS) for all exporter connections.  Validate backend certificates.
*   **3.1.3 Credential Leakage:**
    *   **Description:**  The attacker gains access to the credentials used by the exporter to connect to the backend, either through a vulnerability or a misconfiguration (e.g., credentials stored in plain text).
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use a secrets management solution.  Avoid hardcoding credentials.  Regularly rotate credentials.
*   **3.3 Custom/Contrib Exporter Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:** Custom exporters may have unique vulnerabilities due to implementation flaws.
    *   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly review and test any custom exporter code. Follow secure coding practices.
*   **3.4 Network Eavesdropping:**
    *   **Description:** If the exporter uses unencrypted communication, an attacker on the network can passively capture the data being sent.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Enforce TLS for all exporter communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/4__extension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **4.2 pprof Extension (Data Leak):**
    *   **Description:** If the `pprof` extension is enabled and exposed without authentication, an attacker can access profiling data, which might reveal sensitive information or performance bottlenecks that could be exploited.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Disable the `pprof` extension if not needed.  If needed, require authentication.
*   **4.3 zpages Extension (Data Leak):**
    *   **Description:** Similar to `pprof`, the `zpages` extension can leak trace and component data if exposed without authentication.
    *   **Mitigation:** Disable the `zpages` extension if not needed. If needed, require authentication.
*   **4.4 Custom/Contrib Extension Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:** Custom extensions may have unique vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly review and test any custom extension code.
*   **4.5 Authentication/Authorization Bypass:**
    *   **Description:** If extensions are misconfigured, authentication and authorization can be bypassed.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication and authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Configuration Errors](./attack_tree_paths/5__configuration_errors.md)

*   **5.1 Insecure Defaults:**
    *   **Description:** The Collector or its components might have default configurations that are insecure (e.g., no authentication required).
    *   **Mitigation:**  Review and change default configurations to secure settings.
*   **5.2 Overly Permissive Access Control:**
    *   **Description:**  The Collector might be configured to grant excessive permissions to untrusted sources.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Follow the principle of least privilege.  Use specific, restrictive access control rules.
*   **5.3 Exposed Endpoints:**
    *   **Description:**  Receivers, exporters, or extensions might be unintentionally exposed to the public internet or untrusted networks.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use network segmentation.  Configure firewalls to restrict access.  Regularly scan for exposed ports.
*   **5.4 Weak or Default Credentials:**
    *   **Description:**  The Collector or its components might use default or easily guessable credentials.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Change default credentials immediately after installation.  Use strong, unique passwords.
*   **5.5 Missing TLS/Encryption:**
    *   **Description:**  Communication between the Collector and other components (application, backend) might be unencrypted.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Enforce TLS for all communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Underlying System Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/6__underlying_system_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **6.3 Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:** Third-party libraries used by the Collector might have known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Regularly update dependencies.  Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify vulnerable libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Supply Chain Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/7__supply_chain_attacks.md)

*   **7.1 Compromised Dependencies:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into a library that the OpenTelemetry Collector depends on.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use trusted sources for dependencies. Verify dependency integrity (e.g., using checksums). Use a software bill of materials (SBOM).
*   **7.2 Malicious Contrib Components:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious receiver, processor, exporter, or extension to a public repository.
    *   **Mitigation:** Carefully vet any contrib components before using them. Review the source code if possible.
*   **7.3 Compromised Build Pipeline:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the build pipeline and injects malicious code into the OpenTelemetry Collector binary itself.
    *   **Mitigation:** Secure the build pipeline with strong access controls and multi-factor authentication. Implement build integrity checks.
