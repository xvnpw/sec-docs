# BUSINESS POSTURE

The OpenTelemetry Collector project aims to provide a vendor-agnostic, open-source telemetry data collection, processing, and exporting solution. It addresses the business need for unified observability across diverse application and infrastructure landscapes.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Standardize telemetry data collection across different environments and technologies.
- Simplify the process of sending telemetry data to multiple backends.
- Provide a flexible and extensible platform for telemetry data processing.
- Reduce vendor lock-in for observability solutions.
- Improve application performance monitoring and incident response capabilities.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Data Loss: Failure to reliably collect and deliver telemetry data can lead to gaps in observability and hinder incident response.
- Data Breach: Exposure of sensitive telemetry data (e.g., logs containing PII) due to security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
- Service Disruption: Downtime or performance degradation of the Collector can impact observability and monitoring capabilities.
- Vendor Lock-in (mitigation failure): If the Collector becomes overly complex or difficult to manage, it could inadvertently create a different form of lock-in, hindering the goal of vendor neutrality.

## BUILD

    B --> C[CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)]
    C --> D{Build Process (Go Build, Linters, SAST, Dependency Scan)}
    D --> E[Build Artifacts (Binaries, Container Images)]
    E --> F{Artifact Repository (Container Registry, Binary Storage)}
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write code, including Collector components and configurations, and commit changes to the Code Repository.
2. Code Repository (GitHub): The GitHub repository hosts the source code of the OpenTelemetry Collector project. It serves as the central version control system.
3. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions): GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration and continuous delivery. It automates the build, test, and release processes.
4. Build Process (Go Build, Linters, SAST, Dependency Scan): The CI/CD pipeline executes a series of build steps:
    - Go Build: Compiles the Go source code into executable binaries.
    - Linters: Runs linters to enforce code style and identify potential code quality issues.
    - SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Performs static analysis of the code to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
    - Dependency Scan: Scans project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
5. Build Artifacts (Binaries, Container Images): The build process produces build artifacts:
    - Binaries: Executable binaries for different platforms.
    - Container Images: Container images for different Collector distributions (agent, gateway, etc.).
6. Artifact Repository (Container Registry, Binary Storage): Build artifacts are stored in artifact repositories:
    - Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry): Stores container images.
    - Binary Storage (e.g., GitHub Releases, cloud storage): Stores binaries and other release artifacts.

Build Security Controls:
- security control: Automated Build Process: CI/CD pipeline ensures a consistent and repeatable build process, reducing manual errors.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): SAST tools are integrated into the build pipeline to automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
- security control: Dependency Scanning: Dependency scanning tools are used to identify and alert on vulnerabilities in project dependencies, enabling timely updates.
- security control: Code Linting: Linters help enforce code quality and consistency, indirectly contributing to security by reducing potential coding errors.
- security control: Signed Artifacts: Consider signing build artifacts (binaries, container images) to ensure integrity and authenticity.
- security control: Access Control to CI/CD Pipeline: Restrict access to the CI/CD pipeline to authorized personnel to prevent unauthorized modifications to the build process.
- security control: Secure Build Environment: Ensure the CI/CD build environment is secure and hardened to prevent compromise.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Observability and Monitoring: The primary critical business process is maintaining observability of applications and infrastructure. This is essential for performance monitoring, incident response, and capacity planning.
- Incident Response: Reliable telemetry data is crucial for effective incident response, enabling faster identification and resolution of issues.
- Performance Management: Telemetry data enables performance analysis and optimization, ensuring applications meet performance SLAs and user expectations.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
- Telemetry Data (Metrics, Logs, Traces): This is the primary data handled by the Collector.
    - Sensitivity: Varies depending on the content of the telemetry data. Metrics are generally less sensitive. Logs and traces can contain sensitive information, including:
        - Application-specific data (potentially sensitive business data).
        - User identifiers (potentially PII).
        - Internal system details (potentially revealing architectural information).
    - Classification:  Depending on the organization's data classification policy, telemetry data, especially logs and traces, might be classified as confidential or internal.
- Configuration Data: Collector configurations may contain sensitive information such as API keys, credentials for backend systems, and internal network details.
    - Sensitivity: High. Exposure of configuration data can lead to unauthorized access to backend systems or compromise of the Collector itself.
    - Classification: Confidential.

Assumptions:
- The OpenTelemetry Collector project prioritizes performance and reliability as key non-functional requirements, alongside security.
- Users of the OpenTelemetry Collector are expected to implement security best practices in their deployment environments, in addition to the security features provided by the Collector itself.
- The open-source nature of the project implies a reliance on community contributions for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
- The project aims to be vendor-neutral and avoid vendor lock-in, including in security solutions.
