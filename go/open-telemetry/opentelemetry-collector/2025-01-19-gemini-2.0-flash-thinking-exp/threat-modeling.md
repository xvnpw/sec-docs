# Threat Model Analysis for open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection](./threats/malicious_data_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends crafted or malicious telemetry data (traces, metrics, logs) to the Collector's receivers. This could involve sending excessively large payloads, data with unexpected formats, or data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in processing logic.
* **Impact:**
    * Resource exhaustion on the Collector, leading to denial of service.
    * Overloading downstream systems with spurious data, impacting their performance or availability.
    * Data poisoning, leading to inaccurate monitoring, alerting, and analysis, potentially masking real issues.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in receiver implementations, potentially leading to code execution or other security breaches.
* **Affected Component:**  `receiver` (specifically the implementation of individual receivers like gRPC, HTTP, Kafka, etc.)
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the Collector's receivers to reject malformed or excessively large telemetry data.
    * Configure rate limiting on receivers to prevent overwhelming the Collector with data.
    * Use authentication and authorization mechanisms for receivers to restrict data sources.
    * Regularly update the Collector and its receiver components to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Processor Configuration Tampering](./threats/processor_configuration_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Collector's configuration and modifies processor configurations. This could involve changing filtering rules, data masking settings, or even introducing malicious processing logic.
* **Impact:**
    * Dropping or filtering critical telemetry data, obscuring malicious activity or performance issues.
    * Modifying data before export, potentially hiding attacks or manipulating analysis results.
    * Introducing vulnerabilities through custom or poorly configured processors.
* **Affected Component:** `config` (the Collector's configuration mechanism), `processor` (the execution of the modified processor logic)
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure access to the Collector's configuration files and management interfaces using strong authentication and authorization.
    * Implement version control and auditing for configuration changes.
    * Use immutable infrastructure for deploying the Collector configuration.
    * Regularly review and validate the Collector's configuration.

## Threat: [Data Interception During Export](./threats/data_interception_during_export.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts telemetry data as it is being exported from the Collector to backend systems (e.g., monitoring dashboards, logging aggregators). This could occur if communication channels are not properly secured.
* **Impact:**
    * Exposure of sensitive information contained within logs, traces, or metrics (e.g., API keys, user data, internal system details).
    * Potential compromise of backend systems if intercepted data contains credentials or other sensitive information.
* **Affected Component:** `exporter` (the communication channel used by exporters like gRPC, HTTP, Kafka, etc.)
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Enforce the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security) for all communication between the Collector and its exporters.
    * Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication between the Collector and export destinations.
    * Ensure that backend systems receiving telemetry data are also properly secured.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Export Destinations](./threats/unauthorized_data_export_destinations.md)

**Description:** An attacker modifies the Collector's configuration to redirect telemetry data to unauthorized destinations under their control.
* **Impact:**
    * Leakage of sensitive telemetry data to external parties.
    * Potential misuse of the leaked data for malicious purposes.
    * Compliance violations related to data privacy and security.
* **Affected Component:** `config`, `exporter`
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure access to the Collector's configuration as described in the "Processor Configuration Tampering" threat.
    * Implement strict validation of exporter configurations to prevent the addition of unauthorized destinations.
    * Regularly audit the configured exporters to ensure they are legitimate.

## Threat: [Credential Compromise for Exporters](./threats/credential_compromise_for_exporters.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to credentials used by the Collector to authenticate with export destinations. This could happen if credentials are stored insecurely within the Collector's configuration or environment variables.
* **Impact:**
    * Unauthorized access to backend systems where telemetry data is being sent.
    * Potential data breaches or manipulation on the backend systems.
    * Ability for the attacker to send malicious data directly to the backend systems, bypassing the Collector.
* **Affected Component:** `config`, `exporter` (specifically the credential management within exporter implementations)
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Store exporter credentials securely using secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets).
    * Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files or environment variables.
    * Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and the principle of least privilege for exporter credentials.
    * Regularly rotate exporter credentials.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion of the Collector](./threats/resource_exhaustion_of_the_collector.md)

**Description:** An attacker overwhelms the Collector with excessive requests or data, causing it to consume excessive CPU, memory, or network resources, leading to denial of service.
* **Impact:**
    * Interruption of telemetry data collection and processing.
    * Loss of visibility into application performance and health.
    * Potential cascading failures if dependent systems rely on the Collector.
* **Affected Component:** All components, especially `receiver` (data ingestion), `processor` (data processing), and the underlying infrastructure.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement rate limiting and request throttling on receivers.
    * Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for the Collector process.
    * Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.
    * Monitor the Collector's resource usage and set up alerts for anomalies.
    * Deploy the Collector with sufficient resources to handle expected load and potential spikes.

## Threat: [Exploiting Collector Component Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_collector_component_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known or unknown vulnerabilities in the OpenTelemetry Collector's core components, receivers, processors, or exporters.
* **Impact:**
    * Code execution on the Collector host.
    * Data breaches or manipulation.
    * Denial of service.
    * Privilege escalation.
* **Affected Component:** Any component of the OpenTelemetry Collector (core, receivers, processors, exporters).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the severity of the vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly update the OpenTelemetry Collector and all its components to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to the OpenTelemetry Collector.
    * Implement a vulnerability scanning process for the Collector's dependencies.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Collector Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_collector_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency (library, module) used by the OpenTelemetry Collector, potentially introducing malicious code or vulnerabilities.
* **Impact:** Similar to exploiting Collector component vulnerabilities, potentially leading to code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
* **Affected Component:** All components that rely on external dependencies.
* **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the compromised dependency)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Use dependency management tools to track and manage the Collector's dependencies.
    * Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    * Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify and mitigate supply chain risks.
    * Consider using signed and verified dependencies.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Collector Management Interfaces](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_collector_management_interfaces.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Collector's management interfaces (e.g., APIs, configuration endpoints) if they are exposed and not properly secured.
* **Impact:**
    * Ability to modify the Collector's configuration, leading to the threats described above (processor tampering, unauthorized export destinations).
    * Potential to disrupt the Collector's operation or take it offline.
* **Affected Component:** `extensions` (if management interfaces are implemented as extensions), `config` (the underlying configuration mechanism).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure management interfaces with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    * Restrict access to management interfaces to authorized personnel and networks.
    * Disable or remove unnecessary management interfaces.
