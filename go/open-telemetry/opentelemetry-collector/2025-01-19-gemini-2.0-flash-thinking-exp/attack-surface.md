# Attack Surface Analysis for open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Receiver Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_receiver_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Receiver endpoints (e.g., gRPC, HTTP) are exposed without proper authentication or authorization mechanisms.
    *   **How OpenTelemetry Collector Contributes:** The Collector's core functionality is to receive telemetry data, and if these entry points are not secured, anyone can send data directly to the Collector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a large volume of arbitrary metrics to an unauthenticated gRPC receiver on the Collector, overwhelming its resources.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) on the Collector, resource exhaustion, injection of misleading or malicious telemetry data into the Collector's processing pipeline, potential for exploiting vulnerabilities in processing pipelines with attacker-controlled data received by the Collector.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Authentication:** Enable authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS) for the Collector's receiver endpoints.
        *   **Implement Authorization:** Configure authorization rules on the Collector to restrict which sources can send data to specific receivers.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Collector within a network segment with restricted access.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the Collector's receiver endpoints to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Data Injection via Receivers](./attack_surfaces/malformed_data_injection_via_receivers.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send intentionally malformed or excessively large telemetry data to the Collector's receiver endpoints.
    *   **How OpenTelemetry Collector Contributes:** The Collector must parse and process incoming data, and vulnerabilities in the Collector's parsing libraries or processing logic can be exploited by malformed input.
    *   **Example:** Sending a gRPC payload with an extremely large string field to the Collector that causes a buffer overflow in its parsing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) on the Collector, crashes of the Collector process, potential for remote code execution on the Collector host if parsing vulnerabilities exist, resource exhaustion on the Collector.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on all of the Collector's receiver endpoints to reject malformed or oversized data.
        *   **Secure Parsing Libraries:** Ensure that the parsing libraries used by the Collector's receivers are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits (e.g., memory, CPU) for the Collector to prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Perform fuzz testing on the Collector's receiver endpoints to identify potential parsing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_management.md)

*   **Description:** The Collector's configuration file contains sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials for exporters) that is not properly protected.
    *   **How OpenTelemetry Collector Contributes:** The Collector directly relies on a configuration file to define its behavior, including connections to external systems.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Collector's configuration file and retrieves credentials for a backend monitoring system used by the Collector.
    *   **Impact:** Credential theft from the Collector's configuration, unauthorized access to downstream systems connected by the Collector, data breaches facilitated by the Collector's compromised credentials, ability to manipulate the Collector's behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Configuration Storage:** Store the Collector's configuration file with appropriate file system permissions, restricting access to authorized users only.
        *   **Secret Management:** Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to store and manage sensitive credentials used by the Collector.
        *   **Environment Variables:** Prefer using environment variables for sensitive configuration values instead of hardcoding them in the Collector's configuration file.
        *   **Configuration Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data within the Collector's configuration file at rest.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Processors and Extensions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_processors_and_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities exist in the code of specific processors or extensions used by the Collector.
    *   **How OpenTelemetry Collector Contributes:** The Collector's extensibility allows for custom processing logic within the Collector, which can introduce vulnerabilities if not developed securely.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable processor within the Collector allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code through specially crafted telemetry data processed by the Collector.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Collector host, data manipulation within the Collector's processing pipeline, information leakage from the Collector's environment, denial of service on the Collector.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the Collector and all its dependencies (including processors and extensions) updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom processors and extensions used by the Collector to identify potential security flaws.
        *   **Static and Dynamic Analysis:** Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to identify vulnerabilities in the Collector's processor and extension code.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant processors and extensions within the Collector only the necessary permissions to perform their intended functions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Exporter Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_exporter_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Exporters within the Collector are configured to send telemetry data to insecure or compromised destinations, or use insecure protocols.
    *   **How OpenTelemetry Collector Contributes:** The Collector's purpose is to export telemetry data, and misconfigured exporters within the Collector can lead to data breaches originating from the Collector.
    *   **Example:** An exporter within the Collector is configured to send sensitive data over unencrypted HTTP to an attacker-controlled server.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration from the Collector, exposure of sensitive information processed by the Collector, compromise of downstream systems due to data originating from the Collector.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Secure Protocols:** Always use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, gRPC with TLS) for the Collector's exporters when sending telemetry data.
        *   **Verify Export Destinations:** Ensure that the export destinations configured for the Collector are legitimate and properly secured.
        *   **Authentication and Authorization for Exporters:** Configure authentication and authorization for the Collector's exporters to ensure data is only sent to authorized systems.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant exporters within the Collector only the necessary permissions to write data to their intended destinations.
