## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Collector's Data Reception (Critical Node) & Inject Malicious Telemetry Data (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_collector's_data_reception__critical_node__&_inject_malicious_telemetry_data__critical_node_.md)

**1. Exploit Collector's Data Reception (Critical Node) & Inject Malicious Telemetry Data (Critical Node):**

* **Attack Vector:** The OpenTelemetry Collector receives telemetry data from various sources using protocols like OTLP, Jaeger, and Zipkin. Attackers can exploit weaknesses in how the collector handles these incoming data streams.
* **Threat:** By injecting malicious telemetry data, attackers aim to trigger vulnerabilities in the collector's parsing logic, processing stages, or even the backend systems where the data is exported. This can lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or in severe cases, remote code execution on the collector itself or connected systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Protocol Handling (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_protocol_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

**2. Exploit Insecure Protocol Handling (High-Risk Path):**

* **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the implementation of the telemetry protocols.
    * **Send Malformed OTLP Requests:** Attackers craft OTLP requests that violate the protocol specification. If the collector's parsing logic is not robust, this can lead to errors, resource exhaustion, or exploitable conditions.
    * **Send Malformed Jaeger/Zipkin Spans:** Similar to OTLP, malformed spans in Jaeger or Zipkin formats can exploit vulnerabilities, particularly deserialization flaws if the collector attempts to deserialize untrusted data without proper validation.
    * **Exploit Protocol-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Known vulnerabilities (CVEs) might exist in the specific versions or implementations of the telemetry protocols used by the collector. Attackers can leverage these known weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Collector's Data Processing (Critical Node) & Exploit Vulnerabilities in Processors (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_collector's_data_processing__critical_node__&_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_processors__high-ri_648c83f0.md)

**3. Exploit Collector's Data Processing (Critical Node) & Exploit Vulnerabilities in Processors (High-Risk Path):**

* **Attack Vector:** OpenTelemetry Collectors use processors to transform and filter telemetry data. Vulnerabilities in these processors can be exploited to disrupt the data flow or compromise the collector's integrity.
    * **Leverage Known CVEs in Built-in Processors:** The collector includes built-in processors. If these processors have publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs), attackers can exploit them.
    * **Leverage Known CVEs in Custom Processors:** Organizations can develop custom processors. If these custom components are not developed with security in mind or are not regularly audited, they can contain vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Collector Configuration (Critical Node, High-Risk Path) & Configuration Injection (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_collector_configuration__critical_node__high-risk_path__&_configuration_injection__critic_8c57f72d.md)

**4. Manipulate Collector Configuration (Critical Node, High-Risk Path) & Configuration Injection (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**

* **Attack Vector:** The collector's behavior is governed by its configuration. If an attacker can manipulate this configuration, they can gain significant control over the collector's operations. Configuration injection is a specific technique where malicious configuration parameters are injected into the collector's configuration.
    * **Exploit Unsanitized Input in Configuration Sources:** If the collector loads configuration from external sources (e.g., environment variables, files, remote sources) without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious configuration values.
    * **Exploit Default or Weak Credentials for Configuration Access:** If access to configuration files or APIs is protected by default or easily guessable credentials, attackers can gain unauthorized access and modify the configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Collector's Data Export (Critical Node) & Compromise Exporter Credentials (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_collector's_data_export__critical_node__&_compromise_exporter_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

**5. Exploit Collector's Data Export (Critical Node) & Compromise Exporter Credentials (High-Risk Path):**

* **Attack Vector:** Exporters send telemetry data to backend systems. These exporters often require credentials for authentication. If these credentials are compromised, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the backend systems.
    * **Exploit Stored Credentials Vulnerabilities:** If the collector stores exporter credentials in plaintext or uses weak encryption, attackers who gain access to the collector's system (through other vulnerabilities) can retrieve these credentials.
    * **Intercept Credentials in Transit:** If the communication channel used to transmit credentials between the collector and the backend system is not properly secured (e.g., not using TLS), attackers can intercept these credentials using man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Collector's Data Export (Critical Node) & Exploit Vulnerabilities in Exporters (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_collector's_data_export__critical_node__&_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_exporters__high-risk_pa_104e55e9.md)

**6. Exploit Collector's Data Export (Critical Node) & Exploit Vulnerabilities in Exporters (High-Risk Path):**

* **Attack Vector:** Similar to processors, exporters can have vulnerabilities in their implementation.
    * **Leverage Known CVEs in Built-in Exporters:** The collector includes built-in exporters. If these exporters have publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs), attackers can exploit them. This could potentially lead to denial of service on the backend system or other forms of compromise.
    * **Leverage Known CVEs in Custom Exporters:** Custom exporters, if not developed securely, can contain vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. This could lead to similar outcomes as exploiting built-in exporter vulnerabilities.
