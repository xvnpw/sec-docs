# Attack Surface Analysis for beego/beego

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Parameter Binding](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_parameter_binding.md)

*   **Description:**  Beego automatically maps request parameters to controller method arguments. If these parameters are not properly validated and sanitized, attackers can inject malicious data.
    *   **How Beego Contributes:** Beego's automatic parameter binding simplifies development but places the responsibility for validation squarely on the developer. The framework itself doesn't enforce input validation by default.
    *   **Example:** A user ID is passed in the URL (`/user/delete/123`). Without validation, an attacker could change it to a SQL injection payload (`/user/delete/1 OR 1=1; --`).
    *   **Impact:**  SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), depending on how the parameter is used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all parameters received by controller methods. Use Beego's built-in validation features or external libraries. Employ parameterized queries or ORM features with proper escaping to prevent SQL injection. Avoid directly executing system commands with user-provided input. Encode output appropriately to prevent XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** If user-controlled data is directly embedded into Beego templates without proper escaping, attackers can inject malicious template code that executes on the server.
    *   **How Beego Contributes:** Beego's template engine, while powerful, can be vulnerable if developers directly pass unsanitized user input into template directives.
    *   **Example:** A comment form allows users to enter their name. If the template renders `Hello {{.Name}}`, and a user enters `{{exec "rm -rf /"}}`, this command could be executed on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to completely compromise the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Always escape user-provided data before rendering it in templates. Use Beego's built-in escaping functions. Avoid allowing users to directly control template code or paths. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential damage from successful injection.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Beego manages user sessions can allow attackers to hijack or manipulate sessions.
    *   **How Beego Contributes:** Beego provides session management features, but the security depends on the chosen storage mechanism and configuration. Default or insecure configurations can be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Using the default memory session provider in a production environment makes session data easily accessible. Lack of session ID regeneration after login can lead to session fixation attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and malicious actions performed under the guise of a legitimate user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Configure secure session storage (e.g., Redis, database). Ensure session IDs are regenerated after login. Use HTTPS to protect session cookies from interception. Set appropriate session cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite). Implement session timeouts.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Beego handles file uploads. Improper validation of uploaded files can lead to various attacks.
    *   **How Beego Contributes:** Beego provides mechanisms for handling file uploads, but the framework doesn't enforce strict validation by default.
    *   **Example:**  An application allows users to upload profile pictures. Without validation, an attacker could upload a malicious executable file (e.g., a web shell) and potentially execute it on the server. Lack of filename sanitization can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (via malicious file uploads), Denial of Service (by uploading large files), Path Traversal (overwriting critical files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Validate file types, sizes, and content. Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal. Store uploaded files outside the web root or in a dedicated storage service. Implement virus scanning on uploaded files. Set appropriate file permissions.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via ORM Usage](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_orm_usage.md)

*   **Description:** Even when using Beego's ORM, improper construction of queries or use of raw SQL can introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Beego Contributes:** While the ORM aims to prevent direct SQL injection, developers might still use raw SQL queries or construct ORM queries in a way that is vulnerable if user input is not properly handled.
    *   **Example:**  Using string concatenation to build a `Where` clause in an ORM query with unsanitized user input: `o.QueryTable("users").Filter("name", name).Filter("status", "active").SetExpr("ORDER BY " + orderBy)`. If `orderBy` is user-controlled, it can be exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid using raw SQL queries whenever possible. Use parameterized queries or ORM features with proper escaping. Carefully validate and sanitize any user input used in ORM queries. Avoid constructing dynamic `ORDER BY` or `LIMIT` clauses with direct user input.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Configuration Data](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:** If Beego's configuration files or environment variables are not properly secured, sensitive information can be exposed.
    *   **How Beego Contributes:** Beego relies on configuration files (e.g., `app.conf`) and environment variables. If these are not protected, attackers can gain access to sensitive data.
    *   **Example:** Database credentials, API keys, or secret keys are stored in plain text in `app.conf` and the file is accessible through a misconfigured web server or by an attacker gaining access to the server.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to further compromise of the application and related systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Store sensitive configuration data securely, preferably using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions. Avoid committing sensitive data directly to version control. Ensure configuration files are not accessible through the web server. Use appropriate file permissions to restrict access to configuration files.
