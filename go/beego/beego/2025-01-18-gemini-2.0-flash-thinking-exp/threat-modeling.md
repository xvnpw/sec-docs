# Threat Model Analysis for beego/beego

## Threat: [Route Hijacking/Confusion](./threats/route_hijackingconfusion.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft requests that match unintended routes due to overly broad or overlapping route definitions in the Beego application. This allows them to access handlers they shouldn't have access to, potentially executing arbitrary code or accessing sensitive data.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to application functionality, potential data breaches, code execution, denial of service.

**Affected Beego Component:** `server/web/router.go` (Beego's routing mechanism).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict and specific route definitions.
* Avoid using overly broad or overlapping route patterns.
* Regularly review and test route configurations.
* Use Beego's route grouping features to organize routes logically.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Session Storage](./threats/insecure_default_session_storage.md)

**Description:** If the Beego application relies on the default session storage mechanism in a production environment, session data might be stored in a way that is easily accessible or vulnerable to compromise (e.g., in memory or using insecure file storage). An attacker gaining access to this storage could hijack user sessions.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts and data.

**Affected Beego Component:** `session` package (Beego's session management).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure a secure session storage backend like Redis, Memcached, or a database.
* Ensure proper encryption and access controls for the chosen storage.
* Use secure session cookies (HttpOnly, Secure flags).

## Threat: [Predictable or Weak Session IDs (if custom implementation is flawed)](./threats/predictable_or_weak_session_ids__if_custom_implementation_is_flawed_.md)

**Description:** If developers implement custom session management using Beego's features but employ weak or predictable session ID generation algorithms, attackers could potentially guess or predict valid session IDs and hijack user sessions.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts and data.

**Affected Beego Component:** `session` package (if custom implementation is used).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize Beego's built-in session management features with secure configuration.
* If implementing custom session management, use cryptographically secure random number generators for session ID generation.
* Ensure sufficient session ID length and complexity.

## Threat: [Session Fixation Vulnerabilities](./threats/session_fixation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the Beego application doesn't regenerate session IDs after successful login or privilege escalation, an attacker could potentially fix a user's session ID (e.g., by sending a crafted link with a specific session ID) and later hijack their session after the user logs in.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts and data.

**Affected Beego Component:** `session` package (Beego's session management).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure session IDs are regenerated after successful authentication.
* Regenerate session IDs after any significant privilege changes.

## Threat: [SQL Injection if Raw Queries are Used Carelessly](./threats/sql_injection_if_raw_queries_are_used_carelessly.md)

**Description:** While Beego's ORM provides mechanisms to prevent SQL injection, developers using raw SQL queries or not properly sanitizing input within ORM queries could still introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code that is executed by the database, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, potential for arbitrary code execution on the database server.

**Affected Beego Component:** `orm` package (Beego's ORM).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Primarily use Beego's ORM features for data access.
* If raw queries are necessary, use parameterized queries or prepared statements.
* Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input used in database interactions.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) if User Input is Directly Rendered in Templates](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__if_user_input_is_directly_rendered_in_templates.md)

**Description:** If user-provided input is directly embedded into Beego templates without proper escaping or sanitization, attackers could inject malicious code (e.g., Beego template language code or Go code if using certain template engines) that is executed on the server during template rendering.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, server compromise.

**Affected Beego Component:** `view` package, template rendering functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always escape user-provided input when rendering it in templates.
* Use Beego's built-in template escaping functions.
* Avoid directly rendering raw user input in templates.
* Consider using template engines with strong sandboxing capabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Uploaded Files](./threats/insecure_handling_of_uploaded_files.md)

**Description:** If the Beego application doesn't implement proper validation and security measures for file uploads, attackers could upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) to the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, malware distribution.

**Affected Beego Component:** Request handling related to multipart forms, file upload functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict file type validation based on content, not just extension.
* Generate unique and unpredictable filenames for uploaded files.
* Store uploaded files outside the web root or in a dedicated storage service with appropriate access controls.
* Scan uploaded files for malware.
* Limit file size and quantity.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities during File Upload or Retrieval](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_during_file_upload_or_retrieval.md)

**Description:** If the Beego application uses user-provided input to determine the storage location or retrieval path of uploaded files without proper sanitization, attackers could potentially access or overwrite arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the file path.

**Impact:** Access to sensitive files, overwriting critical files, potential for remote code execution.

**Affected Beego Component:** Request handling related to file uploads and downloads.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using user input directly in file paths.
* Use whitelisting and canonicalization techniques to ensure file paths are valid and within expected boundaries.
* Store file metadata separately from the file path.
