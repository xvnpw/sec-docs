# Threat Model Analysis for beego/beego

## Threat: [Session Hijacking via Predictable Session IDs](./threats/session_hijacking_via_predictable_session_ids.md)

*   **Threat:** Session Hijacking via Predictable Session IDs

    *   **Description:** An attacker could guess or predict a valid session ID due to weak random number generation or a small keyspace used by Beego's session management. The attacker could then use this predicted ID to impersonate a legitimate user.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, data breaches, potential for further attacks (e.g., privilege escalation).
    *   **Affected Beego Component:** `session` module, specifically the session ID generation logic within functions like `NewSessionStore` and related configuration options.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure `sessionkey` in `app.conf` is a long, randomly generated string (e.g., using a cryptographically secure random number generator).  Do *not* use a short, predictable, or hardcoded value.
        *   Regularly rotate the `sessionkey`.
        *   Use a secure session provider (e.g., Redis, database) instead of the default file-based provider.
        *   Set `sessionsecure = true` to enforce HTTPS for session cookies.
        *   Set `sessionhttponly = true` to prevent client-side JavaScript access to cookies.
        *   Keep Beego updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Session Fixation](./threats/session_fixation.md)

*   **Threat:** Session Fixation

    *   **Description:** An attacker sets a user's session ID to a known value *before* the user logs in.  After the user authenticates, the attacker can use the known session ID to hijack the session. This differs from hijacking in that the attacker *sets* the ID, rather than guessing it.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Beego Component:** `session` module, specifically how Beego handles session ID regeneration upon authentication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Beego is configured to regenerate the session ID upon successful user authentication.  This should be the default behavior, but verify it.  This is typically handled within the authentication logic *using* the session module, not *within* the session module itself.
        *   Use a secure session provider.
        *   Keep Beego updated.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability via ORM](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability_via_orm.md)

*   **Threat:** Mass Assignment Vulnerability via ORM

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a crafted request containing unexpected fields that are automatically bound to a model by Beego's ORM.  This allows the attacker to modify fields they shouldn't have access to (e.g., setting `is_admin = true`).
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Beego Component:** `orm` module, specifically functions related to model creation and updating (e.g., `Insert`, `Update`, `ReadOrCreate`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly define which fields are allowed to be updated in each ORM operation using the `Cols` parameter in `Update` or by creating separate structs for create/update operations.
        *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to map request data to models, providing an explicit layer of control over which fields are populated.
        *   Avoid using "magic" features that automatically bind all request parameters to models.
        *   Implement input validation *before* interacting with the ORM.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Uncontrolled File Uploads](./threats/denial_of_service_via_uncontrolled_file_uploads.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Uncontrolled File Uploads

    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a very large file or a large number of files, exhausting server resources (disk space, memory, CPU) and causing the application to become unavailable. This leverages Beego's file handling capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application unavailability.
    *   **Affected Beego Component:** `context.Input.SaveToFile` function and related file upload handling logic.  Also potentially the `StaticDir` configuration if serving uploaded files directly.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict limits on file upload sizes using `context.Input.MaxMemory` and potentially custom middleware to check file size *before* saving.
        *   Validate file types to prevent uploading of executable files or other potentially dangerous content. Use a whitelist approach, not a blacklist.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the web root to prevent direct execution.
        *   Use a dedicated file storage service (e.g., cloud storage) to offload file handling.
        *   Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive upload attempts.

## Threat: [Command Injection via `RunCommand`](./threats/command_injection_via__runcommand_.md)

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via `RunCommand`

    *   **Description:** If the application uses Beego's `RunCommand` feature to execute system commands, and user input is incorporated into these commands without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands, potentially gaining full control of the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breaches, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Beego Component:** `RunCommand` function within the `beego` package.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strongly avoid** using `RunCommand` with user-provided input.
        *   If absolutely necessary, use extreme caution and implement rigorous input validation and sanitization. Use a whitelist of allowed characters and commands, *never* a blacklist.
        *   Consider using a more secure alternative to executing system commands, such as a dedicated library or API designed for the specific task.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization via `gob` (if used)](./threats/insecure_deserialization_via__gob___if_used_.md)

* **Threat:**  Insecure Deserialization via `gob` (if used)

    *   **Description:** If the application uses Beego's `cache` module with the `gob` encoding (or any other component that uses `gob` for serialization/deserialization) and deserializes data from untrusted sources, an attacker could craft malicious input that executes arbitrary code upon deserialization.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Beego Component:** `cache` module (if using `gob` encoding), or any other component that uses `gob` for serialization/deserialization of untrusted data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid using `gob` to deserialize data from untrusted sources.**
        *   If `gob` must be used, use a secure alternative like a digitally signed format or a format with built-in security features.
        *   If using the `cache` module, prefer safer encoding options like `json` or `memcache` if possible.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* deserialization.
