# Attack Surface Analysis for beego/beego

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Routing (AutoRouter and Regex)](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_routing__autorouter_and_regex_.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentional exposure of controller methods due to misconfigured or overly broad routing rules.
*   **How Beego Contributes:** Beego's `AutoRouter` and regular expression-based routing features, while convenient, can easily lead to unintended exposure if not carefully managed. This is a *direct* consequence of Beego's routing mechanism.
*   **Example:** An `AdminController` with a method `deleteUser` is automatically routed by `AutoRouter` without explicit access control, allowing any user to access `/admin/deleteUser`.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality, data modification/deletion, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Potentially Critical if administrative functions are exposed)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Prefer explicit routing (`beego.Router`) over `beego.AutoRouter`, especially for sensitive areas.
    *   Define specific HTTP methods for each route (e.g., `// @router /users/:id [get]`).
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization *within* controller methods, *not* solely relying on routing.
    *   Use Beego's `Filter` mechanism for global or group-level access control.
    *   Regularly audit all defined routes.

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Pollution/Mass Assignment in Controllers](./attack_surfaces/parameter_pollutionmass_assignment_in_controllers.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentional modification of internal application state due to uncontrolled binding of request parameters to controller structs.
*   **How Beego Contributes:** Beego's automatic parameter binding (e.g., `this.Ctx.Input.Bind`) is the *direct* mechanism that enables this vulnerability if not used carefully.
*   **Example:** A user profile update form allows changing the `email` field.  An attacker adds an `isAdmin=true` parameter to the request, which is bound to the user struct and updates the user's role in the database.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation, bypassing security checks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use explicit parameter binding and validation.  *Never* bind the entire request body directly to a model struct.
    *   Utilize Beego's validation library (`beego/validation`) to define strict rules for each expected parameter.
    *   Employ Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to represent expected input, separating input validation from model logic.
    *   Sanitize input where appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [ORM-Related Injection (Raw SQL)](./attack_surfaces/orm-related_injection__raw_sql_.md)

*   **Description:** SQL injection vulnerabilities arising from the misuse of Beego's ORM, specifically when using raw SQL queries.
*   **How Beego Contributes:** Beego's `orm.Raw` method, a *direct* part of the Beego ORM, provides the functionality that, if misused, leads to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** `orm.Raw("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + this.GetString("username") + "'")` – The `username` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to injection.
*   **Impact:** Data leakage, modification, deletion, complete database compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Prioritize using the ORM's built-in query builders (e.g., `Where`, `Filter`) over raw SQL.
    *   If raw SQL is unavoidable, *always* use parameterized queries (prepared statements).  *Never* concatenate user input directly into SQL strings.
    *   Thoroughly review and test any code using `orm.Raw`.

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/template_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Execution of arbitrary code on the server through the injection of malicious template code.
*   **How Beego Contributes:** Beego's template rendering mechanism, specifically how it handles template names and paths, is the *direct* enabler of this vulnerability if user input is improperly used in template selection.
*   **Example:** `this.TplName = this.GetString("template") + ".tpl"` – If an attacker provides a value like `../../malicious`, they might be able to load and execute a malicious template file.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Never* construct template paths or names directly from user input.
    *   Use a whitelist of allowed template names.
    *   If dynamic template selection is necessary, use a safe lookup mechanism (e.g., a map or database query) based on a validated identifier.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `httplib`](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via__httplib_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting Beego's `httplib` to make unauthorized requests to internal or external resources.
*   **How Beego Contributes:** `httplib`, a *direct* component of Beego, is the tool used to make the HTTP requests that are the basis of SSRF.
*   **Example:** An application uses `httplib` to fetch data from a URL provided by the user: `beego.NewHttpRequester(this.GetString("url")).Get().Response()`. An attacker could provide a URL like `http://localhost:8080/admin` to access internal services.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal services, data leakage, potential for further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Potentially Critical depending on the targeted resources)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate and sanitize any user-supplied data used in constructing URLs for `httplib` requests.
    *   Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or IP addresses if possible.
    *   Avoid making requests to internal resources based on user input.
    *   Use a dedicated network proxy with strict access control rules if external requests are necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Session Configuration](./attack_surfaces/improper_session_configuration.md)

* **Description:** Weak session security due to misconfigured session settings.
* **How Beego Contributes:** Beego *directly* provides and manages the session configuration options. The vulnerability arises from misconfiguration of *Beego's* settings.
* **Example:** Setting `SessionSecure = false` in a production environment (using HTTPS) allows session cookies to be transmitted over unencrypted connections.
* **Impact:** Session hijacking, session fixation.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Set `SessionCookieLifeTime` and `SessionGCMaxLifetime` to appropriate values.
    * *Always* set `SessionSecure = true` in production (HTTPS).
    * *Always* set `SessionHttpOnly = true` to prevent client-side JavaScript access to session cookies.
    * Use a strong, randomly generated `SessionName`.
    * Choose a secure session storage backend (e.g., Redis with proper security).
