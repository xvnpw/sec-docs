## Attack Tree Path: [[[Attacker's Goal: Gain Unauthorized Access/Execute Arbitrary Code]]](./attack_tree_paths/__attacker's_goal_gain_unauthorized_accessexecute_arbitrary_code__.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to either gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources within the Beego application or to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This could lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Impact:** High-Very High
*   **Why Critical:** This is the fundamental objective and represents the worst-case scenario.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Beego-Specific Vulnerabilities]](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_beego-specific_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents attacks that directly target vulnerabilities within the Beego framework itself, or vulnerabilities introduced by how the application uses the framework's features.
*   **Why High-Risk Path:** This path leads directly to multiple critical nodes (ORM and Template vulnerabilities).

## Attack Tree Path: [[[ORM Vulnerabilities]]](./attack_tree_paths/__orm_vulnerabilities__.md)

*   **Description:** This node encompasses vulnerabilities related to Beego's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). The ORM is a crucial component for interacting with databases, and vulnerabilities here can have severe consequences.
*   **Why Critical:** ORM vulnerabilities often lead to direct database access, which is a high-impact outcome.
*   **Why High-Risk Path:** Leads to critical nodes (SQLi and NoSQLi).

## Attack Tree Path: [[[SQL Injection via ORM]]](./attack_tree_paths/__sql_injection_via_orm__.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates input data to inject malicious SQL code through Beego's ORM. This can occur if raw SQL queries are used improperly or if there are undiscovered vulnerabilities in the ORM itself. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to bypass authentication, read, modify, or delete data in the database.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if raw SQL is used) / Low (if ORM is used correctly)
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete database compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium (depending on complexity of injection)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (WAF, IDS can detect, but sophisticated attacks can bypass)
*   **Why Critical:** High impact and potentially medium likelihood, combined with relatively low effort.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[NoSQL Injection via ORM]]](./attack_tree_paths/__nosql_injection_via_orm__.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to SQL injection, but targets NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) used through Beego's ORM. Attackers inject malicious commands specific to the NoSQL database to bypass security controls and access or modify data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if raw queries are used) / Low (if ORM is used correctly)
*   **Impact:** High-Very High (data breach, data modification, denial of service)
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard (less mature detection tools compared to SQLi)
*   **Why Critical:** High impact and potential for medium likelihood.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Misuse Beego Features/Misconfigurations]](./attack_tree_paths/_misuse_beego_featuresmisconfigurations_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents attacks that exploit misconfigurations or improper use of Beego's features, even if the framework itself isn't inherently vulnerable.
*   **Why High-Risk Path:** This path leads directly to multiple critical nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Template Vulnerabilities]]](./attack_tree_paths/__template_vulnerabilities__.md)

*   **Description:** This node focuses on vulnerabilities within Beego's templating engine. Templates are used to generate dynamic HTML output, and improper handling of user input within templates can lead to serious security issues.
*   **Why Critical:** Template vulnerabilities, particularly XSS, are very common and easily exploitable.
*   **Why High-Risk Path:** Leads to the critical XSS node.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[XSS via Template Injection]]](./attack_tree_paths/__xss_via_template_injection__.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application through user input that is not properly escaped or sanitized before being rendered in a Beego template. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' browsers, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if output encoding is not consistent) / Low (if consistent)
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (session hijacking, defacement, phishing)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (WAF, browser security features, but sophisticated XSS can bypass)
*   **Why Critical:** High likelihood, medium-high impact, and low effort make this a critical vulnerability.
