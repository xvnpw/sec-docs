## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Beego Application [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_beego_application__cr_.md)

This is the root goal and is critical as it represents the ultimate success for the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Beego Router Vulnerabilities [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_beego_router_vulnerabilities__cr_.md)

This category is critical because the router is the entry point for all requests. Vulnerabilities here can have broad impact.
    *   **2.1. Route Parameter Injection/Manipulation [HR] [CR]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker manipulates route parameters in the URL to bypass authorization checks or access unintended resources.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on routing complexity and developer input validation practices.
        *   **Impact:** Medium - Potential unauthorized access, data modification, or application logic bypass.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all route parameters. Use Beego's routing features securely, avoiding overly complex or dynamic routing patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Beego ORM Vulnerabilities [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_beego_orm_vulnerabilities__cr_.md)

This category is critical because the ORM interacts directly with the database, holding sensitive data.
    *   **3.1. ORM Injection (Beego ORM Specific) [HR] [CR]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker injects malicious code into ORM queries through unsanitized user input, leading to unauthorized database access or modification.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends heavily on developer practices regarding parameterized queries.
        *   **Impact:** High - Full database compromise, data breach, data manipulation.
        *   **Mitigation:** Always use parameterized queries or Beego ORM's query builders that automatically handle input sanitization. Avoid constructing raw SQL queries with user-provided data.
    *   **3.2. Data Exposure via ORM Error Handling [HR] [CR]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** ORM error messages inadvertently expose sensitive database schema information or internal application details to attackers.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common misconfiguration to leave verbose error messages in production.
        *   **Impact:** Low to Medium - Information disclosure, aiding further attacks.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement custom error handling for ORM operations that logs errors securely and returns generic error messages to users in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Beego Template Engine Vulnerabilities [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_beego_template_engine_vulnerabilities__cr_.md)

This category is critical because template engines, if vulnerable, can lead to Remote Code Execution.
    *   **4.1. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Beego Templates [HR] [CR]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker injects malicious template code into user-controlled input that is rendered by Beego's template engine, leading to remote code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on developer practices regarding template escaping and user input handling in templates.
        *   **Impact:** High - Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, full server compromise.
        *   **Mitigation:** Never directly embed user input into templates without proper escaping. Use Beego's template engine's built-in escaping mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Beego Configuration & Deployment Weaknesses [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_beego_configuration_&_deployment_weaknesses__cr_.md)

This category is critical because misconfigurations are common and can directly expose sensitive data or create vulnerabilities.
    *   **5.1. Exposed Configuration Files (e.g., `app.conf`) [HR] [CR]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Publicly accessible configuration files containing sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or secret keys.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common misconfiguration in deployments.
        *   **Impact:** High - Exposure of sensitive credentials, full application compromise.
        *   **Mitigation:** Ensure configuration files are not publicly accessible. Store sensitive configuration data securely (e.g., environment variables, secrets management systems).
    *   **5.2. Insecure Default Configurations [HR] [CR] [CR]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from insecure default settings in Beego or its dependencies.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Frameworks often have defaults that are convenient but not always secure.
        *   **Impact:** Medium - Can lead to various vulnerabilities depending on the specific insecure default.
        *   **Mitigation:** Review and harden Beego's default configurations. Disable unnecessary features, set strong security headers, and configure secure session management.
    *   **5.3. Misconfigured Security Features (e.g., CSRF, HTTPS) [HR] [CR]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting misconfigurations or disabled security features provided by Beego, such as CSRF protection or HTTPS enforcement.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Developers might forget to enable or properly configure security features.
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High - CSRF bypass leads to unauthorized actions, lack of HTTPS leads to data interception.
        *   **Mitigation:** Properly configure and enable all relevant security features provided by Beego. Ensure HTTPS is enforced, CSRF protection is enabled and correctly implemented.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Beego Middleware or Filter Vulnerabilities [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_beego_middleware_or_filter_vulnerabilities__cr_.md)

This category is critical because middleware and filters are often used for security controls.
    *   **6.1. Middleware Bypass [HR] [CR]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Finding ways to bypass middleware or filters designed for security checks, allowing access to protected resources or functionalities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Depends on the complexity and correctness of middleware logic and routing configuration.
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Bypassing authentication, authorization, or other security checks.
        *   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly test middleware logic and ensure it cannot be bypassed. Review routing configurations to prevent unintended bypassing of middleware.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Exploit Beego Input Handling & Validation Weaknesses [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/7__exploit_beego_input_handling_&_validation_weaknesses__cr_.md)

This category is critical as input handling vulnerabilities are very common and can lead to various attacks.
    *   **7.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Input [HR] [CR]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts into the application through unsanitized user input, which are then executed in other users' browsers.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common vulnerability, especially if developers are not consistently sanitizing output.
        *   **Impact:** Medium - Account compromise, session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites.
        *   **Mitigation:** Sanitize all user input before displaying it in templates or using it in other contexts where it could be interpreted as code. Use Beego's template engine's escaping features and implement input validation on the server-side.
    *   **7.2. Path Traversal via Unsanitized Input [HR] [CR]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating file paths through unsanitized user input to access files outside of the intended directory.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common vulnerability if file paths are constructed using user input without proper validation.
        *   **Impact:** Medium - Access to sensitive files on the server, information disclosure.
        *   **Mitigation:** Validate and sanitize file paths based on user input. Use secure file handling mechanisms and avoid directly using user input to construct file paths.
    *   **7.3. Input Validation Bypass [HR] [CR]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Finding ways to bypass client-side or server-side input validation mechanisms to submit malicious or unexpected data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Input validation is often implemented but can be incomplete or flawed.
        *   **Impact:** Medium - Can lead to various vulnerabilities depending on what the validation was intended to prevent.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust server-side input validation for all user inputs. Do not rely solely on client-side validation.
