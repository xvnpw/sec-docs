# Attack Surface Analysis for beego/beego

## Attack Surface: [1. Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/1__route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code or commands through URL route parameters that are not properly sanitized or validated within Beego applications.
*   **Beego Contribution:** Beego's routing system allows defining routes with parameters (e.g., `/user/:id`). If developers directly use these parameters in backend operations (like database queries or system commands) without sanitization within Beego controllers, it creates a direct injection point facilitated by Beego's routing mechanism.
*   **Example:** A Beego route `/delete/:filename` where the `filename` parameter from the URL is directly passed to `os.Remove(filename)` in a Beego controller without validation. An attacker could access `/delete/../../sensitive_file.txt` to delete files outside the intended directory, exploiting Beego's route parameter handling.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, data deletion, command execution on the server, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation in Beego Controllers:**  Within Beego controller actions, strictly validate all route parameters obtained from `this.Ctx.Input.Param(":param_name")` against expected formats and values. Use whitelisting.
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements with BeeORM or Raw SQL in Beego:** When using route parameters in database queries within Beego applications (especially with BeeORM or raw SQL), always utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by BeeORM or the database driver to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Input Sanitization/Escaping in Beego Controllers:** Sanitize or escape route parameters within Beego controllers before using them in system commands or other sensitive operations.

## Attack Surface: [2. Wildcard Route Abuse](./attack_surfaces/2__wildcard_route_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting overly permissive or misconfigured wildcard routes defined in Beego to access unintended resources or functionalities.
*   **Beego Contribution:** Beego supports wildcard routes (`*`) for flexible routing configurations. Misuse or overly broad wildcard definitions in Beego's `router.go` can unintentionally expose application parts.
*   **Example:** A Beego route defined as `/static/*` intended for serving static files, but configured to serve from a directory too high in the file system hierarchy. An attacker could access `/static/../app.conf` through Beego's wildcard routing to potentially read application configuration files.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to application files or functionalities, potential for further exploitation based on exposed information.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Wildcard Scope in Beego Routing:** Carefully define the scope of wildcard routes in Beego's `router.go` to only cover the specifically intended resources. Use more specific path definitions instead of broad wildcards whenever feasible.
    *   **Input Validation for Wildcard Paths in Beego Controllers:** Within Beego controllers handling wildcard routes, validate and sanitize the path portion captured by the wildcard (accessible via `this.Ctx.Input.Param("*")` or similar) to prevent directory traversal or access to sensitive files.

## Attack Surface: [3. Lack of Built-in Input Sanitization](./attack_surfaces/3__lack_of_built-in_input_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising because Beego framework itself does not automatically sanitize user inputs, requiring developers to implement sanitization manually within Beego application code.
*   **Beego Contribution:** Beego, by design, provides request handling and data binding mechanisms but deliberately avoids enforcing automatic input sanitization. This design choice places the responsibility squarely on Beego developers to implement proper sanitization within their controllers, models, and views. Failure to do so, especially within Beego applications, leads to vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A form field in a Beego application that accepts user comments. If these comments are displayed on another page using Beego templates without explicit HTML escaping in the template or controller, it directly leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the Beego application.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Command Injection, other injection vulnerabilities, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Input Validation in Beego Application Logic:**  Within Beego controllers and application logic, rigorously validate all user inputs received via `this.Ctx.Input`. Use whitelisting and reject invalid inputs.
    *   **Implement Output Encoding/Escaping in Beego Templates and Controllers:**  Consistently encode or escape user-provided data before displaying it in Beego templates or when constructing responses in controllers. Utilize context-aware escaping functions provided by Go's `html/template` package within Beego templates.

## Attack Surface: [4. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/4__server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into Beego's template engine (Go templates by default), potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Beego Contribution:** Beego, by default, uses Go's `html/template` package for rendering views. While Go templates are designed to be safer than some other engines, improper usage within Beego applications, particularly dynamic template construction or direct inclusion of user input into templates without careful escaping within Beego controllers, can still create SSTI risks.
*   **Example:**  A Beego application dynamically constructs a template string based on user input and then executes it using `template.Execute` within a Beego controller. An attacker could inject template directives into the user input to execute arbitrary Go code on the server, exploiting Beego's template rendering process.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Template Construction in Beego:**  Minimize or completely eliminate the dynamic construction of templates within Beego applications based on user input. Rely on pre-defined, static templates as much as possible.
    *   **Strict Output Encoding in Beego Templates:**  Enforce rigorous output encoding within Beego templates, especially when handling any user-provided data that is rendered in templates.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Beego Template Usage:** Conduct regular security audits specifically focused on Beego template usage patterns to proactively identify and remediate potential SSTI vulnerabilities within the application.

## Attack Surface: [5. Insecure Default Session Configuration](./attack_surfaces/5__insecure_default_session_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from deploying Beego applications with default session configurations that are not secure for production environments.
*   **Beego Contribution:** Beego provides built-in session management functionality. However, relying on default session configurations in Beego applications without understanding their security implications can lead to vulnerabilities. Default settings might not enforce secure session cookies or use secure session storage in production.
*   **Example:** Deploying a production Beego application using the default in-memory session storage. This makes session data volatile and unsuitable for clustered environments. More critically, default Beego session settings might not automatically set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies, making them vulnerable to client-side JavaScript access and transmission over unencrypted HTTP, respectively.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, session fixation, unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service (session exhaustion).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Session Storage Configuration in Beego:**  Configure Beego's session management to use persistent and secure storage mechanisms like databases (Redis, MySQL, PostgreSQL) instead of in-memory storage for production deployments. Configure this within Beego's `app.conf` or programmatically.
    *   **Secure Session Cookie Attributes Configuration in Beego:**  Explicitly configure Beego's session cookie settings to include `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags. Set these flags within Beego's session configuration to prevent client-side JavaScript access and ensure transmission only over HTTPS.
    *   **Session Timeout Configuration in Beego:**  Implement appropriate session timeouts within Beego's session configuration to limit the lifespan of sessions and reduce the window of opportunity for session hijacking.

## Attack Surface: [6. SQL Injection (via BeeORM or Raw SQL in Beego)](./attack_surfaces/6__sql_injection__via_beeorm_or_raw_sql_in_beego_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities by injecting malicious SQL code into database queries within Beego applications, leading to unauthorized database access or manipulation.
*   **Beego Contribution:** Beego applications can utilize BeeORM (Beego's ORM) or raw SQL for database interactions. While BeeORM is designed to help prevent SQL injection, improper usage of BeeORM or the use of raw SQL queries within Beego applications without proper parameterization can introduce significant SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Using string concatenation within a Beego controller to build SQL queries when using BeeORM's raw query functionality or when executing raw SQL queries directly using database drivers within a Beego application. This practice, instead of using parameterized queries, makes the Beego application vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, data deletion, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential for command execution on the database server (in some database configurations).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements (Always) in Beego Data Access:**  Mandate the use of parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions within Beego applications, whether using BeeORM or raw SQL.
    *   **ORM Best Practices with BeeORM in Beego:**  Strictly adhere to BeeORM best practices for query building and data access within Beego applications to minimize SQL injection risks. Avoid raw SQL queries if possible and leverage BeeORM's query builder.
    *   **Input Validation (Database Context) in Beego Controllers:**  Validate user inputs within Beego controllers that are intended to be used in database queries to ensure they conform to expected formats and types before incorporating them into database operations.

## Attack Surface: [7. Outdated Beego Version](./attack_surfaces/7__outdated_beego_version.md)

*   **Description:** Running Beego applications on outdated versions of the Beego framework that contain publicly known security vulnerabilities.
*   **Beego Contribution:**  Like any software framework, Beego may have security vulnerabilities discovered and patched in newer releases. Using an outdated Beego version in a deployed application directly exposes it to these known vulnerabilities, making it a Beego-specific risk.
*   **Example:**  A Beego version prior to a specific patch release might contain a known vulnerability in its routing or session handling component that allows for remote denial-of-service or other attacks. Running a Beego application on this outdated version makes it directly susceptible to exploits targeting this Beego-specific vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Exposure to known vulnerabilities, potential for exploitation by attackers using publicly available exploit information, application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Beego Framework:**  Establish a process for regularly updating the Beego framework and its dependencies to the latest stable versions for all Beego applications. This ensures that security patches and bug fixes are applied promptly.
    *   **Monitor Beego Security Advisories:**  Actively monitor Beego project's security advisories, release notes, and community channels to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities and recommended update schedules for Beego.
    *   **Dependency Management for Beego Applications:** Utilize Go's dependency management tools (like Go modules) to effectively track and manage Beego and its dependencies, making updates and security patching a more streamlined process for Beego projects.
