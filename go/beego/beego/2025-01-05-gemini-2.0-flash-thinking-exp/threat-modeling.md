# Threat Model Analysis for beego/beego

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Route Parameters](./threats/path_traversal_via_route_parameters.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate route parameters that are used to construct file paths (e.g., for serving static files or in custom file handling). By injecting characters like `../`, they can navigate outside the intended directories and access arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact:** Information disclosure by accessing sensitive files, potential for remote code execution if accessible files contain executable code or configuration data.

**Affected Beego Component:**  `beego.Controller`'s methods that handle file access based on route parameters, potentially interacting with `http.ServeFile`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid directly using route parameters to construct file paths.
*   Implement strict validation and sanitization of route parameters used for file access, blocking characters like `../`.
*   Utilize Beego's built-in static file serving with appropriate directory restrictions configured in the `conf/app.conf` file (`StaticDir`).
*   If custom file handling is necessary, use canonical path resolution to ensure the requested path stays within the allowed directory.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities via Data Binding](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_via_data_binding.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send unexpected request parameters that map to struct fields during Beego's data binding process. If the application doesn't explicitly define allowed fields or perform proper authorization checks, the attacker could modify unintended or sensitive fields.

**Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation by modifying user roles or permissions, unauthorized modification of application state.

**Affected Beego Component:** `beego.Controller`'s data binding functionality (e.g., `Ctx.Input.Bind`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly define which fields are allowed for data binding using struct tags (e.g., `form:"field_name"`) and avoid binding to sensitive fields directly.
*   Use data transfer objects (DTOs) or view models to represent the data that can be bound from requests, separating them from internal data structures.
*   Implement robust authorization checks before and after data binding to ensure the user has the right to modify the affected data.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious template code into user-controlled data that is then rendered by Beego's template engine. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data exfiltration.

**Affected Beego Component:** `beego.Template` module, specifically the template rendering functions when used with user-provided data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always escape user-provided data before rendering it in templates using Beego's built-in escaping mechanisms.
*   Avoid using raw or unsafe template rendering functions with user input.
*   If possible, use a templating engine with strong security features and auto-escaping enabled by default.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Storage Leading to Session Hijacking](./threats/insecure_session_storage_leading_to_session_hijacking.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intercept or access session data if it is stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text cookies). This allows them to hijack legitimate user sessions and gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, impersonation, and potential misuse of user privileges.

**Affected Beego Component:** `beego.Session` module and the configured session provider (e.g., cookie, file, memory).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use secure session storage mechanisms like database-backed sessions or encrypted cookies.
*   Configure strong session keys and rotate them regularly.
*   Set appropriate `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access and ensure transmission only over HTTPS.
*   Implement appropriate session timeouts and idle timeouts.

## Threat: [Predictable Session IDs Enabling Session Fixation/Hijacking](./threats/predictable_session_ids_enabling_session_fixationhijacking.md)

**Description:** If Beego's session ID generation is not sufficiently random, an attacker might be able to predict valid session IDs or influence the creation of session IDs (session fixation), allowing them to hijack user sessions.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Affected Beego Component:** `beego.Session` module and the session ID generation mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure Beego's session management is configured to use cryptographically secure random number generators for session ID creation.
*   Regenerate session IDs after successful login to prevent session fixation attacks.

## Threat: [Bypass of Built-in Security Features (e.g., CSRF) due to Misconfiguration](./threats/bypass_of_built-in_security_features__e_g___csrf__due_to_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit misconfigurations or improper implementation of Beego's built-in security features, such as CSRF protection. For example, failing to include the CSRF token in forms or AJAX requests.

**Impact:** Vulnerabilities that the built-in features are intended to prevent, such as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Affected Beego Component:**  Beego's middleware for security features (e.g., `beego.InsertFilter`), specifically the CSRF protection implementation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly understand and correctly implement Beego's security features as documented.
*   Ensure CSRF tokens are included in all relevant forms and AJAX requests.
*   Verify that the CSRF middleware is correctly configured and enabled.
*   Regularly review and test the effectiveness of these security features.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information due to Insecure Default Configurations](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_due_to_insecure_default_configurations.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit insecure default configurations in Beego, such as default secret keys or debug mode being enabled in production, to gain access to sensitive information or exploit vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential for remote code execution if debug mode is enabled, and other security vulnerabilities.

**Affected Beego Component:** Beego's configuration system (`conf/app.conf`) and the default values for various settings.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Review and adjust Beego's configuration settings in `conf/app.conf` for your specific environment.
*   Ensure debug mode (`RunMode = prod`) is disabled in production environments.
*   Change default secret keys (`sessionsecret`, `AdminName`, `AdminPass`) and other sensitive configuration values.
*   Disable features not required in production.
