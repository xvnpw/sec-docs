## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Critical Node: Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate URL structures and Beego's routing logic to access unintended resources or bypass security checks.
        * **Parameter Pollution:** Crafting URLs with conflicting parameters to confuse Beego's routing and potentially bypass validation or access controls.
        * **Route Hijacking/Overriding:** Defining malicious routes that shadow legitimate ones, allowing the attacker to intercept and handle requests meant for other parts of the application.
        * **Verb Tampering:** Using HTTP method override features to bypass access controls that rely on specific HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc.).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Critical Node & High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious data into application inputs, exploiting the lack of proper validation and sanitization in Beego applications.
        * **Lack of Built-in Input Validation/Sanitization:** Beego's lack of default input validation means developers must implement it. Failure to do so allows for:
            * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious JavaScript into web pages viewed by other users.
            * **SQL Injection (if applicable):** Injecting malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
        * **Vulnerabilities in Custom Input Processing Logic:**  Flaws in developer-written code that handles input can lead to:
            * **Buffer Overflows:** Providing more data than a buffer can hold, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
            * **Format String Bugs:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in functions that format strings, potentially leading to information disclosure or code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Engine Vulnerabilities (if used directly)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_engine_vulnerabilities__if_used_directly_.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Template Engine Vulnerabilities (if used directly)**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious code into template data, leveraging vulnerabilities in the template engine used by Beego.
        * **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** Injecting code that is executed directly on the server by the template engine, leading to remote code execution.
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Rendering:** Injecting malicious scripts that are rendered into the HTML output, affecting users viewing the page.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Session Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_session_management_vulnerabilities.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Session Management Vulnerabilities**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers target weaknesses in how Beego applications manage user sessions to gain unauthorized access.
        * **Insecure Session ID Generation:** If session IDs are predictable, attackers can guess or brute-force them to hijack user sessions.
        * **Session Fixation:** Forcing a known session ID onto a user, allowing the attacker to gain access once the user authenticates.
        * **Insecure Session Storage (if default is used):** If Beego's default session storage is insecure (e.g., stored in plaintext files), attackers with server access can steal session IDs.
        * **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) without Beego's built-in protection:** If Beego's CSRF protection is disabled or not implemented, attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit insecure configurations to gain access to sensitive information.
        * **Exposure of Configuration Files:** If configuration files containing sensitive data (database credentials, API keys) are publicly accessible, attackers can retrieve this information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware/Filter Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middlewarefilter_vulnerabilities.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Middleware/Filter Vulnerabilities**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in custom middleware implemented within the Beego application.
        * **Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware:** Flaws in developer-written middleware can lead to various security issues, including authentication bypasses or code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Upload Handling Vulnerabilities (if implemented)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_upload_handling_vulnerabilities__if_implemented_.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit File Upload Handling Vulnerabilities (if implemented)**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers upload malicious files to the server, exploiting weaknesses in how the Beego application handles file uploads.
        * **Unrestricted File Upload Types:** Allowing the upload of executable files (e.g., PHP, JSP) which can then be executed on the server, leading to remote code execution.
        * **Inadequate File Content Validation:** Failing to properly validate the content of uploaded files, allowing attackers to upload malicious files disguised as legitimate types, which can then exploit vulnerabilities in file processing libraries.
