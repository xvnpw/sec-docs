# Attack Surface Analysis for beego/beego

## Attack Surface: [I. ReDoS Vulnerabilities in Routing](./attack_surfaces/i__redos_vulnerabilities_in_routing.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft malicious URLs that cause Beego's regular expression-based router to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to denial of service.
*   **How Beego Contributes:** Beego's reliance on regular expressions for route definitions makes it susceptible to ReDoS if developers use complex or poorly written regex patterns.
*   **Example:** A route defined as `/api/users/{name:[a-zA-Z]+(?:[a-zA-Z]+)*}` could be attacked with a long string of 'a' characters, causing the regex engine to backtrack excessively.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion, potential server crashes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [II. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/ii__server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template variables that are then executed by Beego's template engine on the server.
*   **How Beego Contributes:** Beego's template engine (often the standard Go `html/template` or `text/template`) can execute arbitrary code if user-controlled input is directly embedded without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Example:** A template like `<h1>Hello {{.Username}}</h1>` is vulnerable if `.Username` comes directly from user input without escaping, allowing an attacker to inject `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` or more severe server-side code.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [III. ORM Injection (SQL Injection via Beego's ORM)](./attack_surfaces/iii__orm_injection__sql_injection_via_beego's_orm_.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate database queries generated by Beego's ORM to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially gaining unauthorized access to or modifying data.
*   **How Beego Contributes:** While Beego's ORM offers some protection, vulnerabilities can arise from using raw queries, dynamic query construction based on user input without proper sanitization, or insecure use of ORM features.
*   **Example:**  Constructing a query like `o.Raw("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "'").QueryRows(&users)` is vulnerable if `userInput` is not sanitized.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [IV. Insecure File Upload Handling](./attack_surfaces/iv__insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

**Description:** Attackers upload malicious files that can be executed by the server or used to compromise the system.
*   **How Beego Contributes:** Beego's file upload handling mechanisms, if not implemented carefully within the Beego application, can allow attackers to bypass restrictions on file types, sizes, and destination paths.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image through a Beego handler and then accesses it via a crafted URL, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, defacement, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [V. Insufficient CSRF Protection or Bypass](./attack_surfaces/v__insufficient_csrf_protection_or_bypass.md)

**Description:** Attackers can trick authenticated users into making unintended requests on the application, leading to unauthorized actions.
*   **How Beego Contributes:** While Beego provides built-in CSRF protection, improper implementation or weaknesses in the application's use of Beego's CSRF features can allow attackers to bypass it.
*   **Example:**  A form submission handled by a Beego controller lacks proper CSRF token validation, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious form on a different website that, when submitted by an authenticated user, performs an action on the Beego application.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of users, data manipulation, account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [VI. Session Fixation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/vi__session_fixation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers can trick users into using a known session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session after they log in.
*   **How Beego Contributes:** If the Beego application's session management (utilizing Beego's session handling features) doesn't regenerate session IDs upon successful login, it can be vulnerable to session fixation.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a user with a specific session ID. The user logs in to the Beego application, and the attacker can then use the same session ID to access the user's account.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
