## High and Critical Beego-Specific Threats

This table outlines high and critical security threats that directly involve the Beego framework.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Beego Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Debug Mode Information Disclosure** | An attacker accesses the application while Beego's debug mode is enabled in production. They can view detailed error messages, stack traces, and potentially configuration details exposed through the debug interface. | Exposure of sensitive application internals, potentially revealing vulnerabilities, database credentials, or API keys. This can aid further attacks. | `beego.RunMode` configuration, error handling middleware | **Critical** | **Ensure `beego.RunMode` is set to `prod` or `live` in production environments.** Implement custom error handling that logs detailed errors securely but provides generic messages to users. |
| **Configuration File Exposure** | An attacker gains unauthorized access to the application's configuration files (e.g., `conf/app.conf`). This could be through misconfigured server permissions, directory traversal vulnerabilities, or other means. | Direct exposure of sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, secret keys, and other application settings. | Configuration loading mechanism | **Critical** | **Secure configuration files with appropriate file system permissions (e.g., read-only for the application user).** Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files; use environment variables or a secrets management system. |
| **Session Fixation** | An attacker crafts a valid session ID and tricks a legitimate user into using that ID. When the user logs in, the attacker gains access to their account. This can happen if Beego's session IDs are predictable or not properly regenerated after login. | Account takeover, allowing the attacker to perform actions as the legitimate user. | `beego.Session` | **High** | **Ensure `SessionOn` is enabled and configure secure session settings like `SessionName`, `SessionProvider`, and `SessionSavePath`.** Use strong, unpredictable session IDs. **Regenerate session IDs after successful login.** Consider using HTTPOnly and Secure flags for session cookies. |
| **Unrestricted File Upload leading to Resource Exhaustion/Remote Code Execution** | An attacker uploads excessively large files or malicious files without proper validation using Beego's file upload functionality. This can lead to disk space exhaustion, denial of service, or even remote code execution if the uploaded files are processed insecurely. | Denial of service, potential remote code execution, data corruption. | `Ctx.Request.FormFile` function | **High** | **Implement strict file size limits and type validation.** Sanitize file names. Store uploaded files in a secure location outside the web root. Consider using a dedicated storage service. Scan uploaded files for malware. |
| **Slowloris Attack on Default Server** | An attacker exploits Beego's default HTTP server's potential vulnerability to slowloris attacks by sending slow, partial HTTP requests to keep connections open and exhaust server resources. | Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. | Default HTTP server | **Medium** (While the impact is high, the direct Beego involvement can be mitigated by using a reverse proxy) | **In production environments, use a more robust and production-ready web server like Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy in front of the Beego application.** Configure appropriate timeouts and connection limits on the reverse proxy. |
| **ReDoS in Route Definitions** | An attacker crafts a URL that matches a route defined with a poorly written regular expression in Beego's routing configuration. This can cause the regular expression engine to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. | Denial of service, potentially crashing the application or making it unresponsive. | Routing mechanism | **Medium** (While the impact can be high, the severity depends on the complexity of the regex) | **Carefully review and test regular expressions used in route definitions.** Avoid overly complex or nested expressions. Consider using more specific route patterns where possible. Implement timeouts for regex matching if the framework allows. |
| **Missing or Improper CSRF Protection** | An attacker crafts a malicious website or email that tricks a logged-in user into making unintended requests on the Beego application, potentially performing actions without their knowledge. This is due to the lack of or improper implementation of Beego's CSRF protection mechanisms. | Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of a legitimate user, such as changing passwords, transferring funds, or making purchases. | CSRF protection mechanisms (`beego.EnableCsrf`, `{{.xsrfdata}}`) | **High** | **Enable Beego's built-in CSRF protection by setting `EnableCsrf` to `true` in the configuration.** Include the CSRF token in forms using the `{{.xsrfdata}}` template function. Validate the CSRF token on all state-changing requests. |
| **Mass Assignment Vulnerability via ORM** | An attacker sends unexpected or malicious data in request parameters that are directly bound to database models using Beego's ORM without proper whitelisting. This can allow them to modify unintended fields in the database. | Data corruption, privilege escalation, or other unintended consequences due to unauthorized modification of database records. | Beego's ORM (`orm` package) | **Medium** (Can be high depending on the sensitivity of the modifiable data) | **Use whitelisting techniques when binding request data to models.** Define specific fields that are allowed to be updated. Avoid directly binding all request parameters. Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to control data input. |
