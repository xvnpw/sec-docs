## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal 1: Compromise CA](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_1_compromise_ca.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most direct and impactful attack.  If the attacker gains control of the Certificate Authority, they can issue certificates for any identity, effectively bypassing all trust established by the CA.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise.  The attacker can impersonate any user or service, decrypt traffic, and sign malicious code.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (General):**
        *   Implement strict physical and logical access controls to the CA server.
        *   Use a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to protect the CA private key.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative access.
        *   Regularly audit and monitor CA activity.
        *   Implement robust logging and alerting.
        *   Maintain a minimal and hardened operating system on the CA server.
        *   Regularly apply security patches.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Steal CA Key](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_steal_ca_key.md)

*   **Description:**  Direct theft of the CA's private key, granting the attacker full control over certificate issuance. This is a *critical node* because it's the single most valuable target.
        *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (combining sub-attack likelihoods).
        *   **Effort:** Varies (Low to High, depending on the sub-attack).
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Expert.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Very Hard.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Poor Key Storage Practices](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_poor_key_storage_practices.md)

*   **Description:** The CA private key is stored insecurely (e.g., plaintext file, weak encryption, easily guessable password).
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Unfortunately common).
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Total CA compromise).
            *   **Effort:** Low (If keys are poorly protected, they are easy to steal).
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Basic hacking skills needed).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Unless file access auditing is in place and actively monitored).
            *   **Mitigation:** Use an HSM.  If an HSM is not feasible, use strong encryption with a robust key management system.  Never store keys in source code or configuration files.  Regularly audit key storage practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Compromise Host via Other Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_compromise_host_via_other_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the operating system, web server, or other software running on the CA host to gain root access and steal the key.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (Systems are often vulnerable).
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Total CA compromise).
            *   **Effort:** Medium (Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often readily available).
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced (Requires knowledge of exploit development or use of existing exploits).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Intrusion detection systems *might* detect the exploit, but sophisticated attackers can evade detection).
            *   **Mitigation:**  Keep the CA server fully patched.  Use a minimal, hardened operating system.  Implement a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) and network intrusion detection system (NIDS).  Regularly perform vulnerability scans and penetration testing.  Employ least privilege principles.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit CA](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_ca.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the CA setup, excluding direct key theft.
        * **Impact:** High to Very High (depending on the specific exploit).
        * **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on configuration and patching).
        * **Effort:** Low to High (depending on the vulnerability).
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Expert.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Misconfigured Permissions on CA Host](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_misconfigured_permissions_on_ca_host.md)

*   **Description:**  Weak file system permissions or overly permissive access controls allow unauthorized access to CA configuration or key material (even if the key itself is in an HSM, configuration files might allow bypassing it).
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common configuration error).
            *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to CA compromise or unauthorized certificate issuance).
            *   **Effort:** Low (Exploiting misconfigurations is often straightforward).
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires auditing of file permissions and access logs).
            *   **Mitigation:**  Implement the principle of least privilege.  Regularly audit file and directory permissions.  Use file integrity monitoring (FIM).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 Weak Authentication to CA Management Interface](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_weak_authentication_to_ca_management_interface.md)

*   **Description:**  The CA management interface (if any) is protected by weak passwords, lacks MFA, or has other authentication vulnerabilities.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (Weak passwords and lack of MFA are common).
            *   **Impact:** High (Full control over CA operations).
            *   **Effort:** Low (Brute-force attacks or password guessing).
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Failed login attempts can be logged, but successful attacks might be harder to detect).
            *   **Mitigation:**  Enforce strong password policies.  Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative access.  Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.4 Insider Threat (Malicious Admin)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_4_insider_threat__malicious_admin_.md)

*   **Description:**  An authorized administrator abuses their privileges to compromise the CA.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (But potentially very high impact).
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete system compromise).
            *   **Effort:** Low (Administrator already has access).
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Depends on the administrator's technical skills).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (Insider threats are notoriously difficult to detect).
            *   **Mitigation:**  Implement strong access controls and auditing.  Require multiple administrators to approve critical actions (e.g., issuing a new CA certificate, changing key configuration).  Implement separation of duties.  Conduct thorough background checks.  Monitor administrator activity for anomalies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal 3: Manipulate Existing Certificates](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_3_manipulate_existing_certificates.md)

*   **Description:**  Attacker attempts to modify or misuse certificates that have already been issued.
    *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to impersonation, unauthorized access, and data breaches).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (General):**
        *   Implement strong certificate revocation mechanisms (CRL, OCSP).
        *   Monitor certificate usage for anomalies.
        *   Protect certificate storage locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Certificate Modification](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_certificate_modification.md)

*   **Description:**  Directly altering the contents of a certificate after it has been issued. This is difficult due to digital signatures, but possible if the storage is compromised.
        *   **Impact:** High (Allows impersonation of the certificate holder).
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Due to cryptographic protections).
        *   **Effort:** High (Requires bypassing cryptographic protections).
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (If integrity checks are in place).

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1 Compromise Certificate Storage](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_compromise_certificate_storage.md)

*   **Description:**  Gaining unauthorized access to the location where certificates are stored (e.g., database, file system, key store) and modifying or stealing them. This is a *critical node* because it's a central point of failure.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the security of the storage location).
            *   **Impact:** High (Allows for certificate theft and potential modification).
            *   **Effort:** Medium (Depends on the security of the storage location).
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring of access to certificate storage and potentially file integrity monitoring).
            *   **Mitigation:**  Encrypt certificates at rest.  Implement strong access controls on the storage location.  Use a database with robust security features.  Regularly audit access logs.  Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) if certificates are stored on the file system.
