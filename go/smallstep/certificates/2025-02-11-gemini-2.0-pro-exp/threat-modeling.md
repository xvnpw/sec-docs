# Threat Model Analysis for smallstep/certificates

## Threat: [CA Private Key Compromise](./threats/ca_private_key_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** CA Private Key Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the root or intermediate CA's private key.  This allows the attacker to sign arbitrary *certificates*, effectively impersonating any entity within the PKI and completely undermining trust.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the PKI. *All certificates* issued by the compromised CA (or its subordinates) are untrustworthy. The attacker can perform MITM attacks using *fraudulent certificates*, issue *certificates* for phishing, and bypass any security controls relying on *certificate-based authentication*.
    *   **Affected Component:** CA private key storage (HSM, KMS, file system). The `step-ca` server itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a robust Key Management System (KMS).
        *   Implement strict multi-factor authentication and access control.
        *   Regularly audit access logs and key usage.
        *   Consider an offline root CA with an online intermediate CA.
        *   Implement key ceremony procedures.
        *   Physically secure the HSM or server.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Certificate Issuance](./threats/unauthorized_certificate_issuance.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Certificate Issuance
    *   **Description:** An attacker, without compromising the CA private key, gains unauthorized access to issue *certificates*. This could be due to weak authentication, misconfigured provisioners, or a vulnerability, allowing them to create *certificates* for unauthorized entities.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can issue *certificates* for unauthorized services or users, leading to MITM attacks using these *certificates*, phishing, or bypassing access controls that rely on *valid certificates*. The PKI is partially compromised.
    *   **Affected Component:** `step-ca` server API, provisioner configuration, authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication) for the `step-ca` API and CLI.
        *   Use the principle of least privilege for provisioners.
        *   Regularly audit provisioner configurations and access logs.
        *   Implement rate limiting on *certificate issuance*.
        *   Use short-lived *certificates* and automate renewal.
        *   Monitor Certificate Transparency (CT) logs.

## Threat: [Revocation Information Tampering (OCSP/CRL)](./threats/revocation_information_tampering__ocspcrl_.md)

*   **Threat:** Revocation Information Tampering (OCSP/CRL)
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and modifies OCSP responses or CRLs to make a *revoked certificate* appear valid. This allows the continued use of a *compromised certificate*.
    *   **Impact:** A *revoked certificate* continues to be accepted, allowing an attacker to impersonate a legitimate service or user even after their *certificate* should have been invalidated. This undermines the revocation mechanism.
    *   **Affected Component:** OCSP responder, CRL distribution point, client-side OCSP/CRL validation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure OCSP responses and CRLs are digitally signed, and clients validate these signatures.
        *   Use OCSP stapling.
        *   Configure short lifetimes for OCSP responses and CRLs.
        *   Use a highly available and reliable infrastructure for OCSP and CRL distribution.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for OCSP/CRL availability.
        *   Protect the OCSP responder and CRL distribution point from DDoS.

## Threat: [Provisioner Hijacking](./threats/provisioner_hijacking.md)

* **Threat:** Provisioner Hijacking
    * **Description:** An attacker gains control of a provisioner, allowing them to issue *certificates* with elevated privileges or bypass restrictions. This enables the creation of *unauthorized certificates*.
    * **Impact:** The attacker can issue *unauthorized certificates*, potentially with broader scope or longer lifetimes. This leads to MITM attacks using these *certificates*, impersonation, and unauthorized access.
    * **Affected Component:** Provisioner configuration and authentication, `step-ca` server's provisioner management.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unique credentials for each provisioner.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication for provisioner access.
        *   Regularly rotate provisioner credentials.
        *   Securely store provisioner secrets.
        *   Monitor provisioner activity.
        *   Use the principle of least privilege.
        *   Secure the system hosting the provisioner.
