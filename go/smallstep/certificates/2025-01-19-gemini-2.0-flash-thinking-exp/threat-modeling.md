# Threat Model Analysis for smallstep/certificates

## Threat: [Stolen CA Private Key](./threats/stolen_ca_private_key.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the private key of the Certificate Authority managed by `step ca`. This could happen through exploiting vulnerabilities in the key storage mechanism used by `step ca`, or through compromising the server where `step ca` is running. The attacker can then use this key to sign arbitrary certificates that will be trusted by systems relying on this CA.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the trust infrastructure. The attacker can impersonate any service or user, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, and potentially gain access to sensitive data or systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** `step ca` (specifically the key storage and management aspects).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store the CA private key in a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a secure key management system integrated with `step ca`.
        *   Implement strict access control policies for the `step ca` server and any system or personnel with access to the key material.
        *   Consider offline CA setups where the private key is only used for signing and is kept disconnected from networks, with `step ca` configured accordingly.
        *   Implement multi-person authorization for critical CA operations within `step ca`.
        *   Regularly audit access logs and security configurations related to `step ca`.

## Threat: [Exploitation of `step ca` Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of__step_ca__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits security vulnerabilities within the `step ca` software itself. This could involve remote code execution, privilege escalation, or denial-of-service attacks against the CA.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, the attacker could gain control of the `step ca` server, potentially leading to the theft of the CA private key, unauthorized certificate issuance, or disruption of certificate services.
    *   **Affected Component:** `step ca` (the core binary and its dependencies).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `step ca` updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to `smallstep/certificates`.
        *   Follow secure deployment practices for the `step ca` server, including network segmentation and minimal necessary services.
        *   Regularly scan the `step ca` server for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to `step ca` Management Interface](./threats/unauthorized_access_to__step_ca__management_interface.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `step ca` management interface (e.g., through exposed ports, weak authentication, or compromised credentials). This interface allows for the management of certificates, policies, and the CA itself.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker could issue unauthorized certificates, revoke valid certificates causing service disruption, or modify CA policies to weaken security.
    *   **Affected Component:** `step ca` (the administrative interface, potentially the HTTP server).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the `step ca` management interface (e.g., mutual TLS, strong passwords, multi-factor authentication).
        *   Restrict network access to the management interface to authorized networks or IP addresses.
        *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions for the management interface within `step ca`.

## Threat: [Abuse of ACME Protocol for Unauthorized Certificate Issuance](./threats/abuse_of_acme_protocol_for_unauthorized_certificate_issuance.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses or misconfigurations in the ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) implementation within `step ca` to obtain certificates for domains they do not control. This could involve bypassing domain ownership validation challenges implemented by `step ca`.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can obtain valid certificates for legitimate domains, enabling them to perform phishing attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, or impersonate services.
    *   **Affected Component:** `step ca` (specifically the ACME server implementation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure and secure the ACME challenge mechanisms (e.g., HTTP-01, DNS-01) within `step ca`.
        *   Implement rate limiting and other safeguards within `step ca` to prevent abuse of the ACME endpoint.
        *   Regularly review issued certificates for any anomalies or unauthorized issuances through `step ca`'s monitoring capabilities.
        *   Ensure proper validation of domain ownership during the ACME challenge process configured in `step ca`.

## Threat: [Failure to Revoke Compromised Certificates](./threats/failure_to_revoke_compromised_certificates.md)

*   **Description:** When a certificate issued by `step ca` is compromised (e.g., the private key is leaked), there is a failure to promptly revoke the certificate using `step ca`.
    *   **Impact:** The compromised certificate remains valid and can be used by attackers for malicious purposes until its natural expiration.
    *   **Affected Component:** `step ca` (the revocation functionality).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Establish clear procedures for reporting and revoking compromised certificates using `step ca`.
        *   Implement automated mechanisms within `step ca` for revoking certificates when a compromise is detected.
        *   Ensure that relying parties are configured to regularly check certificate revocation status (e.g., using CRLs or OCSP served by `step ca`).

## Threat: [Ineffective Certificate Revocation Mechanisms](./threats/ineffective_certificate_revocation_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:** The mechanisms used by `step ca` for certificate revocation (e.g., Certificate Revocation Lists - CRLs, Online Certificate Status Protocol - OCSP) are not properly configured or implemented, making it difficult for relying parties to determine if a certificate has been revoked.
    *   **Impact:** Relying parties may continue to trust compromised certificates issued by `step ca`, even after they have been revoked.
    *   **Affected Component:** `step ca` (the CRL and OCSP server implementations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Properly configure and maintain CRL distribution points and OCSP responders within `step ca`.
        *   Implement OCSP stapling in `step ca` to improve the efficiency and reliability of revocation checks.
        *   Ensure that relying parties are configured to correctly check certificate revocation status against `step ca`'s revocation endpoints.
