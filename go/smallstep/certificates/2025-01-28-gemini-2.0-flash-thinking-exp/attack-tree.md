## Attack Tree Path: [1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise CA Private Key [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1___high-risk_path__compromise_ca_private_key__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] File System Access on CA Server [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Weak File Permissions [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Attacker exploits incorrectly configured file permissions on the CA server to directly access and steal the CA private key file.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insider Threat [CRITICAL NODE]:** A malicious insider with legitimate access to the CA server abuses their privileges to steal the CA private key.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Backup/Storage Compromise [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Backups [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attacker gains access to insecurely stored backups of the CA private key, which are not properly encrypted or access-controlled.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Software Vulnerabilities in `step-ca` [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Known Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attacker exploits publicly known vulnerabilities in specific versions of the `step-ca` software to gain unauthorized access and potentially extract the CA private key.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Authentication/Authorization Bypass [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attacker bypasses authentication or authorization mechanisms in the `step-ca` API to access key management functions and potentially retrieve the CA private key.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Social Engineering/Phishing CA Admins [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attacker uses social engineering or phishing techniques to trick CA administrators into revealing credentials or performing actions that directly compromise the CA private key.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Endpoint Compromise (Server/Client)](./attack_tree_paths/2___high-risk_path__endpoint_compromise__serverclient_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Malware Infection:** Malware on a server or client system steals private keys associated with issued certificates.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Weak Access Controls on Certificate Storage [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3___high-risk_path__weak_access_controls_on_certificate_storage__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Certificates and their private keys are stored on servers or clients with weak file permissions or access controls, allowing unauthorized users or processes to access and steal them.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Weak Certificate Generation/Storage by Application](./attack_tree_paths/4___high-risk_path__weak_certificate_generationstorage_by_application.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Storage of Certificates/Keys [CRITICAL NODE]:** The application itself stores issued certificates and their private keys insecurely, such as in plaintext in databases, logs, or easily accessible files.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Certificate Validation Weaknesses in Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5___high-risk_path__exploit_certificate_validation_weaknesses_in_application__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Bypass Certificate Validation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Configuration Errors [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Disabled Certificate Validation [CRITICAL NODE]:** Application is misconfigured to completely disable certificate validation, allowing any certificate (even invalid or rogue ones) to be accepted.
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Permissive Validation Settings [CRITICAL NODE]:** Application is configured with overly permissive validation settings, such as ignoring certificate errors or not performing proper chain verification.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Code Logic Errors [CRITICAL NODE]:** Bugs in the application's code lead to incorrect or bypassed certificate validation logic, allowing invalid or rogue certificates to be accepted.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Exploiting Validation Gaps) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Lack of Certificate Pinning [CRITICAL NODE]:** Application does not implement certificate pinning, making it vulnerable to MitM attacks where an attacker can present a rogue certificate and bypass validation.
