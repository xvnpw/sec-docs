# Threat Model Analysis for smallstep/certificates

## Threat: [Root CA Private Key Compromise](./threats/root_ca_private_key_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the private key of the root Certificate Authority managed by `step`. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in the server hosting the CA, social engineering, or insider threats. The attacker can then use this key to issue valid certificates for any domain or identity.

**Impact:** Catastrophic. Complete loss of trust in the entire certificate infrastructure. Attackers can impersonate any service or user, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, and decrypt communications.

**Affected Component:** `step` CA Server (specifically key storage).

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store the root CA private key in a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
*   Implement strict access controls and monitoring for the CA server.
*   Employ multi-factor authentication for access to the CA server.
*   Regularly audit access logs and security configurations of the CA server.
*   Consider offline root CA for increased security.

## Threat: [Intermediate CA Private Key Compromise](./threats/intermediate_ca_private_key_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the private key of an intermediate Certificate Authority managed by `step`. This could occur through similar methods as root CA compromise, but potentially with less stringent security measures in place for intermediate CAs. The attacker can then issue valid certificates within the scope of that intermediate CA.

**Impact:** Significant. Allows targeted impersonation of services or users within the intermediate CA's domain. Enables man-in-the-middle attacks for those specific entities.

**Affected Component:** `step` CA Server (specifically key storage for the intermediate CA).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store intermediate CA private keys in HSMs or secure key management systems.
*   Implement strong access controls and monitoring for intermediate CA servers.
*   Regularly rotate intermediate CA keys.
*   Enforce strict certificate issuance policies and approvals for the intermediate CA.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Certificate Issuance via ACME](./threats/unauthorized_certificate_issuance_via_acme.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the `step` ACME server to obtain certificates for domains they do not control. This could involve bypassing domain ownership validation or exploiting flaws in the ACME protocol implementation.

**Impact:** High. Allows attackers to impersonate legitimate websites or services, potentially leading to phishing attacks or data breaches.

**Affected Component:** `step` ACME Server.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the ACME server is properly configured with strong domain validation methods.
*   Regularly update the `step` ACME server to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement rate limiting and abuse detection mechanisms on the ACME server.
*   Monitor certificate issuance requests for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to `step` CLI](./threats/unauthorized_access_to__step__cli.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `step` command-line interface (CLI) with sufficient privileges. This could be through compromised credentials, stolen API keys, or exploiting vulnerabilities in systems where the CLI is used. With access, they could issue, revoke, or manage certificates.

**Impact:** Significant. Allows for arbitrary certificate management actions, potentially leading to service disruption, impersonation, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `step` CLI.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the `step` CLI.
*   Use short-lived API keys or tokens for CLI access.
*   Restrict CLI access to authorized personnel and systems.
*   Audit CLI usage and activity.

## Threat: [Compromise of Provisioner Credentials](./threats/compromise_of_provisioner_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the credentials (e.g., passwords, API keys) used by a provisioner configured in `step`. This could be through phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in systems where provisioner credentials are stored or used.

**Impact:** High. Allows attackers to issue certificates using the compromised provisioner, potentially bypassing intended security controls and impersonating users or services associated with that provisioner.

**Affected Component:** `step` CA Server (Provisioner module).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use strong, unique passwords for provisioners.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication for provisioner authentication.
*   Securely store and manage provisioner credentials using secrets management solutions.
*   Regularly rotate provisioner credentials.
