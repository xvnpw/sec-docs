## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Certificate Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_certificate_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success here means the attacker has gained unauthorized access or control over the application by exploiting certificate-related weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Certificate Issuance [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_certificate_issuance__high_risk_.md)

This path focuses on gaining unauthorized certificates, which can then be used for malicious purposes.
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in CA Server [CRITICAL NODE]:** Targeting the Certificate Authority directly is a high-risk path as it can lead to widespread compromise.
        * **Exploit Known CVEs in `step-ca` -> Gain Remote Code Execution on CA Server [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities to gain control of the CA server is a critical risk. This allows the attacker to issue arbitrary certificates, effectively undermining the entire trust infrastructure.
    * **Compromise CA Administrator Credentials [HIGH RISK]:** Gaining control of administrator accounts allows attackers to bypass normal certificate issuance controls.
        * **Phishing CA Administrator -> Obtain Certificate with Elevated Privileges [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]:**  Tricking an administrator into revealing their credentials can grant the attacker the ability to issue certificates with high privileges, leading to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Compromise Existing Certificates [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__compromise_existing_certificates__high_risk_.md)

This path focuses on obtaining legitimate certificates that can be misused.
    * **Steal Private Key [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]:** Obtaining the private key associated with a certificate is a critical risk, as it allows the attacker to impersonate the legitimate entity.
        * **Compromise Certificate Storage on Application Server [HIGH RISK] -> Gain Unauthorized Access to Server Filesystem -> Obtain Private Key [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations on the application server to access and steal the stored private key is a common and high-risk attack vector.
        * **Compromise Certificate Storage on CA Server [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK] -> Obtain Private Keys [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Compromising the storage on the CA server is a critical risk, as it can expose the private keys for all certificates issued by that CA.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Certificate Usage [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_certificate_usage__high_risk_.md)

This path focuses on misusing already obtained certificates (either legitimately or illegitimately).
    * **Man-in-the-Middle Attack using Stolen Certificate [HIGH RISK]:** Using a stolen certificate, an attacker can intercept and potentially modify communication between parties, impersonating one or both ends of the connection.
    * **Impersonate Application with Stolen Certificate [HIGH RISK]:**  An attacker possessing a valid certificate for the application can directly impersonate it to users or other services, gaining unauthorized access or performing malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Certificate Management Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_certificate_management_weaknesses.md)

This path highlights weaknesses in how certificates are managed, creating opportunities for attackers.
    * **Insecure Certificate Storage Practices [HIGH RISK CONTRIBUTOR] -> Easy Access to Private Keys by Attackers [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]:**  Storing certificates and private keys insecurely (e.g., without encryption, with weak permissions) makes them easily accessible to attackers who have gained some level of system access. This is a critical vulnerability as it directly leads to key compromise.
