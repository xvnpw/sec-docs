### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving urfave/cli

* **Threat:** Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Argument Bomb)
    * **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large number of arguments or excessively long argument values directly to the command-line interface. `urfave/cli` allocates memory to store these arguments during the parsing phase. This can lead to excessive memory consumption *within the `urfave/cli` library itself*, potentially crashing the application before it even reaches the application's core logic.
    * **Impact:** Application crash, temporary unavailability of the service due to resource exhaustion within the `urfave/cli` parsing stage.
    * **Affected urfave/cli Component:** `cli.App.Run` (specifically the argument parsing logic), internal data structures used by `urfave/cli` to store arguments and flags.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** While the primary responsibility lies with the application to limit input, being aware of this potential within `urfave/cli` is important. Consider if extremely large argument lists are a legitimate use case for your application.
        * **Operating System/Environment:** Implement system-level resource limits (e.g., memory limits per process) that can mitigate the impact of such attacks, even if the application doesn't explicitly handle them.
