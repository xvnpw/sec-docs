## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving `docker/cli`

This table lists high and critical threats that directly involve the `docker/cli` library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected `docker/cli` Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Docker Binary Substitution** | An attacker replaces the legitimate `docker` binary on the host system. The application, when invoking `docker` commands via the `docker/cli` library, unknowingly executes the malicious binary. This can be done through exploiting OS vulnerabilities, social engineering, or gaining unauthorized access. | Complete compromise of the host system, data theft, application malfunction, deployment of malware. |  Underlying OS interaction (the `docker/cli` library relies on the system's `docker` executable). | **Critical** | * **Path Hardening:** Ensure the `PATH` environment variable is tightly controlled and doesn't include untrusted directories. * **Binary Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the `docker` binary (e.g., checksum verification) before execution. * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of a compromise. * **Host OS Security:** Implement robust security measures on the host operating system to prevent unauthorized file modifications. |
| **Command Injection via Unsanitized Input** | An attacker provides malicious input that is used to construct Docker CLI commands within the application. The application, using the `docker/cli` library's command construction mechanisms (or lack thereof), fails to properly sanitize this input, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary commands. | Container escape, execution of arbitrary commands on the host, data manipulation within containers, denial of service. | `pkg/command` (functions for building and executing commands), potentially custom command construction logic within the application using the library's building blocks. | **High** | * **Avoid String Concatenation:**  Use the `docker/cli` library's functions and parameters to construct commands instead of directly concatenating strings. * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input or external data used in constructing Docker commands. Use allow-lists rather than block-lists where possible. * **Parameterization:** If direct command construction is unavoidable, use parameterization techniques to prevent injection. |
| **Manipulation of Docker Context** | An attacker gains access to the Docker context used by the application (e.g., through compromised credentials or file system access). They can then modify the context to point to malicious registries, alter build configurations, or change other settings that affect subsequent `docker` commands executed by the application. | Pulling malicious images, building compromised containers, potential supply chain attacks, unauthorized access to resources. | `client.NewClientWithOpts` (for creating clients with specific contexts), `context` package (for managing context information). | **High** | * **Secure Docker Context Storage:** Protect the Docker context files and credentials with appropriate permissions. Avoid storing sensitive information directly in context files if possible. * **Regularly Rotate Credentials:** If the application uses specific credentials for Docker access, rotate them regularly. * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Use a dedicated Docker context with minimal necessary permissions for the application. * **Monitor Context Changes:** Implement monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications to the Docker context. |
| **Information Disclosure via Sensitive Data in Commands** | The application includes sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, secrets) directly within Docker CLI commands (e.g., environment variables passed to `docker run`). An attacker observing the process or logs could potentially extract this information. | Exposure of sensitive credentials, potential for unauthorized access to external services, compromise of other systems. | `pkg/command` (how environment variables and other parameters are passed to the `docker` executable). | **High** | * **Avoid Embedding Secrets in Commands:**  Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) and mount them into containers or pass them securely. * **Environment Variable Filtering:**  Carefully review and filter environment variables passed to containers. * **Audit Logging with Masking:**  Log Docker CLI commands executed by the application, but mask sensitive information in the logs. |
| **Elevation of Privilege via Privileged Containers** | The application uses the `--privileged` flag when running containers via the `docker/cli` library. If an attacker can influence the application to launch a privileged container, and a vulnerability exists within that container, they could potentially gain root access on the host system. | Complete compromise of the host system, data theft, application malfunction. | `pkg/command` (for executing `docker run` with the `--privileged` flag). | **High** | * **Avoid Privileged Containers:**  Generally, avoid using the `--privileged` flag. Instead, grant only the necessary capabilities using the `--cap-add` and `--cap-drop` flags. * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run containers with the minimal necessary privileges. * **Strict Control over Container Configuration:**  Implement strict controls over how container configurations are defined and prevent unauthorized modifications. |
| **Elevation of Privilege via Docker Socket Exposure** | The application mounts the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) into a container via the `docker/cli` library. This grants the container full control over the Docker daemon, allowing for container escape and host compromise. | Complete compromise of the host system, data theft, application malfunction. | `pkg/command` (for executing `docker run` with volume mounts, specifically the Docker socket). | **Critical** | * **Never Mount the Docker Socket:**  Avoid mounting the Docker socket into containers unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. Explore alternative solutions like using a dedicated Docker API client within the container with restricted permissions. |
