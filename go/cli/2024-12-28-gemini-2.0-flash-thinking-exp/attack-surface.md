*   **Attack Surface:** Command Injection
    *   **Description:**  The application uses user-provided command-line arguments to construct and execute shell commands.
    *   **How CLI Contributes:** `urfave/cli` provides the mechanism to receive arbitrary string input from the command line through flags and arguments, which can then be misused in shell commands.
    *   **Example:** An application has a flag `--file` and uses its value in `os/exec.Command("cat", c.String("file"))`. A malicious user could provide `--file "; rm -rf /"` leading to arbitrary command execution.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the system where the application is running, including data loss, unauthorized access, and system disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid using shell commands with user-provided input. If necessary, use parameterized commands or libraries that offer safer ways to interact with the operating system. Sanitize and validate all user input rigorously. Use allow-lists for expected input values.

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal
    *   **Description:** The application uses user-provided command-line arguments as file paths without proper validation, allowing access to files outside the intended directory.
    *   **How CLI Contributes:** `urfave/cli` allows users to specify file paths as values for flags or positional arguments, which the application might then use to access files.
    *   **Example:** An application has a flag `--config` and uses its value to open a configuration file. A malicious user could provide `--config ../../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive system files.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potential modification of critical files, and in some cases, arbitrary code execution if the accessed file is interpreted as code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Always sanitize and validate file paths provided by users. Use functions like `filepath.Clean` to normalize paths and check if they fall within the expected directory. Use allow-lists for allowed file paths or patterns.

*   **Attack Surface:** Environment Variable Manipulation (Flag Binding)
    *   **Description:** `urfave/cli` allows binding flags to environment variables. Attackers with control over the environment can manipulate these variables to alter the application's behavior.
    *   **How CLI Contributes:** The `EnvVar` option in `urfave/cli` directly links command-line flags to environment variables, making the application's configuration susceptible to environment manipulation.
    *   **Example:** An application has a flag `--api-key` bound to the environment variable `API_KEY`. An attacker could set `API_KEY` to a malicious value, potentially gaining unauthorized access or disrupting the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the flag's purpose, this could lead to security misconfigurations, unauthorized access, or unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Be cautious about binding sensitive flags to environment variables. Clearly document which flags are bound to environment variables. Consider using a more robust configuration management system. Validate environment variable values before using them.
