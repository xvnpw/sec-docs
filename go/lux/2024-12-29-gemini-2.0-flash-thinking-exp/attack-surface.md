*   **Attack Surface: Malicious URL Handling**
    *   Description: The application using `lux` accepts a URL as input to download a video. A malicious actor could provide a URL that, when processed by `lux`, leads to unintended consequences.
    *   How lux Contributes: `lux` is responsible for fetching the content from the provided URL. If the URL points to a malicious server or content, `lux` will interact with it.
    *   Example: A user provides a URL that redirects to a server hosting malware, which `lux` might inadvertently download or trigger a vulnerability on the malicious server.
    *   Impact:
        *   Compromise of the server running the application using `lux`.
        *   Exposure of the application to vulnerabilities on the malicious server.
        *   Potential download of malicious content onto the server.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for URLs before passing them to `lux`.
            *   Consider using a URL reputation service to check the safety of URLs before processing.
            *   Run the `lux` process in a sandboxed environment with limited permissions.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Be cautious about the source of URLs provided for download.
            *   Avoid downloading content from untrusted sources.

*   **Attack Surface: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
    *   Description: If the application allows users to specify the download URL, an attacker could provide a URL pointing to internal network resources or other unintended targets.
    *   How lux Contributes: `lux` will make a network request to the provided URL, regardless of whether it's internal or external.
    *   Example: An attacker provides a URL like `http://localhost:6379/` (if Redis is running locally) to interact with internal services, potentially reading sensitive data or executing commands.
    *   Impact:
        *   Exposure of internal services and data.
        *   Potential for unauthorized actions on internal systems.
        *   Bypassing firewall restrictions.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement a strict allow-list of allowed URL schemes and domains for download.
            *   Prevent users from directly specifying arbitrary URLs. Instead, offer a curated list or controlled input mechanisms.
            *   Sanitize and validate URLs to prevent manipulation.
            *   Run the `lux` process in a network segment with limited access to internal resources.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Understand the risks of providing arbitrary URLs to the application.

*   **Attack Surface: Path Traversal via Filename or Download Location**
    *   Description: If the downloaded filename or the destination directory is not properly sanitized, an attacker might be able to manipulate these values to write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system.
    *   How lux Contributes: `lux` is responsible for writing the downloaded file to the specified location with the given filename.
    *   Example: An attacker crafts a URL or manipulates configuration to cause `lux` to save a file with a name like `../../../../etc/cron.d/malicious_job`, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution.
    *   Impact:
        *   Overwriting critical system files.
        *   Introduction of malicious files into sensitive directories.
        *   Potential for arbitrary command execution.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Enforce a strict, predefined download directory and prevent users from specifying arbitrary paths.
            *   Sanitize filenames to remove or replace potentially dangerous characters (e.g., `..`, `/`, `\`).
            *   Use secure file handling APIs that prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Avoid using applications that allow specifying arbitrary download locations or filenames when using `lux`.

*   **Attack Surface: Filename Injection Leading to Code Execution**
    *   Description: The downloaded filename might be derived from the video URL or metadata. If this process is not secure, an attacker could influence the filename to include special characters or commands that could be executed when the file is later accessed or processed by other parts of the application.
    *   How lux Contributes: `lux` uses the potentially attacker-influenced filename when saving the downloaded file.
    *   Example: A malicious video hosting site could set the video title to something like `; rm -rf /tmp/*`, and if the application naively uses this title as the filename and later executes commands based on filenames in the download directory, it could lead to unintended consequences.
    *   Impact:
        *   Arbitrary command execution on the server.
        *   Data loss or corruption.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Sanitize filenames derived from external sources to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters.
            *   Avoid directly executing downloaded files or using their names in shell commands without proper sanitization.
            *   Store downloaded files with randomly generated, non-executable filenames.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Be cautious about applications that automatically process downloaded files based on their filenames.

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in lux's Dependencies**
    *   Description: `lux` relies on other libraries for its functionality (e.g., for HTTP requests, parsing, etc.). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited through `lux`.
    *   How lux Contributes: `lux` integrates and uses these third-party libraries, inheriting any vulnerabilities they might have.
    *   Example: A vulnerability in the HTTP request library used by `lux` could allow an attacker to perform a denial-of-service attack or gain unauthorized access.
    *   Impact:
        *   Various, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency (e.g., remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure).
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Regularly update `lux` and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
            *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and monitor for vulnerabilities in `lux`'s dependencies.
            *   Consider using a software bill of materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Ensure the application using `lux` is kept up-to-date.
