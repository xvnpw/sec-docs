* Threat: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    * Description: An attacker could manipulate the application to provide a malicious URL to `lux`. `lux` would then make a request to this attacker-controlled URL, potentially targeting internal network resources, other services, or even the application's own infrastructure. The attacker could use this to scan internal ports, access internal APIs, or read sensitive data from internal services that are not exposed to the public internet.
    * Impact: Access to internal resources, potential data breaches from internal services, denial of service against internal services, and potentially compromising the server hosting the application.
    * Affected `lux` Component: The core functionality of `lux` responsible for fetching content from URLs (likely within the modules handling URL processing and HTTP requests).
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization on user-provided URLs.
        * Use an allow-list of trusted domains or URL patterns for downloads.
        * Configure `lux` or the underlying HTTP client to prevent requests to internal IP ranges or private networks.
        * Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF.

* Threat: Command Injection via URL Manipulation
    * Description: An attacker might craft a specially formatted URL that, when processed by `lux` or its underlying dependencies, could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the server. This could happen if `lux` or a dependency improperly handles certain characters or sequences in the URL, leading to shell command execution.
    * Impact: Full compromise of the server hosting the application, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, steal data, or disrupt services.
    * Affected `lux` Component: Potentially the URL parsing or processing modules within `lux`, or vulnerabilities in external tools or libraries that `lux` might invoke.
    * Risk Severity: Critical
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Avoid directly passing user-provided data to shell commands or external processes.
        * Ensure `lux` and its dependencies are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        * Implement strong input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious characters in URLs.
        * Consider running the `lux` process in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.

* Threat: Path Traversal/Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Output Path Manipulation
    * Description: If the application allows configuration of the download destination path for `lux`, an attacker could provide a malicious path that allows writing files outside the intended directory. This could lead to overwriting critical system files, placing malicious scripts in web-accessible directories, or accessing sensitive files on the server.
    * Impact: Server compromise, arbitrary code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    * Affected `lux` Component: The functionality within `lux` that handles the output path configuration and file saving operations.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Never allow users to directly specify the output path for downloaded files.
        * Enforce a predefined, secure download directory.
        * Implement strict validation and sanitization of any path-related configuration options.
        * Ensure the application has appropriate file system permissions to prevent writing to sensitive areas.

* Threat: Malware Introduction via Downloaded Content
    * Description: An attacker could provide a URL to a video file that contains malware. If the application automatically processes or executes the downloaded file without proper security checks, the malware could infect the server or the user's machine (if the file is served to a client). This threat directly involves `lux` as it's the mechanism for retrieving the malicious content.
    * Impact: Server compromise, data breaches, malware propagation, and potential harm to users.
    * Affected `lux` Component: The core download functionality of `lux`.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Never automatically execute downloaded files.
        * Implement virus scanning and malware detection on downloaded files before any further processing.
        * Isolate the download process and any subsequent processing in a secure environment.
