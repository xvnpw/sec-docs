# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for traefik/traefik

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Exposed Traefik Entrypoints](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_exposed_traefik_entrypoints.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Review your Traefik configuration, specifically the `entryPoints` section in your `traefik.yml` or `traefik.toml` file.
    2.  Identify all ports and interfaces Traefik is configured to listen on.
    3.  Determine which entrypoints are absolutely necessary for external access (e.g., ports 80 and 443 for web traffic).
    4.  For Traefik entrypoints that are not intended for public access (like the Traefik dashboard or API), restrict their exposure *within Traefik configuration*. This can be done by:
        *   Binding them to specific IP addresses or network interfaces in the `entryPoints` configuration, limiting accessibility.
        *   Using network policies or firewall rules *external to Traefik* to restrict access to these ports, but the configuration starts with defining entrypoints in Traefik.
    5.  Document the purpose of each exposed Traefik entrypoint and justify its necessity.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unnecessary Service Exposure (Medium):** Reduces the attack surface of Traefik by limiting the number of publicly accessible entry points configured within Traefik.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low):** Prevents accidental exposure of internal Traefik services or information through publicly accessible but unnecessary entrypoints defined in Traefik.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unnecessary Service Exposure (Medium):** High - Significantly reduces the attack surface configurable within Traefik.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low):** Medium - Prevents accidental leaks of potentially sensitive information exposed by Traefik services.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Public facing application ports (80, 443) are defined as entrypoints in `traefik.yml`.
    *   Configuration files: `traefik.yml`, Docker Compose file.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dashboard and API entrypoints are currently accessible from the public internet. Need to restrict their binding within Traefik configuration to internal interfaces or specific IP ranges.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Traefik Dashboard and API Access](./mitigation_strategies/secure_traefik_dashboard_and_api_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication in Traefik:** Configure authentication middleware *within Traefik* for the dashboard and API entrypoints.
        *   Choose a strong authentication method supported by Traefik: BasicAuth, DigestAuth, ForwardAuth, or OAuth, configured directly in `traefik.yml` or `traefik.toml`.
        *   Define users and strong passwords *within Traefik configuration* or integrate with an external identity provider using ForwardAuth or OAuth, configured in Traefik.
        *   Apply the authentication middleware to the dashboard and API routes *using Traefik's routing configuration*.
    2.  **Implement Authorization in Traefik:** If your chosen authentication method supports it (like ForwardAuth or OAuth), implement authorization rules *within Traefik*.
        *   Define roles or permissions for users accessing the dashboard and API *using Traefik's middleware or external authorization service integration*.
        *   Restrict access to specific functionalities based on user roles *through Traefik's configuration or external authorization decisions*.
    3.  **Disable Dashboard/API Entrypoints in Traefik (If Possible):** If the dashboard and API are not actively used in production, consider disabling their entrypoints *in Traefik configuration*.
        *   Remove the `entryPoints` and routes associated with the dashboard and API from your `traefik.yml` or `traefik.toml` configuration.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Traefik Configuration (High):** Prevents attackers from accessing and modifying Traefik configuration through the dashboard or API, which are Traefik features.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Traefik Dashboard/API (Medium):** Protects sensitive information exposed through the Traefik dashboard and API, such as service configurations and routing rules managed by Traefik.
    *   **Account Takeover of Traefik Management (Medium):** Mitigates the risk of attackers gaining access to Traefik management interfaces through weak or default credentials configured within Traefik.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Traefik Configuration (High):** High - Critical for maintaining control and security of Traefik infrastructure.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Traefik Dashboard/API (Medium):** Medium - Prevents leakage of sensitive operational details exposed by Traefik.
    *   **Account Takeover of Traefik Management (Medium):** High - Prevents attackers from gaining administrative control over Traefik.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   BasicAuth is enabled for the dashboard using hardcoded credentials in `traefik.yml`. This is a Traefik feature being used.
    *   Configuration files: `traefik.yml`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Replace BasicAuth with a stronger authentication method like ForwardAuth or OAuth, configurable within Traefik.
    *   Implement authorization rules within Traefik or via external authorization service integration to restrict access based on user roles.
    *   Move credentials to a secure secrets management solution instead of hardcoding them in `traefik.yml`, even though the authentication method is configured in Traefik.

        *   Set appropriate `max-age`, `includeSubdomains`, and `preload` directives *within the Traefik middleware configuration*.
    3.  **Strong Cipher Suites in Traefik:** Configure Traefik to use only strong and modern cipher suites *using Traefik's TLS options*.
        *   Specify allowed cipher suites in your Traefik configuration using the `tls.options` section.
        *   Prioritize modern cipher suites recommended by security best practices.
        *   Disable weak or outdated cipher suites.
    4.  **Restrict TLS Protocol Versions in Traefik:** Restrict TLS protocol versions to TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 *using Traefik's TLS options*.
        *   Configure the `minVersion` and `maxVersion` options within `tls.options` in your Traefik configuration.
        *   Disable older, less secure versions like TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.
    5.  **Certificate Management with Traefik:** Implement robust certificate management *using Traefik's certificate management features*.
        *   Use trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) like Let's Encrypt for obtaining TLS certificates, leveraging Traefik's Let's Encrypt integration.
        *   Automate certificate renewal using Traefik's built-in Let's Encrypt integration or other certificate management tools integrated with Traefik.
