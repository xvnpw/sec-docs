# Threat Model Analysis for traefik/traefik

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Traefik Dashboard/API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_traefik_dashboardapi.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Traefik dashboard or API. This could be achieved through weak or default credentials, exposed management ports, or vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism. Once accessed, the attacker can view sensitive configuration data, modify routing rules, and potentially disrupt service.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Traefik instance, leading to potential redirection of traffic, exposure of internal services, denial of service, and exfiltration of sensitive configuration data (including secrets).
    *   **Affected Component:** `API`, `Dashboard`, `Entrypoints` (if exposed).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Traefik dashboard and API (e.g., HTTP Basic Auth, Digest Auth, forwardAuth).
        *   Restrict access to the Traefik dashboard and API to trusted networks or IP addresses.
        *   Disable the dashboard and API entirely if not required.
        *   Regularly audit and rotate API keys or credentials.
        *   Ensure the management port is not exposed publicly.

## Threat: [Configuration Injection/Manipulation via Providers](./threats/configuration_injectionmanipulation_via_providers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a Traefik configuration provider (e.g., file provider, Kubernetes CRDs, Consul, etc.). By manipulating the configuration data at the source, the attacker can inject malicious routing rules, redirect traffic to attacker-controlled servers, or expose internal services.
    *   **Impact:**  Redirection of user traffic to malicious sites, exposure of internal services and data, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Providers` (e.g., `File`, `Kubernetes CRD`, `Consul`), `Router`, `Entrypoints`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to configuration providers with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Implement access control lists (ACLs) or role-based access control (RBAC) for configuration providers.
        *   Use secure communication channels (e.g., TLS) for communication with configuration providers.
        *   Regularly audit configuration sources for unauthorized changes.
        *   Consider using immutable infrastructure principles for configuration management.

## Threat: [TLS Termination Vulnerabilities (Weak Ciphers/Protocols)](./threats/tls_termination_vulnerabilities__weak_ciphersprotocols_.md)

*   **Description:** Traefik is configured to use outdated or weak TLS protocols or cipher suites. This makes the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and decrypt the communication between the client and Traefik.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS, including credentials, personal information, and application data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Entrypoints` (TLS configuration), `ACME` (certificate management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Traefik to use strong and modern TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   Disable weak cipher suites.
        *   Regularly update Traefik to benefit from security updates and best practices for TLS configuration.
        *   Use tools like SSL Labs' SSL Test to verify TLS configuration.

## Threat: [Improper Backend Certificate Validation](./threats/improper_backend_certificate_validation.md)

*   **Description:** Traefik is configured to communicate with backend services over HTTPS but does not properly validate the backend server's TLS certificate. This allows for man-in-the-middle attacks between Traefik and the backend, where an attacker can intercept and potentially modify traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of communication between Traefik and backend services, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation of backend data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Services` (backend server configuration), `Transport` (backend communication).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Traefik to verify the TLS certificates of backend servers.
        *   Use trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) for backend certificates.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for enhanced security between Traefik and backends.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Traefik Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_traefik_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software, Traefik might contain undiscovered or known security vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including complete compromise of the Traefik instance and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** All components of Traefik.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Traefik updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists for Traefik.
        *   Follow security best practices for deploying and configuring Traefik.
