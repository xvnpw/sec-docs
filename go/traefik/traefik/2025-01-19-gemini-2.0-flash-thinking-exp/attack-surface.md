# Attack Surface Analysis for traefik/traefik

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Traefik API and Dashboard](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_traefik_api_and_dashboard.md)

**Description:** The Traefik API and Dashboard provide a management interface for configuring and monitoring Traefik. If exposed without proper authentication and authorization, attackers can gain full control over Traefik.

**How Traefik Contributes:** Traefik provides these features for management, and if not secured, they become direct attack vectors. Default configurations might not enforce strong authentication.

**Example:** An attacker accesses the unprotected `/api` endpoint and uses it to reconfigure routing rules, redirecting traffic to a malicious server.

**Impact:** Critical

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enable Authentication:** Configure strong authentication mechanisms for the API and Dashboard (e.g., BasicAuth, DigestAuth, ForwardAuth).
*   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to the API and Dashboard to specific IP addresses or networks using network policies or firewall rules.
*   **Disable if Unused:** If the API and Dashboard are not required, disable them entirely.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Dynamic Configuration Providers](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_dynamic_configuration_providers.md)

**Description:** Traefik relies on providers (like Kubernetes Ingress, Docker labels, Consul) to dynamically discover and configure routing rules. Misconfigurations can allow unauthorized modification of these rules *within Traefik's understanding of the provider*.

**How Traefik Contributes:** Traefik's flexibility in using dynamic providers introduces complexity. Insufficient access controls on the *provider itself* can lead to compromised routing *within Traefik*.

**Example:** An attacker with write access to the Kubernetes API modifies an Ingress resource, changing the backend service for a critical application to a malicious endpoint, and Traefik reflects this change.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement Strong RBAC/ACLs:**  Enforce strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the underlying configuration providers to limit who can modify routing rules that Traefik will then adopt.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to Traefik and other components interacting with the configuration providers.
*   **Regular Auditing:** Regularly audit the configuration of the providers and the resulting Traefik configuration for any unauthorized changes.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Middlewares](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_middlewares.md)

**Description:** Developers can create custom middlewares to extend Traefik's functionality. Vulnerabilities in these custom middlewares can be exploited to compromise Traefik or the backend applications *through Traefik's processing*.

**How Traefik Contributes:** Traefik's extensibility through middlewares allows for custom logic, which can introduce security flaws if not developed securely and are executed within Traefik's request handling.

**Example:** A custom middleware designed for header manipulation has an injection vulnerability, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary headers into requests to backend services *via Traefik*.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Development Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middlewares, including input validation, output encoding, and avoiding known vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom middlewares to identify potential security flaws.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep custom middlewares updated with the latest security patches and bug fixes.
*   **Consider Built-in Alternatives:** Whenever possible, utilize Traefik's built-in middlewares instead of developing custom ones.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tls_configuration.md)

**Description:** Misconfigured TLS settings can expose communication to man-in-the-middle attacks or other cryptographic vulnerabilities *at the Traefik level*.

**How Traefik Contributes:** Traefik handles TLS termination. Incorrect configuration of TLS protocols, cipher suites, or certificate management weakens the security of the connection *managed by Traefik*.

**Example:** Traefik is configured to allow outdated TLS 1.0 protocol, making connections terminated by Traefik susceptible to known vulnerabilities like POODLE.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Use Strong TLS Protocols:** Configure Traefik to use only strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
*   **Select Secure Cipher Suites:** Choose secure cipher suites that do not have known vulnerabilities within Traefik's configuration.
*   **Implement HSTS:** Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to force clients to use HTTPS when interacting with Traefik.
*   **Proper Certificate Management:** Use valid, non-expired TLS certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) configured within Traefik. Automate certificate renewal using tools like Let's Encrypt.
