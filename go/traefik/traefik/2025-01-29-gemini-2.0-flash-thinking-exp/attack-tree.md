## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Traefik Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_traefik_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Known Traefik CVEs [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Exploit Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Execute Exploit against Traefik Instance [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Traefik. If a vulnerable version is in use and not patched, attackers can find or develop exploit code and execute it against the Traefik instance. Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing full system compromise.

* **Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Exploit Dependency Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Trigger Vulnerable Code Path in Traefik [CRITICAL NODE]:** Traefik relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited. Attackers identify vulnerable dependencies and then find ways to trigger the vulnerable code paths within Traefik's functionality. This can also lead to RCE or other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Traefik Misconfiguration [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_traefik_misconfiguration__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Exposed Traefik Dashboard/API [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Brute-Force/Default Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attempt Default Credentials (admin:admin, etc.) [CRITICAL NODE]:** If the Traefik dashboard or API is exposed and default credentials (like `admin:admin`) are still in use, attackers can easily gain administrative access.
    * **Credential Stuffing [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Use Leaked Credentials from Other Services [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers use credentials leaked from breaches of other services to attempt login to the Traefik dashboard/API. Credential reuse is common, making this a viable attack.
    * **API Authentication Bypass:**
        * **Identify and Exploit API Authentication Vulnerabilities (e.g., JWT flaws, insecure session management) [CRITICAL NODE]:** If there are vulnerabilities in the API's authentication mechanisms (e.g., flaws in JWT implementation, session management issues), attackers can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.
    * **Gain Control via Dashboard/API [CRITICAL NODE]:** Once authenticated (legitimately or via bypass), attackers can:
        * **Modify Routing Rules to Redirect Traffic [CRITICAL NODE]:** Redirect legitimate traffic to attacker-controlled servers for phishing or data interception.
        * **Deploy Malicious Middleware [CRITICAL NODE]:** Inject malicious code into the request/response flow, enabling data interception, code execution on backend servers, or other malicious actions.
        * **Access Sensitive Configuration Data [CRITICAL NODE]:** Expose sensitive information like backend service credentials, API keys, and internal network details stored in Traefik's configuration.
        * **Restart/Halt Traefik Service (DoS) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Cause a Denial of Service by disrupting Traefik's operation, impacting application availability.

* **Insecure TLS Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]:** While individual TLS misconfigurations might have moderate impact, a combination of weaknesses can create a High-Risk Path for traffic interception and downgrade attacks.

* **Open Ports and Services:**
    * **Exploit Exposed Services [HIGH RISK PATH - if Admin API exposed]:**
        * **Unprotected Admin API on Public Interface [CRITICAL NODE]:** If the Traefik Admin API is unintentionally exposed to the public internet without proper authentication, it becomes a direct and critical point of compromise, allowing full control over Traefik.

* **Misconfigured Routing Rules:**
    * **Path Traversal via Routing:**
        * **Craft Requests to Bypass Traefik Routing and Access Backend Files [CRITICAL NODE]:** Incorrectly configured routing rules might allow attackers to craft requests that bypass Traefik's intended path and directly access files on backend servers, leading to data breaches or code execution.
    * **Access to Internal Services [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Routing Rules Incorrectly Expose Internal Services Not Intended for Public Access [CRITICAL NODE]:** Misconfigurations can lead to internal services, not meant for public access, being exposed through Traefik. This can grant attackers access to sensitive internal systems and data.
    * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Routing Configuration:**
        * **Manipulate Routing Rules or Providers to Make Traefik Initiate Requests to Internal Resources [CRITICAL NODE]:** In specific configurations (especially with custom providers or plugins), attackers might manipulate routing rules to induce Traefik to make requests to internal resources, potentially leading to SSRF vulnerabilities and access to internal systems.

* **Insecure Middleware Configuration:**
    * **Vulnerable Custom Middleware [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware Code (e.g., written in Lua, Go plugins) [CRITICAL NODE]:** If custom middleware is used, vulnerabilities in its code (e.g., in Lua scripts or Go plugins) can be exploited to achieve code execution within Traefik's context or bypass security controls.
    * **Misconfigured Built-in Middleware [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Bypassing Authentication Middleware (e.g., incorrect regex, logic flaws) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Misconfigurations in built-in authentication middleware (e.g., flawed regex patterns, logical errors) can allow attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to protected resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Traefik Deployment](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_traefik_deployment.md)

* **Compromised Traefik Image [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Use Malicious Traefik Docker Image from Untrusted Registry [CRITICAL NODE]:** Using a compromised or malicious Traefik Docker image from an untrusted source directly injects malware or vulnerabilities into the deployment from the outset, leading to full system compromise.

* **Compromised Configuration Source [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Modify Configuration Files in Git Repository, Consul, Etcd, etc. [CRITICAL NODE]:** If the source of Traefik's configuration (e.g., Git repository, Consul, Etcd) is compromised, attackers can inject malicious configurations, gaining full control over Traefik's behavior and potentially the backend applications.

* **Compromised Deployment Pipeline [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Inject Malicious Code/Configuration during CI/CD Process [CRITICAL NODE]:** Compromising the CI/CD pipeline used to build and deploy Traefik allows attackers to inject malicious code or configurations into the deployment process itself, leading to a compromised Traefik instance from deployment.
