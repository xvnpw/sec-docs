# Threat Model Analysis for traefik/traefik

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configuration](./threats/insecure_default_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits default, insecure settings left unchanged after Traefik deployment. This could involve accessing exposed ports, exploiting enabled but unnecessary features, or leveraging weak default TLS configurations.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Traefik control plane, backend services, data interception, potential compromise of the entire infrastructure.
*   **Affected Traefik Component:** Core Configuration, Entrypoints, Providers, TLS Configuration
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and harden default configurations before production deployment.
    *   Consult Traefik's security best practices documentation.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege in configuration.
    *   Disable unnecessary features and modules.
    *   Change default ports if possible and restrict access.

## Threat: [Exposed Configuration Files](./threats/exposed_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains access to sensitive Traefik configuration files (e.g., `traefik.yml`, `traefik.toml`) due to misconfiguration or insecure storage. This allows them to read secrets, understand infrastructure, and potentially modify configurations if write access is also gained.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information (API keys, certificates), potential manipulation of Traefik configuration, unauthorized access to backend services.
*   **Affected Traefik Component:** Configuration Loading, File Provider
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store configuration files in secure locations with restricted file system permissions.
    *   Utilize secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to manage sensitive data instead of hardcoding in files.
    *   Implement access control lists (ACLs) to limit access to configuration files.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Access Control](./threats/misconfigured_access_control.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker bypasses or exploits weaknesses in Traefik's access control configurations (e.g., IP whitelists, authentication middleware) to gain unauthorized access to backend services or the Traefik control plane.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, backend application compromise, control plane manipulation, potential data breaches.
*   **Affected Traefik Component:** Middleware (e.g., `IPWhiteList`, `BasicAuth`, `ForwardAuth`), Routers, Entrypoints
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all exposed services and the control plane.
    *   Use least privilege access control rules, granting only necessary permissions.
    *   Regularly audit and review access control configurations.
    *   Utilize Traefik's built-in authentication middleware or integrate with external identity providers (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).

## Threat: [TLS/SSL Misconfiguration](./threats/tlsssl_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits weaknesses in Traefik's TLS/SSL configuration, such as using weak ciphers, outdated protocols, or improper certificate management, to intercept or decrypt encrypted traffic (Man-in-the-Middle attacks) or downgrade connection security.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, eavesdropping on sensitive communications, potential data breaches, weakened security posture.
*   **Affected Traefik Component:** TLS Configuration, Entrypoints, Certificates Resolvers
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher) and disable older, insecure protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1).
    *   Use strong cipher suites and disable weak or vulnerable ciphers.
    *   Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to force HTTPS connections.
    *   Properly manage TLS certificates, ensuring automatic renewal and secure storage.
    *   Regularly audit TLS configuration using tools like SSL Labs.

## Threat: [Unsecured Traefik API](./threats/unsecured_traefik_api.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains unauthorized access to the Traefik API if it is enabled without proper authentication. This allows them to reconfigure Traefik, potentially disrupting services, gaining access to sensitive information, or even taking control of the proxy.
*   **Impact:** Full control over Traefik configuration, denial of service, potential compromise of backend services, data breaches.
*   **Affected Traefik Component:** API Module
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable the API in production environments unless strictly necessary for automation or monitoring.
    *   If the API is required, implement strong authentication and authorization (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).
    *   Restrict access to the API to authorized IP addresses or networks.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys and store them securely.
    *   Monitor API access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities](./threats/api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Impact:** Full control over Traefik configuration, denial of service, potential compromise of backend services, data breaches.
*   **Affected Traefik Component:** API Module, Core Code
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Traefik updated to the latest version to patch known API vulnerabilities.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories and apply patches promptly.
    *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing of the Traefik deployment, specifically focusing on the API.

    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on backend applications to mitigate the impact of smuggled requests.
    *   Regularly audit Traefik's request handling logic and configurations.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by Traefik. These vulnerabilities could be in Go libraries, TLS libraries, or other components, potentially allowing for remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on Traefik server, denial of service, information disclosure, potential compromise of the entire infrastructure.
*   **Affected Traefik Component:** All Components (indirectly), Dependency Management

## Threat: [Middleware Misconfiguration/Abuse](./threats/middleware_misconfigurationabuse.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in Traefik middleware (built-in or custom) to bypass security controls, cause denial of service, or gain unauthorized access. This could involve exploiting logic errors in custom middleware or misconfiguring built-in middleware like rate limiting or CORS.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, denial of service, unauthorized access, potential data breaches, service disruption.
*   **Affected Traefik Component:** Middleware (Built-in and Custom), Routers

    *   Monitor plugin activity and logs for suspicious behavior.

## Threat: [HTTP Request Floods](./threats/http_request_floods.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker floods Traefik with a large volume of HTTP requests to overwhelm its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), causing legitimate requests to be dropped and resulting in denial of service for users. This can be achieved through various methods like SYN floods, HTTP GET floods, or slowloris attacks.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, service unavailability, performance degradation, impact on legitimate users.
*   **Affected Traefik Component:** Entrypoints, Core Proxying Logic
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
