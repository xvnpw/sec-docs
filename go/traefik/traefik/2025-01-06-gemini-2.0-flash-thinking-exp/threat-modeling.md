# Threat Model Analysis for traefik/traefik

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to Traefik Dashboard/API](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_traefik_dashboardapi.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthenticated Access to Traefik Dashboard/API
    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers the Traefik dashboard or API is exposed without any authentication. They can then access sensitive information about the application's routing, health, and configuration. They might modify routing rules to redirect traffic to malicious sites, disable services, or exfiltrate sensitive data revealed by the dashboard.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Traefik instance, leading to potential data breaches, service disruption, and unauthorized control over the application's traffic flow.
    *   **Affected Traefik Component:** `Traefik Dashboard` (web UI) and `API` (if exposed without authentication).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication on the Traefik dashboard and API using `basicAuth`, `forwardAuth`, or other supported authentication mechanisms.
        *   Restrict access to the dashboard and API to specific IP addresses or networks using firewall rules or Traefik's access control features.
        *   Consider disabling the dashboard and API in production environments if they are not actively required for monitoring or management.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Authentication Middleware leading to Bypass](./threats/misconfigured_authentication_middleware_leading_to_bypass.md)

*   **Misconfigured Authentication Middleware leading to Bypass**
    *   **Description:** Developers configure authentication middleware (e.g., `basicAuth`, `forwardAuth`) incorrectly. An attacker crafts requests that bypass the intended authentication checks, gaining access to protected resources without proper credentials. This could involve exploiting logic flaws in the middleware configuration or the authentication service itself.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive application endpoints and data, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, and other security violations.
    *   **Affected Traefik Component:** `Middleware` (specifically authentication middleware like `basicAuth`, `forwardAuth`, `digestAuth`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test all authentication middleware configurations with various input scenarios to ensure they function as intended.
        *   Follow security best practices when configuring authentication middleware, including using strong credentials and secure communication protocols.
        *   If using `forwardAuth`, ensure the external authentication service is secure and robust against common web vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly review and audit middleware configurations.

## Threat: [TLS Downgrade Attack due to Insecure TLS Configuration](./threats/tls_downgrade_attack_due_to_insecure_tls_configuration.md)

*   **TLS Downgrade Attack due to Insecure TLS Configuration**
    *   **Description:** Traefik is configured with weak TLS settings, allowing an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to force the connection to downgrade to an older, less secure TLS protocol (e.g., TLS 1.0 or SSLv3) that has known vulnerabilities. This allows them to potentially eavesdrop on or manipulate the encrypted traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted between clients and the application, including credentials, personal information, and other confidential data.
    *   **Affected Traefik Component:** `Entrypoints` (specifically the TLS configuration within entrypoints).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce the use of strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   Disable support for older, vulnerable TLS protocols (TLS 1.1 and below).
        *   Configure strong cipher suites that prioritize forward secrecy and authenticated encryption.
        *   Regularly review and update TLS configurations based on current security best practices.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Providers Leading to Information Disclosure or Control Plane Access](./threats/misconfigured_providers_leading_to_information_disclosure_or_control_plane_access.md)

*   **Misconfigured Providers Leading to Information Disclosure or Control Plane Access**
    *   **Description:** When using providers like Docker, Kubernetes, or Consul for dynamic configuration, insecure configurations or leaked credentials can allow attackers to access the provider's API. This could enable them to view service configurations, potentially revealing sensitive information, or even modify routing rules, gaining control over the application's traffic flow.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized modification of routing rules, and potential compromise of the application's control plane.
    *   **Affected Traefik Component:** `Providers` (modules responsible for integrating with service discovery platforms like Docker, Kubernetes, Consul).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow security best practices for configuring and securing the chosen provider (Docker, Kubernetes, Consul, etc.).
        *   Use the principle of least privilege when granting Traefik access to the provider's API.
        *   Securely store and manage credentials used by Traefik to access the provider.
        *   Regularly audit provider configurations and access controls.
