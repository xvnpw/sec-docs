# Attack Surface Analysis for traefik/traefik

## Attack Surface: [TLS/SSL Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/tlsssl_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Traefik is responsible for terminating TLS/SSL connections. Misconfigurations in TLS settings can expose the application to man-in-the-middle attacks or allow the use of weak or outdated cryptographic protocols.
    *   **How Traefik Contributes:** Traefik handles the configuration of TLS certificates, cipher suites, and protocol versions. Incorrect settings directly impact the security of the encrypted connection.
    *   **Example:** Configuring Traefik to accept SSLv3 or weak cipher suites like RC4, allowing an attacker to downgrade the connection and potentially decrypt traffic.
    *   **Impact:**  Confidential data transmitted between the client and the application can be intercepted and potentially decrypted by attackers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong TLS protocol versions (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   Use secure cipher suites and disable weak or deprecated ones.
        *   Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) with `includeSubDomains` and `preload` directives.
        *   Regularly update TLS certificates and ensure proper certificate management practices.
        *   Utilize tools like SSL Labs' SSL Server Test to verify TLS configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Traefik Dashboard/API without Proper Authentication](./attack_surfaces/exposed_traefik_dashboardapi_without_proper_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Traefik provides a dashboard and an API for monitoring and configuration. If these interfaces are exposed without strong authentication, attackers can gain full control over Traefik.
    *   **How Traefik Contributes:** Traefik provides these management interfaces. If not secured, they become a direct entry point to manipulate routing, access logs, and potentially the backend services.
    *   **Example:**  Accessing the `/dashboard/` or `/api/` endpoint without requiring any login credentials, allowing an attacker to modify routing rules to redirect traffic to a malicious server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application's routing and potentially the backend services. Attackers can intercept traffic, inject malicious content, or disrupt service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication for the Traefik dashboard and API (e.g., using `basicAuth`, `digestAuth`, or external authentication providers).
        *   Restrict access to the dashboard and API to specific IP addresses or networks using firewall rules.
        *   Consider disabling the dashboard and API in production environments if not strictly necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Providers](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_providers.md)

*   **Description:** Traefik relies on configuration providers (like file, Docker, Kubernetes) to define routing rules and other settings. If these providers are compromised, attackers can manipulate Traefik's behavior.
    *   **How Traefik Contributes:** Traefik actively reads and applies configurations from these providers. Vulnerabilities in the provider or its access controls directly impact Traefik's operation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gaining write access to the Traefik configuration file (using the file provider) and adding a new router that redirects all traffic to a phishing site. Or, compromising the Kubernetes API server and modifying Traefik's IngressRoute objects.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete control over application routing, potentially leading to redirection to malicious sites, data exfiltration, or service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the underlying configuration providers (e.g., restrict file system permissions, secure Docker/Kubernetes API access).
        *   Use the principle of least privilege for Traefik's access to configuration providers.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for changes in Traefik's configuration.
        *   Consider using more secure configuration providers if available and suitable for the environment.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:** Discrepancies in how Traefik and backend servers parse HTTP requests can allow attackers to "smuggle" additional requests within a single HTTP connection.
    *   **How Traefik Contributes:** As a reverse proxy, Traefik parses and forwards HTTP requests. If its parsing logic differs from the backend servers, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** Crafting a malicious HTTP request that Traefik interprets as one request, but the backend server interprets as two, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary requests into the backend processing pipeline.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls on the backend, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Traefik and backend servers have consistent HTTP parsing configurations.
        *   Use HTTP/2 end-to-end if possible, as it's less susceptible to smuggling attacks.
        *   Implement strict HTTP parsing on both Traefik and backend servers.
        *   Monitor for unusual HTTP behavior and request patterns.
