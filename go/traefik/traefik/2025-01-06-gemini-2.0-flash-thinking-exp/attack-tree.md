## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Traefik Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_traefik_vulnerability.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Traefik. These vulnerabilities could allow for Remote Code Execution (RCE), Path Traversal, or other critical exploits.
**Why High-Risk:**
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Publicly known exploits often have readily available proof-of-concepts, making exploitation easier once a vulnerability is disclosed. The likelihood depends on the severity of the CVE and how quickly organizations patch.
    * **Impact:** Very High - Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the Traefik instance and potentially the underlying application and server.

**Critical Node: Identify and Exploit Publicly Known Vulnerability (e.g., RCE, Path Traversal)**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies a specific, publicly known vulnerability in the deployed version of Traefik and uses an exploit to leverage that weakness.
    * **Why Critical:** This is the initial action that triggers the high-risk path. Success here directly leads to the attacker gaining a foothold.

**Critical Node: Gain Unauthorized Access to Traefik or Backend**
    * **Attack Vector:** As a result of successfully exploiting a vulnerability, the attacker gains unauthorized access to either the Traefik management interface, the server it's running on, or the backend application directly.
    * **Why Critical:** This node represents a significant escalation of the attack. Once access is gained, further compromise is highly likely.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Misconfigure Traefik -> Expose Sensitive Information -> Unprotected Dashboard Access](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_misconfigure_traefik_-_expose_sensitive_information_-_unprotected_dashboard_access.md)

**Attack Vector:** The Traefik dashboard, which provides a management interface, is exposed without proper authentication.
**Why High-Risk:**
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - This is a common misconfiguration, especially in development or testing environments that are inadvertently exposed.
    * **Impact:** High - An unprotected dashboard grants full control over Traefik's configuration and can expose sensitive information.

**Critical Node: Access Traefik Dashboard without Authentication**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker directly accesses the Traefik dashboard without being prompted for any credentials.
    * **Why Critical:** This is the entry point for this high-risk path, representing a complete failure of access control.

**Critical Node: Modify Configuration or Extract Secrets**
    * **Attack Vector:** Once inside the unprotected dashboard, the attacker can modify routing rules, access control settings, or extract sensitive information like API keys, TLS certificates, or backend credentials.
    * **Why Critical:** This node allows the attacker to directly manipulate Traefik to their advantage or obtain the necessary information to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Misconfigure Traefik -> Insecure Authentication/Authorization -> Weak Authentication Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_misconfigure_traefik_-_insecure_authenticationauthorization_-_weak_authentication_cre_a06f757e.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Weak, default, or easily guessable credentials are used for accessing the Traefik API or dashboard.
**Why High-Risk:**
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - While best practices discourage default credentials, they are still sometimes used or weak passwords are chosen. Brute-force attacks can increase the likelihood.
    * **Impact:** High - Successful authentication grants unauthorized access to manage Traefik.

**Critical Node: Brute-force or Guess Default Credentials for Traefik API/Dashboard**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to gain access by trying common default credentials or using brute-force techniques to guess passwords.
    * **Why Critical:** This is the direct action to exploit weak credentials and gain initial access.

**Critical Node: Gain Unauthorized Access**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker successfully authenticates using weak or guessed credentials, gaining access to the Traefik API or dashboard.
    * **Why Critical:** Similar to the previous "Gain Unauthorized Access" node, this signifies a major security breach allowing for further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Abuse Traefik Features -> Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities -> Vulnerable Custom Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_abuse_traefik_features_-_exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities_-_vulnerable_custom_middl_7e1ec6be.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Custom middleware, which extends Traefik's functionality, contains security vulnerabilities.
**Why High-Risk:**
    * **Likelihood:** Medium to High - The security of custom code can vary significantly. Developers might introduce vulnerabilities during development.
    * **Impact:** High to Very High - Vulnerabilities in middleware can allow for Remote Code Execution, bypassing security controls, or access to sensitive data.

**Critical Node: Exploit vulnerabilities in custom middleware configurations**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies and exploits specific vulnerabilities within the logic or dependencies of the custom middleware.
    * **Why Critical:** This node represents the successful exploitation of a potentially less scrutinized part of the Traefik setup.

**Critical Node: Gain Unauthorized Access or Execute Arbitrary Code**
    * **Attack Vector:**  Successful exploitation of the middleware vulnerability allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to resources or execute arbitrary code within the context of Traefik.
    * **Why Critical:** This node signifies a significant compromise, potentially granting the attacker full control over Traefik's operations or the ability to directly impact the backend application.
