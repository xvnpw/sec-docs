# Attack Surface Analysis for traefik/traefik

## Attack Surface: [1. Unsecured Management Interfaces (Dashboard/API)](./attack_surfaces/1__unsecured_management_interfaces__dashboardapi_.md)

*   **Description:** Exposed and unprotected Traefik dashboard and API allow attackers to reconfigure Traefik, potentially gaining full control.
*   **How Traefik Contributes:** Traefik creates and manages these interfaces.
*   **Example:** Attacker accesses `/dashboard` without authentication and modifies routing rules to redirect traffic.
*   **Impact:** Complete Traefik compromise, control over backend services, data exfiltration, service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable:** Disable in production if not strictly required.
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Use robust authentication (external IdP preferred).
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict access via network firewalls.
    *   **Traefik IP Whitelisting:** Use *in addition to* network firewalls.
    *   **Dedicated Entry Point:** Use a separate, non-standard entry point.
    *   **Auditing:** Regularly audit access logs.

## Attack Surface: [2. Entry Point Exposure and Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/2__entry_point_exposure_and_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured entry points (ports) can expose unintended services or allow unauthorized access.
*   **How Traefik Contributes:** Traefik defines and manages these entry points.
*   **Example:** An entry point listens on `0.0.0.0` without network restrictions, or HTTP is not redirected to HTTPS.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend services, various attacks (DDoS, injection), man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Explicit Entry Points:** Define entry points explicitly (address and port).
    *   **Network Firewalls:** *Essential* to restrict access to authorized sources.
    *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Use Traefik's TLS options; disable/redirect HTTP.
    *   **Port Review:** Regularly review exposed ports.

## Attack Surface: [3. Routing Rule Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/3__routing_rule_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Complex or flawed routing rules can be exploited to bypass security or access unintended resources.
*   **How Traefik Contributes:** Traefik's routing engine interprets and applies these rules.
*   **Example:** A flawed regex in a routing rule allows bypassing authentication middleware.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend services, bypassing security controls.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Simplicity:** Keep routing rules simple; avoid complex regex.
    *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test with various inputs, including malicious payloads.
    *   **WAF:** Consider a Web Application Firewall in front of Traefik.
    *   **Regular Review:** Regularly review rules for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [4. Middleware Misconfiguration or Bypass](./attack_surfaces/4__middleware_misconfiguration_or_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured middleware (authentication, rate limiting, etc.) can create vulnerabilities or be bypassed.
*   **How Traefik Contributes:** Traefik provides and executes the middleware.
*   **Example:** A rate-limiting middleware has overly permissive limits, or authentication is applied to the wrong routes.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, denial-of-service, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Least Privilege:** Apply middleware only where needed.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test all configurations.
    *   **Middleware Order:** Understand execution order.
    *   **Well-Defined Chains:** Use tested middleware chains.
    *   **Regular Review:** Regularly review configurations.

## Attack Surface: [5. Weak TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/5__weak_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Using outdated or weak TLS ciphers/protocols exposes encrypted traffic.
*   **How Traefik Contributes:** Traefik handles TLS termination and configuration.
*   **Example:** Traefik allows TLS 1.0/1.1 or weak cipher suites.
*   **Impact:** Decryption of sensitive data, man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Ciphers/Protocols:** Use only strong TLS (1.2/1.3) and ciphers.
    *   **Traefik Options:** Use `cipherSuites` and `minVersion`.
    *   **SSL Labs Test:** Regularly assess TLS configuration.
    *   **HSTS:** Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security.

## Attack Surface: [6. Insecure Provider Integration (Docker/Kubernetes)](./attack_surfaces/6__insecure_provider_integration__dockerkubernetes_.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure configurations when integrating with Docker/Kubernetes can expose the underlying infrastructure.
*   **How Traefik Contributes:** Traefik interacts with these platforms' APIs.
*   **Example:** Traefik has excessive Kubernetes API permissions, or the Docker socket is exposed insecurely.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the container orchestration platform.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Kubernetes RBAC:** Use RBAC for *minimum* necessary permissions; dedicated service account.
    *   **Docker Socket Security:** *Never* expose the socket directly; use secure methods (TLS, SSH tunneling). Consider dind.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Audit Traefik's API access.
