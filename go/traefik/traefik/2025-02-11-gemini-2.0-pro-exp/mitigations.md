# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for traefik/traefik

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict EntryPoint Definition and Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_entrypoint_definition_and_validation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Ports:** Determine the *absolute minimum* set of ports and protocols your application needs (e.g., 80 for HTTP redirect, 443 for HTTPS).
    2.  **Explicitly Define EntryPoints:** In your Traefik configuration (static file, dynamic configuration, or CRDs), define EntryPoints *only* for those ports.  *Do not* use wildcard ports (`:*`). Example (`traefik.toml`):
        ```toml
        [entryPoints]
          [entryPoints.web]
            address = ":80"
          [entryPoints.websecure]
            address = ":443"
        ```
    3.  **Configure Redirection (HTTP to HTTPS):** Use Traefik's middleware to redirect HTTP (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443):
        ```toml
        [http.middlewares.redirect-to-https.redirectScheme]
          scheme = "https"
          permanent = true
        ```
    4.  **Validate Configuration:** Use Traefik's validation tool: `traefik check --configfile=traefik.toml` (or equivalent). Include this in your CI/CD pipeline.
    5.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically review EntryPoint configurations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintentional Service Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents accessing services not intended to be public.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Enforces HTTPS, preventing interception of unencrypted traffic.
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls (Medium Severity):** Ensures traffic goes through intended EntryPoints and middleware.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintentional Service Exposure:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low, with proper TLS).
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low/Medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   EntryPoints defined for 80 and 443 in `traefik.toml`.
    *   HTTP to HTTPS redirection via middleware.
    *   `traefik check` in CI/CD pipeline.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Regular audits of EntryPoint configurations are not formally scheduled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Dashboard Access](./mitigation_strategies/secure_dashboard_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Public Access:** Ensure the dashboard is *not* on a public-facing EntryPoint.
    2.  **Enable Basic Authentication:** Use Traefik's Basic Authentication middleware. Generate a strong, unique username and password. Example (`traefik.toml`):
        ```toml
        [http.middlewares.auth.basicAuth]
          users = ["admin:$apr1$H6uskkkW$IgXLP6ewTrSuBkTrqE8wj/"]  # Example hashed password
        [http.routers.dashboard]
          rule = "Host(`traefik.internal.example.com`) && (PathPrefix(`/api`) || PathPrefix(`/dashboard`))"
          service = "api@internal"
          middlewares = ["auth"]
        ```
    3.  **Consider Stronger Authentication (Optional):** Explore using an external authentication provider (OAuth2, OIDC) via Traefik middleware.
    4.  **Disable if Unnecessary:** If the dashboard isn't *strictly* required, disable it. Use the Traefik CLI or API.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to infrastructure and routing information.
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from modifying Traefik's configuration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Authentication enabled.
    *   Dashboard accessible only on an internal domain.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal policy to disable the dashboard if not needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Middleware Selection and Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/careful_middleware_selection_and_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Middleware:** Only use *essential* middleware.
    2.  **Review Documentation:** Thoroughly review documentation before using any middleware.
    3.  **Stay Updated:** Regularly update Traefik and all middleware.
    4.  **Staging Environment Testing:** Test all middleware configurations in a staging environment, including negative testing.
    5.  **Custom Middleware Audit:** If using custom middleware, ensure thorough security auditing and maintenance.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Middleware Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces risk of exploiting vulnerabilities.
    *   **Unexpected Middleware Behavior (Medium Severity):** Ensures middleware functions as expected.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Middleware Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Unexpected Middleware Behavior:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Minimal set of middleware used.
    *   Regular updates performed.
    *   Staging environment testing is part of deployment.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal review process for middleware documentation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong TLS Settings](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_tls_settings.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimum TLS Version:** Configure Traefik to enforce TLS 1.3 (or at least 1.2). Disable older versions. Example (`traefik.toml`):
        ```toml
        [tls.options.default]
          minVersion = "VersionTLS12"
        ```
    2.  **Strong Cipher Suites:** Specify strong, modern cipher suites. Avoid weak ciphers. Example:
        ```toml
        [tls.options.default]
          cipherSuites = [
            "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
            "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
            ...
          ]
        ```
    3.  **Enable HSTS:** Use Traefik's `headers` middleware for HSTS. Set a long `max-age`.
        ```toml
        [http.middlewares.hsts.headers]
          stsSeconds = 31536000
          stsIncludeSubdomains = true
          stsPreload = true
        ```
    4.  **Certificate Validation:** Ensure proper certificate validation.
    5.  **Automated Renewal:** Implement automated certificate renewal.
    6. **CertificatesResolvers:** Use `CertificatesResolvers` to manage certificates securely.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents interception with weak ciphers/protocols.
    *   **Certificate Spoofing (High Severity):** Ensures only valid certificates are accepted.
    *   **Downgrade Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents forcing clients to use weaker TLS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **Certificate Spoofing:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **Downgrade Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Minimum TLS version set to 1.2.
    *   HSTS enabled.
    *   Automated renewal with Let's Encrypt.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Cipher suite not explicitly defined.
    *   TLS 1.3 is not enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Precise Routing Rules and Testing](./mitigation_strategies/precise_routing_rules_and_testing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Specific Rules:** Use specific routing rules (e.g., `Host`, `PathPrefix`, `Headers`). Avoid broad rules. Example:
        ```toml
        [http.routers.my-service]
          rule = "Host(`my-service.example.com`) && PathPrefix(`/api/v1`)"
          service = "my-service"
        ```
    2.  **Prioritization:** Use the `priority` option for rule precedence.
    3.  **Negative Testing:** Test unexpected inputs and paths.
    4.  **Regular Audits:** Regularly review routing configurations.
    5.  **Least Privilege:** Grant access only to required resources.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintentional Service Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents routing to unintended services.
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls (Medium Severity):** Routes through intended middleware.
    *   **Routing Misconfigurations (Medium Severity):** Reduces errors in routing rules.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintentional Service Exposure:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low/Medium).
    *   **Routing Misconfigurations:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Specific routing rules used.
    *   Testing of routing rules included in deployment.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Negative testing not explicitly part of strategy.
    *   Regular audits not formally scheduled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Header Handling](./mitigation_strategies/careful_header_handling.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Forwarded Headers:** Know which headers Traefik forwards by default.
    2.  **Control Forwarded Headers:** Use Traefik's `headers` middleware to control forwarded headers. Remove or sanitize if needed.
    3. **ForwardedHeaders Middleware:** Use `ForwardedHeaders` middleware to handle `X-Forwarded-*` headers according to RFC 7239.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **IP Spoofing (Medium Severity):** Prevents spoofing via forwarded headers.
    *   **Information Leakage (Low Severity):** Prevents leaking sensitive headers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **IP Spoofing:** Risk reduced significantly (Medium to Low).
    *   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduced (Low to Negligible).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Backend services trust Traefik's IP for `X-Forwarded-For`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No explicit configuration to control forwarded headers.
    *   `ForwardedHeaders` middleware is not used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Resource Constraints](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_resource_constraints.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Rate Limiting:** Use Traefik's `RateLimit` middleware. Configure limits based on traffic patterns. Example:
        ```toml
        [http.middlewares.rate-limit.rateLimit]
          average = 100
          burst = 200
          period = "1m"
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Protects Traefik from excessive requests.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents excessive resource consumption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rate limiting is *not* implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Request Body Size](./mitigation_strategies/limit_request_body_size.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify Maximum Body Size:** Determine the maximum expected size of request bodies.
    2. **Configure Buffering Middleware:** Use Traefik's `buffering` middleware to set `maxRequestBodyBytes`. Example:
       ```toml
       [http.middlewares.limit-body-size.buffering]
         maxRequestBodyBytes = 10485760  # 10MB
       ```
    3. **Apply Middleware to Routes:** Apply the middleware to relevant routes.
    4. **Test Limits:** Thoroughly test the configured limits.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents large requests from causing DoS.
    * **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Limits memory used for buffering.

* **Impact:**
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low/Medium).
    * **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Not implemented.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * The `buffering` middleware is not configured.
