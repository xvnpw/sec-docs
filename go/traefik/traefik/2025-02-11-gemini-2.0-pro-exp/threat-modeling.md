# Threat Model Analysis for traefik/traefik

## Threat: [Threat: Unauthenticated Traefik Dashboard Access](./threats/threat_unauthenticated_traefik_dashboard_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Traefik dashboard.  This typically happens because the dashboard is enabled without any authentication or with easily guessable default credentials.  The attacker can view sensitive configuration details (backend addresses, routing rules, potentially exposed secrets) and, *critically*, modify the Traefik configuration. This allows them to redirect traffic, expose internal services, or disable security features.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Complete system compromise:**  The attacker can fully control Traefik and, by extension, the traffic flowing through it.
    *   **Data breach:**  Exposure of sensitive configuration information and potentially backend data.
    *   **Service disruption:**  Malicious configuration changes can cause widespread outages.
*   **Traefik Component Affected:**  `Dashboard` component, `API` entrypoint (if exposed without authentication).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable the dashboard in production:** If not absolutely essential for operational monitoring, disable it entirely.
    *   **Enable strong authentication:**  Use Basic Authentication, OAuth2, or Forward Authentication with a robust identity provider.  *Never* use default credentials.
    *   **Restrict network access:**  Use firewall rules or network policies (e.g., Kubernetes NetworkPolicies) to limit access to the dashboard to *only* trusted IP addresses or networks.
    *   **Use a separate entrypoint:** Configure the dashboard on a dedicated entrypoint that is *not* exposed to the public internet.
    *   **Regularly audit access logs:** Monitor for unauthorized access attempts and investigate any anomalies.

## Threat: [Threat: Weak TLS Configuration](./threats/threat_weak_tls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or modifies traffic due to weak TLS settings within Traefik. This includes using outdated TLS protocols (TLS 1.0, 1.1), weak cipher suites (vulnerable to known attacks like BEAST, CRIME, POODLE), or improperly configured certificates (self-signed in production, expired, weak keys). The attacker employs man-in-the-middle (MITM) techniques to exploit these weaknesses.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data breach:**  Interception of sensitive data (credentials, personal information, etc.) transmitted between clients and backend services.
    *   **Loss of confidentiality and integrity:**  Attacker can read and modify data in transit.
    *   **Compromised user sessions:**  Attacker can hijack user sessions and impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Traefik Component Affected:**  `TLS` configuration within `EntryPoints`, `Routers`, and `Certificates` configuration (if using Let's Encrypt or manual certificate management).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce TLS 1.2 or 1.3 only:**  Explicitly disable older, vulnerable TLS versions in Traefik's configuration.
    *   **Use strong cipher suites:**  Select cipher suites recommended by security best practices (e.g., Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator).  Regularly review and update the allowed cipher suites.
    *   **Use valid, trusted certificates:**  Obtain certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).  Avoid self-signed certificates in production environments.
    *   **Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):**  Configure HSTS middleware in Traefik to force clients to use HTTPS.
    *   **Automate certificate renewal:**  Use Let's Encrypt or another ACME provider for automated certificate renewal to prevent expiration issues.
    *   **Monitor certificate expiration:**  Implement monitoring and alerting to notify administrators of impending certificate expiry.

## Threat: [Threat: Unintended Service Exposure via Misconfigured Router](./threats/threat_unintended_service_exposure_via_misconfigured_router.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a backend service that *should not* be publicly accessible due to an error in Traefik's routing configuration. This is often caused by overly broad routing rules (e.g., using a wildcard that matches unintended paths), incorrect host matching, or errors in regular expressions used in the `rule` definition. The attacker simply sends HTTP requests to the exposed service's address.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data breach:**  Direct access to sensitive data or internal APIs that were not intended for public exposure.
    *   **System compromise:**  Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the exposed backend service, potentially leading to further compromise.
    *   **Denial of service:**  The exposed service could be overloaded by malicious or unintentional traffic.
*   **Traefik Component Affected:**  `Routers` configuration, specifically the `rule` definition (including `Host`, `Path`, `PathPrefix`, `Headers`, and other matching criteria).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of least privilege:**  Create *highly specific* routing rules that match *only* the intended traffic.  Avoid overly broad wildcards or regular expressions.
    *   **Thorough testing:**  Rigorously test routing rules in a staging environment to verify they behave as expected *before* deploying to production.
    *   **Regular expression review:**  Carefully review and validate any regular expressions used in routing rules to ensure they are precise and do not unintentionally match unintended paths.
    *   **Input validation (at the backend):** While not a Traefik-specific mitigation, ensure backend services perform proper input validation to prevent attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in those services.
    *   **Regular audits:**  Periodically review and audit routing rules to ensure they remain appropriate and haven't become overly permissive over time.

## Threat: [Threat: Denial of Service (DoS) via Unconfigured Rate Limiting](./threats/threat_denial_of_service__dos__via_unconfigured_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods Traefik with a large volume of requests, overwhelming the server and making it unavailable to legitimate users. This is possible if Traefik's rate limiting features are not configured or are configured too permissively. The attacker uses automated tools to generate a high volume of requests, targeting specific routes or the entire Traefik instance.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Service unavailability:**  Legitimate users are unable to access services proxied by Traefik.
    *   **Resource exhaustion:**  Traefik server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) are consumed, potentially impacting other services on the same host.
    *   **Financial loss:**  Downtime of critical applications can lead to significant financial losses.
*   **Traefik Component Affected:**  `RateLimit` middleware.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement rate limiting:**  Configure the `RateLimit` middleware to limit the number of requests from a single IP address or client within a defined time period.
    *   **Configure appropriate limits:**  Set rate limits based on expected traffic patterns and server capacity.  Start with conservative limits and adjust as needed.
    *   **Combine rate limiting techniques:**  Consider using different rate limiting strategies (e.g., IP-based, header-based, or based on other request attributes) for different routes or services.
    *   **Monitor traffic:**  Continuously monitor request rates and identify potential DoS attacks.  Implement alerting for unusual traffic spikes.
    *   **Consider a WAF:** While not strictly a Traefik-only solution, a Web Application Firewall (WAF) can provide an additional layer of protection against DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Threat: Exploitation of Traefik Vulnerability (e.g., CVE)](./threats/threat_exploitation_of_traefik_vulnerability__e_g___cve_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in the Traefik codebase itself. The attacker crafts a malicious request or payload that triggers the vulnerability, potentially leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or, in the worst case, remote code execution (RCE). The attacker researches known vulnerabilities (CVEs) or develops exploits for previously unknown (zero-day) vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Variable, depending on the vulnerability:**  Ranges from service disruption (DoS) to complete system compromise (RCE).
    *   **Data breach:**  Potential access to sensitive data handled by Traefik or the backend services.
    *   **Remote code execution (RCE):**  Attacker gains full control of the Traefik server and potentially the underlying host.
*   **Traefik Component Affected:**  Potentially *any* component, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE vulnerabilities), High (for information disclosure or DoS vulnerabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Traefik up-to-date:**  Apply security patches *immediately* upon release.  Subscribe to Traefik's security announcements and mailing lists.
    *   **Monitor vulnerability databases (CVE):**  Regularly check for newly discovered vulnerabilities affecting Traefik.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help mitigate some exploits, particularly for known vulnerabilities, by filtering malicious requests.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and potentially block malicious requests.
    *   **Regular security audits and penetration testing:**  Proactively identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

## Threat: [Threat: Insecure File Provider Configuration](./threats/threat_insecure_file_provider_configuration.md)

*    **Description:** When using the file provider for dynamic configuration, an attacker gains access to sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.) stored within the configuration files. This occurs due to improperly set file permissions, allowing unauthorized users or processes to read the configuration data. The attacker might exploit OS-level vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain file access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential theft:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to potential compromise of other systems.
    *   **System compromise:** Attackers can leverage stolen credentials to access other services or systems.
*   **Traefik Component Affected:** `File` provider.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict file permissions:** Ensure *only* the Traefik process has read access to the configuration files. Use the most restrictive permissions possible (e.g., `600` or `400` on Unix-like systems).
    *   **Secrets management solution:** *Avoid* storing sensitive information directly in configuration files. Use a dedicated secrets management solution (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets).
    *   **Regular permission audits:** Periodically audit file permissions to ensure they haven't been accidentally changed.
    *   **Alternative provider:** If feasible, consider using a more secure provider for dynamic configuration, such as a key-value store (etcd, Consul) with proper access controls, rather than the file provider.
