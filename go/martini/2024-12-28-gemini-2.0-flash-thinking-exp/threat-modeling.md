## High and Critical Martini Threats

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Route Hijacking/Conflict** | An attacker crafts a URL that matches multiple defined routes due to overlapping or poorly defined patterns within Martini's routing mechanism. This can lead to an unintended handler being executed, potentially exposing sensitive data or performing unauthorized actions. | Unauthorized access to resources, execution of unintended logic, potential data manipulation. | `Router` (specifically the route matching logic) | High | Define routes with clear and specific patterns. Avoid overly broad or ambiguous route definitions. Utilize Martini's route ordering to prioritize more specific routes. Implement thorough testing of all defined routes. |
| **ReDoS in Route Definitions** | If regular expressions are used for route matching within Martini, a malicious actor can craft a URL that causes the regex engine to backtrack excessively, leading to high CPU consumption and a denial of service. | Denial of Service (DoS), application slowdown or crash. | `Router` (when using regular expressions for route matching) | High | Carefully review and test all regular expressions used in route definitions. Avoid overly complex or nested regex patterns. Consider using simpler string matching where possible. Implement timeouts for regex matching operations if the underlying regex engine supports it. |
| **Middleware Ordering Bypass** | An attacker exploits an incorrect order of middleware execution within Martini to bypass security checks. For example, if an authentication middleware is placed after an authorization middleware, an unauthenticated user might gain access. | Unauthorized access, data breaches, privilege escalation. | `Middleware Chain` (the order in which middleware is added) | Critical | Carefully plan and document the order of middleware execution. Ensure authentication and authorization middleware are placed early in the chain. Implement thorough testing of the middleware chain. |
| **Information Leakage through Martini's Default Error Handling** | Martini's default error handling exposes detailed error messages, including stack traces and internal paths, which can reveal sensitive information about the application's structure and implementation to an attacker. | Information Disclosure, aiding attackers in identifying vulnerabilities. | `Error Handler` (Martini's built-in error handling) | High | Configure Martini to display generic error messages in production environments. Implement custom error handling logic to control the information exposed in error responses. Log detailed error information securely for debugging purposes. |
