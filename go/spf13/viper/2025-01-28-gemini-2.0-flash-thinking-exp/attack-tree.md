## Attack Tree Path: [Control Configuration File -> File Inclusion/Overwrite](./attack_tree_paths/control_configuration_file_-_file_inclusionoverwrite.md)

*   **Action:** Exploit vulnerabilities allowing file write or inclusion to modify Viper configuration files (e.g., path traversal, insecure file upload, misconfigured permissions).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium-High (Common web app vulnerabilities, misconfigurations possible)
*   **Impact:** High-Critical (Configuration manipulation, potential RCE, data breach)
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Tools and techniques readily available)
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium (Basic web app exploitation skills)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (File system monitoring, integrity checks can help, but initial overwrite might be missed)

## Attack Tree Path: [Control Environment Variables -> Environment Variable Injection](./attack_tree_paths/control_environment_variables_-_environment_variable_injection.md)

*   **Action:** Inject malicious environment variables that Viper reads and uses to override or manipulate application settings.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on environment access, containerization, cloud environments might limit this, but still possible in some setups)
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (Configuration manipulation, potential privilege escalation, service disruption)
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Relatively easy if attacker gains access to the environment)
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium (Basic system administration/environment manipulation skills)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Environment variable changes can be logged, but might be missed in noisy environments)

## Attack Tree Path: [Control Environment Variables -> Environment Variable Precedence Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/control_environment_variables_-_environment_variable_precedence_exploitation.md)

*   **Action:** Understand Viper's precedence rules and leverage environment variables to override intended configuration values, especially in production environments where environment variables are often used.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium-High (Common practice to use env vars in production, precedence rules can be exploited if not well understood)
*   **Impact:** Medium (Configuration manipulation, potentially subtle changes in application behavior)
*   **Effort:** Low (Requires understanding Viper's precedence, but easy to execute)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic understanding of configuration and environment variables)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Very difficult to detect as it might look like legitimate configuration, unless deviations from intended config are monitored)

## Attack Tree Path: [Control Remote Configuration Source -> Compromise Remote Source Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/control_remote_configuration_source_-_compromise_remote_source_credentials.md)

*   **Action:** Obtain credentials for remote configuration sources (e.g., etcd, Consul) if used by Viper, allowing direct manipulation of configuration data.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Depends on security of credential management, secrets rotation, etc.)
*   **Impact:** Critical (Full control over application configuration, potential for complete compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium-High (Requires bypassing authentication and authorization mechanisms of the remote source)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High (Requires understanding of authentication, authorization, and potentially cryptography)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Access logs of remote source, anomaly detection on configuration changes can help)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Viper's Configuration Processing -> Default Configuration Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_viper's_configuration_processing_-_default_configuration_exploitation.md)

*   **Action:** If the application relies heavily on Viper's default values and these defaults are insecure or predictable, exploit these defaults when other configuration sources are unavailable or can be bypassed.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Developers might rely on defaults, especially in early stages, and defaults might not always be secure)
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (Depends on the nature of insecure defaults, could lead to weakened security, information disclosure, etc.)
*   **Effort:** Low (Requires understanding of default configurations, often easily discoverable)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic understanding of configuration and application defaults)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Very difficult to detect as it relies on *lack* of configuration, might look like intended behavior if defaults are not well-documented)

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Application Logic via Viper Configuration -> Insecure Configuration Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_application_logic_via_viper_configuration_-_insecure_configuration_parameters.md)

*   **Action:** Identify configuration parameters managed by Viper that directly control security-sensitive aspects of the application (e.g., database credentials, API keys, feature flags, allowed origins, insecure defaults enabled via config). Manipulate these parameters to weaken security or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium-High (Common issue, developers might expose sensitive settings via configuration)
*   **Impact:** High-Critical (Data breach, unauthorized access, privilege escalation, depending on the sensitive parameter)
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Requires reconnaissance to identify sensitive parameters, but manipulation is often straightforward)
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium (Basic understanding of application configuration and security principles)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Configuration changes can be logged, but detecting *insecure* configuration requires security policy enforcement and monitoring)
