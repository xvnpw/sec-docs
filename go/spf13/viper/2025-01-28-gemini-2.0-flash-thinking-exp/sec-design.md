# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Simplify configuration management for Go applications.
  - Provide a flexible and easy-to-use configuration library that supports multiple configuration formats and sources.
  - Enable developers to easily manage application settings across different environments (development, staging, production).
  - Reduce configuration errors and improve application reliability.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk of misconfiguration in applications using viper, leading to application downtime or incorrect behavior.
  - Risk of security vulnerabilities in viper library itself, potentially affecting all applications that depend on it.
  - Risk of supply chain attacks targeting viper's dependencies, which could introduce vulnerabilities.
  - Risk of sensitive configuration data being exposed if not handled properly by applications using viper.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions to the viper repository (implicitly assumed for open-source projects).
  - security control: Usage of Go's built-in security features and standard library functions.
  - security control: Dependency management using `go modules` to track and manage dependencies.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by viper. Mitigation relies on dependency updates and security scanning.
  - accepted risk: Misuse of viper library by developers leading to insecure configurations in their applications. This is considered developer's responsibility.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the viper library to proactively find and fix security issues.
  - recommended security control: Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to detect and alert on vulnerable dependencies.
  - recommended security control: Provide clear documentation and examples on secure configuration practices when using viper, especially for handling sensitive data.
  - recommended security control: Consider adding fuzzing to the testing process to discover input validation vulnerabilities.
  - recommended security control: Generate and publish Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to enhance supply chain transparency.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to viper library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using viper.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to viper library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using viper.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Viper must robustly handle various input formats (JSON, YAML, TOML, etc.) and sources (files, environment variables, remote configurations) without being vulnerable to injection attacks or parsing errors.
    - Requirement: Implement input validation to ensure that configuration values are within expected ranges and formats, preventing unexpected behavior or security issues in applications using viper.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If viper is used to handle sensitive configuration data (e.g., secrets), applications should use appropriate encryption mechanisms to protect this data at rest and in transit. Viper itself might not need to implement cryptography, but should not hinder its usage by applications.
    - Requirement: Consider providing guidance or examples on how to securely handle sensitive configuration data with viper, potentially integrating with secret management solutions.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure configuration of Go applications is a critical process. Misconfiguration can lead to application failures, data breaches, or other security incidents. Viper aims to simplify and improve this process, but vulnerabilities in Viper or its misuse can introduce risks.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The data being protected is application configuration data. The sensitivity of this data varies depending on the application. Configuration data can include:
    - Non-sensitive data: Application settings, feature flags.
    - Sensitive data: API keys, database credentials, private keys, and other secrets.
  - If Viper is used to manage sensitive configuration data, it becomes crucial to ensure the security of Viper itself and the applications using it. Exposure of sensitive configuration data can lead to significant security breaches.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific security considerations taken into account during the development of Viper?
  - Are there any plans to incorporate more security-focused features into Viper, such as built-in secret management or configuration validation?
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported in Viper or its dependencies?
  - Are there guidelines or best practices documented for developers on how to securely use Viper, especially when handling sensitive configuration data?
- Assumptions:
  - Assumption: Viper is intended to be used in a wide range of Go applications, including those that handle sensitive data.
  - Assumption: Security is a significant concern for users of Viper, and they expect the library to be developed and maintained with security in mind.
  - Assumption: Developers using Viper are responsible for implementing security controls in their applications, but Viper should provide a secure foundation and not introduce unnecessary security risks.
  - Assumption: The build and release process for Viper includes basic security checks like linting and testing, but further security measures might be beneficial.
