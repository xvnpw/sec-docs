## Attack Tree Path: [[[Manipulate Configuration Source]]](./attack_tree_paths/__manipulate_configuration_source__.md)

**Description:** This is the overarching critical node representing the attacker's attempt to alter the configuration data that Viper uses. It's the primary entry point for the high-risk path.
**Why Critical:** Compromising the configuration source gives the attacker direct control over how the application behaves, making it a highly valuable target.

## Attack Tree Path: [==Modify Config File==](./attack_tree_paths/==modify_config_file==.md)

**Description:** This high-risk path involves directly changing the contents of the application's configuration file (e.g., YAML, JSON, TOML).
**Why High-Risk:** This is a common and often successful attack vector due to misconfigurations, weak permissions, or vulnerabilities that allow file system access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[FS Access]]](./attack_tree_paths/__fs_access__.md)

**Description:** This critical node represents the attacker gaining unauthorized access to the file system where the configuration file resides.
**Why Critical:** This is a prerequisite for modifying the configuration file. Without file system access, the attacker cannot directly alter the file's contents.
**Attack Methods:**
    *   Exploiting operating system vulnerabilities.
    *   Leveraging weak user account passwords.
    *   Exploiting other application vulnerabilities that allow file system access (e.g., path traversal).
    *   Social engineering to gain access to credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [[ACLs Weak] -> [[Permissions (RWX)]]](./attack_tree_paths/_acls_weak__-___permissions__rwx___.md)

**Description:** This represents the exploitation of weak Access Control Lists (ACLs) leading to overly permissive file permissions (Read, Write, Execute). The arrow indicates that weak ACLs *result in* exploitable permissions. `[[Permissions (RWX)]]` is the critical node because it's the direct enabler of the file modification.
**Why Critical (Permissions (RWX)):** If the configuration file has write permissions for unauthorized users or groups, the attacker can directly modify it without needing to exploit further vulnerabilities.
**Attack Methods:**
    *   Directly modifying the file if the attacker already has the necessary permissions (e.g., the file is world-writable).
    *   Exploiting a process running with higher privileges that has write access to the file.
**Why Weak ACLs are important:**
    *   ACLs are often misconfigured, especially in development or testing environments.
    *   Even if the immediate user doesn't have write access, a misconfigured ACL might grant it to a group the user belongs to, or to "everyone."
**Mitigation:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** The configuration file should only be readable by the application process and, ideally, only writable during deployment by a dedicated deployment user/process.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit file permissions and ACLs to ensure they are configured correctly.
    *   **Use a dedicated user:** Run the application under a dedicated user account with minimal privileges.
