## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Viper [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_viper__critical_node_.md)

* This is the root goal of the attacker. Success at any of the child nodes can lead to this ultimate compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Configuration Sources [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_configuration_sources__critical_node_.md)

* Attackers aim to alter where Viper reads its configuration from. Success here grants significant control over the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Configuration Files [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_configuration_files__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

* Attackers directly alter the application's configuration files.
    * **Exploit File Upload Vulnerability [HIGH RISK]:**
        * Attackers leverage weaknesses in the application's file upload functionality to upload malicious configuration files, overwriting legitimate ones or introducing new ones that Viper reads.
    * **Gain Unauthorized Access to Server [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * Attackers gain unauthorized access to the server hosting the application (e.g., via SSH, RDP, or exploiting other server vulnerabilities). Once inside, they can directly modify configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Environment Variables [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_environment_variables__high_risk_.md)

* Attackers aim to control the environment variables that Viper reads configuration from. This can be achieved through:
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities allowing environment variable injection (e.g., command injection flaws).
    * Compromising the environment where the application runs (e.g., container orchestration platforms).

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Remote Configuration Source [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_remote_configuration_source__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

* If Viper is configured to fetch configurations from remote sources, attackers target these sources.
    * **Exploit Remote Source Authentication:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the authentication or authorization mechanisms of the remote configuration service (e.g., weak credentials, missing authentication).
    * **Compromise Network Communication [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers intercept and manipulate the communication between the application and the remote configuration source (Man-in-the-Middle attack), allowing them to inject malicious configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Misuse of Viper [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_misuse_of_viper__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

* This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application *uses* Viper.
    * **Lack of Input Validation on Configuration Values [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Provide Malicious Configuration Values [HIGH RISK]:** The application directly uses configuration values without proper validation or sanitization. Attackers can provide malicious values that are then used in sensitive operations, leading to vulnerabilities like SQL injection, command injection, or path traversal.
    * **Over-Reliance on Configuration for Security-Critical Settings [HIGH RISK]:**
        * **Exploit Configurable Security Settings [HIGH RISK]:** Security-critical settings (e.g., API keys, encryption keys, authentication parameters) are stored in configuration and can be modified by attackers if they gain access to the configuration sources.
    * **Exposing Configuration Endpoints [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Access and Modify Exposed Endpoint [HIGH RISK]:** The application unintentionally or intentionally exposes endpoints that allow viewing or modifying the application's configuration. Attackers can access these endpoints (if not properly secured) and manipulate the configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Viper's Configuration Loading and Merging Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_viper's_configuration_loading_and_merging_logic.md)

* **Configuration Overriding Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]:**
    * **Exploit Precedence Rules [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers exploit Viper's configuration merging logic and precedence rules. They inject malicious configuration values through a source with higher precedence than legitimate configurations, effectively overriding secure settings.
