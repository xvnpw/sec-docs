# Attack Surface Analysis for spf13/viper

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Configuration File Read](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_configuration_file_read.md)

- **Description:** An attacker can force the application to load a configuration file from an unintended location on the file system.
  - **How Viper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Viper's functionality of loading configuration files from a path specified in code or through external input (e.g., command-line flags, environment variables) allows for the possibility of an attacker controlling this path.
  - **Example:** An application uses a command-line flag `-config` to specify the configuration file. An attacker could run the application with `-config /etc/passwd` to potentially read the contents of the password file.
  - **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potential for further exploitation based on the revealed data.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Strictly control and sanitize any user-provided input that influences the configuration file path.
    - Use relative paths where possible and avoid constructing file paths dynamically based on untrusted input.
    - Implement checks to ensure the configuration file path is within an expected directory.

## Attack Surface: [Loading Malicious Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/loading_malicious_configuration_files.md)

- **Description:** The application loads a configuration file from an untrusted source containing malicious content.
  - **How Viper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Viper parses various configuration file formats (YAML, JSON, TOML, etc.). Vulnerabilities in the underlying parsing libraries could be exploited by crafting malicious files. Additionally, malicious configurations can override legitimate settings.
  - **Example:** An application fetches configuration from a remote Git repository. An attacker compromises the repository and injects a malicious YAML file that exploits a known vulnerability in the YAML parsing library, leading to remote code execution.
  - **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial-of-service, configuration manipulation leading to security bypasses or data corruption.
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Only load configuration files from trusted and verified sources.
    - Implement integrity checks (e.g., digital signatures) for configuration files.
    - Sanitize and validate configuration data after loading to ensure it conforms to expected types and values.
    - Keep Viper and its underlying parsing libraries updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Overrides for Sensitive Settings](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_overrides_for_sensitive_settings.md)

- **Description:** An attacker with control over the environment where the application runs can override sensitive configuration settings using environment variables.
  - **How Viper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Viper's default behavior includes reading configuration from environment variables, allowing them to override values set in configuration files.
  - **Example:** An application stores database credentials in a configuration file. An attacker sets environment variables with malicious database credentials, causing the application to connect to an attacker-controlled database.
  - **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, manipulation of application behavior.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Be mindful of which configuration values are sensitive and avoid relying solely on environment variables for critical settings.
    - Implement a clear precedence order for configuration sources, making file-based configurations the primary source for sensitive data.
    - Consider using a dedicated secret management solution instead of environment variables for sensitive information.
    - Document clearly which environment variables are used for configuration and their intended purpose.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration.md)

- **Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) is stored directly within configuration files or environment variables accessible to unauthorized individuals.
  - **How Viper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Viper makes it easy to access configuration values, but it doesn't inherently provide secure storage for sensitive data.
  - **Example:** An API key is stored as a plain text value in a configuration file that is committed to a public repository.
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, account compromise.
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files or environment variables.
    - Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and integrate them with your application.
    - If direct storage is unavoidable, encrypt sensitive data within configuration files.
    - Ensure proper access controls are in place for configuration files and the environment where the application runs.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Remote Configuration Retrieval](./attack_surfaces/insecure_remote_configuration_retrieval.md)

- **Description:** If Viper is configured to fetch configuration from remote sources, insecure communication channels or authentication mechanisms can be exploited.
  - **How Viper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Viper supports fetching configuration from remote key/value stores (e.g., etcd, Consul). If not configured securely, this introduces new attack vectors.
  - **Example:** An application fetches configuration from a remote etcd server over an unencrypted HTTP connection. An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack and injects malicious configuration data.
  - **Impact:** Configuration manipulation, remote code execution (depending on the manipulated settings), denial-of-service.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Always use secure protocols (HTTPS) when fetching configuration from remote sources.
    - Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing remote configuration stores.
    - Verify the identity of the remote configuration server.
    - Consider encrypting configuration data in transit and at rest in the remote store.
