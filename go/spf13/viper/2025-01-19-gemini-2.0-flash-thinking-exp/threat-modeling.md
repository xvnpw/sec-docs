# Threat Model Analysis for spf13/viper

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration File Injection](./threats/malicious_configuration_file_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains write access to configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON, TOML) used by Viper. They modify these files to inject malicious configuration values. This could involve changing application behavior, injecting malicious URLs, or providing credentials for unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service, privilege escalation.

**Affected Viper Component:** Configuration Loading (File Reading)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict file system permissions to prevent unauthorized modification of configuration files.
*   Store configuration files in secure locations with restricted access.
*   Use integrity checks (e.g., checksums, signatures) to verify the authenticity of configuration files before loading.
*   Consider encrypting sensitive data within configuration files.

## Threat: [Environment Variable Injection/Manipulation](./threats/environment_variable_injectionmanipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker can set or modify environment variables that the application uses for configuration through Viper. This could be achieved through compromised systems or by exploiting vulnerabilities in other parts of the application or operating system. The attacker can inject malicious values to alter application behavior.

**Impact:**  Unexpected application behavior, security bypasses, data manipulation, potential for command injection if configuration values are used in system calls.

**Affected Viper Component:** Configuration Loading (Environment Variables)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize and validate environment variables used for configuration within the application.
*   Limit the scope and permissions of processes that can set environment variables.
*   Avoid relying solely on environment variables for critical security configurations.
*   Consider using a more secure secret management system for sensitive information.

## Threat: [Remote Configuration Source Poisoning](./threats/remote_configuration_source_poisoning.md)

**Description:** If Viper is configured to fetch configuration from remote sources (e.g., Consul, etcd), an attacker compromises these remote sources. They then inject malicious configuration data that Viper retrieves, leading to compromised application behavior.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service, application takeover.

**Affected Viper Component:** Remote Configuration (e.g., `viper.AddRemoteProvider`)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the remote configuration sources with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   Use encrypted communication channels (e.g., TLS) when fetching remote configuration data.
*   Implement verification mechanisms (e.g., signatures) for remote configuration data before applying it.
*   Regularly audit the security of the remote configuration infrastructure.

## Threat: [Parsing Vulnerabilities Exploitation](./threats/parsing_vulnerabilities_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Viper relies on underlying libraries (e.g., `go-yaml`, `go-toml`) to parse configuration files. An attacker crafts malicious configuration files that exploit vulnerabilities in these parsing libraries, potentially leading to crashes, resource exhaustion, or even code execution.

**Impact:** Denial of service, potential for remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.

**Affected Viper Component:** Configuration Parsing (e.g., `viper.ReadInConfig`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Viper and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential parsing issues in configuration files.
*   Implement input validation on configuration data even after parsing.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:**  Sensitive configuration values (e.g., API keys, passwords, database credentials) retrieved through Viper are unintentionally logged, exposed in error messages, or leaked through other channels.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches.

**Affected Viper Component:** Configuration Access (All retrieval functions)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement secure logging practices, avoiding logging sensitive configuration data.
*   Use dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) instead of storing sensitive data directly in configuration files.
*   Be mindful of where and how configuration values are used and potentially exposed.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on Viper or Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_viper_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The `spf13/viper` library itself or one of its dependencies is compromised, and malicious code is introduced. This could happen through compromised maintainer accounts or vulnerabilities in the dependency management system.

**Impact:**  Wide-ranging impact, potentially leading to full application compromise.

**Affected Viper Component:**  All components

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use dependency management tools to track and verify dependencies.
*   Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.
*   Consider using software composition analysis (SCA) tools to monitor for supply chain risks.
*   Pin specific versions of Viper and its dependencies in your project's dependency file.
