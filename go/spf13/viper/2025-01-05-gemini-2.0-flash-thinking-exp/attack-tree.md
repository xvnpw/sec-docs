## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Loading Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_loading_mechanisms.md)

This critical node represents the various ways an attacker can interfere with how Viper loads the application's configuration. Success at this node allows the attacker to influence the application's behavior from the outset.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Configuration Files -> Gain Write Access to Configuration File Location](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_configuration_files_-_gain_write_access_to_configuration_file_location.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  An attacker aims to obtain write access to the directories where the application stores its configuration files. This could be achieved through various means:
    * **Exploiting Operating System Vulnerabilities:**  Leveraging weaknesses in the underlying operating system's security to gain elevated privileges and modify file permissions.
    * **Compromising User Accounts:** Gaining access to a user account that has write permissions to the configuration file location.
    * **Exploiting Application Vulnerabilities:**  Finding vulnerabilities in the application itself or other related services that allow writing to arbitrary file locations.
    * **Social Engineering:** Tricking administrators or operators into granting unauthorized access or making configuration changes.
* **Impact:** If successful, the attacker can directly modify the configuration files to inject malicious settings. This could include changing API keys, database credentials, security settings, or any other configuration parameter that influences the application's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_configuration_files.md)

This critical node signifies the direct act of altering the application's configuration files. Successful manipulation here grants the attacker significant control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Environment Variables](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_environment_variables.md)

This critical node focuses on the attack vector of manipulating environment variables that Viper uses for configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Environment Variables -> Inject Malicious Environment Variables](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_environment_variables_-_inject_malicious_environment_variables.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker seeks to inject malicious environment variables into the environment where the application is running. This can be done in several ways:
    * **Compromising the Host System:** If the application runs on a compromised server, the attacker can directly set environment variables.
    * **Exploiting Container Orchestration Vulnerabilities:** In containerized environments (like Docker or Kubernetes), vulnerabilities in the orchestration platform could allow attackers to inject environment variables into the application's container.
    * **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Intercepting and modifying the application's startup process to inject environment variables.
* **Impact:**  Successfully injected malicious environment variables can override existing configurations, potentially exposing sensitive data, changing application behavior, or even allowing for remote code execution if configuration values are used insecurely.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Environment Variables -> Exploit Conflicting Precedence Rules (if environment variables override critical settings unexpectedly)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_environment_variables_-_exploit_conflicting_precedence_rules__if_environment_variables_ov_97d51fe0.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This attack leverages Viper's configuration precedence rules. Attackers exploit the fact that environment variables often have a higher precedence than configuration files. By setting specific environment variables, they can override critical settings defined in the files, even without having write access to those files.
* **Impact:** This can lead to a variety of issues, from subtle changes in application behavior to complete security bypasses, depending on which settings are overridden. The effort required is often trivial, making it a high-risk path despite potentially moderate immediate impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Viper's Parsing and Merging Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_viper's_parsing_and_merging_logic.md)

This critical node represents vulnerabilities within Viper's core functionality for parsing and merging configuration data from different sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Merging Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_merging_behavior.md)

This critical node specifically focuses on exploiting how Viper merges configurations from different sources based on precedence rules.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Viper's Parsing and Merging Logic -> Exploit Configuration Merging Behavior -> Override Critical Settings with Less Secure Values](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_viper's_parsing_and_merging_logic_-_exploit_configuration_merging_behavior_-_override_critic_382d4516.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits the order in which Viper merges configuration sources. By providing a configuration value in a source with higher precedence (e.g., environment variables or command-line flags) than the intended secure setting in a configuration file, the attacker can effectively override the secure setting with a less secure or malicious value.
* **Impact:** This can have significant security implications. For example, an attacker might override a strong authentication mechanism with a weaker one, disable security features, or redirect the application to malicious external resources. The effort required for this attack is often minimal, especially if the configuration precedence is not well-understood or documented.
