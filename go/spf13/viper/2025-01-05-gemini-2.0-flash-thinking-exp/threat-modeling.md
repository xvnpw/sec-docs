# Threat Model Analysis for spf13/viper

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration Files](./threats/malicious_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON, TOML) used by Viper. They modify these files to inject malicious settings, such as changing database credentials, API keys, redirect URLs, or feature flags. This directly impacts Viper's ability to load trusted configurations.

**Impact:**  Leads to unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, application malfunction, redirection to malicious sites, or the enabling of unintended and potentially harmful features due to Viper loading and using the malicious configuration.

**Viper Component Affected:**
* `viper.ReadConfigFromFile()`
* `viper.SetConfigType()`
* `viper.AddConfigPath()`
* Underlying parsing libraries used by Viper (e.g., `yaml`, `json`, `toml`) during the loading process.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls on configuration files and directories.
* Store configuration files in secure locations with restricted access.
* Use file integrity monitoring systems to detect unauthorized modifications before Viper loads the file.
* Implement code reviews to ensure proper handling of configuration values *after* Viper loads them.
* Consider using immutable infrastructure for configuration files.

## Threat: [Compromised Environment Variables](./threats/compromised_environment_variables.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control over the environment where the application runs and injects or modifies environment variables that Viper is configured to read. This directly influences the configuration Viper loads and uses.

**Impact:** Similar to malicious configuration files, this can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, application malfunction, or the enabling of harmful features because Viper uses the attacker-controlled environment variables.

**Viper Component Affected:**
* `viper.AutomaticEnv()`
* `viper.BindEnv()`
* `viper.SetEnvPrefix()`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong security measures for the application's runtime environment.
* Avoid storing sensitive secrets directly in environment variables that Viper reads. Use dedicated secret management solutions.
* Limit the scope and permissions of processes running the application to prevent unauthorized environment variable manipulation that Viper would then read.
* Regularly audit and monitor environment variable configurations.

## Threat: [Insecure Remote Configuration Sources](./threats/insecure_remote_configuration_sources.md)

**Description:** If Viper is configured to fetch configuration from remote sources (e.g., etcd, Consul, remote HTTP endpoints), an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the authentication, authorization, or transport mechanisms of these sources. This results in Viper fetching and using malicious configuration data.

**Impact:** Can lead to the application loading malicious configurations, exposure of sensitive configuration data during transit to Viper, or denial of service if Viper cannot retrieve its configuration.

**Viper Component Affected:**
* Functions related to remote configuration providers (e.g., if custom providers are implemented) used by Viper to fetch the data.
* Potentially the underlying HTTP client or other communication libraries used by custom providers *within Viper's context*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for remote configuration sources accessed by Viper.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for Viper accessing remote configuration data.
* Verify the integrity of the configuration data received from remote sources *before* Viper uses it.
* Secure the remote configuration server itself.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Configuration Values](./threats/code_injection_via_configuration_values.md)

**Description:** Unsanitized configuration values retrieved by Viper are directly used in system calls, execution of external commands, or in templating engines without proper escaping. An attacker who can control these configuration values (through the threats above) can inject malicious commands or scripts that are then executed by the application. Viper's role is in retrieving and providing this unsanitized data.

**Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server running the application, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the system because Viper provided the malicious input.

**Viper Component Affected:** `viper.Get()` and related functions used by the application to retrieve configuration values loaded by Viper.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never directly use configuration values retrieved by Viper in system calls or external commands without thorough sanitization and validation.
* Use parameterized commands or safe execution methods.
* Employ secure templating practices and avoid executing arbitrary code within templates based on configuration values retrieved by Viper.
