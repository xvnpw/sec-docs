# Attack Surface Analysis for spf13/viper

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides or manipulates a configuration file that exploits vulnerabilities in Viper's parsing logic.
    *   **How Viper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Viper's core functionality is to read and parse configuration files in various formats (YAML, JSON, TOML, etc.). Vulnerabilities in the underlying parsing libraries or in Viper's handling of these formats can be exploited.
    *   **Example:**  Providing a YAML file with excessively nested structures that cause a stack overflow during parsing, leading to a denial of service. Another example could be a crafted file that exploits a known vulnerability in the YAML parsing library used by Viper.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, resource exhaustion, potential for arbitrary code execution if vulnerabilities in parsing libraries are severe enough.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the parsing vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on configuration files, including schema validation and size limits.
        *   Ensure configuration files are sourced from trusted locations with restricted write access.
        *   Keep Viper and its underlying parsing libraries up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Run the application in a sandboxed environment with resource limits to mitigate the impact of resource exhaustion.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Configuration Source Compromise](./attack_surfaces/remote_configuration_source_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a remote configuration source (e.g., Consul, etcd) that Viper is configured to use, injecting malicious configurations.
    *   **How Viper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Viper's ability to fetch configurations from remote sources introduces a dependency on the security of those sources. If these sources are compromised, Viper will load and apply the malicious configurations.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Consul server where the application's configuration is stored and modifies key values to redirect traffic to a malicious server or inject malicious credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Application misconfiguration, data breaches, redirection to malicious sites, unauthorized access, potential for remote code execution depending on the configured values.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to remote configuration sources.
        *   Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS with proper certificate verification) for communication with remote configuration sources.
        *   Implement granular access control policies on the remote configuration source to limit who can modify configurations.
        *   Monitor changes in the remote configuration source for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Replacement during Watch](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_replacement_during_watch.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces a watched configuration file with a malicious one before Viper detects the change and reloads it.
    *   **How Viper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Viper's file watching functionality, while convenient, relies on the integrity of the file system. If an attacker gains write access to the watched file, they can inject malicious configurations.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the directory containing the watched configuration file and replaces it with a file containing malicious settings. Viper detects the change and loads the malicious configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Application misconfiguration, potential for data breaches, redirection to malicious sites, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file system permissions on watched configuration files and directories, preventing unauthorized write access.
        *   Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to configuration files.
        *   Where feasible, make the watched configuration files read-only after initial deployment.
