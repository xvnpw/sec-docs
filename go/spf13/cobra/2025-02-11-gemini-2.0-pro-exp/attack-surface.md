# Attack Surface Analysis for spf13/cobra

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/command_injection.md)

Attack Surface: Command Injection

*   Description: Attackers inject malicious code through command arguments or flags, leading to unauthorized command execution on the host system.
*   Cobra's Contribution: Cobra's core function is to parse command-line arguments and flags, providing the *mechanism* through which user-supplied data enters the application.  While Cobra itself doesn't execute the injected code, it's the *gateway* for the malicious input. The vulnerability lies in how the *application* subsequently uses this data.
*   Example:
    *   Command: `mycli backup --source /home/user/data --destination "; rm -rf /; #"`
    *   Cobra parses `--destination` and provides its value to the application. If the application uses this value directly in a shell command without sanitization, the injected command executes.
*   Impact: Complete system compromise, data loss, data exfiltration, malware installation.
*   Risk Severity: Critical
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Developer:
        *   Strict Input Validation: Use allow-lists (whitelists) to define *exactly* what is permitted for each argument and flag. Reject anything that doesn't match.
        *   Input Sanitization: Escape or remove dangerous characters *before* using the input in any system-level operation.
        *   Avoid Shell Commands: Prefer using Go's `os/exec` with explicit arguments (e.g., `exec.Command("cp", source, dest)`).
        *   Parameterization: Use parameterized queries or equivalents when interacting with other services.
    *   User:
        *   Be extremely cautious about command arguments, especially from untrusted sources.
        *   Avoid piping untrusted output into Cobra-based applications.

## Attack Surface: [Subcommand Hijacking](./attack_surfaces/subcommand_hijacking.md)

Attack Surface: Subcommand Hijacking

*   Description: Attackers trigger unintended or hidden subcommands, potentially bypassing security controls or accessing privileged functionality.
*   Cobra's Contribution: Cobra's hierarchical subcommand structure is the *direct enabler* of this attack surface. If the application relies on user input to determine *which* subcommand to execute, and that input is not strictly validated against a known-good list of subcommands, hijacking is possible.
*   Example:
    *   Hidden subcommand: `mycli internal debug --reset-all`.
    *   If an attacker can manipulate input (e.g., a config file, a crafted URL) to make the application's Cobra-based command parsing logic select this hidden subcommand, they gain unauthorized access.
*   Impact: Execution of unauthorized actions, privilege escalation, data modification, denial of service.
*   Risk Severity: High
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Developer:
        *   Static Command Structure: Define the command hierarchy statically. Avoid dynamic subcommand generation based on user input.
        *   Explicit Command Mapping: If dynamic execution is *unavoidable*, use a strict, pre-defined mapping between input and allowed subcommands. Do *not* use user input directly as a subcommand name.
        *   Input Validation: Validate even subcommand names.
    *   User:
        *   Be aware of documented commands. Investigate unexpected behavior.
