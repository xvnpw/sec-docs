# Threat Model Analysis for spf13/cobra

## Threat: [Command Structure Injection via Unvalidated Flag Values](./threats/command_structure_injection_via_unvalidated_flag_values.md)

*   **Threat:** Command Structure Injection via Unvalidated Flag Values

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted input to a command's flags.  This input is not treated as a simple value but is used in a way that alters the intended program logic or accesses resources inappropriately.  The attacker manipulates the *application's* internal logic through Cobra's flag parsing, *not* by injecting shell commands.  For example, a flag intended for a filename might be used to inject a path traversal sequence (`../../`), or a numeric ID flag might be used to inject a large number to cause a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized file access (read or write).
        *   Modification of application state.
        *   Triggering of unintended application functions.
        *   Denial of service (DoS) through resource exhaustion.
    *   **Cobra Component Affected:**
        *   `Flags()` and related methods (e.g., `StringVar`, `IntVar`, `StringSliceVar`, etc.) used to define command flags.
        *   `Run` and `RunE` functions where flag values are used without proper validation.
        *   `PersistentFlags()` if misused in subcommands (where a parent command's persistent flag influences a subcommand's behavior).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on how flag values are used).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation for *all* flag values. Use allow-lists (whitelists) whenever possible. Validate data types, lengths, allowed characters, and formats (e.g., using regular expressions).
        *   **Type-Specific Validation:** Use Cobra's type-specific flag functions (e.g., `IntVar`, `Float64Var`) to enforce basic type checking.
        *   **Custom Validation Functions:** Use Cobra's `RegisterFlagCompletionFunc` (with caution, see separate threat) and custom validation logic within `PreRun` or `RunE` to perform more complex validation checks.
        *   **Contextual Validation:** Validate flag values in the context of their intended use.  For example, if a flag represents a file path, ensure it's a valid and safe path within the application's allowed scope.
        *   **Avoid Direct Use in Sensitive Operations:** Do not directly use unvalidated flag values in security-sensitive operations like file system access, database queries, or system calls. Sanitize and escape the input appropriately.

## Threat: [Misuse of `PreRun` and `PostRun` Hooks](./threats/misuse_of__prerun__and__postrun__hooks.md)

*   **Threat:** Misuse of `PreRun` and `PostRun` Hooks

    *   **Description:** The application uses `PreRun` or `PostRun` hooks to perform actions based on flag values or other user input. If this input is not validated *within the hooks*, an attacker could manipulate these hooks to perform unauthorized actions. This is a direct vulnerability because it involves the misuse of a specific Cobra feature.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Similar to command structure injection, but localized to the `PreRun` or `PostRun` context.
        *   Unauthorized file access, modification of application state, or triggering of unintended functions.
    *   **Cobra Component Affected:**
        *   `PreRun`, `PreRunE`, `PostRun`, and `PostRunE` fields of the `cobra.Command` struct.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation within Hooks:**  Thoroughly validate *all* input used within `PreRun` and `PostRun` hooks, just as you would within the main `Run` function. This is the most critical mitigation.
        *   **Avoid Security-Sensitive Operations:**  Minimize the use of `PreRun` and `PostRun` for security-sensitive operations. If necessary, ensure these operations are performed with appropriate safeguards.
        *   **Consider Alternatives:** If possible, refactor the code to perform the necessary actions within the main `Run` function, where input validation is already expected and more naturally enforced.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Unbounded Flag Input (Specifically `StringSliceVar` and unbounded `Args`)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_unbounded_flag_input__specifically__stringslicevar__and_unbounded__args__d0f8181f.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Unbounded Flag Input (Specifically `StringSliceVar` and unbounded `Args`)

    * **Description:** An attacker provides excessively large input to a `StringSliceVar` flag, or a very large number of arguments to a command that accepts a variable number of arguments without proper limits. This causes the application to allocate excessive memory, leading to a denial of service. This is *directly* related to Cobra because it involves the misuse of specific flag types and argument handling.
    * **Impact:**
        * Application crash due to out-of-memory errors.
        * System instability due to excessive memory consumption.
        * Denial of service for other users or processes.
    * **Cobra Component Affected:**
        * `Flags().StringSliceVar()` when used without length/count limits.
        * Commands that accept a variable number of arguments (using `Args` in the `cobra.Command` struct) without validation (e.g., missing `cobra.MaximumNArgs`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Slice Size Limits:** For `StringSliceVar`, implement custom validation (e.g., in `PreRunE`) to check the length of the slice and enforce a reasonable maximum.
        * **Argument Count Limits:** If a command accepts a variable number of arguments, *always* set a reasonable maximum limit using `cobra.Command.Args` (e.g., `cobra.MaximumNArgs(10)`). This is a direct and effective mitigation.
        * **Input Length Limits (for individual strings):** Even within a slice, limit the length of individual strings accepted.
        * **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor application resource usage (memory, CPU) and implement alerts or automatic termination if limits are exceeded.
