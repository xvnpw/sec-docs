# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for spf13/cobra

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strategic Command and Flag Naming](./mitigation_strategies/strategic_command_and_flag_naming.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Choose Descriptive Names:**  When defining commands and flags using `cobra.Command` and its associated methods (e.g., `Flags().StringVarP()`, `AddCommand()`), select names that are clear, unambiguous, and unlikely to be mistyped.
2.  **Avoid Short Aliases (Generally):** While Cobra allows short aliases (e.g., `-h` for `--help`), minimize their use, especially for critical commands.  If used, ensure they are extremely well-known and documented.
3.  **Consistent Casing:**  Establish and enforce a consistent casing convention (kebab-case, snake_case) for command and flag names *within your Cobra setup*.
4.  **Review Existing Cobra Definitions:**  Examine your `cmd` package (or wherever your Cobra commands are defined) and refactor any command or flag names that are ambiguous or prone to typosquatting.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unexpected Command Execution (Typosquatting):** (Severity: **Medium**) - Reduces the chance of a user accidentally running the wrong command due to a typo, especially if a similarly named command exists.

**Impact:**
*   **Unexpected Command Execution:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example:  A general guideline to use descriptive names exists, but it's not consistently followed in the `cmd` package.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example:  Short, ambiguous command names exist (e.g., `cmd/r.go`, `cmd/s.go`).  These should be renamed to be more descriptive.
*   Example:  Inconsistent casing is used across different command files (e.g., `cmd/addUser.go` vs. `cmd/delete-user.go`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Cobra Configuration and Feature Control](./mitigation_strategies/cobra_configuration_and_feature_control.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`DisableFlagParsing = true` (If Applicable):** If a command *does not* use flags, explicitly disable flag parsing by setting `DisableFlagParsing: true` on the `cobra.Command` instance.  This prevents Cobra from attempting to process any flags, reducing the attack surface.
2.  **`TraverseChildren = false` (Carefully):**  By default, Cobra's `TraverseChildren` is `true`, meaning it continues to parse flags *after* finding a valid subcommand.  If this behavior is not needed, set `TraverseChildren: false` on the relevant `cobra.Command` to limit flag parsing.  Understand the implications *before* changing this.
3.  **`DisableSuggestions = true` (If High Risk):**  If the risk of accidental command execution via typos is high (especially for destructive commands), disable Cobra's command suggestion feature by setting `DisableSuggestions: true` on the root command.  Alternatively, customize the suggestion behavior if possible.
4.  **`PersistentFlags` Review:**  Carefully review the use of `PersistentFlags()`.  These flags are inherited by *all* subcommands.  Ensure that persistent flags do not inadvertently expose sensitive functionality or information to subcommands that should not have access.  Use them sparingly and only when truly necessary.
5. **`ValidArgs` and `ValidArgsFunction`:** Use `ValidArgs` to define a static list of allowed arguments for a command, or `ValidArgsFunction` for dynamic validation. This provides built-in input validation at the Cobra level.
6. **`Args`:** Use the `Args` field on `cobra.Command` to specify a validator function for positional arguments. Cobra provides several built-in validators like `cobra.MinimumNArgs(n)`, `cobra.MaximumNArgs(n)`, `cobra.ExactArgs(n)`, `cobra.NoArgs`, `cobra.OnlyValidArgs`. Use these or define a custom validator.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unexpected Command Execution (Misconfiguration):** (Severity: **Medium**) - By controlling how Cobra parses commands and flags.
*   **Denial of Service (via Flags):** (Severity: **High**) - By disabling flag parsing where it's not needed.
*   **Information Disclosure (via Suggestions):** (Severity: **Low**) - By disabling or customizing suggestions.

**Impact:**
*   **Unexpected Command Execution:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Medium** (in specific scenarios where flags are a vector).
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from **Low** to **Very Low**.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: `DisableSuggestions` is set to `true` on the root command in `cmd/root.go`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: `TraverseChildren` is not explicitly set on any commands, relying on the default behavior.  This should be reviewed and potentially set to `false` where appropriate.
*   Example:  Persistent flags are used in `cmd/root.go` without a clear understanding of their impact on subcommands.
*   Example: `ValidArgs` and `Args` validators are not used, relying solely on custom validation logic after Cobra parsing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Customizing Help Text via Cobra](./mitigation_strategies/customizing_help_text_via_cobra.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`Short`, `Long`, `Example` Fields:**  Use the `Short`, `Long`, and `Example` fields of the `cobra.Command` struct to provide *clear, concise, and security-conscious* descriptions of each command and its flags.
2.  **Avoid Sensitive Information:**  Do *not* include any information in the help text that could be useful to an attacker (e.g., internal file paths, specific library versions, API keys).
3.  **Review Generated Help:**  Regularly run `your-app help` and review the output to ensure that the help text is accurate, helpful, and does not reveal any sensitive information.
4.  **Customize Flag Help:** Use the `Usage` field of flags (e.g., `Flags().StringVarP(&myVar, "myflag", "m", "", "A secure description of myflag")`) to provide specific, secure descriptions for each flag.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: **Low** to **Medium**) - Prevents the leakage of sensitive information through Cobra's automatically generated help text.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from **Low/Medium** to **Very Low**.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example:  Basic `Short` descriptions are provided for some commands in the `cmd` package.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example:  The `Long` and `Example` fields are not consistently used, resulting in incomplete or unhelpful help text for many commands.
*   Example:  No systematic review of the generated help text has been performed to check for sensitive information disclosure.
*   Example: Flag `Usage` fields are not customized, relying on default descriptions.
