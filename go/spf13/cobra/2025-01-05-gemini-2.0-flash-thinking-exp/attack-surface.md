# Attack Surface Analysis for spf13/cobra

## Attack Surface: [Excessive Flag Arguments](./attack_surfaces/excessive_flag_arguments.md)

* **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large number of command-line flags to the application.
    * **How Cobra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cobra's flag parsing mechanism is directly involved in processing these arguments. Cobra itself doesn't inherently limit the number of flags processed, making it susceptible to resource exhaustion through this vector.
    * **Example:**  `./my-cobra-app --flag1=value1 --flag2=value2 ... [thousands of flags]`
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) during Cobra's flag parsing.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Implement application-level checks to limit the number of accepted flags *before* or during Cobra's parsing if possible.
        * **Developer:** Monitor resource usage during flag parsing and consider timeouts to prevent indefinite processing by Cobra.

## Attack Surface: [Flag Value Injection](./attack_surfaces/flag_value_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts flag values that, when processed by the application, are interpreted as commands or escape sequences, leading to unintended actions.
    * **How Cobra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cobra parses the flag values and makes them directly available to the application. This parsed value becomes the input that, if not handled securely by the application, can be exploited for injection attacks.
    * **Example:** An application uses a flag to specify a filename for processing: `./my-cobra-app --file="; rm -rf /"`
    * **Impact:**  Arbitrary command execution on the server or client machine.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**  Never directly use flag values obtained from Cobra in shell commands or other sensitive operations without thorough sanitization and validation.
        * **Developer:** Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to system calls.
        * **Developer:** Implement output encoding when displaying flag values to prevent interpretation of escape sequences.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Shell Completion Scripts](./attack_surfaces/malicious_shell_completion_scripts.md)

* **Description:** If the application's shell completion feature relies on dynamically generated scripts or external resources, an attacker could inject malicious code into these scripts.
    * **How Cobra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cobra provides the functionality to generate shell completion scripts. If this generation process is flawed or relies on untrusted sources, Cobra directly contributes to the vulnerability by creating and potentially executing malicious code during the completion process.
    * **Example:** A completion script generated by Cobra that, when executed by the shell, downloads and runs malicious code.
    * **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when they use tab completion.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**  Ensure that shell completion scripts generated by Cobra are created securely and do not incorporate data from untrusted external sources without rigorous sanitization.
        * **Developer:**  Prefer static completion definitions over dynamic generation where possible to reduce the attack surface.
        * **User:** Be cautious about installing and using completion scripts from untrusted applications.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Completion Suggestions](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_completion_suggestions.md)

* **Description:**  The shell completion suggestions generated by Cobra inadvertently reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings, available commands, or potential vulnerabilities.
    * **How Cobra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cobra's completion feature is directly responsible for generating these suggestions based on the defined commands and flags. If not carefully configured, Cobra can expose sensitive details through these suggestions.
    * **Example:** Completion suggestions revealing internal API endpoints, sensitive configuration options, or undocumented commands.
    * **Impact:**  Provides attackers with valuable information to plan further attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Carefully review the generated completion suggestions provided by Cobra and ensure they do not expose sensitive information.
        * **Developer:**  Filter or sanitize the data used by Cobra to generate completion suggestions, preventing the inclusion of sensitive details.
        * **Developer:**  Consider restricting the level of detail provided in completion suggestions for less privileged users.
