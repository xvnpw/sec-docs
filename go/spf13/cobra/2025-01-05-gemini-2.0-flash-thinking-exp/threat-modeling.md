# Threat Model Analysis for spf13/cobra

## Threat: [Command Injection via Arguments](./threats/command_injection_via_arguments.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input within command-line arguments. Cobra's `Args` parsing mechanism passes these arguments to the application. If the application then uses these unsanitized arguments in system calls or interactions with external processes, the attacker's injected commands are executed on the underlying operating system.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. Attackers can execute arbitrary commands, read sensitive data, modify files, or launch further attacks.

**Affected Cobra Component:** `Args` parsing mechanism within Cobra's command structure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid direct execution of shell commands with user-provided arguments.
*   If shell execution is necessary, use parameterized commands or escape user input using appropriate libraries *after* Cobra has parsed the arguments.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all command arguments based on expected formats and values *after* Cobra has parsed the arguments. Use a whitelist approach where possible.
*   Consider using safer alternatives to shell execution if feasible.

## Threat: [Flag/Option Injection](./threats/flagoption_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides unexpected or malicious flags/options to the command-line interface. Cobra's `Flags` parsing mechanism processes these flags. If the application doesn't properly validate the presence or values of these flags after Cobra parsing, the attacker can manipulate the application's behavior, potentially bypassing security checks, accessing sensitive information, or triggering unintended actions.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the exploited flag. Could lead to information disclosure, privilege escalation within the application, denial of service, or other unintended behaviors.

**Affected Cobra Component:** `Flags` definition and parsing mechanism within Cobra's `Command`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict validation for all flag values based on their expected type, format, and range *after* Cobra has parsed the flags.
*   Define allowed values for flags where appropriate (e.g., using `cobra.OnlyValidArgs` and performing additional validation).
*   Avoid relying solely on Cobra's built-in type checking for security-sensitive flags.
*   Sanitize flag values before using them in any sensitive operations.

## Threat: [Command Injection within Command Handlers](./threats/command_injection_within_command_handlers.md)

**Description:** Even if command arguments are handled carefully, vulnerabilities can arise within the command handler logic. If user input obtained via Cobra's flag parsing is used to construct system commands or interact with external systems without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system, similar to command injection via arguments.

**Affected Cobra Component:** The `Run`, `RunE`, `PersistentRun`, or `PersistentRunE` functions within a Cobra `Command` where flag values are accessed and used.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Apply the same principles of input validation and sanitization within command handlers as for command arguments, focusing on the values obtained from Cobra flags.
*   Avoid direct string concatenation for building commands using flag values.
*   Use secure libraries or functions for interacting with external systems that prevent command injection.

## Threat: [Unintentional Exposure of Sensitive Information in Command Definitions](./threats/unintentional_exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_command_definitions.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials, internal paths) within command descriptions, example usage, or flag help texts within the Cobra structure. This information is directly part of Cobra's command definition and can be exposed to users via help messages.

**Impact:** Direct exposure of sensitive information, potentially leading to unauthorized access or compromise.

**Affected Cobra Component:** `Use`, `Short`, `Long`, `Example` fields of the `Command` struct, and `Usage` strings for flags. These are core parts of how Cobra defines and presents commands.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review all command definitions, help texts, and examples to ensure no sensitive information is exposed.
*   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the application code or command definitions within Cobra.
*   Use environment variables or secure configuration mechanisms for sensitive data, and reference them within the application logic instead of directly in Cobra definitions.
