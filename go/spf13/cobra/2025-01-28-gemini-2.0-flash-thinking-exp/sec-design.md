# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Cobra, aims to provide a library for creating powerful modern command-line interfaces (CLIs) in Go. The primary business priority is to empower developers to build user-friendly and robust CLIs quickly and efficiently. The goal is to increase developer productivity and promote best practices in CLI development within the Go ecosystem.

Key business risks associated with this project include:
- Risk of vulnerabilities in the Cobra library itself, which could be inherited by all CLIs built using it.
- Risk of developers misusing Cobra features, leading to insecure CLIs.
- Risk of poor documentation or examples that could lead to developers implementing insecure patterns.
- Risk of the library becoming unmaintained or outdated, hindering developers and potentially introducing security issues over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open Source project with public code repository on GitHub. This allows for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. Implemented: GitHub repository.
- security control: Written in Go, a memory-safe language that reduces the risk of certain classes of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. Implemented: Language choice.
- security control: Includes a test suite to ensure functionality and potentially catch regressions. Implemented: Test directory in the repository.
- security control: Uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI), which can be used to automate testing and potentially security checks. Implemented: `.github/workflows` directory.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to exist in dependencies used by Cobra.
- accepted risk: Risk of developers building insecure CLIs using Cobra despite the framework itself being secure.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify vulnerabilities in Cobra's dependencies.
- recommended security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the CI pipeline to automatically detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Conduct periodic security audits or penetration testing of Cobra to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
- recommended security control: Provide secure coding guidelines and examples specifically for developers using Cobra to build CLIs, focusing on common CLI security pitfalls.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: While Cobra itself doesn't handle authentication, CLIs built with Cobra often need to authenticate users or services. Cobra should provide mechanisms or guidance to facilitate secure authentication implementation in CLIs.
- Authorization: Similarly, CLIs need to implement authorization to control access to commands and resources. Cobra should enable developers to easily integrate authorization logic into their CLIs.
- Input validation: CLIs are inherently exposed to user input, making input validation critical. Cobra must encourage and facilitate robust input validation to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography: If CLIs built with Cobra need to handle sensitive data, cryptographic operations are essential. Cobra should not hinder the use of cryptography and ideally provide utilities or best practice guidance for secure cryptographic implementation within CLIs.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer writes code in their local development environment.
2. Source code is committed and pushed to the Code Repository (GitHub).
3. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions) is triggered upon code changes.
4. Build Server (GitHub Actions Runner) retrieves the source code.
5. Build Server compiles the Go code into Binary Artifacts.
6. Test Runner executes automated tests to verify functionality.
7. SAST Scanner performs static analysis security testing on the code.
8. Dependency Scanner checks for vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
9. Binary Artifacts are stored in Artifact Storage.
10. Artifacts are then released to the Distribution Platform for users to download.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect: Secure development and distribution of command-line tools within the Go ecosystem. Ensuring that CLIs built with Cobra are robust, reliable, and do not introduce security vulnerabilities to users.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Integrity of the Cobra library code: High sensitivity. Compromised code could lead to widespread vulnerabilities in all CLIs built with Cobra.
- Availability of the Cobra library: Medium sensitivity. Downtime or unavailability would hinder developers but not directly cause immediate harm.
- Confidentiality of Cobra's development process (less relevant for open source): Low sensitivity. As an open-source project, confidentiality is not a primary concern.
- Integrity of CLIs built with Cobra: High sensitivity. Vulnerabilities in generated CLIs can directly impact users and systems they interact with.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended audience for CLIs built with Cobra? (Internal tools, public utilities, etc.) - Assumption: Broad audience, including both internal and public facing CLIs.
- What are the typical use cases for CLIs built with Cobra? (System administration, data processing, application control, etc.) - Assumption: Diverse use cases, requiring flexibility and security.
- Are there any specific security compliance requirements for projects using Cobra? (e.g., SOC 2, PCI DSS) - Assumption: No specific compliance mentioned, but general security best practices are expected.
- What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in Cobra? - Assumption: Standard open-source vulnerability reporting process via GitHub issues or security channels.

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: Primary goal is developer productivity and wide adoption of Cobra for building CLIs. Security is a secondary but important consideration.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Current security posture relies on open-source community review and Go language security. There is room for improvement in automated security checks and proactive security measures.
- DESIGN: Cobra follows a modular design with components for parsing, handling flags, and generating help. Deployment of Cobra-based CLIs is typically as standalone binaries. Build process involves standard Go tooling and can be enhanced with security checks in CI.
