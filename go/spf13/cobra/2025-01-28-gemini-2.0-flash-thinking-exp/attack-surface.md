# Attack Surface Analysis for spf13/cobra

## Attack Surface: [Command Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/command_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in Cobra's core command parsing logic that could allow attackers to manipulate or bypass intended command structures.
*   **Cobra Contribution:** Cobra's primary function is command parsing. Vulnerabilities here are inherent to Cobra's design and implementation.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a command like `mycli command1 --flag="value" ; malicious_command`. If Cobra incorrectly handles special characters in command names or flag values, it might execute the injected `malicious_command`.
*   **Impact:** Command injection, unauthorized command execution, potential for arbitrary code execution depending on application privileges and injected commands.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Cobra Updated:**  Regularly update Cobra to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in command parsing.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on command parsing, especially with complex command structures.

## Attack Surface: [Flag Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/flag_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Cobra parses and handles flags (options), potentially allowing injection or manipulation of flag values.
*   **Cobra Contribution:** Cobra is responsible for flag parsing. Flaws in this process are directly attributable to Cobra.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a flag like `--file-path="../sensitive/data.txt"`. If Cobra's parsing doesn't prevent or sanitize path traversal characters, and the application uses this unsanitized path, it leads to a vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Path traversal, flag injection leading to unintended application behavior, potential for information disclosure or privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Cobra Updated:** Ensure Cobra is up-to-date to patch any flag parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Application Level):**  Critically, *always* validate and sanitize flag values *after* Cobra parsing within the application logic.  Specifically for file paths, use secure path handling functions.
    *   **Flag Whitelisting (Application Level):**  Define and whitelist expected flags and reject unknown flags to prevent flag injection attacks at the application level.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Completion Function Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_completion_function_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security weaknesses in custom shell completion functions, which are a feature provided by Cobra.
*   **Cobra Contribution:** Cobra provides the mechanism for custom completion functions. Insecurely written functions directly leverage Cobra's completion feature to introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A completion function executes an external command based on user input without sanitization. A malicious input during completion could lead to command injection executed during the completion process itself.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine during command completion, information disclosure if completion functions access sensitive data insecurely.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Completion Function Design:** Design completion functions to be simple and safe. Avoid external command execution or complex logic within them.
    *   **Input Sanitization in Completion Functions:** If external data is used, rigorously sanitize any data used in shell commands or displayed to the user within completion functions.
    *   **Code Review and Testing:** Thoroughly review and test custom completion functions for potential vulnerabilities.
