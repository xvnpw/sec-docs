## Attack Tree Path: [Input Manipulation Attacks [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/input_manipulation_attacks__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This category encompasses attacks that exploit vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of user-supplied input provided through Cobra flags and arguments.  Attackers aim to manipulate the application's behavior by crafting malicious input.

    *   **Breakdown of Attack Vectors within Input Manipulation:**

        *   **1.1. Command Injection [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands into flag or argument values that are then executed by the application within a shell environment.
                *   **1.1.1. Unsanitized Flag Values [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                    *   **Attack Vector:**  Providing malicious shell commands as values for Cobra flags.
                    *   **Impact:** Critical - Full system compromise, arbitrary code execution.
                    *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
                    *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
                    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
                    *   **Actionable Mitigations:**
                        *   Strictly validate and sanitize all flag inputs.
                        *   Avoid executing shell commands with user-provided input.
                        *   If shelling out is necessary, use proper escaping or safer alternatives.
                *   **1.1.2. Unsanitized Argument Values [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** Providing malicious shell commands as Cobra command arguments.
                    *   **Impact:** Critical - Full system compromise, arbitrary code execution.
                    *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
                    *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
                    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
                    *   **Actionable Mitigations:**
                        *   Strictly validate and sanitize all argument inputs.
                        *   Avoid executing shell commands with user-provided input.
                        *   If shelling out is necessary, use proper escaping or safer alternatives.

        *   **1.2. Path Traversal via Input [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Description:** Attackers provide malicious file paths (e.g., using `../`) in flags or arguments to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
                *   **Attack Vector:** Supplying path traversal sequences in flags or arguments intended for file operations.
                *   **Impact:** High - Unauthorized file access, data leakage, potential arbitrary file read/write.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                *   **Actionable Mitigations:**
                    *   Strictly validate and sanitize all file paths provided by users.
                    *   Use `filepath.Clean` and `filepath.Abs` in Go to normalize paths.
                    *   Consider chroot environments to restrict file system access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Exploitation (Viper Integration) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_exploitation__viper_integration___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** If the Cobra application uses Viper for configuration, vulnerabilities can arise from insecure default configurations.

    *   **Breakdown of Attack Vectors within Configuration Exploitation:**

        *   **2.1. Insecure Default Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Description:** Exploiting weak or insecure default settings in configuration files that are shipped with the application.
                *   **Attack Vector:** Leveraging vulnerabilities present in default configuration settings (e.g., weak default credentials, insecure protocols enabled by default).
                *   **Impact:** Medium-High - Unauthorized access, data breach, application compromise (depending on the specific insecure setting).
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
                *   **Effort:** Very Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Novice
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy-Medium (through security audits)
                *   **Actionable Mitigations:**
                    *   Security harden all default configuration settings.
                    *   Disable unnecessary features and services by default.
                    *   Regularly audit default configurations for security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic & Implementation Flaws (Cobra Specific) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/logic_&_implementation_flaws__cobra_specific___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This category highlights vulnerabilities stemming from flaws in the custom logic implemented within Cobra commands, specifically focusing on insufficient input validation within the command's execution logic.

    *   **Breakdown of Attack Vectors within Logic & Implementation Flaws:**

        *   **3.1. Lack of Input Validation in Command Logic [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from insufficient or missing input validation within the `RunE` functions of Cobra commands, leading to exploitable flaws in the application's core logic.
                *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting missing or weak input validation within the custom command logic to trigger unintended behavior, errors, or security vulnerabilities.
                *   **Impact:** High - Varies greatly depending on the specific flaw in the logic, can range from data corruption to arbitrary code execution in vulnerable logic paths.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
                *   **Effort:** Medium
                *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard (requires code audits and thorough testing)
                *   **Actionable Mitigations:**
                    *   Implement robust input validation within the `RunE` functions of each command.
                    *   Use defensive programming techniques to handle unexpected inputs.
                    *   Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of command logic.
