```
**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

Execute Arbitrary Commands on the Server **CRITICAL NODE**
* OR
    * Exploit Command Injection via Cobra Flags/Arguments *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
        * AND **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Application uses user-controlled input to construct Cobra command flags or arguments
            * Cobra does not properly sanitize or escape these inputs
        * Actions:
            * Inject malicious commands into flag values (e.g., `--output "file.txt; malicious_command"`)
            * Inject malicious commands into argument values (e.g., `command arg1; malicious_command`)
    * Exploit Command Injection via Cobra Subcommand Names *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
        * AND **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Application dynamically determines the Cobra subcommand to execute based on user input

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Commands on the Server (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_commands_on_the_server__critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has gained the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application, leading to a complete compromise.
* **Significance:** This node represents the highest impact scenario. All other nodes in the high-risk sub-tree are pathways leading to this critical point.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Command Injection via Cobra Flags/Arguments (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_command_injection_via_cobra_flagsarguments__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This attack path involves exploiting the application's use of user-controlled input to construct Cobra command flags or arguments without proper sanitization. If the application takes user input and directly embeds it into a Cobra command string, an attacker can inject malicious commands that will be executed by the system.
* **Critical Node: Application uses user-controlled input to construct Cobra command flags or arguments AND Cobra does not properly sanitize or escape these inputs:** This critical node highlights the two necessary conditions for this attack path to be viable. The application must be using user input in command construction, and Cobra (or the application's handling of Cobra) must fail to sanitize this input.
* **Actions:**
    * **Inject malicious commands into flag values:** Attackers can inject commands into the values assigned to Cobra flags. For example, if a flag is used to specify an output file, an attacker might inject a command like `; rm -rf /` within the filename, which could be executed after the file operation.
    * **Inject malicious commands into argument values:** Similar to flag values, attackers can inject commands into the arguments passed to the Cobra command. If arguments are not properly sanitized, malicious commands can be inserted and executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Command Injection via Cobra Subcommand Names (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_command_injection_via_cobra_subcommand_names__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This attack path targets applications that dynamically determine which Cobra subcommand to execute based on user input. If this input is not strictly validated, an attacker can inject malicious commands as the subcommand name itself.
* **Critical Node: Application dynamically determines the Cobra subcommand to execute based on user input AND Insufficient validation allows injection of arbitrary commands as subcommand names:** This critical node emphasizes the vulnerability arising from dynamic subcommand selection without adequate input validation. If the application relies on user input to choose the subcommand and doesn't properly sanitize this input, command injection becomes possible.
* **Actions:**
    * **Inject malicious commands as subcommand names:** The attacker crafts input that, when interpreted by the application, results in a malicious command being treated as the subcommand to be executed. For example, instead of a legitimate subcommand, the input might be `malicious_command --flag value`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities in Cobra (Partial High-Risk Path - Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_in_cobra__partial_high-risk_path_-_critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** This attack vector focuses on vulnerabilities related to how the application uses Cobra's configuration management features. If configuration files or the mechanisms for loading configuration are vulnerable to manipulation, an attacker might be able to inject malicious commands or settings that are executed when the application starts or reloads its configuration. While the full path to arbitrary command execution via configuration might involve further steps, the initial vulnerability in configuration is a critical point.
* **Critical Node: Application relies on Cobra's configuration management features AND Configuration files or mechanisms are vulnerable to manipulation:** This critical node highlights the dependency on Cobra's configuration and the weakness in how that configuration is managed or protected. If the application uses Cobra's configuration and the configuration source is susceptible to unauthorized modification, it creates a significant security risk.
