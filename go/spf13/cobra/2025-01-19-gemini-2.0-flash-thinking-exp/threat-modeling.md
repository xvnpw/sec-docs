# Threat Model Analysis for spf13/cobra

## Threat: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Arguments](./threats/command_injection_via_unsanitized_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input within command-line arguments. The application, without proper sanitization, passes these arguments directly to a shell command or system call. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Cobra Component:** `Command.RunE`, `Command.Run`, `Command.PreRunE`, `Command.PreRun`, `Command.PostRunE`, `Command.PostRun` (where application logic using `os/exec` or similar is implemented, receiving arguments parsed by Cobra).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid direct execution of shell commands with user-provided input.
        *   Use parameterized commands or libraries that handle escaping and quoting (e.g., the `exec` package with proper argument handling).
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all command arguments, allowing only expected characters and formats.
        *   Consider using alternative approaches that don't involve direct shell execution if possible.

## Threat: [Argument Injection through Flag Manipulation](./threats/argument_injection_through_flag_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides unexpected or malicious values for command-line flags defined by Cobra. The application's logic, assuming valid input, processes these manipulated flag values, leading to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities. This could involve providing excessively long strings, special characters, or values of an incorrect type that bypass weak validation.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, unexpected behavior, potential for buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues if flag values are used in unsafe operations, bypassing intended security checks.
    *   **Affected Cobra Component:** `Flags` (specifically how flag values are retrieved and used within the application logic after Cobra parsing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust validation for all flag values based on their expected type, length, and format.
        *   Utilize Cobra's built-in type checking and validation features where applicable.
        *   Implement custom validation functions for complex flag requirements.
        *   Sanitize flag values before using them in sensitive operations.

## Threat: [Configuration File Injection/Manipulation](./threats/configuration_file_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Cobra's configuration features and allows users to specify the configuration file path, an attacker could point the application to a malicious configuration file. This file could contain crafted settings that, when loaded, alter the application's behavior in a harmful way.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation (if the configuration controls access rights), data manipulation (if the configuration affects data processing), execution of arbitrary code (if the configuration is used to load plugins or scripts).
    *   **Affected Cobra Component:** `Viper` integration (specifically how the application uses Viper to load configuration files and how the configuration values are used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict the locations from which configuration files can be loaded.
        *   Avoid allowing users to specify arbitrary configuration file paths.
        *   Implement strong validation and sanitization of configuration values loaded from files.
        *   Consider using environment variables or command-line flags for sensitive configuration instead of relying solely on files.
