# Attack Surface Analysis for spf13/cobra

## Attack Surface: [Flag Injection](./attack_surfaces/flag_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Flag Injection**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can inject unintended flags into the command-line arguments processed by the Cobra application.
    *   **How Cobra Contributes:** Cobra's flag parsing mechanism directly processes command-line arguments. If the application allows external sources (e.g., environment variables, configuration files read before parsing) to influence the arguments passed to `Execute()`, Cobra will parse and potentially execute these injected flags.
    *   **Example:** An environment variable `COBRA_FLAGS="--verbose --debug"` is set. The application calls `cmd.ExecuteC()` without sanitizing the environment. Cobra parses these flags, potentially enabling debugging output in a production environment.
    *   **Impact:** Unexpected behavior, information disclosure (e.g., enabling verbose logging), privilege escalation if injected flags alter application behavior in a privileged context.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid constructing command-line arguments dynamically from untrusted sources. If necessary, use whitelisting or strict validation before passing arguments to the Cobra command. Be mindful of environment variables and configuration files loaded before Cobra parsing.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about setting environment variables that might influence the execution of Cobra applications, especially those run with elevated privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Completion Scripts](./attack_surfaces/malicious_completion_scripts.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Completion Scripts**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious code into the completion scripts generated by Cobra, which will be executed when other users use the completion feature.
    *   **How Cobra Contributes:** Cobra's completion feature generates shell scripts based on the command structure. If the application allows users to influence the content of these scripts (e.g., through custom completion functions or external data), malicious code can be injected.
    *   **Example:** A custom completion function for a subcommand includes a call to download and execute a script from a remote server. When another user uses tab completion for that subcommand, the malicious script is executed.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when they use tab completion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Carefully review and sanitize any external data or custom functions used in generating completion scripts. Avoid dynamic script generation based on untrusted input. Consider signing or verifying the integrity of completion scripts.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about using completion features for applications from untrusted sources. Inspect completion scripts if possible.
