### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Path Traversal in HttpFs

* Description:
    1. An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to an application using `HttpFs`.
    2. The request path contains path traversal sequences like `../../../`.
    3. The `httpDir.Open` function processes the path.
    4. `path.Clean("/"+name)` is called, which can resolve to an absolute path outside the intended base directory. For example, `../../../sensitive_file` becomes `/sensitive_file`.
    5. `filepath.Join` then concatenates the base path with the cleaned path. However, if the cleaned path is absolute, `filepath.Join` effectively ignores the base path and uses the absolute path.
    6. `HttpFs.Open` opens the file at the escaped path, allowing access outside the intended directory.

* Impact:
    An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that are accessible to the application process. This can lead to information disclosure of sensitive data, source code, configuration files, etc.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. The current implementation in `httpDir.Open` does not prevent path traversal.

* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement path validation in `httpDir.Open` after cleaning the path and before opening the file.
    - Verify that the resolved path remains within the intended base directory. A simple check would be to ensure the resolved path still has the base path as a prefix.

* Preconditions:
    - An application uses `afero.HttpFs` to serve static files.
    - The application does not implement additional path validation before using `HttpFs`.
    - An attacker has network access to the application.

* Source code analysis:
    ```go
    // File: /code/httpFs.go
    func (d httpDir) Open(name string) (http.File, error) {
    	if filepath.Separator != '/' && strings.ContainsRune(name, filepath.Separator) ||
    		strings.Contains(name, "\x00") {
    		return nil, errors.New("http: invalid character in file path")
    	}
    	dir := string(d.basePath) // Base path is stored in d.basePath
    	if dir == "" {
    		dir = "."
    	}

    	// Vulnerable line: path.Clean might resolve to absolute path, escaping basePath
    	f, err := d.fs.Open(filepath.Join(dir, filepath.FromSlash(path.Clean("/"+name))))
    	if err != nil {
    		return nil, err
    	}
    	return f, nil
    }
    ```
    The vulnerability is in the line `f, err := d.fs.Open(filepath.Join(dir, filepath.FromSlash(path.Clean("/"+name))))`. `path.Clean("/"+name)` can return an absolute path, and when joined with `dir` using `filepath.Join`, it can bypass the intended base path restriction.

* Security test case:
    1. Create a directory `/tmp/afero_httpfs_test_base` as the base directory for `HttpFs`.
    2. Inside `/tmp/afero_httpfs_test_base`, create a file `index.html` with content "Hello from base directory".
    3. Outside `/tmp/afero_httpfs_test_base`, create a sensitive file `/tmp/sensitive.txt` with content "This is sensitive data.".
    4. Write a Go program that uses `afero.HttpFs` to serve files from `/tmp/afero_httpfs_test_base` using `http.FileServer`.
    ```go
    package main

    import (
    	"log"
    	"net/http"
    	"github.com/spf13/afero"
    )

    func main() {
    	baseFs := afero.NewOsFs()
    	httpFs := afero.NewHttpFs(baseFs)
    	fs := http.FileServer(httpFs.Dir("/tmp/afero_httpfs_test_base"))
    	http.Handle("/", fs)
    	log.Println("Server listening on :8080")
    	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
    }
    ```
    5. Run the Go program.
    6. Send an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8080/index.html`. Verify that you receive "Hello from base directory".
    7. Send a crafted HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8080/../../../tmp/sensitive.txt`.
    8. Check the HTTP response body. If the response body contains "This is sensitive data.", then path traversal vulnerability exists.
