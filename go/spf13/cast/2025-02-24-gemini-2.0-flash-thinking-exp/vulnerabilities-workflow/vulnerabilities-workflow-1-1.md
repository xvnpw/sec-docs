### Vulnerability Report

* Vulnerability Name: Incorrect Decimal Point Stripping in Integer Conversions
* Description:
    1. An attacker provides an input string that represents a valid integer but ends with a decimal point (e.g., "10.").
    2. This input is passed to one of the `ToUint*E` or `ToInt*E` functions in the `cast` library.
    3. Inside these functions, the `trimZeroDecimal` function is called to remove trailing zeros and the decimal point.
    4. The `trimZeroDecimal` function incorrectly handles strings ending with a decimal point and fails to remove it.
    5. The modified string (e.g., "10.") is then passed to `strconv.ParseInt` for conversion to an integer.
    6. `strconv.ParseInt` fails to parse the string because of the trailing decimal point, resulting in an error.
    7. The `To*E` function returns an error, or the zero value for the target type if the non-error version is used.
* Impact:
    - Inconsistent behavior: Applications using the `cast` library might behave inconsistently when handling numerical string inputs that may or may not have trailing decimal points.
    - Potential application errors: If the application does not properly handle the error returned by the `To*E` functions, it could lead to unexpected application behavior or even crashes depending on how the error is used.
    - Type conversion failures: Legitimate numerical string inputs with a trailing decimal point will fail to be converted to integers, potentially disrupting application logic.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations: No specific mitigation for this vulnerability in the `trimZeroDecimal` function or in the `ToInt*E`/`ToUint*E` functions. The `To*E` functions do return errors when conversion fails, which is a general error handling mechanism, but not a specific mitigation for this input.
* Missing mitigations:
    - The `trimZeroDecimal` function should be corrected to properly remove the trailing decimal point when it is the last character in the string.
    - Unit tests should be added to specifically test the `trimZeroDecimal` function with strings ending in decimal points and to test the `ToInt*E` and `ToUint*E` functions with such inputs to ensure they are handled correctly.
* Preconditions:
    - An application uses the `cast` library to convert string inputs to integer types.
    - The application receives string inputs that are intended to be integers but might have a trailing decimal point (e.g., from user input, configuration files, external data sources).
* Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/caste.go`
    - Function: `trimZeroDecimal(s string) string`
    ```go
    func trimZeroDecimal(s string) string {
    	var foundZero bool
    	for i := len(s); i > 0; i-- {
    		switch s[i-1] {
    		case '.':
    			if foundZero {
    				return s[:i-1]
    			}
    		case '0':
    			foundZero = true
    		default:
    			return s
    		}
    	}
    	return s
    }
    ```
    The `trimZeroDecimal` function iterates backwards to remove trailing zeros after a decimal. However, if the input string ends with a decimal point (e.g., "10."), the function fails to remove it because the condition `if foundZero` is not met when the decimal point is encountered last. This is because `foundZero` is only set to `true` when a '0' is encountered before the decimal. As a result, strings like "10." are not correctly processed, leading to parsing errors in subsequent integer conversion steps using `strconv.ParseInt`.

* Security test case:
    Vulnerability: Incorrect Decimal Point Stripping in Integer Conversions
    Test steps:
    1. Set up a Go testing environment with `quicktest` library.
    2. Navigate to the directory containing the `cast` library code (e.g., `/code/`).
    3. Create a new test file or modify an existing test file (e.g., `cast_test.go`).
    4. Add the following test function to the test file using `quicktest` framework:
    ```go
    package cast

    import (
    	"testing"
    	qt "github.com/frankban/quicktest"
    )

    func TestToIntTrailingDecimalPointE(t *testing.T) {
    	c := qt.New(t)
    	inputString := "123."
    	_, err := ToIntE(inputString)
    	c.Assert(err, qt.IsNotNil)

    	valueNonError := ToInt(inputString)
    	c.Assert(valueNonError, qt.Equals, 0)
    }
    ```
    5. Run the test using `go test ./...` from the `/code/` directory.
    6. Observe that the test `TestToIntTrailingDecimalPointE` passes, confirming the vulnerability is present as the `ToIntE` function returns an error (not nil), and `ToInt` returns the zero value (0) for the invalid input "123.".
