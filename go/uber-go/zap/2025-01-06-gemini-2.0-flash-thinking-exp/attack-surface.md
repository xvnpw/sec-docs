# Attack Surface Analysis for uber-go/zap

## Attack Surface: [Logging Sensitive Information](./attack_surfaces/logging_sensitive_information.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII, etc.) is inadvertently or intentionally included in log messages.

**How Zap Contributes:** `zap`'s structured logging features make it easy to log specific fields and values, increasing the risk if developers are not careful about what data they include. The ease of use can lead to over-logging.

**Example:** A developer logs the user's password during authentication for debugging purposes using `zap.String("password", userProvidedPassword)`.

**Impact:** Data breach, compliance violations, reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict policies against logging sensitive information.
* Utilize redaction techniques or mechanisms to mask sensitive data before logging.
* Log only necessary information and avoid overly verbose logging.
* Train developers on secure logging practices.
* Review log configurations and code regularly to identify potential sensitive data leaks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration of External Logging Sinks](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_of_external_logging_sinks.md)

**Description:** If `zap` is configured to write logs to external sinks (files, network destinations, etc.), misconfigurations can introduce security vulnerabilities.

**How Zap Contributes:** `zap` allows configuration of various output sinks. If these configurations are insecure, it can expose log data.

**Example:** Configuring `zap` to write logs to a file with world-readable permissions or sending logs over an unencrypted network connection.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive log data, potential compromise of logging infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Securely configure permissions for log files and directories.
* Use secure protocols (e.g., TLS) for network logging.
* Authenticate and authorize access to remote logging sinks.
* Regularly review and audit logging configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Log Sinks or Encoders](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_log_sinks_or_encoders.md)

**Description:** If developers implement custom log sinks or encoders for `zap`, vulnerabilities in these custom components can introduce security risks.

**How Zap Contributes:** `zap` allows for custom sink and encoder implementations, providing flexibility but also introducing potential security risks if these custom components are not implemented securely.

**Example:** A custom log sink that writes to a database has an SQL injection vulnerability, or a custom encoder mishandles special characters leading to unexpected behavior.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the custom component, potentially ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and test custom log sinks and encoders for security vulnerabilities.
* Adhere to secure coding practices when developing custom components.
* Consider using well-vetted and established logging solutions where possible.
* Regularly update and patch any dependencies used in custom components.
