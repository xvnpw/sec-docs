# Threat Model Analysis for uber-go/zap

## Threat: [Accidental Logging of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_logging_of_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Accidental Logging of Sensitive Data
    *   **Description:** Developers using `zap`'s structured logging features unintentionally include sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, PII) directly within log messages. An attacker gaining access to these logs can then extract this sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential data leading to potential account compromise, data breaches, or unauthorized access to systems.
    *   **Affected Zap Component:** Core Logging Functionality (specifically the `SugaredLogger` and `Logger` interfaces and their methods for adding fields).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes to identify and prevent logging of sensitive data.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools configured to detect potential sensitive data being logged.
        *   Educate developers on secure logging practices and the risks of logging sensitive information.
        *   Consider implementing automated redaction or filtering of sensitive data at the application level before logging or at the log aggregation layer.

## Threat: [Contextual Logging Exposing Sensitive Information](./threats/contextual_logging_exposing_sensitive_information.md)

*   **Threat:** Contextual Logging Exposing Sensitive Information
    *   **Description:** Developers utilize `zap`'s ability to add contextual fields to log entries and inadvertently include sensitive data within these fields. An attacker accessing the logs can then extract this confidential information.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to accidental logging, this can lead to the exposure of confidential information.
    *   **Affected Zap Component:** Contextual Logging Features (methods like `With`, `Fields`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Establish clear guidelines and training for developers on what contextual information is appropriate to log.
        *   Regularly review logging code for potential oversharing of context.
        *   Implement checks or filters to prevent the inclusion of sensitive data in contextual fields.
