## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service / Performance Degradation](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__performance_degradation.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks in this category aim to make the application unusable or significantly slow it down by exploiting how Zap is used or configured.
*   **High-Risk Paths:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Excessive Logging](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_excessive_logging.md)

*   **[[1.1 Excessive Logging]]**: This is a common and easily achievable attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 High Volume Logging](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_high_volume_logging.md)

    *   **[[1.1.1 High Volume Logging]]**: 
        *   **Description:** The application is configured to log at an extremely high volume, even in production. This generates massive amounts of log data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Misconfiguration of Debug/Verbose Logging](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_misconfiguration_of_debugverbose_logging.md)

    *   **[[1.1.2 Misconfiguration of Debug/Verbose Logging]]**: 
        *   **Description:** Debug or verbose logging is accidentally enabled in a production environment.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **[[1.3 Resource Exhaustion]]**:  Focuses on exhausting system resources through logging.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Disk Space Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_disk_space_exhaustion.md)

    *   **[[1.3.1 Disk Space Exhaustion]]**: 
        *   **Description:** Excessive logging, combined with inadequate or absent log rotation, fills up the available disk space.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Information Disclosure (Sensitive Data Leakage)](./attack_tree_paths/2__information_disclosure__sensitive_data_leakage_.md)

*   **Description:**  This category encompasses attacks that aim to reveal sensitive information through the application's logs. This is a *critical* threat.
    *   **High-Risk Paths:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Insecure Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_insecure_configuration.md)

*   **[[2.1 Insecure Configuration]]**:  The primary cause of information disclosure via logging.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Logging Sensitive Data to Console/Network](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_logging_sensitive_data_to_consolenetwork.md)

    *   **[[2.1.1 Logging Sensitive Data to Console/Network]]**: 
        *   **Description:** The application is configured to log sensitive information (PII, credentials, API keys, etc.) directly to the console or send it unencrypted over the network.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if monitored)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Console/Network Logging (e.g., PII, Credentials)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_consolenetwork_logging__e_g___pii__credentials_.md)

    *   **[[2.1.2 Console/Network Logging (e.g., PII, Credentials)]]**: 
        *   **Description:**  This is a more specific instance of 2.1.1, explicitly listing examples of sensitive data that might be logged.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if monitored)
