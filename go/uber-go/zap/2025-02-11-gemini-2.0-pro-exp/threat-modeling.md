# Threat Model Analysis for uber-go/zap

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Unfiltered Logging](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_unfiltered_logging.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure via Unfiltered Logging

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to log files and extracts sensitive information that was inadvertently logged due to misconfiguration of `zap`'s logging levels or lack of proper redaction within `zap`'s configuration or custom encoders. This is a direct misuse of `zap`'s features.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of PII, leading to identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage.
        *   Disclosure of credentials, allowing unauthorized access to systems and data.
        *   Revelation of internal system details, aiding in further attacks.
        *   Compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).
    *   **Affected Zap Component:**
        *   `zapcore.Core`: Misconfiguration of the core interface (e.g., using `Debug` level in production) is the primary cause.
        *   `zap.Logger`: Incorrect usage (e.g., logging entire request objects) via the main logging interface.
        *   Any custom `zap.ObjectEncoder` or `zap.ArrayEncoder` implementation that fails to redact sensitive fields.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Log Level Control:** Use `zap.ErrorLevel` or `zap.WarnLevel` as the default production log level.  Only enable `DebugLevel` or `InfoLevel` in controlled environments.
        *   **Data Redaction:** Implement custom `zapcore.Core` implementations or `zap.Hooks` to filter or redact sensitive data *before* it reaches the encoder. Use regular expressions or dedicated redaction libraries within these custom components.
        *   **Structured Logging:**  Always use `zap`'s structured logging features (e.g., `logger.Info("message", zap.String("key", "value"))`). Avoid logging raw strings.
        *   **Field-Specific Logging:** Log only necessary fields, not entire objects. Create custom encoders for specific data types to ensure consistent and safe logging within `zap`.
        *   **Code Review:** Regularly review code that uses `zap` to ensure that sensitive data is not being logged.
        *   **Secure Configuration:** Store sensitive `zap` configuration (e.g., API keys for external logging services, if used) securely.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Excessive Logging (Direct `zap` Misconfiguration)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_excessive_logging__direct__zap__misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Excessive Logging (Direct `zap` Misconfiguration)

    *   **Description:** An attacker triggers actions that, combined with a misconfigured `zap` setup (e.g., excessively verbose logging level, lack of sampling), cause `zap` to consume excessive system resources. This is distinct from general application DoS; it's specifically about `zap`'s contribution to the problem due to its configuration.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application slowdown or unavailability due to resource exhaustion caused by the logging process itself.
        *   Disk space exhaustion, leading to system instability, specifically triggered by `zap`'s output.
        *   Increased operational costs.
    *   **Affected Zap Component:**
        *   `zapcore.Core`: A high log level combined with a fast encoder (e.g., `zapcore.NewConsoleEncoder`) exacerbates the issue.
        *   `zap.Logger`: The application's use of the logger, especially at high verbosity, directly controls the volume.
        *   `zap.Sampling`: If *not* used, all logs are written, increasing the risk. A misconfigured sampler could also contribute.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Log Level Control:** Use appropriate log levels (e.g., `zap.ErrorLevel` or `zap.WarnLevel` in production).
        *   **Sampling:** Use `zap.Sampling` to reduce the volume of logs written in high-traffic scenarios. Configure the sampler correctly to write a representative subset.
        *   **Asynchronous Logging:** If the application architecture allows, consider using asynchronous logging to minimize `zap`'s direct impact on the application's performance.
        * **Monitoring:** Monitor disk space, CPU, and memory.

## Threat: [Log Injection and Forgery (Due to Unsafe `zap` Usage)](./threats/log_injection_and_forgery__due_to_unsafe__zap__usage_.md)

*   **Threat:** Log Injection and Forgery (Due to Unsafe `zap` Usage)

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious data into log entries *because* the application uses `zap` to log unsanitized user input. This is a direct consequence of how `zap` is used, not a general input validation issue. The attacker aims to disrupt log analysis or mislead investigations.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Corruption of log data.
        *   Misleading investigations.
        *   Potential (though less direct) for DoS if injected data causes excessive logging.
    *   **Affected Zap Component:**
        *   `zap.Logger`: The application's use of the logger to log unsanitized input is the direct cause.
        *   `zapcore.Encoder`: Custom encoders might be vulnerable if not implemented to properly escape special characters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Structured Logging:**  *Always* use `zap`'s structured logging features. Log data as key-value pairs, and rely on `zap`'s encoders to properly escape special characters.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (as it pertains to logging):** While broader input validation is crucial, *specifically* ensure that any data passed to `zap`'s logging methods is sanitized to prevent injection of control characters or newlines. This is a mitigation *within the context of using zap*.
        *   **Contextual Logging:** Include contextual information (e.g., user ID, request ID) in log entries, but ensure *this* data is also handled safely within `zap`.
