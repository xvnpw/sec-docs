# Attack Surface Analysis for uber-go/zap

## Attack Surface: [Log Injection/Forging](./attack_surfaces/log_injectionforging.md)

*   **1. Log Injection/Forging**

    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious content into log entries by manipulating application inputs that are subsequently logged. This can mislead investigations, trigger false alerts, or even exploit vulnerabilities in log analysis tools.
    *   **How `zap` Contributes:** `zap` provides the mechanism for logging data. If user-supplied data is directly included in log messages without sanitization, `zap` becomes the conduit for the injected content. This is the *primary* direct attack surface of `zap`.
    *   **Example:**
        *   An application logs user login attempts: `logger.Info("Login attempt for user: " + username)`.
        *   An attacker provides a username like: `admin\n[ERROR] Database connection failed`.
        *   The log now contains a misleading error message, potentially masking a real attack.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Bypass of security monitoring.
        *   Triggering of false positives in security systems.
        *   Potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in log analysis tools (though this is *indirectly* related to `zap`).
        *   Data exfiltration (indirectly, through vulnerable log parsers).
        *   Denial of Service on the logging system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if user input is directly logged) / **High** (if some sanitization is present but insufficient).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Structured Logging:** *Always* use `zap`'s structured logging features (e.g., `logger.Info("Login attempt", zap.String("username", username))`). This treats user input as data, not part of the log message template. This is the *single most important mitigation*.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation *before* logging. Reject or sanitize any input containing unexpected characters or patterns. This is a general security best practice, but crucial here.
        *   **Encoding (as a fallback):** If absolutely necessary to log potentially problematic characters, encode them (e.g., URL encoding, Base64) before passing them to `zap`. This is less preferred than strict structured logging.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on logging to prevent attackers from flooding the system with malicious log entries (DoS mitigation).
        *   **Contextual Logging:** Add contextual information (request ID, user ID) to aid in tracing.

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Configuration](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure_in_configuration.md)

*   **2. Sensitive Data Exposure in Configuration**

    *   **Description:** `zap`'s configuration (e.g., sink settings, encoder options) might inadvertently contain sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or internal network addresses. Exposure of this configuration can lead to compromise.
    *   **How `zap` Contributes:** `zap` requires configuration to define its behavior (sinks, encoders, etc.). If this configuration includes secrets and is not properly protected, `zap`'s configuration mechanism is directly involved in the exposure.
    *   **Example:**
        *   A `zap` configuration file includes a database password for a logging sink:
            ```json
            {
              "outputPaths": ["db://user:password@host:port/database"]
            }
            ```
        *   This file is accidentally committed to a public source code repository.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of sensitive credentials.
        *   Unauthorized access to internal systems.
        *   Data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Hardcode Secrets:** Absolutely avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in `zap` configuration files.
        *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to store sensitive configuration values and load them programmatically.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Employ a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to securely store and retrieve secrets.
        *   **Configuration File Permissions:** Ensure that configuration files have restrictive file permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
        *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement checks to ensure that the loaded configuration does not contain any obvious secrets or misconfigurations.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Logging Sinks](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_logging_sinks.md)

*   **3. Misconfigured Logging Sinks**

    *   **Description:** Incorrectly configured output sinks (e.g., files, network sockets, external services) can lead to logs being sent to unintended or insecure destinations, exposing sensitive information.
    *   **How `zap` Contributes:** `zap` provides the functionality to send logs to various sinks. Misconfiguration of these sinks, a direct setting within `zap`, is the root cause of this attack surface.
    *   **Example:**
        *   A `zap` sink is configured to send logs to a publicly accessible web server directory.
        *   An attacker can access the logs and potentially gain sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unintentional data exposure.
        *   Potential for network-based attacks if logs are sent to an attacker-controlled server.
        *   Denial of Service if the sink is slow or unavailable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Sink Review:** Carefully review and test *all* sink configurations to ensure they are sending logs to the correct and secure destinations. This is paramount.
        *   **Secure Protocols:** Use secure protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) when sending logs over a network.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Configure sinks with the minimum necessary permissions.  A file sink should only have write access to the specific log file, for example.
        *   **Sink Monitoring:** Monitor the performance and availability of logging sinks.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** If sending logs over a network, use network segmentation to isolate the logging traffic.
