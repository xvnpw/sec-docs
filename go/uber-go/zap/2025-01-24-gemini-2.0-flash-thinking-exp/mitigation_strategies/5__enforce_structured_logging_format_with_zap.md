    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Consistent Output Format:**  Guarantees all logs are outputted in a uniform, machine-readable format (e.g., JSON), simplifying parsing and integration with log management tools.
        *   **Simplified Configuration Management:**  Centralized configuration makes it easier to manage and update logging settings across the entire application.
        *   **Improved Auditability:**  Centralized configuration enhances auditability by providing a single point of control for logging settings.
        *   **Reduced Configuration Drift:**  Prevents inconsistencies in logging configurations across different components of the application.

    *   **Drawbacks:**
        *   **Configuration Management Complexity:**  Requires a mechanism for centralized configuration management (e.g., configuration files, environment variables, configuration server).
        *   **Single Point of Failure (Potential):**  If the centralized configuration system fails, it could impact logging across the entire application.
        *   **Deployment Complexity:**  Introducing centralized configuration might add complexity to the deployment process.
