# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for uber-go/zap

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict Data Sanitization Before Logging with `zap`](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_data_sanitization_before_logging_with__zap_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** `zap` Data Sanitization
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data for `zap` Logging:** Developers must identify data considered sensitive that might be logged using `zap`. This includes passwords, API keys, PII, financial data, etc.
    2.  **Utilize `zap`'s Structured Logging for Sanitization:** Leverage `zap`'s structured logging capabilities (fields) to control exactly what data is logged. Instead of logging entire objects or raw strings, log specific, sanitized fields.
    3.  **Sanitize Data *Before* Passing to `zap` Fields:**  Before adding data as a `zap` field (e.g., using `zap.String`, `zap.Int`, `zap.Any`), apply sanitization functions. This might involve redaction, masking, hashing, or filtering sensitive parts of the data.
    4.  **Example with `zap`:** Instead of `logger.Info("User details", zap.Any("user", userObject))`, use:
        ```go
        logger.Info("User details",
            zap.Int("user_id", userObject.ID),
            zap.String("username", sanitizeUsername(userObject.Username)), // Sanitize username
            // Omit or redact sensitive fields like password or email
        )
        ```
    5.  **Code Reviews Focused on `zap` Usage:** Conduct code reviews specifically to ensure developers are correctly using `zap`'s structured logging and applying sanitization before logging sensitive data through `zap`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Accidental logging of sensitive data through `zap` can lead to unauthorized access if logs are compromised.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Reduction):** Significantly reduces information disclosure by controlling data logged via `zap` and sanitizing it beforehand.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Partially implemented in the `user` module where password fields are redacted *before* being passed to `zap.String` for logging.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Sanitization before `zap` logging is not consistently applied across all modules, especially when using `zap.Any` or constructing complex log messages. Needs to be enforced wherever `zap` is used to log potentially sensitive data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control `zap` Log Levels in Production Environments](./mitigation_strategies/control__zap__log_levels_in_production_environments.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Production `zap` Log Level Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Production `zap` Log Level Policy:** Establish a policy to restrict `zap` log levels in production to `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`, and `Fatal`. Avoid `Debug` and `Verbose` levels in production `zap` loggers.
    2.  **Configure `zap` Logger Level for Production:**  Configure `zap` logger instances used in production to enforce this policy. This is typically done during `zap` logger initialization using configuration options or environment variables.
    3.  **Example `zap` Configuration:**
        ```go
        cfg := zap.NewProductionConfig()
        // Ensure Level is set to InfoLevel or higher for production
        cfg.Level = zap.NewAtomicLevelAt(zap.InfoLevel)
        logger, _ := cfg.Build()
        ```
    4.  **Dynamic `zap` Log Level Adjustment (Optional):** Implement a mechanism to dynamically adjust `zap` log levels in production without restarts, if needed. This could involve a configuration server or secure API to modify the `zap` logger's atomic level.
    5.  **Regular Audits of `zap` Level Configuration:** Periodically audit the `zap` logger level configuration in production to ensure it adheres to the defined policy and hasn't been inadvertently set to a more verbose level.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Verbose `zap` logging levels in production can unintentionally log more details, increasing sensitive data exposure.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Low Severity):** Excessive `zap` logging at verbose levels can consume resources, impacting performance.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Reduction):** Reduces accidental information disclosure by limiting `zap`'s verbosity in production.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Low Reduction):** Minimizes performance impact from excessive `zap` logging.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Implemented in production deployments by setting the `zap` logger level to `InfoLevel` via environment variables during logger initialization.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dynamic adjustment of `zap` log levels is not implemented.  Consider adding dynamic control for faster issue response.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encode `zap` Log Messages to Prevent Interpretation as Code](./mitigation_strategies/encode__zap__log_messages_to_prevent_interpretation_as_code.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** `zap` Log Message Encoding
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prioritize `zap` Structured Logging (Fields):** Primarily use `zap`'s field-based logging (`zap.String`, `zap.Int`, etc.). This inherently treats data as data, reducing injection risks compared to raw string messages.
    2.  **Contextual Encoding for `zap` String Messages (If Necessary):** If you must construct string log messages with `zap`, especially with external data, apply encoding appropriate for the log output format configured in `zap`.
        *   **JSON Encoding (Common for `zap`):** If `zap` outputs JSON, ensure any user-provided strings in log messages are JSON-encoded to escape special characters.
        *   **Example with `zap` and JSON Encoding (manual, but `zap` encoders handle this):**
            ```go
            userInput := `malicious"data` // Example potentially malicious input
            encodedInput := jsonEncodeString(userInput) // Hypothetical JSON encoding function
            logger.Info("User input received", zap.String("raw_input", encodedInput))
            ```
    3.  **Avoid Code Execution from `zap` Logs:** Ensure downstream log processing systems do not interpret `zap` log messages as executable code. Treat `zap` log data as data.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Injection (Medium Severity):** Attackers could inject malicious code into `zap` log messages if not properly encoded and processed as code later. Less direct threat with `zap`'s structured logging, but relevant for string messages.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Log Injection (Medium Reduction):** Reduces log injection risk by favoring `zap` structured logging and encoding string messages when needed.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Primarily uses `zap`'s structured logging. String message construction is minimized. `zap`'s JSON encoder handles basic encoding.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit, consistent JSON encoding for string messages containing external data is not enforced in all modules where string messages are used with `zap`. Standardize encoding for string messages used with `zap`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate and Sanitize Input Data Before `zap` Logging (Injection Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/validate_and_sanitize_input_data_before__zap__logging__injection_focus_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation & Sanitization for `zap` Logging
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Sources Logged by `zap`:** Pinpoint all external input sources that are logged using `zap`, such as user requests, API calls, etc.
    2.  **Validate Input Data Before `zap` Logging:** Validate all input data *before* it's passed to `zap` for logging. This includes data type, format, range, and allowlist validation.
    3.  **Sanitize Input for `zap` Logging (Injection Prevention):** Sanitize input data specifically to prevent log injection attacks *before* logging with `zap`. This involves escaping special characters relevant to log processing systems.
    4.  **Log Validated and Sanitized Data with `zap`:** Only log the validated and sanitized version of input data using `zap`.
    5.  **Example with `zap` and Sanitization:**
        ```go
        userInput := getUntrustedInput()
        if isValidInput(userInput) {
            sanitizedInput := sanitizeForLogs(userInput) // Sanitize for logging
            logger.Info("User input", zap.String("input", sanitizedInput))
        } else {
            logger.Warn("Invalid user input received")
        }
        ```
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Injection (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious payloads into logs via user input logged by `zap`, which could be exploited in downstream processing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Log Injection (Medium Reduction):** Reduces log injection risk by ensuring data logged by `zap` is validated and sanitized.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Input validation exists for application logic, but specific sanitization for log injection *before* `zap` logging is inconsistent.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dedicated input sanitization for log injection prevention needs to be consistently applied *before* all `zap` logging points that handle external input. Integrate this into the input validation process used with `zap`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `zap` Configuration Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure__zap__configuration_management.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure `zap` Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Externalize `zap` Configuration:**  Externalize `zap` configuration from application code. Use configuration files, environment variables, or configuration management systems to manage `zap` settings.
    2.  **Secure Storage for `zap` Configuration:** Store `zap` configuration securely. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information (like API keys for log aggregation services used by `zap`'s outputs) directly in configuration. Use secure storage like environment variables or secrets management systems.
    3.  **Example `zap` Configuration with Environment Variables:**
        ```go
        cfg := zap.NewProductionConfig()
        apiKey := os.Getenv("LOG_AGGREGATION_API_KEY") // Get API key from env
        cfg.OutputPaths = []string{"stdout", fmt.Sprintf("https://log-aggregator.example.com?apiKey=%s", apiKey)} // Use API key
        logger, _ := cfg.Build()
        ```
    4.  **Restrict Access to `zap` Configuration:** Limit access to `zap` configuration files and systems to authorized personnel. Use access control to prevent unauthorized modification of `zap` settings.
    5.  **Audit `zap` Configuration Changes:** Audit changes to `zap` configuration to track modifications and identify unauthorized changes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** If `zap` configuration contains sensitive data (e.g., API keys) and is insecure, it could be exposed.
    *   **Configuration Tampering (Medium Severity):** Unauthorized modification of `zap` configuration could disable logging, redirect logs insecurely, or make other security-relevant changes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Reduction):** Reduces information disclosure by securely managing sensitive data in `zap` configuration.
    *   **Configuration Tampering (Medium Reduction):** Protects `zap` configuration integrity by controlling access and auditing changes.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - `zap` configuration is partially externalized using environment variables for log level and output paths.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Sensitive configuration values for `zap` (like API keys) are sometimes hardcoded. Migrate all sensitive `zap` configuration to a secrets management system. Implement auditing of `zap` configuration changes.
