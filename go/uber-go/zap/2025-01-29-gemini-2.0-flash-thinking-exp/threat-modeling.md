# Threat Model Analysis for uber-go/zap

## Threat: [Overly Verbose Logging in Production](./threats/overly_verbose_logging_in_production.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit overly verbose logging configurations in production to gather sensitive information exposed in logs. They could passively monitor log streams or access stored logs to extract credentials, PII, or application secrets inadvertently logged due to misconfiguration of `zap` logging levels.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information, compliance violations, potential reputational damage.

**Affected Zap Component:** `Config`, `Logger` (Configuration and usage of logging levels and encoders within `zap`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement separate logging configurations for different environments (development, staging, production) within `zap` configuration.
* Minimize logging level in production `zap` configurations to only essential information for monitoring and debugging.
* Regularly review and audit production `zap` logging configurations.
* Utilize structured logging in `zap` to control logged fields and avoid accidental sensitive data logging.

## Threat: [Unintentional Logging of Sensitive Data](./threats/unintentional_logging_of_sensitive_data.md)

**Description:** Developers might unknowingly log sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII) within log messages when using `zap`'s logging functions. An attacker gaining access to these logs could directly obtain this sensitive information due to insecure coding practices in conjunction with `zap` usage. Access could be gained through compromised log storage, insecure log aggregation systems, or even exposed log files.

**Impact:** Data breach, identity theft, unauthorized access to systems, financial loss, compliance violations.

**Affected Zap Component:** `Logger` (Usage of `zap` logging functions like `Info`, `Error`, `Debug` with sensitive data as arguments).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement mandatory code reviews focusing on logging practices when using `zap`.
* Educate developers on secure logging principles and data minimization specifically in the context of `zap` usage.
* Use structured logging in `zap` and explicitly define logged fields, avoiding logging entire objects that might contain sensitive data.
* Utilize linters or static analysis tools to detect potential sensitive data logging when using `zap` logging functions.
* Consider data masking or sanitization techniques for sensitive data *before* logging with `zap` (with caution to retain debugging value).

## Threat: [Insecure Log Output Destinations](./threats/insecure_log_output_destinations.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit insecure log output destinations configured in `zap` to gain unauthorized access to logs. For example, if `zap` is configured to write logs to a publicly accessible file system, an attacker could directly read them. If `zap` is configured to send logs over an unencrypted network, they could be intercepted.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information, log tampering, loss of confidentiality.

**Affected Zap Component:** `Syncer` (Configuration of output destinations like files, stdout, network sinks within `zap` configuration).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store log files in secure locations with restricted file system permissions when using `zap` file syncer.
* Secure network connections for log shipping using TLS/SSL when using network syncer with `zap`.
* Avoid configuring `zap` to write logs to publicly accessible locations or services.
* Regularly audit and secure `zap` log output configurations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `zap` Library or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__zap__library_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known security vulnerabilities in the `zap` library itself or its dependencies. Exploiting vulnerabilities within `zap` code could potentially lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure directly related to the logging functionality or the application using `zap`.

**Impact:** Application compromise, remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, potential full system compromise.

**Affected Zap Component:** `zap` library code, dependencies of `zap`.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `zap` library and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
* Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for `zap` and its dependencies.
* Use dependency scanning tools to automatically detect vulnerable dependencies of `zap`.
* Follow secure development practices to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities when using and integrating `zap` into applications.
