# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `uber-go/zap`, provides a high-performance structured logging library for Go.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust and efficient logging solution for Go applications.
  - Enable developers to easily integrate structured logging into their applications.
  - Offer flexibility and customization through various encoders and output sinks.
  - Improve application observability and debugging capabilities.
  - Enhance application performance by minimizing logging overhead.

- Business Risks:
  - Application instability or failure due to logging library bugs.
  - Performance degradation in applications using the logging library if not used correctly.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the logging library itself could be exploited in applications using it.
  - Improper handling or exposure of sensitive data logged by applications using the library.
  - Dependency on an open-source project with potential for discontinued maintenance or security issues.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions (implicit in open-source contribution model).
  - security control: Unit and integration testing to ensure code quality and identify bugs (evident in repository).
  - security control: Static analysis tools and linters used during development (likely, though not explicitly documented).
  - security control: Dependency management using `go.mod` and `go.sum` to ensure dependency integrity.
  - security control: Publicly accessible vulnerability reports and issue tracking on GitHub.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential delay in security patch availability compared to commercial solutions.
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature implies public disclosure of vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline for the library itself.
  - security control: Formalize a security vulnerability disclosure and response process.
  - security control: Consider code signing or checksum verification for releases to ensure integrity.
  - security control: Provide guidelines and best practices for secure logging practices to users of the library, emphasizing data sanitization and sensitive data handling.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for a logging library itself. Authentication is relevant for systems that consume logs, which is outside the scope of this library.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for a logging library itself. Authorization is relevant for systems that consume logs.
  - Input Validation: Input validation is crucial within the library to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior when processing log messages and configurations. This should be implemented in the encoding and output stages.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography might be relevant if the library is extended to support encrypted logging or secure log transport. Currently, it's not a core requirement of the library itself, but could be a future enhancement.

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment for a library is different from a standalone application. Zap is deployed by being included as a dependency in Go applications.

- Deployment Architecture Options:
  - Option 1: Direct inclusion in application code (most common).
  - Option 2: Vendoring as part of application dependencies.
  - Option 3: Using Go modules dependency management.

- Detailed Deployment (Option 3 - Go Modules):

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer commits and pushes code changes to the Source Code Repository (GitHub).
  - A webhook in the Source Code Repository triggers the CI Environment (e.g., GitHub Actions).
  - The CI Environment checks out the code from the repository.
  - The Build Process is executed, which includes:
    - Go build: Compiles the Go code.
    - Unit and integration tests: Executes automated tests.
    - Linters: Runs code linters and static analysis tools to check code quality and style.
    - SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Performs static security scans to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - Build Artifacts (in this case, primarily the Go module metadata and potentially compiled binaries for distribution) are produced.
  - Artifacts are published to an Artifact Repository (e.g., Go Modules Registry like pkg.go.dev or GitHub Packages).
  - Applications can then download and use the Zap library from the Artifact Repository using `go get` or `go mod download`.

- Build Process Security Controls:
  - security control: Secure Source Code Repository (GitHub) with access control and audit logging.
  - security control: CI Environment (GitHub Actions) with secure configuration and access control.
  - security control: Automated build process to ensure consistent and repeatable builds.
  - security control: Dependency scanning in the build process to identify vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools integrated into the build process to detect code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Code linters and static analysis tools to enforce code quality and security best practices.
  - security control: Unit and integration tests to verify code functionality and prevent regressions.
  - security control: Secure Artifact Repository (Go Modules Registry) with access control and integrity checks (go.sum).
  - security control: Code signing or checksum generation for releases to ensure artifact integrity (recommended enhancement).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes Protected:
  - Application Monitoring and Observability: Logging is crucial for monitoring application health, performance, and identifying issues in production.
  - Incident Response and Debugging: Logs are essential for diagnosing and resolving application errors and incidents.
  - Security Auditing and Forensics: Logs can provide valuable information for security audits, incident investigations, and forensic analysis.
  - Business Analytics and Reporting: Logs can be used to collect data for business analytics and reporting purposes (depending on what is logged).

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Log Data: The data being protected is the log data generated by applications using the Zap library.
  - Sensitivity of Log Data: The sensitivity of log data varies greatly depending on what is being logged by the application. Logs can contain:
    - Non-sensitive operational data (e.g., timestamps, request IDs, component names).
    - Potentially sensitive data (e.g., user IDs, IP addresses, request paths).
    - Highly sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords, personal identifiable information - PII) - **logging highly sensitive data should be avoided**.
  - Data Sensitivity Classification:  Log data sensitivity should be classified based on the application and the data being logged. Organizations should have policies and guidelines for handling sensitive data in logs.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific types of applications that will be using this logging library? (e.g., web applications, microservices, backend systems).
  - What are the primary logging destinations (sinks) that will be used? (e.g., console, files, centralized logging systems).
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements related to logging (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)?
  - What is the organization's risk appetite regarding open-source dependencies?
  - Are there existing security policies or guidelines that need to be considered for logging practices?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a reliable and efficient logging solution to improve application observability and debugging.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: The organization values security and is concerned about potential vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies and secure logging practices. It is assumed that standard secure development practices are generally followed for open-source projects.
  - DESIGN: The library will be used in a variety of Go applications and will output logs to various destinations, including centralized logging systems. The deployment model is primarily focused on Go modules dependency management. The build process utilizes standard CI/CD practices and includes basic security checks.
