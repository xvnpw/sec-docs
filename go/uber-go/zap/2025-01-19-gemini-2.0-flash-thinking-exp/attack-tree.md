## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Zap -> Exploit Logged Data -> Access Sensitive Information in Logs](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_zap_-_exploit_logged_data_-_access_sensitive_information_in_logs.md)

**Exploit Logged Data (CRITICAL NODE):** The attacker's goal here is to leverage the information contained within the application's logs. This is a critical node because successful exploitation opens the door to significant information disclosure.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application logs sensitive information without proper redaction or security measures.

**Access Sensitive Information in Logs (HIGH RISK PATH):** The attacker successfully gains access to logs containing sensitive information. This path is high-risk due to the direct exposure of confidential data.
    *   **Attack Vector 1: Exploit Insufficient Sanitization of Logged Data (CRITICAL NODE):** The application logs sensitive user input (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data) directly or indirectly without proper sanitization or redaction. This is a critical node because it's a common coding error with severe consequences.
        *   **Technique:** The attacker triggers actions that cause the application to log sensitive data in plain text or easily reversible formats.
        *   **Example:** A user submits a form with their password, and the application logs the entire request body without masking the password field.
    *   **Attack Vector 2: Access Log Files with Weak Permissions (CRITICAL NODE):** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the server or log storage due to misconfigured file permissions or insecure storage configurations. This is a critical node because it provides direct access to potentially all logged information.
        *   **Technique:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the server or storage system to gain access to the file system where logs are stored.
        *   **Example:** Weak SSH credentials allow an attacker to log into the server and read log files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Log Storage](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_log_storage.md)

**Compromise Log Storage (CRITICAL NODE):** The attacker directly targets the systems where logs are stored, bypassing the application itself. This is a critical node because it grants access to a large volume of historical data, potentially revealing past security incidents or sensitive information.
    *   **Attack Vector 1: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Log Management System:** If logs are forwarded to a centralized log management system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk), the attacker exploits vulnerabilities in that system to gain access to the logs.
        *   **Technique:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the log management software, such as unpatched security flaws or default credentials.
        *   **Example:** Exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability in an outdated version of Elasticsearch.
    *   **Attack Vector 2: Access Cloud Storage with Weak Credentials:** If logs are stored in cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage), the attacker gains access through compromised access keys, weak IAM policies, or misconfigured bucket permissions.
        *   **Technique:** Obtaining leaked access keys or exploiting misconfigured bucket policies that allow public access.
        *   **Example:** Finding exposed AWS access keys in a public GitHub repository that grant read access to the S3 bucket containing logs.
