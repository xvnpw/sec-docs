# Attack Surface Analysis for uber-go/zap

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Verbose Logging](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_verbose_logging.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive data or internal application details are unintentionally included in log messages due to overly verbose logging configurations.
    * **How Zap Contributes:** `zap`'s configurable logging levels (Debug, Info, Warn, Error, DPanic, Panic, Fatal) allow developers to control the granularity of logging. Setting the level too low in production environments directly leads to `zap` recording and potentially exposing sensitive information.
    * **Example:** Logging the full request body containing user passwords or API keys at the `Debug` level, which `zap` will write to the configured output.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of user credentials, exposure of sensitive business data, potential for further attacks based on leaked information.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce strict logging level policies:** Ensure that production environments use appropriate logging levels (e.g., `Warn` or `Error`) within `zap`'s configuration to minimize the inclusion of sensitive data.
        * **Avoid logging sensitive data directly:**  Refrain from passing raw sensitive information to `zap`'s logging functions. If necessary, log only relevant identifiers or anonymized data.
        * **Regularly review logging configurations:** Periodically audit `zap`'s logging level settings to ensure they align with security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Custom Sinks](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_custom_sinks.md)

* **Description:** If the application utilizes custom `zap` sinks to direct log output to specific destinations, vulnerabilities in these custom sinks can be exploited.
    * **How Zap Contributes:** `zap` provides the functionality to register and use custom sinks. The security of these sinks directly impacts the security of the logging process managed by `zap`.
    * **Example:** A custom sink registered with `zap` that writes logs to a network location without proper authentication or encryption, allowing attackers to intercept log data written by `zap`.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of log data handled by `zap`, potential for further exploitation if the sink itself has vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Securely implement custom sinks:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom sinks used with `zap`, including input validation, proper authentication, and encryption where necessary.
        * **Regularly review and audit custom sink code:** Treat custom sink code integrated with `zap` with the same security scrutiny as other critical application components.
        * **Consider using well-established and vetted sinks:** Whenever possible, leverage existing, well-tested logging solutions or `zap`'s built-in sinks instead of creating custom sinks from scratch.

## Attack Surface: [Development Mode Left Enabled in Production](./attack_surfaces/development_mode_left_enabled_in_production.md)

* **Description:** `zap`'s development mode often includes more verbose logging, stack traces, and caller information, which can expose sensitive internal details if left enabled in production.
    * **How Zap Contributes:** `zap` offers a `NewDevelopment()` constructor that configures the logger for development purposes. Using this in production directly causes `zap` to output more detailed and potentially sensitive information.
    * **Example:** Production logs generated by `zap` including full stack traces revealing internal code execution paths and variable values during errors.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, providing attackers with insights into the application's inner workings and potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strictly control environment-specific configurations:** Ensure that the correct `zap` configuration (e.g., using `NewProduction()` or a custom production configuration) is used in production environments.
        * **Automate deployment processes:** Use automated deployment pipelines to minimize the risk of manual configuration errors related to `zap`'s initialization.
        * **Regularly review environment configurations:** Periodically verify that production environments are using the intended `zap` logging configurations.
