# Threat Model Analysis for uber-go/zap

## Threat: [Logging Sensitive Data](./threats/logging_sensitive_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, personal data, session tokens) if developers inadvertently log this data using `zap`. This could happen through direct logging of variables containing sensitive information or including sensitive data in log messages that are processed by `zap`. The attacker might access log files directly or intercept logs sent to external sinks configured within `zap`.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential for identity theft, unauthorized access to systems, financial loss, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.

**Affected Component:** Application's use of `zap`'s logging functions (e.g., `Info`, `Error`, `Debug` methods), `Encoder` (if sensitive data is formatted into the log output by `zap`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict code review processes to identify and prevent logging of sensitive data passed to `zap`'s logging functions.
* Utilize `zap`'s ability to redact or sanitize sensitive information before logging using custom `Option`s or interceptors.
* Avoid directly logging variables that might contain sensitive data when calling `zap`'s logging methods.
* Consider using dedicated secrets management solutions and logging only references or identifiers instead of the actual secrets through `zap`.
* Educate developers on secure logging practices specifically related to how `zap` handles data.

## Threat: [Log Injection](./threats/log_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious content into log files by manipulating input data that is subsequently logged by the application using `zap`. This injected content could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in log analysis tools or SIEM systems that process logs generated by `zap`. The attacker might use specially crafted strings with control characters or escape sequences that are not properly handled by `zap`'s `Encoder` or downstream tools.

**Impact:** Manipulation of log data, potentially hiding malicious activity, triggering false alerts, or even leading to code execution in vulnerable log processing tools that consume `zap`'s output. Can hinder incident response and forensic analysis.

**Affected Component:** Application's use of `zap`'s logging functions when logging user-supplied or external data, `Encoder` (if it doesn't properly escape or sanitize input before formatting the log message).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid directly logging user-provided input using `zap`.
* If logging user input is necessary, sanitize and validate the input before passing it to `zap`'s logging functions.
* Utilize `zap`'s structured logging capabilities to separate data from log messages, making injection more difficult by treating data as distinct fields.
* Ensure that log analysis tools and SIEM systems are properly configured and patched against known vulnerabilities related to processing logs in the format produced by `zap`.

## Threat: [Excessive Logging Leading to Resource Exhaustion](./threats/excessive_logging_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trigger events that cause the application to generate an excessive amount of log data using `zap`. This could be achieved by sending numerous requests, exploiting error conditions, or triggering verbose logging paths configured within the application's `zap` setup. This excessive logging can consume significant disk space, CPU, and I/O resources used by the application and the systems where `zap` writes logs.

**Impact:** Application performance degradation due to logging overhead, service unavailability due to resource exhaustion, disk space exhaustion on systems where `zap` writes logs, increased infrastructure costs for log storage.

**Affected Component:** Application's logging logic using `zap`, `zap`'s core logging functions, `Sinks` configured within `zap` (where logs are written).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully configure logging levels within the application's `zap` setup for different environments (development, staging, production).
* Implement log rotation policies for the `Sinks` used by `zap` to manage log file sizes.
* Monitor resource usage related to `zap`'s logging activity and set up alerts for unusual spikes in log volume.
* Consider using asynchronous logging provided by `zap` or external libraries to minimize the impact on application performance.
* Implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms for certain log events that are handled by the application and subsequently logged by `zap`.

## Threat: [Exposure through Insecure Log Sinks](./threats/exposure_through_insecure_log_sinks.md)

**Description:** If `zap` is configured to send logs to external sinks (e.g., files, network sockets, cloud logging services) without proper security measures, an attacker could intercept or access the log data. This could involve eavesdropping on network traffic if `zap` is configured to use unencrypted network sinks, or accessing unsecured file systems where `zap` writes logs.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive information logged by `zap`, potential for further attacks based on leaked information.

**Affected Component:** `Sinks` configured within `zap` (especially network sinks), `zap`'s configuration related to sink destinations and security settings.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure secure configuration of all log sinks used by `zap`, including encryption in transit (e.g., TLS for network sinks) and at rest for file-based sinks.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing log sinks configured within `zap`.
* Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) for transmitting logs over the network if using network sinks with `zap`.
* Regularly review the security configurations of external logging services used as `zap` sinks.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Sinks](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_sinks.md)

**Description:** If developers implement custom log sinks for `zap`, vulnerabilities in the custom sink code could expose the application to risks. This could include issues like insecure network communication within the custom sink, improper data handling of logs received from `zap`, or injection vulnerabilities within the custom sink's logic.

**Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom sink, potentially leading to information disclosure of data logged by `zap`, remote code execution within the custom sink's environment, or denial of service affecting the logging pipeline.

**Affected Component:** Custom `Sink` implementations used with `zap`.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be high or critical depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review and test any custom log sink implementations used with `zap` for security vulnerabilities.
* Adhere to secure coding practices when developing custom sinks for `zap`.
* Consider using well-established and vetted logging solutions or `zap`'s built-in sinks instead of custom implementations where possible.
* Implement proper input validation and sanitization within the custom sink to handle log data received from `zap` securely.
* Ensure secure communication protocols are used if the custom sink involves network communication.
