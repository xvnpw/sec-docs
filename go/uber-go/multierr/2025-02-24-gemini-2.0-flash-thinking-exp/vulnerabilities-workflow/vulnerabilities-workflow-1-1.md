## Vulnerability List for multierr Project

After analyzing the provided project files for the `multierr` Go library, no high-rank vulnerabilities were identified that meet the specified criteria.

It's important to note that the `multierr` library is designed to aggregate and manage errors within Go applications. It does not handle external user input directly, nor does it perform operations that are typically exposed to external attackers in a public instance. The potential security concerns related to error handling often arise in the context of how applications *use* error libraries, particularly in areas like error message content and exposure. However, these concerns are generally outside the scope of vulnerabilities *within* the `multierr` library itself.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the constraints given, there are no vulnerabilities to report for the `multierr` project that fit the criteria of being:

- Introduced by the `multierr` library code.
- Triggerable by an external attacker on a public instance.
- Ranked as high or critical.
- Not already mitigated (as there are no identified vulnerabilities).
- Not excluded due to being DoS, developer misuse, or missing documentation.

It is recommended to continue monitoring for vulnerabilities as the project evolves and in the context of specific applications that utilize the `multierr` library. However, based on the current code, the `multierr` library appears to be securely implemented for its intended purpose.
