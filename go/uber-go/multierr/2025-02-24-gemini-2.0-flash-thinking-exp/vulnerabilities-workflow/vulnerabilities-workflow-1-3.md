Okay, I will review the provided vulnerability list and the instructions.

The current list states:

```markdown
## Vulnerability List for multierr Project

Based on the provided project files, no high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance of an application using this library have been identified.

It is important to note that this analysis is based solely on the provided files and focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by the `multierr` library itself. Security vulnerabilities might still arise in applications that *use* this library if they are not implemented securely, but those would not be vulnerabilities *of* the `multierr` library.

Therefore, based on the current analysis and the constraints provided, the vulnerability list is empty.
```

Based on your instructions to exclude certain types of vulnerabilities and include only high-rank ones exploitable by external attackers in public instances, and assuming that my analysis also finds no such vulnerabilities in the `multierr` project itself, the current empty list is consistent with your requirements.

Therefore, I will return the same empty list as the updated list because no changes are needed based on your instructions and the current analysis.
