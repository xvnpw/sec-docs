- **Vulnerability Name:** Untrusted Error Implementation Leading to Panic in Error Formatting
  - **Description:**  
    An attacker who can supply a custom error value with a malicious implementation of the `Error()` or `Format()` method can force a panic when the error is later formatted or logged through multierr. The steps to trigger this vulnerability are as follows:
    - An attacker creates a custom error type (for example, a type named `maliciousError`) whose `Error()` method (or `Format()` method) deliberately panics.
    - The attacker finds a way—for instance, through unvalidated input processing in the application—to have an instance of this malicious error injected into the error aggregation process (via calls to functions such as `multierr.Combine()` or `multierr.Append()`).
    - When the application later formats the aggregated error (by calling its `Error()` method or using formatted output such as `%+v`), the multierr implementation calls the underlying error’s method without any protective wrapper.
    - The malicious method panics, causing the overall error formatting operation to panic and, in turn, crash the application.
  - **Impact:**  
    If this vulnerability is successfully triggered, it will cause an unexpected application crash due to an unhandled panic. In production, such a crash might lead to a loss of service and could also disrupt error logging and downstream monitoring—resulting in a potential denial of service situation.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The multierr library calls the `Error()` (and, if available, the `Format()` method) on each aggregated error without wrapping these calls in a recovery or sanitization mechanism.  
    - There is no explicit input validation or error method sandboxing in the code (for example, in `writeSingleline` or `writeMultiline`).
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - A safe error-formatting wrapper that uses a `recover()` block to catch panics triggered by custom error methods should be introduced.  
    - Optional validation or sanitization of error messages (especially when they could have originated from untrusted sources) would reduce the risk of a malicious error implementation.
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The application that uses multierr must allow error values (or errors derived from external inputs) that are controlled or influenced by an attacker.  
    - The attacker must be able to inject a malicious error implementation into the error-handling path that is later aggregated by multierr.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In the function `multiError.writeSingleline(w io.Writer)` (found in *error.go*), the code iterates over the slice `merr.errors` and, for each item, immediately calls `io.WriteString(w, item.Error())`. There is no panic prevention mechanism (such as a deferred recover) around the call to `item.Error()`.
    - Similarly, in `multiError.writeMultiline(w io.Writer)`, the call to `fmt.Sprintf("%+v", item)` may invoke a custom `Format()` method on a user-controlled error value. Again, no recovery from panics is provided.
    - Because neither function attempts to catch panics resulting from calling methods on the aggregated error values, a malicious implementation that panics will propagate its panic and crash the caller.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Setup:**  
       - Define a custom error type (e.g., `maliciousError`) whose `Error()` method immediately calls `panic("malicious panic")`.
       - Create a benign error (for example, using `errors.New("normal error")`).
    2. **Aggregation:**  
       - Use `multierr.Combine(maliciousError{}, normalError)` or a similar call (such as successive calls to `multierr.Append()`) to aggregate the malicious error with the benign error.
    3. **Trigger:**  
       - Invoke the `Error()` method on the resulting aggregated error (or format it using `fmt.Sprintf("%+v", aggregatedError)`).
    4. **Assertion:**  
       - Verify that the call panics as expected (this can be done by wrapping the call in a test that asserts a panic is raised).
    5. **Result:**  
       - The successful detection of the panic confirms that an attacker who can inject such a malicious error would be able to cause a critical failure in any application that later formats the multierr error.
