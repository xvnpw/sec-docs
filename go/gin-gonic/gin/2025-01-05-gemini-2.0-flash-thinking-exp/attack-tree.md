## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities -> Path Traversal via Routing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities_-_path_traversal_via_routing.md)

**1. High-Risk Path: Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities -> Path Traversal via Routing**

*   **Attack Vector:** Path Traversal via Routing
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters or URL paths to access files or directories on the server that are outside the intended scope of the application. This is often achieved by injecting sequences like `../` into the path.
    *   **How Gin is Involved:** If Gin routes are constructed dynamically based on user-provided input without proper sanitization or validation, attackers can inject malicious path segments. For example, if a route is defined like `/files/:filename` and the application directly uses the `filename` parameter to access a file, an attacker could send a request like `/files/../../etc/passwd` to attempt to access the system's password file.
    *   **Why it's High-Risk:**
        *   **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive configuration files, source code, internal application data, or even system files, potentially leading to full server compromise.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium. The likelihood depends on whether developers are constructing file paths directly from user input in route handlers, a common mistake if not explicitly avoided.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities -> File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities_-_file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

**2. High-Risk Path: Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities -> File Upload Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vector:** File Upload Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads malicious files to the server. These files can be designed to execute arbitrary code on the server, overwrite existing files, or facilitate other attacks.
    *   **How Gin is Involved:** Gin provides the `c.SaveUploadedFile` function to handle file uploads. If the application doesn't implement proper security measures when using this function, it can be vulnerable. Common weaknesses include:
        *   Lack of file type validation (relying solely on the extension).
        *   Insufficient file size limits.
        *   Storing uploaded files in publicly accessible locations.
        *   Not sanitizing file names, which could lead to path traversal issues during storage.
    *   **Why it's High-Risk:**
        *   **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the server. It can also be used to upload malware, deface the website, or compromise other users.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High. File upload vulnerabilities are a common weakness in web applications, and the ease of attempting such attacks makes the likelihood relatively high if proper precautions are not taken.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Response Handling Vulnerabilities -> Template Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_response_handling_vulnerabilities_-_template_injection.md)

**3. High-Risk Path: Exploit Response Handling Vulnerabilities -> Template Injection**

*   **Attack Vector:** Template Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into template data that is processed by the server's template engine. If the template engine doesn't properly sanitize or escape user-provided data before rendering it, the injected code can be executed on the server.
    *   **How Gin is Involved:** Gin supports various template engines. If the application uses a template engine and directly embeds user-provided data into templates without proper escaping, it becomes vulnerable. For example, if a template renders a variable like `{{.UserInput}}` and `UserInput` comes directly from a user request, an attacker could inject template directives or scripting code (depending on the engine) to execute commands on the server.
    *   **Why it's High-Risk:**
        *   **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution, giving the attacker full control over the server.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium. The likelihood depends on whether the application uses server-side templating and how user-provided data is handled within the templates. Developers aware of this risk will typically implement proper escaping mechanisms.
