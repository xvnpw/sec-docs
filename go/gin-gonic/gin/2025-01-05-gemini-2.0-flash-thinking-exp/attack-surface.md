# Attack Surface Analysis for gin-gonic/gin

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate data passed within URL path parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`) to cause unintended actions or access unauthorized resources.
    *   **How Gin Contributes:** Gin's routing mechanism directly extracts these parameters and makes them available to handlers. Lack of sanitation or validation at this stage exposes the application.
    *   **Example:**  A request like `/files/../../etc/passwd` targeting a route like `/files/:filepath` could be used to attempt to read sensitive system files if the `filepath` parameter is not validated.
    *   **Impact:**  Path traversal, information disclosure, potential command injection (if parameters are used in system calls).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all route parameters within the handler functions. Use whitelisting of allowed characters or patterns.
        *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize input to remove potentially harmful characters or sequences (e.g., `../`).
        *   **Avoid Direct File Access Based on User Input:**  If possible, use internal identifiers instead of directly using user-provided paths to access files.

## Attack Surface: [Wildcard Route Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/wildcard_route_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit wildcard routes (e.g., `/static/*filepath`) to access unintended resources or perform actions outside the intended scope.
    *   **How Gin Contributes:** Gin's wildcard routing captures the remaining part of the URL, making it available to the handler. Improper handling of this captured path is a direct Gin-related risk.
    *   **Example:** A request like `/static/../../config.json` targeting a route like `/static/*filepath` could be used to access sensitive configuration files if the `filepath` is not properly validated and restricted.
    *   **Impact:** Path traversal, information disclosure, potential server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Wildcard Scope:**  Carefully define the directory or path that the wildcard route should apply to.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize the captured path within the handler function to prevent traversal attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (if using HTML rendering)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__if_using_html_rendering_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into templates that are rendered on the server, leading to arbitrary code execution or information disclosure.
    *   **How Gin Contributes:** If using Gin's HTML rendering capabilities (e.g., `c.HTML()`) and directly embedding user-controlled data into templates without proper escaping, Gin facilitates this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:**  If user input is directly embedded into an HTML template like `<h1>Hello {{.Username}}</h1>` without escaping, an attacker could input `{{exec "rm -rf /"}}` (depending on the template engine) to execute commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), information disclosure, server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Auto-Escaping:**  Ensure the template engine used with Gin (e.g., `html/template`) has auto-escaping enabled by default.
        *   **Sanitize User Input:**  Sanitize any user-provided data before embedding it into templates.
        *   **Avoid Direct Code Execution in Templates:**  Limit the logic within templates and avoid allowing direct code execution.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Static File Serving](./attack_surfaces/insecure_static_file_serving.md)

*   **Description:**  Misconfiguration or lack of proper restrictions when serving static files can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files.
    *   **How Gin Contributes:** Gin provides functions like `r.Static()` and `r.StaticFS()` to easily serve static files. The configuration of these functions directly determines the accessible file paths.
    *   **Example:**  Using `r.Static("/", "./")` would serve the entire server's filesystem if accessed via the root path.
    *   **Impact:** Path traversal, information disclosure, potential exposure of sensitive configuration files or application code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Static File Paths:**  Carefully define the directory from which static files are served. Avoid serving the entire application root or sensitive directories.
        *   **Use Specific Paths:**  Use more specific paths instead of the root path for serving static files.
