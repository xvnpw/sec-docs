## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Unintended Route Exposure [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_unintended_route_exposure__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.1 Misconfigured Route Groups [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **1.1.1 Accidental Exposure of Admin Routes (No Middleware) [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:**  Admin routes are defined without requiring authentication or authorization middleware, allowing anyone to access them.
        *   **Action:**  Review all route group definitions and ensure appropriate middleware (auth, authorization) is applied to sensitive groups. Use a linter or static analysis tool.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if logs are monitored), Easy (if not)

    *   **1.1.2 Incorrectly Nested Groups (Bypassing Middleware)**
        *   **Description:**  Route groups are nested in a way that unintentionally bypasses middleware intended to protect them.
        *   **Action:** Carefully review the nesting of route groups. Test middleware application thoroughly. Consider using a visual route map generator.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

*   **1.2.1 Overly Broad Wildcard Matching (`*filepath`) [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:**  A wildcard route (`*filepath`) is used without proper validation, allowing attackers to access arbitrary files or directories on the server.
    *   **Action:** Use wildcards with extreme caution. Validate the `filepath` parameter within the handler. Consider more specific route definitions.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High (potential for file system access)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if file access logs are monitored)

*   **1.3 Debug Mode Enabled in Production [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:**  Gin's debug mode is left enabled in a production environment, exposing sensitive internal information and application workings.
    *   **Action:** **Never** enable Gin's debug mode (`gin.SetMode(gin.ReleaseMode)`) in a production environment. Use environment variables.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (should be caught in code review/testing)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (full information disclosure)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Data Binding Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_data_binding_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **2.1 Mass Assignment via `ShouldBind` (or similar) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **2.1.1 Binding to Unintended Fields in Struct [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:**  `ShouldBind` (or similar) is used to bind request data directly to a model struct, including fields that should not be user-controlled.
        *   **Action:** Use dedicated Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for binding. DTOs should only contain the fields expected from user input. Use `binding:"-"`.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (potential to modify sensitive data)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

*   **2.2.1 Unsafe XML/YAML Parsing via `ShouldBindXML`/`ShouldBindYAML` [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:**  XML or YAML data is parsed using `ShouldBindXML` or `ShouldBindYAML` without disabling external entity resolution, leading to XXE/YYE vulnerabilities.
    *   **Action:** If using XML or YAML binding, ensure the underlying parser is configured to disable external entity resolution. Use safe parsers. Prefer JSON.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if XML/YAML is used, and not configured securely)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (potential for file system access, SSRF)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

* **2.3 TOML Injection [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** TOML data is parsed without disabling external entity resolution.
    *   **Action:** If using TOML binding, ensure the underlying parser is configured to disable external entity resolution.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if TOML is used, and not configured securely)
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Middleware Misconfiguration or Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_middleware_misconfiguration_or_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **3.1.2 Logic Errors in Middleware [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:**  Custom middleware contains logical errors that allow attackers to bypass security checks.
    *   **Action:** Write comprehensive unit tests for custom middleware. Use code coverage tools.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (bypass security checks)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

*   **3.1.3 Vulnerable Third-Party Middleware [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:**  A third-party Gin middleware contains a vulnerability that can be exploited.
    *   **Action:** Carefully vet any third-party Gin middleware. Keep middleware dependencies updated. Monitor for security advisories.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High (depends on the vulnerability)
    *   **Effort:** Varies (depends on the vulnerability)
    *   **Skill Level:** Varies (depends on the vulnerability)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies (depends on the vulnerability)

*   **3.2 Timing Attacks on Authentication Middleware [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:**  Authentication middleware is vulnerable to timing attacks, allowing attackers to potentially guess credentials.
    *   **Action:** Use constant-time comparison functions (e.g., `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`).
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High (credential compromise)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

*   **3.3 Session Fixation/Hijacking (if using session middleware) [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:**  Session management is misconfigured, allowing attackers to fixate or hijack user sessions.
    *   **Action:** If using Gin's session middleware, ensure it's configured to prevent session fixation and hijacking. Generate new session IDs after authentication, use secure cookies, and set appropriate timeouts.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if session management is misconfigured)
    *   **Impact:** High (account takeover)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

*   **5.1 HTTP Request Smuggling [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Go's `net/http` package allow for HTTP request smuggling attacks.
    *   **Action:** Keep Go updated. Consider using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (requires specific server configurations)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (potential for request hijacking, cache poisoning)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
