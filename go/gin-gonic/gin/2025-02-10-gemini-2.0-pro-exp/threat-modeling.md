# Threat Model Analysis for gin-gonic/gin

## Threat: [Threat: Debug Mode Exposure](./threats/threat_debug_mode_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers that the application is running in debug mode, either through error messages or by probing for debug endpoints. The attacker can then access sensitive information about the application's routes, internal structure, and potentially even environment variables. This is often done by simply trying common debug URLs or observing verbose error output. Gin's default behavior includes debugging features.
*   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive information, including API endpoints, internal paths, and potentially configuration details. This can lead to further attacks, such as targeted exploitation of specific routes or unauthorized access to internal services.
*   **Affected Gin Component:** `gin.DebugPrintRouteFunc`, `gin.Default()` (which includes debugging features by default), general configuration of `gin.Mode()`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** run Gin in debug mode (`gin.DebugMode`) in a production environment.  Use environment variables (e.g., `GIN_MODE=release`) to control the mode.
    *   Ensure that any custom error handling does not reveal sensitive information in production.
    *   Regularly review application logs for any signs of debug information leakage.

## Threat: [Threat: Middleware Bypass via `c.Next()` Misuse](./threats/threat_middleware_bypass_via__c_next____misuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious request that exploits a flaw in a *custom* middleware implementation *within Gin*. The middleware is intended to block certain requests (e.g., based on authentication or authorization), but due to incorrect use of Gin's `c.Next()` function, the request is allowed to proceed to the handler, bypassing the security check. The attacker might achieve this by manipulating request parameters, headers, or the request path. This is a direct misuse of a Gin-provided mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing of authentication or authorization checks, leading to unauthorized access to protected resources or functionality.
*   **Affected Gin Component:** Custom middleware implementations, specifically the use of `c.Next()` and `c.Abort()` within the middleware *provided by Gin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test all custom middleware implementations.  Pay close attention to the logic surrounding `c.Next()` and `c.Abort()`.
    *   Use unit tests and integration tests to verify that middleware correctly blocks or allows requests as intended.
    *   Consider using established middleware libraries for common security tasks (e.g., authentication, authorization) instead of writing custom implementations whenever possible.  This reduces the risk of misusing `c.Next()`.
    *   Implement robust input validation *within* the middleware to prevent attackers from manipulating the request in ways that bypass the intended checks.

## Threat: [Threat: Route Hijacking via Overlapping Routes](./threats/threat_route_hijacking_via_overlapping_routes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers that two or more routes are defined *within Gin* in a way that they overlap (e.g., `/users/:id` and `/users/admin`). The attacker crafts a request that matches the more general route but is intended to target the more specific (and potentially more privileged) route. Gin's routing logic (a core component) might resolve the request to the unintended handler.
*   **Impact:** Unpredictable application behavior, potentially leading to unauthorized access or execution of unintended functionality. The attacker might gain access to a more privileged endpoint than intended.
*   **Affected Gin Component:** Gin's router (`gin.Engine`), specifically the route definition process using methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc. - *this is a core Gin functionality*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review all route definitions to ensure they are unambiguous and do not overlap.
    *   Use a consistent and well-defined routing strategy.
    *   Test the application's routing behavior thoroughly, including edge cases and potential overlaps.
    *   Consider using a linter or static analysis tool to help identify potential routing conflicts.

## Threat: [Threat: Outdated Gin or Dependency Vulnerability](./threats/threat_outdated_gin_or_dependency_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an outdated version of *Gin itself* or one of its *direct* dependencies. The attacker might find information about the vulnerability in public databases (e.g., CVEs) or through security research. The attacker then crafts a request or uses a tool to exploit the vulnerability. This directly impacts the Gin framework.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
*   **Affected Gin Component:** The entire Gin framework itself, or any of its *direct* dependencies (e.g., `net/http`, `golang.org/x/net`, etc.) that Gin relies upon.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a known RCE exists in Gin or a *direct* dependency), High (for other serious vulnerabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Gin and all its *direct* dependencies to the latest stable versions. Use Go modules (`go mod tidy`, `go mod vendor`) to manage dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., `go list -m -u all`, `snyk`, `dependabot`) to identify and track known vulnerabilities in dependencies, *especially Gin itself*.
    *   Monitor security advisories and mailing lists related to Gin and Go.
    *   Implement a robust vulnerability management process.

## Threat: [Threat: Insecure Logging of Sensitive Data (via Gin's Mechanisms)](./threats/threat_insecure_logging_of_sensitive_data__via_gin's_mechanisms_.md)

* **Description:** The application, *through Gin's logging middleware or custom logging that utilizes Gin's context*, logs sensitive information such as request bodies, headers (including authentication tokens), or other confidential data. An attacker gains access to these logs. This focuses on the misuse of Gin's logging facilities.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data.
* **Affected Gin Component:** `gin.Logger()`, `gin.DefaultWriter`, custom logging implementations using `gin.Context`.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Carefully configure logging levels and what data is logged *using Gin's configuration options*. Avoid logging request bodies or sensitive headers in production.
    * Use a structured logging approach to facilitate filtering, making it easier to exclude sensitive fields *when using Gin's logging*.
    * Implement log redaction or masking to prevent sensitive data from being written to logs in the first place, specifically within any custom logging that interacts with `gin.Context`.
    * Securely store and manage logs.
    * Regularly review and audit logging configurations *related to Gin*.
