# Attack Surface Analysis for gin-gonic/gin

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Exploitation (Path Traversal & Injection)](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_exploitation__path_traversal_&_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate URL parameters to access unintended resources or bypass security controls, specifically exploiting Gin's routing mechanisms.
    *   **Gin Contribution:** Gin's wildcard and parameter routing (e.g., `/users/:id`, `/files/*filepath`) are vulnerable *without* robust input validation *within* the handler. Gin's routing logic itself does *not* perform content validation of the parameters. This is a direct consequence of how Gin handles routes.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses `/users/../../etc/passwd` with a route defined as `/users/:id` to attempt path traversal.  Or, an attacker injects SQL code into a parameter if the handler uses it directly in a database query without proper escaping (though this is a general vulnerability, the *entry point* is Gin's parameter handling).
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, bypassing of security controls, potential code execution (if combined with other vulnerabilities like SQL injection).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the exposed data and functionality).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation (Within Handlers):** Implement rigorous input validation *inside* each route handler. This is *crucial* because Gin does not validate parameter content. Check for path traversal sequences (`..`, `/`), unexpected characters, and data type/format violations.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Characters:** Define a whitelist of allowed characters for each parameter and reject any input containing characters outside the whitelist.
        *   **Sanitize Input:** Sanitize input to remove or encode potentially dangerous characters, again, *within the handler*.
        *   **Avoid Overly Broad Wildcards:** Use specific routes whenever possible. If wildcards are necessary, be *extremely* cautious with input validation.
        *   **Dedicated Path Traversal Middleware:** Implement or use a middleware that specifically checks for and blocks path traversal attempts *before* they reach the route handler. This adds a layer of defense *before* Gin's routing logic.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment (Data Binding)](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment__data_binding_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject unexpected fields into request payloads (JSON, XML, form data) to modify data they shouldn't have access to, directly exploiting Gin's binding features.
    *   **Gin Contribution:** Gin's `c.Bind`, `c.BindJSON`, `c.BindXML`, etc., automatically bind request data to Go structs. This is the *direct* mechanism of the vulnerability. If the struct contains fields that should not be user-controlled, Gin will still bind them if present in the request.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with an `isAdmin` field set to `true` when creating a user, hoping to gain administrative privileges. Gin will bind this field if it exists in the target struct.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation, data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the affected data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Create separate structs *specifically* for request binding. *Never* directly bind to structs used for database interaction or other sensitive operations. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Whitelist Fields (Struct Tags):** Use struct tags (e.g., `json:"username,omitempty"`) to explicitly define which fields are allowed to be bound by Gin. This controls what Gin *can* bind.
        *   **Input Validation After Binding:** Perform thorough input validation *after* Gin has performed the binding, to ensure data conforms to expected constraints. This is a secondary check.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Payloads (Binding)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_payloads__binding_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send excessively large request bodies to consume server resources, exploiting Gin's lack of default request size limits during binding.
    *   **Gin Contribution:** Gin, by default, does *not* limit the size of request bodies when using `c.Bind`, `c.BindJSON`, etc. This is the *direct* enabler of the attack.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a multi-gigabyte JSON payload to a route that uses `c.BindJSON`, causing the server to run out of memory.
    *   **Impact:** Server resource exhaustion, application unavailability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Limit Request Body Size (Middleware):** Use middleware to limit the maximum size of request bodies *before* they reach Gin's binding functions. Example: `c.Request.Body = http.MaxBytesReader(c.Writer, c.Request.Body, 1024*1024)` (for a 1MB limit). This is the primary defense.
        *   **Streaming (for very large files):** If you *must* handle very large files, consider using streaming techniques instead of relying on Gin's binding to load the entire request body into memory.

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Proxy Header Spoofing](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_proxy_header_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate proxy headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`) to spoof their IP address, bypassing security controls that rely on IP addresses.
    *   **Gin Contribution:** While Gin *doesn't* trust these headers by default, if `gin.SetTrustedProxies` is misconfigured (especially with `nil`), Gin will use the attacker-supplied values. This is a direct configuration issue within Gin.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sets `X-Forwarded-For` to a trusted IP address to bypass IP-based restrictions that are implemented using Gin's request context information.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing IP-based restrictions, manipulating logging, potentially gaining unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if proxy headers are incorrectly trusted).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Only Trust Known Proxies:** Only enable trust for proxy headers if your application is *actually* behind a trusted proxy *and* you understand the implications.
        *   **Use `gin.SetTrustedProxies` Correctly:** Explicitly specify which proxy IP addresses or networks are trusted using `gin.SetTrustedProxies`. *Never* use `gin.SetTrustedProxies(nil)` in a production environment, as this trusts *all* proxies.
