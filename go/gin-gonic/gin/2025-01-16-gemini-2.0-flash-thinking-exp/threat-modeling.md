# Threat Model Analysis for gin-gonic/gin

## Threat: [Route Hijacking via Overlapping Definitions](./threats/route_hijacking_via_overlapping_definitions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft requests that are unintentionally matched by a less specific route defined *after* a more specific one. This allows them to bypass intended access controls or trigger unintended functionality. For example, if `/admin/users` is defined after `/admin/:resource`, a request to `/admin/users` might be handled by the handler for `/admin/:resource` with `users` as the `resource` parameter.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, execution of unintended code paths, potential data manipulation or disclosure.

**Affected Gin Component:** `RouterGroup.Handle()`, `RouterGroup.GET()`, `RouterGroup.POST()`, etc. (the routing mechanism).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Define routes with increasing specificity. Use `gin.IRoutes.Handle(http.MethodGet, "/admin/users", handler)` for exact path matching if needed. Carefully review route definitions and their order. Consider using a linter that can detect potential route overlaps.

## Threat: [Middleware Ordering Bypass](./threats/middleware_ordering_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities arising from the order in which middleware is executed. If a security-critical middleware (e.g., authentication) is placed after a middleware that modifies the request in a way that bypasses the security check, the attacker can gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Bypassing authentication or authorization, access to protected resources, potential data breaches.

**Affected Gin Component:** `gin.Engine.Use()`, `gin.RouterGroup.Use()`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully plan and document the order of middleware execution. Ensure that security-critical middleware is executed early in the chain. Thoroughly test the middleware pipeline to ensure the intended order and behavior.

## Threat: [Context Data Manipulation by Middleware](./threats/context_data_manipulation_by_middleware.md)

**Description:** A malicious or poorly written middleware could manipulate data stored in the Gin context in a way that negatively impacts subsequent handlers or other middleware. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. For example, a middleware could overwrite authentication information or modify user roles.

**Impact:** Bypassing authorization, data corruption, unexpected application behavior.

**Affected Gin Component:** `gin.Context.Set()`, `gin.Context.Keys`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully review and audit all custom middleware. Ensure that middleware interacts with the context in a predictable and secure manner. Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the context if possible. Clearly define the purpose and expected state of data stored in the context.
