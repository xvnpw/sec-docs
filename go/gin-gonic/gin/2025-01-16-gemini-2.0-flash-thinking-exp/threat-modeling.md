# Threat Model Analysis for gin-gonic/gin

## Threat: [Route Hijacking](./threats/route_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a URL that matches an overly broad or ambiguously defined route, causing the request to be handled by an unintended handler. This can lead to unauthorized access to functionality or data intended for a different route. For example, a poorly defined wildcard route could intercept requests meant for more specific endpoints.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, execution of unintended functionality, potential data manipulation or disclosure depending on the hijacked route's function.
*   **Affected Gin Component:** Router (specifically the route matching logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Define specific and precise route patterns.
    *   Avoid using overly broad wildcards unless absolutely necessary and with strict input validation within the handler.
    *   Utilize route grouping to organize routes and improve clarity, reducing the chance of overlaps.
    *   Test route definitions thoroughly to ensure intended behavior.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Route Parameters](./threats/path_traversal_via_route_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters that are used to construct file paths on the server. By injecting characters like `../`, they can navigate outside the intended directories and access unauthorized files or directories. The ease of parameter extraction in Gin can make this oversight more common.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential disclosure of application source code or configuration files, possibility of arbitrary code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Gin Component:** Router (parameter extraction) and potentially application handlers that process these parameters.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all input received through route parameters before using them to construct file paths.
    *   Use safe file access methods that prevent traversal (e.g., using a whitelist of allowed filenames or IDs).
    *   Avoid directly using user-provided input in file paths.
    *   Implement proper access controls on the file system.

## Threat: [Middleware Execution Order Vulnerabilities](./threats/middleware_execution_order_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits the order in which middleware is registered. If security-critical middleware (like authentication or authorization) is executed after a handler that assumes the user is authenticated, the attacker can bypass these security checks.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing authentication and authorization controls, leading to unauthorized access to resources and functionality.
*   **Affected Gin Component:** Middleware handling mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully plan and document the order of middleware execution.
    *   Ensure that security-critical middleware is registered and executed early in the middleware chain.
    *   Thoroughly test middleware interactions to confirm the intended execution order.
    *   Use a consistent and well-defined middleware structure.

## Threat: [Vulnerable or Malicious Third-Party Middleware](./threats/vulnerable_or_malicious_third-party_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities present in third-party middleware used within the Gin application. This could be due to known vulnerabilities in the middleware package or malicious code intentionally introduced into the middleware.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Affected Gin Component:** Middleware integration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet and audit any third-party middleware before using it in production.
    *   Keep middleware dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor for security advisories related to used middleware packages.
    *   Consider using well-established and reputable middleware libraries.
    *   Implement security measures to sandbox or isolate middleware if possible.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request with unexpected or malicious data that gets automatically bound to application structs using Gin's binding features (e.g., `ShouldBind`). If not properly controlled, this can allow the attacker to modify unintended fields, potentially including sensitive data or internal state.
*   **Impact:** Modification of sensitive data, bypassing business logic, potential privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Gin Component:** Data binding functions (e.g., `ShouldBind`, `BindJSON`, `Bind`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use specific binding methods and define strict struct tags to control which fields can be bound from the request.
    *   Avoid binding directly to database models or entities that contain sensitive fields.
    *   Implement input validation after binding to ensure data conforms to the expected format and constraints.
    *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to explicitly define the structure of expected input.
