# Attack Surface Analysis for gin-gonic/gin

## Attack Surface: [Route Hijacking/Shadowing](./attack_surfaces/route_hijackingshadowing.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrectly defined or overlapping routes can lead to unintended handlers being executed. A more specific route might be shadowed by a more general one.
*   **How Gin Contributes:** Gin's routing mechanism executes the first matching route. If route definitions are not carefully ordered and specific enough, unintended handlers can be triggered.
*   **Example:**
    ```go
    r.GET("/users/:id", getUserHandler) // Intended handler
    r.GET("/users/admin", adminPanelHandler) // Should be more specific
    ```
    A request to `/users/admin` might incorrectly trigger `getUserHandler` if the routes are defined in this order.
*   **Impact:**  Access to unauthorized functionality, data manipulation, or denial of service depending on the shadowed route's functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Define routes with the most specific patterns first.
    *   Avoid overly broad wildcard routes unless absolutely necessary and carefully secured within the handler.
    *   Regularly review and audit route definitions to identify potential overlaps or ambiguities.
    *   Use Gin's route grouping features to organize and manage routes logically.

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection via Path](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection_via_path.md)

*   **Description:** Route parameters extracted from the URL path are not properly sanitized or validated in the handler, allowing attackers to inject malicious code or unexpected values.
*   **How Gin Contributes:** Gin provides easy access to route parameters using `c.Param("id")`. If developers directly use these parameters in sensitive operations without validation, it creates a vulnerability.
*   **Example:**
    ```go
    r.GET("/files/:filename", func(c *gin.Context) {
        filename := c.Param("filename")
        // Insecure: Directly using filename in a system call
        // cmd := exec.Command("cat", "/path/to/files/"+filename)
    })
    ```
    An attacker could request `/files/../../etc/passwd` to attempt path traversal.
*   **Impact:**  File access, command execution, or other unintended actions depending on how the parameter is used.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation using libraries like `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10` within Gin handlers before processing route parameters.
    *   Sanitize input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
    *   Avoid directly using route parameters in system calls or database queries without proper validation and sanitization.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.

## Attack Surface: [Body Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/body_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Gin's built-in body parsing (JSON, XML, etc.) might have vulnerabilities if not kept up-to-date. Maliciously crafted request bodies could exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   **How Gin Contributes:** Gin automatically handles parsing request bodies based on the `Content-Type` header using functions like `c.BindJSON()`, `c.BindXML()`, etc. Vulnerabilities in the underlying parsing libraries can be exploited.
*   **Example:**  A vulnerability in the JSON parsing library could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code by sending a specially crafted JSON payload.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of service, remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE), High (if DoS)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Gin and its dependencies (including the underlying parsing libraries) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Consider using alternative, well-vetted parsing libraries if concerns exist about the default ones.
    *   Implement request size limits to prevent excessively large payloads that could trigger vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal (File Serving)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal__file_serving_.md)

*   **Description:** When using `r.Static` or `r.StaticFS` to serve static files, incorrect configuration or lack of proper sanitization of requested paths can allow attackers to access files outside the intended directory.
*   **How Gin Contributes:** Gin provides convenient functions for serving static files. Misconfiguration or lack of input validation when using these functions can lead to path traversal.
*   **Example:**
    ```go
    r.Static("/static", "./public") // Serving files from the 'public' directory
    ```
    An attacker could request `/static/../../etc/passwd` to try and access the system's password file.
*   **Impact:**  Access to sensitive files, potential information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully configure the root directory for static file serving.
    *   Avoid serving sensitive files directly through static routes.
    *   If dynamic file serving is required, implement strict input validation and sanitization of file paths.
    *   Consider using a dedicated CDN or storage service for static assets.
