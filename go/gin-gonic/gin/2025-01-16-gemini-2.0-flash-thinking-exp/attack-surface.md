# Attack Surface Analysis for gin-gonic/gin

## Attack Surface: [Ambiguous Route Definitions](./attack_surfaces/ambiguous_route_definitions.md)

- **Description:** Multiple routes can match the same incoming request path, leading to the execution of an unintended handler.
- **How Gin Contributes:** Gin's flexible routing mechanism allows for complex route patterns, increasing the possibility of unintended overlaps if not carefully designed. The order of route definition becomes crucial, which is a direct aspect of how Gin handles routing.
- **Example:**
  ```go
  r.GET("/users/:id", handlerA)
  r.GET("/users/admin", handlerB)
  ```
  A request to `/users/admin` might be incorrectly routed to `handlerA` with `:id` set to "admin" if `handlerA` is defined first, a behavior dictated by Gin's route matching order.
- **Impact:** Access to unauthorized functionality, bypassing security checks, potential data manipulation or exposure depending on the unintended handler's logic.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Define routes with clear and distinct patterns.
  - Avoid overlapping or ambiguous route definitions.
  - Order route definitions logically, placing more specific routes before more general ones, leveraging Gin's route processing order intentionally.
  - Thoroughly test route matching with various inputs to ensure intended behavior within the Gin routing context.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Parameter Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_parameter_manipulation.md)

- **Description:** Route parameters intended for resource identification are used directly in file system operations without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to access arbitrary files.
- **How Gin Contributes:** Gin provides easy access to route parameters via `c.Param()`. If developers directly use these parameters to construct file paths without validation, a direct consequence of using Gin's parameter retrieval, it creates this vulnerability.
- **Example:**
  ```go
  r.GET("/files/:filename", func(c *gin.Context) {
      filename := c.Param("filename") // Gin's way to access parameters
      c.File("./uploads/" + filename) // Vulnerable due to direct use of Gin's parameter
  })
  ```
  An attacker could request `/files/../../../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive system files, exploiting how Gin provides the parameter.
- **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files, potential for arbitrary code execution if accessed files are executable.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Never directly use user-provided input obtained via Gin's parameter functions to construct file paths.
  - Implement strict validation and sanitization of route parameters obtained through Gin.
  - Use whitelisting of allowed filenames or paths.
  - Utilize secure file handling mechanisms provided by the operating system or libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of Built-in Middleware (e.g., CORS)](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of_built-in_middleware__e_g___cors_.md)

- **Description:** Incorrectly configured built-in middleware can create security holes. For example, a too permissive CORS policy can allow unauthorized cross-origin requests.
- **How Gin Contributes:** Gin provides built-in middleware like the CORS middleware, making its configuration a direct responsibility when using the framework. Misconfiguration during the setup of Gin's middleware directly impacts the application's security posture.
- **Example:** A CORS policy configured using Gin's CORS middleware with `Allow-Origin: *` allows any website to make requests to the API, a direct consequence of how the middleware is set up within Gin.
- **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized origins.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Carefully configure built-in middleware provided by Gin according to the application's specific needs.
  - Use specific origins in CORS policies instead of wildcards (`*`) when configuring Gin's CORS middleware.
  - Understand the implications of each configuration option for built-in middleware provided by Gin.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** When request data is directly bound to internal data structures without proper filtering, attackers can modify unintended fields.
- **How Gin Contributes:** Gin's data binding features (`c.Bind()`, `c.ShouldBind()`, etc.) can facilitate mass assignment if developers are not careful about which fields are allowed to be bound from user input, a direct consequence of using Gin's binding mechanisms.
- **Example:**
  ```go
  type User struct {
      Username string `json:"username"`
      Email    string `json:"email"`
      IsAdmin  bool   `json:"is_admin"` // Intended to be set internally
  }

  r.POST("/users", func(c *gin.Context) {
      var user User
      if err := c.BindJSON(&user); err == nil { // Using Gin's binding
          // Vulnerable: Attacker can set IsAdmin to true via Gin's binding
          // ... process user creation ...
      }
  })
  ```
  An attacker could send a JSON payload with `"is_admin": true` to elevate their privileges by exploiting Gin's data binding.
- **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, unauthorized access.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Use specific data transfer objects (DTOs) or request structs when using Gin's binding functions that only contain fields intended to be received from the user.
  - Implement whitelisting of allowed fields during data binding with Gin.
  - Avoid directly binding request data to internal model structures containing sensitive fields when using Gin's binding features.
