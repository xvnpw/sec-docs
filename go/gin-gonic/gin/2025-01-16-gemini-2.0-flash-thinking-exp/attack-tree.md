## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities - Route Hijacking/Spoofing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities_-_route_hijackingspoofing.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit flaws in the definition of application routes. This can occur when route patterns are too broad, overlapping, or not explicitly defined.

**Mechanism:** By crafting specific URL paths, attackers can intercept requests intended for legitimate endpoints, redirecting them to malicious handlers or gaining access to unintended functionalities.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive features, data manipulation by interacting with incorrect handlers, or denial of service by disrupting the expected request flow.

**Critical Node: Exploit Missing or Incorrect Route Definitions:** This is the core vulnerability enabling route hijacking. Poorly defined routes create opportunities for attackers to manipulate the application's routing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities - Parameter Manipulation in Routes](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities_-_parameter_manipulation_in_routes.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate parameters embedded within the URL path to bypass security checks or trigger unintended application behavior.

**Mechanism:** By modifying the values of route parameters, attackers can attempt to access resources they shouldn't, inject malicious data, or cause errors leading to information disclosure.

**Impact:** Information leakage, unauthorized access to data or functionality, and potentially code execution if the manipulated parameters are used unsafely in backend operations.

**Critical Node: Exploit Lack of Input Validation on Route Parameters:** The absence of proper validation on route parameters is the primary enabler for this attack. Without validation, malicious or unexpected input can be processed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities - Middleware Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities_-_middleware_bypass.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers find ways to circumvent security-focused middleware, preventing necessary checks (like authentication or authorization) from being executed.

**Mechanism:** This can be achieved by exploiting the order in which middleware is applied or by targeting vulnerabilities within the middleware itself. If a request bypasses authentication middleware, for example, it can access protected resources without proper credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, bypassing security controls intended to prevent malicious actions.

**Critical Node: Exploit Incorrect Middleware Ordering:**  A misconfiguration where security middleware is placed after other processing middleware can lead to it being skipped for certain requests.

**Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware:**  Security flaws within custom-developed middleware (like faulty authentication logic) can be directly exploited to bypass security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities - Vulnerabilities in Parameter Binding and Validation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities_-_vulnerabilities_in_parameter_binding_and_validation.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how Gin binds request parameters to application data structures and how this data is validated.

**Mechanism:**
*   **Mass Assignment:** Attackers include extra parameters in their requests that map to internal object properties, potentially modifying sensitive data or application state that should not be directly accessible.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:**  Gin's binding process might not adequately sanitize input, allowing malicious data to be passed to the application, leading to injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation by modifying user roles or permissions (Mass Assignment), data corruption, and injection attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or potentially SQL Injection if bound data is used in database queries without further sanitization.

**Critical Node: Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities:**  Direct manipulation of internal object states can have severe consequences for application security and data integrity.

**Critical Node: Insufficient Input Sanitization During Binding:** This directly enables injection attacks by allowing unsanitized, potentially malicious data to be processed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities - Vulnerabilities in File Handling (If Applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities_-_vulnerabilities_in_file_handling__if_applicable_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the Gin application handles file uploads or downloads, attackers can exploit insufficient validation of file paths.

**Mechanism:** By crafting file paths containing ".." sequences, attackers can navigate outside of the intended directories, accessing sensitive files or potentially uploading malicious files to unintended locations.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive application files, access to configuration files, or potentially arbitrary code execution if malicious uploaded files are processed by the server.

**Critical Node: Path Traversal via File Uploads/Downloads:** This vulnerability directly allows attackers to bypass intended directory restrictions and access sensitive parts of the file system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies and Third-Party Middleware - Vulnerabilities in Gin's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_and_third-party_middleware_-_vulnerabilities_in_gin's_dependencies.md)

**Attack Vector:** Gin relies on other Go packages. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, the application is indirectly vulnerable.

**Mechanism:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries used by Gin. Exploit code is often readily available for known vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it can range from denial of service to remote code execution, potentially allowing complete control of the server.

**Critical Node: Using Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies:**  Failing to keep dependencies updated leaves the application exposed to known and potentially easily exploitable vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies and Third-Party Middleware - Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Gin Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_and_third-party_middleware_-_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_gin_middleware.md)

**Attack Vector:** Many Gin applications use community-provided middleware. If this middleware contains security flaws, the application becomes vulnerable.

**Mechanism:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities within the third-party middleware being used by the application.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the middleware. It could range from information disclosure to complete application compromise, depending on the middleware's function and the nature of the flaw.

**Critical Node: Exploiting Security Flaws in Community Middleware:** Relying on external code introduces a dependency risk. Vulnerabilities in this code can directly impact the security of the application.
