## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**1. Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]:**

* **Missing or Incorrect Route Constraints [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts requests with unexpected or malicious values for route parameters due to the absence or improper implementation of constraints.
    * **Example:** A route defined as `/admin/:action` without constraints allows an attacker to send requests like `/admin/delete_all_users` if the application logic doesn't properly validate the `action` parameter.
    * **Impact:** Bypassing intended access controls, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**2. Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]:**

* **Middleware Bypass [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts requests in a way that circumvents the execution of one or more middleware components.
    * **Example:** Some middleware might rely on the presence of a trailing slash in the URL. An attacker might send a request without the trailing slash to bypass this middleware, potentially skipping authentication or authorization checks.
    * **Impact:** Bypassing security checks, potentially granting unauthorized access or allowing malicious actions.

* **Middleware Logic Exploitation [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within the logic of custom middleware implementations.
    * **Example:** A custom authentication middleware might have a flaw that allows an attacker to bypass authentication by providing a specific, crafted header value.
    * **Impact:**  Potentially full application compromise, depending on the role and vulnerabilities of the exploited middleware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Binding Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_binding_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**3. Exploit Binding Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]:**

* **Injection Attacks via Binding [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
    * **SQL Injection (if binding to database queries) [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into request parameters that are then bound and used in database queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.
        * **Example:** A form field for a username is used in a query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{{.Username}}'`. An attacker could input `' OR '1'='1` to bypass authentication.
        * **Impact:** Full database compromise, allowing access to sensitive data, modification of data, or even execution of arbitrary commands on the database server.

    * **Command Injection (if binding constructs system commands) [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious commands into request parameters that are then bound and used to construct system commands without proper sanitization.
        * **Example:** A parameter is used to construct a command like `system("ping -c 1 {{.Target}}")`. An attacker could input `127.0.0.1; rm -rf /` to execute a dangerous command.
        * **Impact:** Critical server compromise, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Serving Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_serving_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**4. Exploit File Serving Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]:**

* **Path Traversal [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts requests containing ".." sequences to access files and directories outside the intended static file directory.
    * **Example:** A request to `/static/../../../../etc/passwd` attempts to access the system's password file by traversing up the directory structure.
    * **Impact:** Access to sensitive files on the server, potentially revealing configuration details, credentials, or other confidential information.
