## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Spans **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_spans__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Include Exploitable Payloads in Tags/Logs:**
    * Attack Vector: Injecting malicious scripts or commands within the tag or log data of spans sent by the Jaeger client.
    * Impact:
        * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the Jaeger UI renders this data without proper sanitization, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or further attacks on users viewing the traces.
        * Command Injection if backend systems processing this span data are vulnerable to executing commands based on the content of tags or logs.
    * Key Consideration: Robust input validation and output sanitization are crucial at both the Jaeger UI and any backend systems processing span data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client Library Vulnerabilities **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client_library_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_start_.md)
