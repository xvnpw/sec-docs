## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Spans -> Send Malformed Spans -> Exploit Parsing Vulnerability in Collector [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_spans_-_send_malformed_spans_-_exploit_parsing_vulnerability_in_collector__critical_a1be5088.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts spans with unexpected or malformed data structures that exploit vulnerabilities in the Jaeger Collector's parsing logic.
* **Mechanism:** The attacker sends these crafted spans to the Jaeger Agent, which forwards them to the Collector. The Collector's vulnerable parsing code fails to handle the malformed data correctly, potentially leading to:
    * **Denial of Service:** The Collector process crashes or becomes unresponsive.
    * **Remote Code Execution:** In severe cases, the parsing vulnerability could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the Collector server.
* **Impact:**  Loss of tracing data, disruption of tracing functionality, potential compromise of the Collector server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Spans -> Send Spans with Malicious Attributes -> Exploit Vulnerability in Application's Trace Processing Logic [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_spans_-_send_spans_with_malicious_attributes_-_exploit_vulnerability_in_application_6039df36.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects spans with attributes containing malicious payloads that are not properly sanitized or handled by the application's code that processes tracing data.
* **Mechanism:** The attacker sends spans with carefully crafted attribute values (e.g., containing SQL injection payloads, command injection sequences, or logic-altering data). When the application retrieves and processes these trace attributes, the malicious payload is executed or causes unintended behavior.
* **Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation within the application, potential compromise of application components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jaeger Collector Vulnerabilities -> Data Exfiltration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jaeger_collector_vulnerabilities_-_data_exfiltration__critical_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Jaeger Collector to gain unauthorized access to the stored tracing data.
* **Mechanism:** This could involve:
    * **Exploiting Authentication/Authorization Flaws:** Bypassing security measures to directly access the Collector's data store.
    * **Exploiting Code Vulnerabilities:**  Leveraging vulnerabilities in the Collector's code to read or extract stored data.
    * **Accessing Misconfigured Storage:** If the underlying storage (e.g., Cassandra, Elasticsearch) is misconfigured with weak security, an attacker might directly access it.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application data contained within the traces, including business logic, user information, and system behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jaeger Query Service Vulnerabilities -> Unauthorized Data Access [CRITICAL] -> Bypass Authentication/Authorization -> Exploit Weak Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jaeger_query_service_vulnerabilities_-_unauthorized_data_access__critical__-_bypass_authenti_4bf36a5a.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits weak or missing authentication mechanisms in the Jaeger Query service to gain unauthorized access to tracing data.
* **Mechanism:** This could involve:
    * **Default Credentials:** Using default or easily guessable credentials if they haven't been changed.
    * **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attempting to guess passwords through automated attacks.
    * **Exploiting Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities:** Leveraging flaws in the authentication logic to gain access without proper credentials.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive tracing data, potentially revealing application secrets, business logic, and user activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jaeger Storage Vulnerabilities -> Unauthorized Data Access [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jaeger_storage_vulnerabilities_-_unauthorized_data_access__critical_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker directly targets the underlying storage system used by Jaeger to store trace data, bypassing Jaeger components.
* **Mechanism:** This could involve:
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the Storage Backend:**  Leveraging known vulnerabilities in databases like Cassandra or Elasticsearch.
    * **Compromising Storage Credentials:** Obtaining valid credentials for the storage system through phishing, credential stuffing, or other means.
    * **Exploiting Misconfigurations:** Taking advantage of insecure configurations in the storage system that allow unauthorized access.
* **Impact:** Direct access to all stored tracing data, leading to a significant data breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jaeger Dependencies [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jaeger_dependencies__critical_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker targets vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or components that Jaeger relies upon.
* **Mechanism:** This can occur in two main ways:
    * **Compromising a Dependency:** An attacker compromises a legitimate dependency, injecting malicious code that is then included in Jaeger.
    * **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities:** An attacker identifies and exploits publicly known vulnerabilities in Jaeger's dependencies.
* **Impact:**  The impact can be wide-ranging depending on the compromised dependency and the nature of the vulnerability. This could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, or other severe consequences affecting Jaeger and potentially the application it supports.
