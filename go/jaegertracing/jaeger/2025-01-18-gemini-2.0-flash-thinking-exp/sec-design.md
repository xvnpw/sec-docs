It outlines the architecture, components, data flow, and key considerations, with a particular focus on aspects relevant for threat modeling. This document serves as the foundation for identifying potential security vulnerabilities and designing appropriate mitigations.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of Jaeger is to enable developers to gain insights into the behavior of distributed systems. Key objectives include:

*   **Enabling Distributed Context Propagation:**  Seamlessly track requests as they traverse multiple services within a distributed environment.
*   **Facilitating Performance Monitoring:**  Identify performance bottlenecks, latency issues, and resource utilization problems across services.
*   **Supporting Root Cause Analysis:**  Quickly pinpoint the source of errors, failures, and performance degradations in complex distributed transactions.
*   **Providing Dependency Analysis:**  Visualize and understand the relationships and dependencies between different services in the system.

## 3. Architecture Overview

Jaeger employs a distributed architecture comprising several interconnected components responsible for collecting, processing, storing, and visualizing tracing data. The core components are:

*   **Jaeger Client Libraries:**  Integrated into application code to generate and emit tracing data (spans).
*   **Jaeger Agent:** A network daemon deployed alongside application instances, responsible for receiving, batching, and forwarding spans.
*   **Jaeger Collector:**  Receives span batches from Agents, processes them, validates them, and persists them to the chosen storage backend.
*   **Jaeger Query:**  Provides an API endpoint for retrieving and querying trace data from the storage backend, enabling data access for the UI and other consumers.
*   **Jaeger UI:** A user-friendly web interface for visualizing, analyzing, and exploring collected trace data.
*   **Jaeger Ingester (Conditional):**  An optional component used when Kafka is selected as the storage backend, responsible for consuming spans from Kafka and writing them to a final persistent store.

```

**Detailed Data Flow Steps:**

1. **Instrumentation and Span Creation:** Application code, instrumented with the Jaeger Client Library, generates spans representing individual operations.
2. **Span Emission to Agent:** The Jaeger Client Library sends the generated spans to the configured Jaeger Agent, typically over UDP for efficiency.
3. **Agent Reception and Batching:** The Jaeger Agent receives individual spans, batches them together, and prepares them for transmission to the Collector.
4. **Transmission to Collector:** The Agent sends batches of spans to the Jaeger Collector(s), usually over gRPC or HTTP for reliability.
5. **Collector Processing and Validation:** The Jaeger Collector receives span batches, validates the integrity and format of the spans, and processes them.
6. **Storage Persistence:** The Collector persists the validated spans to the configured storage backend (e.g., Cassandra, Elasticsearch).
7. **Optional Kafka Ingestion:** If Kafka is used, the Collector writes spans to a Kafka topic. The Jaeger Ingester consumes these spans and writes them to the final storage backend.
8. **Query Reception:** The Jaeger Query component receives requests for trace data from the UI or other authorized clients via its REST API.
9. **Data Retrieval from Storage:** The Query component retrieves the requested trace data from the storage backend based on the query parameters.
10. **Visualization in UI:** The Jaeger UI receives the trace data from the Query component and presents it to the user in a visual and interactive format.

## 6. Deployment Options

Jaeger components offer flexible deployment options to suit various scales and environments:

*   **All-in-One Deployment:** All core components (Agent, Collector, Query, UI) are deployed as a single process. Suitable for development, testing, and small-scale deployments.
*   **Separated Agent Deployment:** Agents are deployed as sidecars alongside application instances, while other components are deployed separately. This is a common production deployment pattern.
*   **Scalable Collector Deployment:** Multiple Collector instances are deployed behind a load balancer for high availability and increased throughput.
*   **Ingester Deployment with Kafka:** When using Kafka, one or more Ingester instances are deployed to consume and process spans from Kafka topics.
*   **Containerized Deployments:** Jaeger components are commonly deployed using containerization technologies like Docker and orchestrated with platforms like Kubernetes.
*   **Cloud-Managed Services:** Some cloud providers offer managed Jaeger services, simplifying deployment and maintenance.

## 7. Security Considerations

This section expands on the preliminary security considerations, providing more specific details and recommendations for securing a Jaeger deployment.

    *   **Agent to Collector:** Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for gRPC or HTTPS for HTTP communication between Agents and Collectors to protect span data in transit. Implement mutual TLS for stronger authentication.
    *   **Collector to Storage:** Ensure secure connections to the storage backend using appropriate authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, certificates) and encryption protocols provided by the storage system.
    *   **Query API:**  Mandate HTTPS for all communication with the Jaeger Query API. Implement authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) and authorization to control access to trace data.
    *   **UI Access:** Secure the Jaeger UI with robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, SSO integration) and enforce HTTPS. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
*   **Data Security:**
    *   **Data at Rest:**  Utilize encryption at rest features provided by the chosen storage backend to protect sensitive trace data.
    *   **Data in Transit:**  Encrypt all communication channels as detailed above.
    *   **Sensitive Data Handling:** Implement mechanisms to sanitize or redact sensitive information from spans before they are stored. Educate developers on best practices for avoiding the logging of sensitive data.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Query API:** Implement a strong authentication and authorization framework for the Query API. Consider using OAuth 2.0 or API keys with proper scope management.
    *   **UI Access:** Integrate the UI with an existing authentication provider or implement a secure authentication mechanism. Implement RBAC to control access to different features and data within the UI.
    *   **Agent Authentication (Optional):** For highly sensitive environments, consider implementing authentication mechanisms for Agents to verify their identity before accepting spans.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Collector:** Implement rigorous input validation on the Collector to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. Sanitize or reject malformed or suspicious spans.
    *   **Query API:**  Thoroughly validate all query parameters to prevent injection attacks and ensure that queries are within acceptable limits.
*   **Agent Security:**
    *   **Access Control:** Restrict network access to the Agent's listening port to only authorized applications running on the same host or within a trusted network.
    *   **Configuration Security:** Securely manage the Agent's configuration file and prevent unauthorized modifications.
*   **Dependency Security:**
    *   Regularly scan all Jaeger components and their dependencies for known vulnerabilities and apply necessary patches and updates.
