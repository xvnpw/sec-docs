# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jaegertracing/jaeger

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Jaeger UI and API](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__for_jaeger_ui_and_api.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify distinct user roles that require access to Jaeger within your organization.
    2.  Define granular permissions for each role based on Jaeger functionalities (e.g., view traces, search, admin).
    3.  Leverage Jaeger's built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms (if available and documented in Jaeger documentation).
    4.  Integrate Jaeger with your existing Identity and Access Management (IAM) system (e.g., using OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, LDAP/Active Directory) if Jaeger supports such integrations. This often involves configuring a reverse proxy in front of Jaeger UI and API to handle authentication and authorization before requests reach Jaeger.
    5.  Configure Jaeger or the integrated system to enforce the defined roles and permissions. This might involve setting up access control lists (ACLs), policies, or role mappings within Jaeger or the IAM system.
    6.  Regularly review and update roles and permissions within Jaeger or the IAM system as user needs evolve.
    7.  Implement audit logging for access to Jaeger UI and API within Jaeger or the IAM system to track user activity.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity): Prevents unauthorized users from viewing sensitive tracing data within Jaeger UI and API.
    *   Data Breach (High Severity): Reduces the risk of a data breach by limiting access to Jaeger tracing data to authorized personnel only through Jaeger's access controls.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity): Prevents users from gaining access to functionalities or data within Jaeger beyond their assigned roles, limiting potential misuse of Jaeger itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Data Breach: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Privilege Escalation: Moderately reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Authentication for Jaeger UI is integrated with our company's SSO using OAuth 2.0. Basic role separation is in place for UI access (admin and read-only) within our SSO system controlling access to Jaeger UI.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular API access control within Jaeger itself is missing. Currently, API access is implicitly granted to authenticated users by the SSO. Need to implement fine-grained authorization policies specifically for Jaeger Query and Collector APIs, potentially using Jaeger's own authorization features if available or extending the SSO integration to cover API access control based on Jaeger roles.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Jaeger Components to Enforce Encryption in Transit (TLS/HTTPS)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_jaeger_components_to_enforce_encryption_in_transit__tlshttps_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Refer to Jaeger documentation to identify configuration parameters for enabling TLS/HTTPS for each Jaeger component (Agent, Collector, Query, UI).
    2.  For each communication channel between Jaeger components:
        *   Application to Jaeger Agent: Configure your application's Jaeger client to use gRPC with TLS or HTTPS when sending spans to the Jaeger agent, as per Jaeger client library documentation.
        *   Jaeger Agent to Jaeger Collector: Configure Jaeger agents and collectors to communicate using gRPC with TLS, using Jaeger Collector's TLS configuration options.
        *   Jaeger Collector to Jaeger Query: Configure Jaeger collectors and query services to communicate using gRPC with TLS, using Jaeger Query's TLS configuration options.
        *   Jaeger Query to Jaeger UI: Ensure the Jaeger UI accesses the Jaeger Query service over HTTPS, configure your web server or reverse proxy serving Jaeger UI to enforce HTTPS.
    3.  Generate and manage TLS certificates specifically for Jaeger components. Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or a self-signed CA for internal Jaeger communication (ensure proper key management for self-signed certificates). Configure Jaeger components to use these certificates.
    4.  Configure Jaeger components to *enforce* TLS. This typically involves setting configuration parameters within Jaeger component configurations to enable TLS and specify the paths to certificate and key files, as detailed in Jaeger documentation.
    5.  Regularly rotate TLS certificates used by Jaeger components, following certificate rotation procedures relevant to Jaeger and your certificate management system.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity): Prevents attackers from intercepting and eavesdropping on Jaeger tracing data as it travels between Jaeger components.
    *   Data Tampering in Transit (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of attackers modifying Jaeger tracing data while it is being transmitted between Jaeger components.
    *   Data Exposure in Transit (High Severity): Protects sensitive information within Jaeger tracing data from being exposed if network traffic between Jaeger components is intercepted.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Data Tampering in Transit: Moderately reduces risk.
    *   Data Exposure in Transit: Significantly reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. HTTPS is enabled for Jaeger UI access. Communication between Jaeger Agent and Collector is configured with gRPC, but TLS is not yet enforced within Jaeger component configurations. Communication between Collector and Query is currently unencrypted within Jaeger component configurations.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to enforce TLS for gRPC communication between Agent and Collector, and Collector and Query by configuring TLS settings within Jaeger Agent, Collector, and Query components. Certificate management and rotation processes specifically for Jaeger components need to be established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Data Retention Policies using Jaeger Backend Features](./mitigation_strategies/implement_data_retention_policies_using_jaeger_backend_features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define data retention policies based on legal, compliance, and business requirements for Jaeger tracing data.
    2.  Configure Jaeger's backend storage (e.g., Elasticsearch, Cassandra) data retention mechanisms *specifically as they are used by Jaeger*.  Refer to Jaeger documentation and your chosen backend's documentation for how Jaeger utilizes backend retention features.
        *   For Elasticsearch used with Jaeger: Use Elasticsearch's Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) to define policies for rolling over indices and deleting older indices based on time or size, ensuring these policies are applied to Jaeger's Elasticsearch indices.
        *   For Cassandra used with Jaeger: Utilize Cassandra's Time-To-Live (TTL) feature to automatically expire and delete older Jaeger tracing data stored in Cassandra tables.
    3.  Implement automated processes to enforce data retention policies *within the Jaeger backend configuration*. This might involve configuring Jaeger backend settings, or using backend-specific tools to manage data lifecycle for Jaeger's data.
    4.  Regularly review and adjust data retention policies configured for Jaeger's backend as requirements change.
    5.  Document data retention policies and procedures for Jaeger tracing data for compliance and auditing purposes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Breach from Long-Term Storage of Jaeger Data (Medium Severity): Reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to access older Jaeger tracing data stored for extended periods.
    *   Compliance Violations (Medium Severity): Helps comply with data retention regulations and policies by ensuring Jaeger tracing data is not stored longer than necessary.
    *   Storage Resource Exhaustion (Low Severity): Prevents excessive storage consumption by limiting the amount of Jaeger tracing data stored over time in the backend.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach from Long-Term Storage of Jaeger Data: Moderately reduces risk.
    *   Compliance Violations: Moderately reduces risk.
    *   Storage Resource Exhaustion: Minimally reduces risk (primarily a performance/cost issue, but indirectly related to security by reducing attack surface of Jaeger data).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic data retention is configured in Elasticsearch using index rollover policies to manage index size for Jaeger data, but explicit time-based retention policies based on compliance requirements are not yet fully defined and enforced *specifically for Jaeger's data in Elasticsearch*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to define specific data retention policies based on compliance and business needs for Jaeger tracing data. Implement time-based index deletion policies in Elasticsearch ILM to automatically purge older Jaeger tracing data according to the defined retention periods, ensuring these policies are correctly applied to Jaeger's Elasticsearch indices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting for Jaeger Collector Trace Ingestion](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_for_jaeger_collector_trace_ingestion.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify the Jaeger Collector component as the entry point for trace ingestion.
    2.  Implement rate limiting *directly on the Jaeger Collector* to control the rate at which it accepts incoming traces.
    3.  Utilize Jaeger Collector's built-in rate limiting features if available (refer to Jaeger Collector documentation for configuration options).
    4.  Configure rate limits within Jaeger Collector based on your infrastructure capacity, expected tracing volume, and acceptable performance levels for Jaeger ingestion. Consider factors like:
        *   Number of traces per second Jaeger Collector can handle.
        *   Size of traces Jaeger Collector can process efficiently.
        *   Number of concurrent connections Jaeger Collector can manage.
    5.  Configure Jaeger Collector to implement appropriate error handling and response mechanisms when rate limits are exceeded. Jaeger Collector should ideally return appropriate error codes (e.g., HTTP 429) to clients exceeding the limit.
    6.  Monitor rate limiting metrics exposed by Jaeger Collector (if available) to ensure it is effective and not overly restrictive. Adjust rate limits within Jaeger Collector configuration as needed based on monitoring data and changing traffic patterns.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Trace Flood against Jaeger Collector (High Severity): Prevents attackers from overwhelming Jaeger Collectors with a flood of traces, causing Jaeger service disruption or performance degradation.
    *   Resource Exhaustion of Jaeger Collector (Medium Severity): Protects Jaeger Collector resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) from being exhausted by excessive trace ingestion, ensuring Jaeger Collector stability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Trace Flood against Jaeger Collector: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Resource Exhaustion of Jaeger Collector: Moderately reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Rate limiting is not currently configured directly within Jaeger Collectors.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to implement rate limiting for Jaeger Collectors. Investigate Jaeger Collector's built-in rate limiting capabilities and configure them appropriately. If built-in features are insufficient, explore if Jaeger Collector can be integrated with external rate limiting solutions. Configure appropriate rate limits within Jaeger Collector based on capacity planning and monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Content Security Policy (CSP) for Jaeger UI](./mitigation_strategies/configure_content_security_policy__csp__for_jaeger_ui.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define a Content Security Policy (CSP) specifically for the Jaeger UI web application.
    2.  Configure the web server or reverse proxy *serving the Jaeger UI* to include the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header in responses for Jaeger UI.  This is not a Jaeger configuration itself, but a configuration of the web server serving Jaeger UI.
    3.  Start with a restrictive CSP for Jaeger UI and gradually refine it as needed. A basic CSP for Jaeger UI might include directives like:
        *   `default-src 'self'`: Only allow resources from the same origin as the Jaeger UI.
        *   `script-src 'self'`: Only allow scripts from the same origin for Jaeger UI.
        *   `style-src 'self'`: Only allow stylesheets from the same origin for Jaeger UI.
        *   `img-src 'self' data:`: Allow images from the same origin and data URLs for Jaeger UI.
        *   `frame-ancestors 'none'`: Prevent the Jaeger UI from being embedded in frames on other websites (clickjacking protection for Jaeger UI).
    4.  Test the CSP thoroughly to ensure it doesn't break the functionality of the Jaeger UI. Use browser developer tools to identify and resolve any CSP violations specifically within the Jaeger UI.
    5.  Consider using CSP reporting to monitor for CSP violations and identify potential XSS attempts against Jaeger UI. Configure `report-uri` or `report-to` directives to send violation reports to a designated endpoint for analysis related to Jaeger UI.
    6.  Regularly review and update the CSP as the Jaeger UI is updated or modified.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks targeting Jaeger UI (High Severity): Mitigates the risk of XSS attacks against the Jaeger UI by limiting the sources from which the browser can load resources for the UI.
    *   Clickjacking attacks targeting Jaeger UI (Medium Severity): `frame-ancestors` directive helps prevent clickjacking attacks against the Jaeger UI.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks targeting Jaeger UI: Moderately reduces risk (CSP is a defense-in-depth measure for Jaeger UI, not a complete solution, input validation in Jaeger UI code is still crucial if customizations are made).
    *   Clickjacking attacks targeting Jaeger UI: Moderately reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. CSP is not currently configured for the Jaeger UI.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to define and implement a Content Security Policy for the Jaeger UI. Configure the web server or reverse proxy to add the `Content-Security-Policy` header to Jaeger UI responses. Test and refine the CSP to ensure Jaeger UI functionality and security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Jaeger Components](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_jaeger_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Maintain an inventory of all deployed Jaeger components (Agent, Collector, Query, UI).
    2.  Regularly check for updates and security advisories *specifically for Jaeger components*. Monitor Jaeger project's release notes, security mailing lists, and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases, GitHub Security Advisories related to Jaeger).
    3.  Establish a process for promptly applying security updates and patches to *Jaeger components*.
    4.  Prioritize updating Jaeger components with known security vulnerabilities, especially those with high severity ratings reported for Jaeger.
    5.  Test updated Jaeger components thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying to production to ensure compatibility and stability of the Jaeger system.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Jaeger Component Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Mitigates the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in Jaeger components themselves, which could lead to various attacks like remote code execution, data breaches, or DoS affecting Jaeger.
    *   Software Supply Chain Attacks targeting Jaeger (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of supply chain attacks by ensuring that you are using up-to-date and patched versions of Jaeger components directly from the official Jaeger project or trusted sources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Jaeger Component Vulnerabilities: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Software Supply Chain Attacks targeting Jaeger: Moderately reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have a process for periodically updating container images for Jaeger components, but updates are not always applied immediately upon release of new Jaeger versions.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to establish a more proactive and faster process for applying security updates to Jaeger components. Automate monitoring for new Jaeger releases and security advisories. Improve the update process to ensure timely patching of Jaeger components.
