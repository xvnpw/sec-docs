# Threat Model Analysis for jaegertracing/jaeger

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Traces](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_traces.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Logging in Spans
    *   **Description:** Developers unintentionally log sensitive information (PII, secrets, API keys) as span tags, logs, or baggage. Attackers with access to Jaeger UI or storage can view this data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violation, compliance issues, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Jaeger Component:** Agent, Collector, Query, UI, Storage Backend (all components involved in data processing and storage).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Data Sanitization: Implement code reviews and automated checks to identify and remove sensitive data before creating spans.
        *   Span Tag Filtering/Masking: Configure Jaeger Agent or Collector to filter or mask specific span tags or log messages based on regular expressions or allow lists.
        *   Developer Training: Educate developers on secure logging practices and the risks of exposing sensitive data in traces.
        *   Regular Audits: Periodically audit trace data stored in Jaeger to identify and remediate instances of sensitive data exposure.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Trace Data](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_trace_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Publicly Accessible Jaeger UI/Query
    *   **Description:** Jaeger UI and/or Query service are deployed without authentication, allowing anyone with network access to browse and query trace data. Attackers can gain insights into application behavior, vulnerabilities, and potentially sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, reconnaissance for further attacks, potential data breach.
    *   **Affected Jaeger Component:** Query, UI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Authentication Implementation: Enable authentication for Jaeger Query and UI using mechanisms like basic authentication, OAuth 2.0, or integration with existing identity providers.
        *   Network Segmentation: Restrict access to Jaeger UI and Query to authorized networks or users using firewalls and network policies.
        *   Regular Security Audits: Periodically review access controls and network configurations to ensure Jaeger components are not publicly accessible.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Jaeger Components](./threats/data_leakage_through_jaeger_components.md)

*   **Threat:** Jaeger Component Vulnerability Exploitation
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in Jaeger Agent, Collector, Query, or UI to gain unauthorized access, extract data, or compromise the system.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, system compromise, denial of service, potential lateral movement.
    *   **Affected Jaeger Component:** Agent, Collector, Query, UI, and their dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on vulnerability and component).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regular Updates and Patching: Keep Jaeger components and their dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Vulnerability Scanning: Regularly scan Jaeger components and infrastructure for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanners.
        *   Security Hardening: Follow security hardening guidelines for Jaeger components and the underlying operating system.
        *   Web Application Firewall (WAF): Deploy a WAF in front of Jaeger UI and Query to protect against common web application attacks.

## Threat: [Data Integrity Compromise (Trace Tampering)](./threats/data_integrity_compromise__trace_tampering_.md)

*   **Threat:** Trace Data Manipulation
    *   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to Jaeger storage or intercept communication channels and modify or delete trace data. This can lead to inaccurate monitoring, misleading root cause analysis, and hiding malicious activities.
    *   **Impact:** Inaccurate monitoring, misleading incident investigation, potential cover-up of malicious actions, compromised data integrity.
    *   **Affected Jaeger Component:** Storage Backend, Communication Channels (Agent-Collector, Collector-Storage, Query-Storage).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Storage Access: Implement strong access controls and authentication for Jaeger storage backend to prevent unauthorized access.
        *   Encrypted Communication: Use TLS/HTTPS to encrypt communication between Jaeger components (Agent-Collector, Collector-Storage, Query-Storage) to prevent data interception and tampering in transit.
        *   Data Integrity Checks: Implement data integrity checks (e.g., checksums, signatures) for trace data to detect unauthorized modifications. (Note: Jaeger might not have built-in integrity checks, consider implementing at storage level if critical).
        *   Audit Logging: Enable audit logging for Jaeger components and storage backend to track access and modifications to trace data.

## Threat: [Insecure Communication Channels](./threats/insecure_communication_channels.md)

*   **Threat:** Unencrypted Agent-Collector Communication
    *   **Description:** Communication between Jaeger Agents and Collectors is not encrypted (e.g., using HTTP instead of HTTPS/gRPC with TLS). Attackers can intercept network traffic and capture sensitive trace data in transit.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, information disclosure, privacy violation.
    *   **Affected Jaeger Component:** Agent, Collector, Network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS/HTTPS/gRPC with TLS: Configure Jaeger Agents and Collectors to communicate using encrypted protocols like gRPC with TLS or HTTPS.
        *   Network Segmentation: Isolate Jaeger components within secure network segments to reduce the risk of network interception.
        *   Mutual TLS (mTLS): Consider using mTLS for Agent-Collector communication for stronger authentication and encryption.
