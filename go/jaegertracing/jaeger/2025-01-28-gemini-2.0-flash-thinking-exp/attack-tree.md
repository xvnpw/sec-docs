## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Client Library Vulnerabilities (Code Injection, DoS) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_client_library_vulnerabilities__code_injection__dos___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in Jaeger client libraries (language-specific libraries).
*   **Details:**
    *   Attackers identify and exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Jaeger client libraries.
    *   Vulnerabilities could include buffer overflows, injection flaws, or logic errors.
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to:
        *   **Code Injection:**  Executing arbitrary code within the application's process, potentially gaining full control.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the application or making it unresponsive by sending crafted malicious data.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Regularly update Jaeger client libraries:**  Apply security patches promptly.
    *   **Vulnerability scanning:**  Periodically scan application dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security code reviews:** Review application code interacting with Jaeger clients.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Jaeger Agent Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_jaeger_agent_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

    *   **Examples:** Network vulnerabilities, buffer overflows in UDP packet processing, or other service-level flaws.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Gaining control of the Agent server.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing or overwhelming the Agent, disrupting tracing.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Keep Jaeger Agent updated:** Apply security patches.
        *   **Network security:** Firewall Agent ports, restrict access.
        *   **Regular security audits and pen-testing:** Identify and fix vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Vector 2.2: Malicious Span Injection via Agent's UDP/gRPC Endpoint [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Details:** Directly sending malicious spans to the Agent's exposed UDP or gRPC ports.
    *   **Exploits:** UDP is connectionless and easily spoofed. gRPC, while more secure, can still be targeted if not properly configured.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwhelming the Agent with a flood of spans.
        *   **Misleading Traces:** Injecting false or misleading data into the tracing system.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Consuming Agent resources, impacting performance.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Use gRPC over UDP if possible:** gRPC offers better security features.
        *   **Network access controls:** Restrict access to Agent ports.
        *   **Rate limiting:** Limit span ingestion at the Agent level.
        *   **Anomaly detection:** Monitor for unusual span traffic patterns.
