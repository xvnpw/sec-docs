## 5. Data Flow - Detailed

The data flow within Jaeger is crucial to understand for performance and security considerations.

1.  **Instrumentation & Span Creation:** Developers instrument application code using Jaeger Client Libraries. When an operation begins, the library creates a `Span` object, representing a unit of work.
2.  **Context Propagation:** If the operation involves calls to downstream services, the client library automatically propagates the trace context (Trace ID, Span ID, and Baggage) to these services. This is typically done by injecting context into HTTP headers, gRPC metadata, or message queue headers.
3.  **Span Reporting to Agent:** Upon completion of the operation (span), the client library reports the completed span to the configured Jaeger Agent. Communication usually happens over UDP using the Thrift protocol for efficiency.
4.  **Agent Batching & Forwarding:** The Jaeger Agent receives spans, batches them to improve network efficiency, and forwards these batches to the Jaeger Collector. Communication between Agent and Collector can be over gRPC or Thrift/HTTP.
5.  **Collector Processing & Storage:** The Jaeger Collector receives span batches, validates them, and potentially enriches them. It then indexes the spans for efficient querying and persists them to the configured Storage Backend.
6.  **Querying via Query Service:** When a user interacts with the Jaeger UI to view traces, the UI sends requests to the Jaeger Query Service.
7.  **Storage Retrieval by Query Service:** The Query Service queries the Storage Backend based on the UI's request, retrieving relevant trace data.
8.  **Visualization in UI:** The Query Service returns the trace data to the Jaeger UI, which visualizes it in a user-friendly format, allowing users to analyze and understand the distributed transaction flow.

    *   May offer tighter integration with other cloud services and enhanced features.
    *   Consider vendor lock-in and cost implications when choosing managed solutions.

## 8. Security Considerations - In-Depth

Security is paramount for any monitoring system, including Jaeger, as it handles sensitive operational data. Here's a more detailed breakdown of security considerations:

*   **Data in Transit Encryption (TLS/SSL):**
    *   **Agent to Collector:**  Enable TLS/SSL encryption for communication between Jaeger Agents and Collectors, especially if communication traverses untrusted networks. Configure gRPC and HTTP connections to use TLS.
    *   **Collector to Storage:** Encrypt communication between Collectors and the Storage Backend if the storage backend supports it (e.g., Cassandra, Elasticsearch TLS configuration).
    *   **Query Service to UI:**  Use HTTPS for communication between the Jaeger UI and the Query Service to protect user credentials and trace data transmitted over the web.
    *   **Internal Component Communication:** Consider TLS for internal communication within the Jaeger backend components in highly sensitive environments.

*   **Data at Rest Encryption:**
    *   **Storage Backend Encryption:** Leverage encryption-at-rest capabilities provided by the chosen storage backend (Cassandra, Elasticsearch, cloud-managed storage services). This protects trace data if the storage media is compromised.
    *   **Configuration Secrets Encryption:** Securely manage and encrypt configuration secrets (e.g., storage backend credentials, TLS certificates) used by Jaeger components. Use secret management tools (HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets).

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Collector API Authentication:** Implement authentication for the Jaeger Collector's span ingestion API to prevent unauthorized injection of spans. This can be achieved using API keys, mutual TLS, or integration with identity providers.
    *   **Query Service API Authentication & Authorization:** Secure the Query Service API with authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, API keys) to verify the identity of clients (Jaeger UI, other applications). Implement authorization policies to control access to trace data based on user roles or permissions.
    *   **Jaeger UI Authentication & Authorization:** Integrate Jaeger UI with an authentication provider (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth 2.0) to control user access. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive features or data based on user roles.

*   **Input Validation & Sanitization:**
    *   **Collector Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation in the Jaeger Collector to sanitize and validate incoming spans from Agents. Prevent injection attacks (e.g., log injection, tag injection) by validating data types, lengths, and formats.
    *   **Query Service Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate user inputs to the Query Service API to prevent query injection attacks (e.g., NoSQL injection if using Elasticsearch).

*   **Access Control & Network Segmentation:**
    *   **Storage Backend Access Control:** Restrict access to the storage backend to only authorized Jaeger components (Collector, Query Service). Use network firewalls and database access control lists (ACLs).
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Segment the Jaeger deployment into different network zones based on security sensitivity. Isolate the storage backend in a more secure zone, and place Agents closer to application workloads.

*   **Security Auditing & Logging:**
    *   **Audit Logging:** Enable audit logging for Jaeger components to track security-related events (e.g., authentication attempts, authorization decisions, configuration changes).
    *   **Security Monitoring:** Integrate Jaeger logs and metrics with security monitoring systems (SIEM) to detect and respond to security incidents.

*   **Regular Security Updates & Vulnerability Management:**
    *   Keep Jaeger components and dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Regularly scan Jaeger deployments for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   Follow security best practices for container images and base operating systems.

## 9. Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities - For Threat Modeling

To facilitate threat modeling, let's explicitly outline assets, potential threats, and vulnerabilities within the Jaeger system:

**Assets:**

*   **Trace Data:** The primary asset. Contains sensitive operational data about application performance, transactions, and dependencies. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of trace data are crucial.
