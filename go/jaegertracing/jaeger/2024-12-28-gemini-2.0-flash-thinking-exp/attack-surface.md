Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Jaeger, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthenticated Jaeger Agent Access
    *   **Description:** The Jaeger Agent, by default, often listens on network ports without requiring authentication. This allows anyone on the network to send spans to it.
    *   **How Jaeger Contributes:** Jaeger's architecture relies on the agent to receive spans from application instances. The default lack of authentication on this component creates an open entry point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as the application instances could send a large volume of arbitrary spans to the Jaeger Agent, potentially overwhelming the backend or injecting misleading data.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) against the Jaeger backend, injection of false or misleading trace data, potential resource exhaustion on the agent host.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement Authentication/Authorization: Configure the Jaeger Agent to require authentication for incoming spans. This might involve using a sidecar proxy with authentication capabilities or leveraging network policies.
        *   Network Segmentation: Isolate the Jaeger Agent within a secure network segment, limiting access to authorized application instances.
        *   Firewall Rules: Implement firewall rules to restrict access to the Jaeger Agent's ports from only trusted sources.

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Span Injection via Client Libraries
    *   **Description:** If an attacker gains control of the application's execution flow, they can manipulate the Jaeger client library to send crafted spans with malicious content.
    *   **How Jaeger Contributes:** Jaeger's functionality depends on the application using its client libraries to generate and send trace data. This creates a potential point of manipulation within the application itself.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploiting a vulnerability in the application could inject spans containing excessive tags, extremely large payloads, or data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the Jaeger Collector's processing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) against the Jaeger Collector, injection of misleading or false data, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Collector leading to further compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Application Code: Implement robust security practices in the application to prevent attackers from gaining control of execution flow. This includes input validation, secure coding practices, and regular security audits.
        *   Rate Limiting on Collector: Implement rate limiting on the Jaeger Collector to mitigate the impact of a large volume of malicious spans.
        *   Input Validation on Collector: Ensure the Jaeger Collector performs thorough input validation on incoming spans to prevent exploitation of processing vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Unsecured Jaeger Query Interface
    *   **Description:** The Jaeger Query component provides a UI and API for accessing trace data. If not properly secured with authentication and authorization, sensitive trace information can be exposed.
    *   **How Jaeger Contributes:** Jaeger Query is the primary interface for viewing and analyzing collected trace data, making its security crucial for protecting this information.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gaining network access to the Jaeger Query service could browse through sensitive trace data, potentially revealing API keys, internal system details, or user information captured in spans.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive application data, potential for further attacks based on revealed information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement Authentication and Authorization: Configure authentication (e.g., using a reverse proxy with authentication) to verify the identity of users accessing the Jaeger Query UI and API. Implement authorization to control access to specific trace data based on user roles or permissions.
        *   Secure Network Access: Restrict network access to the Jaeger Query service to authorized users and networks.
        *   HTTPS/TLS Encryption: Ensure all communication with the Jaeger Query service is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS to protect data in transit.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Jaeger Components
    *   **Description:** Like any software, Jaeger components (Agent, Collector, Query) may contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
    *   **How Jaeger Contributes:** Jaeger's code base and dependencies introduce the possibility of exploitable vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in the Jaeger Collector could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted span.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, complete compromise of the Jaeger infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Jaeger Up-to-Date: Regularly update Jaeger components to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   Vulnerability Scanning: Implement vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in Jaeger components and their dependencies.
        *   Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of the Jaeger deployment and configuration.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Spans
    *   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information (API keys, passwords, personal data) within span tags or logs that are then collected by Jaeger.
    *   **How Jaeger Contributes:** Jaeger's purpose is to collect and store trace data, including the information contained within spans. This makes it a potential repository for inadvertently exposed sensitive data.
    *   **Example:** A developer might log a request containing an API key as a span tag, which is then stored in the Jaeger backend and potentially accessible through the Query interface.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive credentials or personal information, potential for misuse of exposed data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Educate Developers: Train developers on secure logging practices and the risks of including sensitive data in spans.
        *   Data Sanitization: Implement mechanisms to sanitize span data before it is sent to Jaeger, removing or masking sensitive information.
        *   Review Span Data: Regularly review the types of data being captured in spans and identify and remove any unnecessary sensitive information.
