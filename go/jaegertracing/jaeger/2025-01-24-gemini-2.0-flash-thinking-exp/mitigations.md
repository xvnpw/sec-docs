# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jaegertracing/jaeger

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Masking and Redaction in Jaeger Instrumentation](./mitigation_strategies/data_masking_and_redaction_in_jaeger_instrumentation.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Data Masking and Redaction in Jaeger Instrumentation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Jaeger Client Library Features:** Leverage Jaeger client library features like span processors or interceptors. These allow modification of spans *before* they are sent to the Jaeger backend.
    2.  **Implement Custom Span Processors/Interceptors:** Develop custom span processors or interceptors within your application code that uses the Jaeger client library. These processors should identify and redact sensitive data within span tags, logs, and operation names.
    3.  **Configure Redaction Rules:** Define clear rules for identifying sensitive data. This could involve regular expressions, keyword matching, or using dedicated libraries for data classification. Configure these rules within your custom span processors.
    4.  **Apply Redaction Consistently:** Ensure the custom span processors are registered and applied consistently across all services instrumented with Jaeger. Verify redaction is active in all relevant code paths.
    5.  **Test Redaction with Jaeger UI:** After implementation, inspect traces in the Jaeger UI to confirm that sensitive data is effectively masked according to the defined rules.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach via Trace Exposure (High Severity):** Sensitive data inadvertently captured in Jaeger traces becomes vulnerable if the Jaeger backend or UI is compromised.
    *   **Privacy Violations due to Trace Data (High Severity):**  Storing unredacted PII in Jaeger traces can lead to violations of privacy regulations when traces are accessed or audited.
    *   **Internal Information Disclosure through Jaeger UI (Medium Severity):**  Unredacted sensitive data in traces could be viewed by unauthorized internal users with access to the Jaeger UI.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach via Trace Exposure:** High risk reduction. Directly prevents sensitive data from being stored and potentially exposed through Jaeger.
    *   **Privacy Violations due to Trace Data:** High risk reduction.  Significantly reduces the risk of privacy violations related to data captured in Jaeger.
    *   **Internal Information Disclosure through Jaeger UI:** Medium risk reduction. Limits the visibility of sensitive information within Jaeger to authorized personnel only (when combined with access control).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic redaction for user IDs is implemented in the user service using a custom span processor in the Jaeger Java client.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Redaction is missing for:
    *   API keys in authentication service traces (requires implementing redaction in the authentication service Jaeger instrumentation).
    *   Potentially sensitive data in database query parameters logged in database interaction spans across all services (requires extending redaction to database interaction instrumentation).
    *   No centralized or easily configurable way to manage and update redaction rules across all Jaeger instrumented services.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Jaeger UI and API Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/jaeger_ui_and_api_access_control.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Jaeger UI and API Access Control
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Jaeger Query Service Authentication:**  Utilize Jaeger Query Service's configuration options to enable authentication. Integrate with an external authentication provider (like OAuth 2.0, LDAP, or similar) supported by Jaeger or through reverse proxy authentication in front of the Jaeger UI.
    2.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) if possible:** If your Jaeger deployment environment allows (e.g., using Kubernetes and service mesh policies, or custom authorization plugins for Jaeger), implement RBAC to control access to trace data based on user roles.
    3.  **Restrict Jaeger API Access:** Configure network policies or firewall rules to restrict access to the Jaeger Query Service API endpoint. Limit access to only authorized internal services or users who require programmatic access to trace data.
    4.  **Regularly Review Jaeger Access Permissions:** Periodically audit user accounts and access permissions configured for Jaeger to ensure they remain appropriate and remove unnecessary access.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Trace Data via Jaeger UI/API (High Severity):**  Without access control, anyone with network access can view potentially sensitive trace data through the Jaeger UI or API.
    *   **Data Manipulation via Unsecured Jaeger API (Medium Severity):**  If the Jaeger API is exposed without authentication, malicious actors could potentially exploit API vulnerabilities to manipulate trace data or Jaeger configurations (depending on API capabilities and vulnerabilities).
    *   **Information Disclosure to Unauthorized Parties (Medium Severity):**  Uncontrolled access to Jaeger UI and API can lead to unintended information disclosure to individuals who should not have access to trace data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Trace Data via Jaeger UI/API:** High risk reduction. Prevents unauthorized viewing of sensitive trace data by enforcing authentication and authorization.
    *   **Data Manipulation via Unsecured Jaeger API:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the risk of unauthorized modification of Jaeger data or configurations through API access control.
    *   **Information Disclosure to Unauthorized Parties:** Medium risk reduction. Limits the potential for information leaks through Jaeger by controlling access.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic authentication using OAuth 2.0 is configured for Jaeger UI access via a reverse proxy.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is not implemented within Jaeger itself. Authorization is currently global after authentication.
    *   API access control is not explicitly configured beyond the general authentication on the UI reverse proxy. Direct API access might still be less restricted.
    *   No automated or regular process for reviewing and managing Jaeger access permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Jaeger Communication Encryption (TLS/HTTPS)](./mitigation_strategies/jaeger_communication_encryption__tlshttps_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Jaeger Communication Encryption (TLS/HTTPS)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable TLS for Jaeger Agent to Collector Communication:** Configure Jaeger agents and collectors to communicate using gRPC with TLS enabled. This involves configuring TLS certificates and enabling TLS settings in both agent and collector configurations.
    2.  **Enable TLS for Jaeger Collector to Query Service Communication:** Configure TLS for communication between Jaeger collectors and query services, typically using HTTPS for HTTP-based communication or gRPC with TLS for gRPC-based communication.
    3.  **Enable TLS for Jaeger Query Service to Backend Storage:** Configure TLS encryption for connections between the Jaeger Query Service and the backend storage system (e.g., Cassandra, Elasticsearch). Refer to the backend storage documentation for TLS configuration.
    4.  **Enforce HTTPS for Jaeger UI Access:** Ensure the Jaeger UI is served over HTTPS. This is often achieved by configuring a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) in front of the Jaeger Query Service to handle TLS termination.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Interception in Transit (High Severity):**  Without encryption, trace data transmitted between Jaeger components can be intercepted and read by attackers on the network.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):**  Unencrypted communication channels are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks where attackers can intercept and potentially modify trace data or inject malicious data.
    *   **Passive Eavesdropping on Jaeger Traffic (Medium Severity):**  Unencrypted Jaeger communication allows passive eavesdropping to gather information about application behavior and potentially sensitive data within traces.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Interception in Transit:** High risk reduction. Makes it extremely difficult for attackers to intercept and understand trace data during transmission between Jaeger components.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High risk reduction. Prevents attackers from successfully performing man-in-the-middle attacks on Jaeger communication channels.
    *   **Passive Eavesdropping on Jaeger Traffic:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents passive monitoring of Jaeger communication to gather sensitive information.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. HTTPS is enabled for Jaeger UI access via a reverse proxy.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   TLS encryption is not configured for communication between Jaeger agents and collectors (gRPC).
    *   TLS encryption is not configured for communication between collectors and the backend storage (Cassandra).
    *   TLS configuration for Jaeger Query Service to Collector communication (if applicable in the deployment architecture) is not explicitly verified.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Jaeger Backend Data Retention Policy](./mitigation_strategies/jaeger_backend_data_retention_policy.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Jaeger Backend Data Retention Policy
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Backend Storage TTL (Time-To-Live):** Utilize the data retention features provided by the chosen Jaeger backend storage (e.g., Cassandra TTL, Elasticsearch Index Lifecycle Management). Configure TTL settings to automatically expire and delete trace data after a defined retention period.
    2.  **Define Retention Period based on Requirements:** Determine an appropriate data retention period based on legal, regulatory, compliance, and business requirements. Consider factors like debugging needs, audit trails, and storage capacity.
    3.  **Automate Data Purging/Archiving:** Ensure the backend storage's TTL or data lifecycle management features are configured to automatically purge or archive data according to the defined retention policy.
    4.  **Monitor Data Retention Enforcement:** Monitor the backend storage to verify that data is being purged or archived as expected and that the retention policy is being effectively enforced.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach Window Extension (Medium Severity):**  Storing trace data indefinitely increases the time window during which older, potentially less relevant but still sensitive data is vulnerable in case of a security breach.
    *   **Compliance Violations related to Data Minimization (Medium Severity):**  Data retention regulations (like GDPR) emphasize data minimization. Storing trace data beyond its useful lifespan can violate these principles.
    *   **Storage Capacity Exhaustion (Low Severity):**  Uncontrolled growth of trace data can lead to storage capacity exhaustion and performance degradation of the Jaeger backend.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach Window Extension:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the amount of historical data at risk in case of a breach by limiting the retention period.
    *   **Compliance Violations related to Data Minimization:** Medium risk reduction. Helps comply with data minimization principles and relevant data retention regulations.
    *   **Storage Capacity Exhaustion:** Low risk reduction (primarily operational benefit). Prevents uncontrolled storage growth and potential performance issues in the Jaeger backend.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Trace data is currently stored indefinitely in Cassandra.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No data retention policy defined for Jaeger trace data.
    *   No TTL or data lifecycle management configured in Cassandra for Jaeger trace data.
    *   No monitoring of data retention enforcement in the Jaeger backend.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Deployment of Jaeger Agents](./mitigation_strategies/secure_deployment_of_jaeger_agents.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Jaeger Agent Deployment
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Deploy Agents in Secure Network Segments:** Deploy Jaeger agents within the same secure network segments as the applications they are monitoring. Avoid deploying agents in publicly accessible networks.
    2.  **Restrict Agent Network Access:** Configure network firewalls or security groups to strictly limit network access for Jaeger agents. Allow only necessary outbound communication to Jaeger collectors on specific ports. Block all other inbound and outbound traffic.
    3.  **Minimize Agent Host Exposure:** Harden the host systems (VMs, containers) where Jaeger agents are deployed. Minimize the attack surface by disabling unnecessary services and ports on the agent host.
    4.  **Regularly Update Jaeger Agent Binaries:** Keep Jaeger agent binaries updated to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities. Implement an automated update process if feasible.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Jaeger Agent Compromise (Medium Severity):**  Vulnerable or exposed Jaeger agents can be compromised by attackers, potentially allowing them to gain a foothold in the internal network or tamper with trace data.
    *   **Data Tampering via Agent Manipulation (Low Severity):**  Compromised agents could be used to manipulate trace data before it is sent to collectors, potentially leading to inaccurate or misleading traces.
    *   **Agent-Based Denial of Service (Low Severity):**  Exposed agents could be targeted for denial-of-service attacks, potentially disrupting tracing functionality.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Jaeger Agent Compromise:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the attack surface of Jaeger agents and limits the potential impact of agent compromise through network segmentation and hardening.
    *   **Data Tampering via Agent Manipulation:** Low risk reduction. Makes it more difficult for attackers to manipulate trace data at the agent level by securing the agent environment.
    *   **Agent-Based Denial of Service:** Low risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of successful DoS attacks against Jaeger agents through network access control.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Agents are deployed within the same VPC as applications, providing some network isolation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Detailed and strict network access control rules for Jaeger agents are not fully implemented in network firewalls. Access might be broader than strictly necessary.
    *   No automated update process for Jaeger agents. Updates are currently manual.
    *   Host system hardening for agent deployments is not consistently and systematically applied across all agent deployments.
