# Deep Analysis of Jaeger Attack Tree Path: Compromise Storage Backend

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:** This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the attack path leading to the compromise of the Jaeger storage backend.  The goal is to identify specific vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and effective mitigation strategies to enhance the security posture of applications using Jaeger.  We will focus on practical, actionable recommendations.

**Scope:** This analysis focuses exclusively on the "Compromise Storage Backend" branch of the provided attack tree, specifically nodes 1.4.1, 1.4.2, and 1.4.3.  This includes:

*   **1.4.1 Exploit Storage Backend Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the specific storage backend used by Jaeger (e.g., Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Badger).
*   **1.4.2 Unauthorized Access to Storage Backend:**  Gaining access to the storage backend without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **1.4.3 Data Corruption/Deletion in Storage Backend:**  Maliciously altering or deleting trace data stored in the backend.

We will *not* analyze attacks on the Jaeger Agent, Collector, or Query components, except where they directly relate to accessing or compromising the storage backend.  We will assume that Jaeger is deployed in a production-like environment.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and common attack patterns for the most popular Jaeger storage backends (Cassandra, Elasticsearch, and Badger).

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.4 Compromise Storage Backend

### 2.1.  1.4.1 Exploit Storage Backend Vulnerabilities

**Detailed Analysis:**

This attack vector focuses on exploiting software vulnerabilities within the chosen storage backend.  The specific vulnerabilities and attack methods will vary significantly depending on the backend.

*   **Cassandra:**
    *   **Common Vulnerabilities:**  Historically, Cassandra has had vulnerabilities related to:
        *   **CQL Injection:** Similar to SQL injection, attackers can inject malicious CQL commands if input validation is insufficient.
        *   **JMX/RMI Exploitation:**  Misconfigured JMX or RMI interfaces can allow remote code execution.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to consume excessive resources, making the database unavailable.
        *   **Authentication Bypass:**  Flaws that allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Example Attack Scenario:** An attacker exploits a CQL injection vulnerability in a custom application that interacts with the Cassandra backend used by Jaeger.  They inject a command to extract all trace data or create a new superuser account.
*   **Elasticsearch:**
    *   **Common Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Vulnerabilities in scripting engines (e.g., Groovy, Painless) or plugins can lead to RCE.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  If Elasticsearch is used to store user-provided data without proper sanitization, XSS attacks are possible (though less relevant to Jaeger's primary use case).
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Vulnerabilities that expose sensitive information, such as cluster configuration or data.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to crash the Elasticsearch cluster or make it unresponsive.
    *   **Example Attack Scenario:** An attacker exploits an RCE vulnerability in an outdated Elasticsearch plugin used by Jaeger.  They gain shell access to the Elasticsearch server and exfiltrate trace data.
*   **Badger:**
    *   **Common Vulnerabilities:**  As a relatively newer and less widely used backend compared to Cassandra and Elasticsearch, Badger has fewer publicly documented vulnerabilities. However, potential attack vectors include:
        *   **Data Corruption:**  Bugs in the Badger code could lead to data corruption, potentially impacting the integrity of trace data.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Resource exhaustion vulnerabilities could make the Badger database unavailable.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:** Badger relies on other libraries, and vulnerabilities in those dependencies could be exploited.
    *   **Example Attack Scenario:** An attacker discovers a bug in Badger that allows them to corrupt the database by sending specially crafted requests.  This leads to data loss and service disruption.

**Enhanced Mitigations:**

*   **Backend-Specific Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners specifically designed for the chosen backend (e.g., `esrally` for Elasticsearch, `cqlsh` with security extensions for Cassandra).  These tools often have more in-depth checks than generic scanners.
*   **Regular Security Audits of Backend Configuration:**  Go beyond basic configuration checks.  Use tools like `lynis` or `cis-cat` to assess compliance with security benchmarks (e.g., CIS Benchmarks for Cassandra/Elasticsearch).
*   **Database Firewalling:** Implement a database firewall (e.g., `DataSunrise`, `Imperva SecureSphere`) to filter and monitor database traffic, blocking malicious queries and unauthorized access attempts.
*   **Sandboxing (Elasticsearch):**  If using Elasticsearch, enable the Java Security Manager and configure strict security policies to limit the capabilities of scripting engines and plugins.
*   **Input Validation (Cassandra):**  If using Cassandra, implement rigorous input validation and parameterized queries (prepared statements) in all applications that interact with the database to prevent CQL injection.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Regularly update all dependencies of the storage backend, including any libraries or plugins.  Use tools like `dependabot` or `snyk` to automate dependency vulnerability scanning.
*   **Threat Intelligence Feeds:** Subscribe to threat intelligence feeds that provide information about newly discovered vulnerabilities and exploits targeting database systems.

### 2.2.  1.4.2 Unauthorized Access to Storage Backend

**Detailed Analysis:**

This attack vector focuses on bypassing authentication and authorization mechanisms to gain direct access to the storage backend.

*   **Common Attack Methods:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Attempting to guess usernames and passwords.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:**  Using credentials stolen from other breaches to try to gain access.
    *   **Exploiting Weak or Default Credentials:**  Many database systems come with default accounts and passwords that must be changed during setup.
    *   **Misconfigured Authentication:**  Incorrectly configured authentication settings (e.g., allowing anonymous access, weak password policies).
    *   **Exploiting Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities:**  Software flaws that allow attackers to bypass authentication entirely.
    *   **Network Sniffing:**  Capturing unencrypted credentials transmitted over the network.

**Enhanced Mitigations:**

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA for all database access, even for service accounts.  This adds a significant layer of security, even if credentials are compromised.
*   **Strong Password Policies:**  Enforce strong password policies, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and regular password changes.  Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.
*   **Account Lockout Policies:**  Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.  Lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
*   **IP Whitelisting:**  Restrict database access to specific IP addresses or ranges.  This prevents attackers from connecting to the database from unauthorized networks.
*   **Mutual TLS (mTLS):**  Use mTLS to authenticate both the client (Jaeger Collector) and the server (storage backend).  This ensures that only authorized clients can connect to the database.
*   **Regular Auditing of User Accounts and Permissions:**  Review user accounts and permissions regularly to ensure that they are still necessary and that the principle of least privilege is being followed.  Remove or disable unused accounts.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the storage backend on a separate network segment from other application components.  This limits the impact of a compromise in other parts of the system.
*   **Encryption in Transit:**  Ensure that all communication between the Jaeger Collector and the storage backend is encrypted using TLS.  This prevents attackers from sniffing credentials or data transmitted over the network.

### 2.3.  1.4.3 Data Corruption/Deletion in Storage Backend

**Detailed Analysis:**

This attack vector focuses on the attacker intentionally corrupting or deleting trace data after gaining unauthorized access.

*   **Motivations:**
    *   **Disrupting Operations:**  Deleting trace data can make it difficult to diagnose performance issues or troubleshoot problems.
    *   **Covering Tracks:**  Attackers may delete trace data to hide evidence of their activities.
    *   **Ransomware:**  Attackers may encrypt the data and demand a ransom for its decryption.
    *   **Data Exfiltration and Deletion:** Stealing the data and then deleting the original to cause damage.

**Enhanced Mitigations:**

*   **Data Backups:**  Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy.  Regularly back up the trace data to a secure, offsite location.  Test the recovery process regularly to ensure that it works.
*   **Write-Once, Read-Many (WORM) Storage:**  Consider using WORM storage for backups to prevent data from being modified or deleted, even by attackers with administrative access.
*   **Data Integrity Checks:**  Implement data integrity checks (e.g., checksums, hashes) to detect data corruption.  Regularly verify the integrity of the data.
*   **Auditing and Alerting:**  Enable detailed auditing of all database operations, including data modifications and deletions.  Configure alerts to notify administrators of suspicious activity, such as large-scale deletions or modifications.
*   **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):**  Deploy IDPS to monitor network traffic and database activity for signs of malicious activity.
*   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):**  Implement DLP solutions to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control.
*   **Rollback Capabilities:**  If using a database system that supports transactions (like Cassandra with lightweight transactions), design the application to use transactions where appropriate. This can allow for rolling back changes in case of accidental or malicious data modification.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Consider using immutable infrastructure principles, where the storage backend is treated as immutable and replaced with a new instance rather than modified in place. This can simplify recovery and reduce the risk of persistent threats.
