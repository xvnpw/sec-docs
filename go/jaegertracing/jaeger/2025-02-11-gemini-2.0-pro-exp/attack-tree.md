## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Jaeger Components [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_jaeger_components__high-risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Compromise Jaeger Agent**

    *   **1.1.1 Exploit Agent Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers exploit software flaws in the Jaeger Agent (e.g., buffer overflows, insecure deserialization, code injection) to gain control of the agent process. This often leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (RCE, full system compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Regularly update the Jaeger Agent to the latest version.
            *   Perform security audits and penetration testing.
            *   Use a vulnerability scanner.
            *   Run the agent with minimal privileges (least privilege principle).
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the agent's code.
            *   Employ intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).

    *   **1.1.4 Configuration Errors [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers take advantage of misconfigurations in the Jaeger Agent, such as exposed ports, weak or default credentials, or overly permissive access controls.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on the specific misconfiguration)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege.
            *   Restrict network access using firewalls and network policies.
            *   Use strong, unique passwords/tokens.
            *   Regularly review and audit the agent's configuration.
            *   Use configuration management tools to enforce secure configurations.
            *   Disable unnecessary features and services.

*   **1.2 Compromise Jaeger Collector [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **1.2.1 Exploit Collector Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers exploit software flaws in the Jaeger Collector (e.g., vulnerabilities in gRPC/HTTP handling, storage interactions, or data processing logic) to gain control. This can lead to RCE or unauthorized data access.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (RCE, data access)
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Keep the Jaeger Collector updated.
            *   Perform security audits and penetration testing.
            *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization.
            *   Employ IDS/IPS.

    *   **1.2.3 Unauthorized Access [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms to gain direct access to the Jaeger Collector, allowing them to manipulate trace data or potentially gain further access to the system.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (if auth is configured), High (if no auth)
        *   **Impact:** High (data access, manipulation)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement strong authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0, mTLS).
            *   Implement strong authorization (role-based access control).
            *   Enforce the principle of least privilege.
            *   Regularly review and audit access logs.
            *   Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.

    *   **1.2.4 Configuration Errors [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Similar to agent misconfigurations, attackers exploit weaknesses in the Collector's configuration, such as exposed ports, weak credentials, or insecure storage settings.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Follow security best practices for configuration.
            *   Restrict network access.
            *   Use strong, unique credentials.
            *   Regularly review and audit the configuration.
            *   Use configuration management tools.

*   **1.4 Compromise Storage Backend [CRITICAL] [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **1.4.1 Exploit Storage Backend Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities specific to the chosen storage backend (e.g., Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Badger) to gain access to the data or compromise the backend system.

        *   **Impact:** Very High (data breach, data loss)
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced

    *   **1.4.2 Unauthorized Access to Storage Backend [CRITICAL] [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers bypass authentication and authorization to gain direct access to the storage backend, allowing them to read, modify, or delete trace data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (if auth is configured), High (if no auth)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (data breach, data loss)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate

    *   **1.4.3 Data Corruption/Deletion in Storage Backend [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers, having gained unauthorized access, intentionally corrupt or delete the trace data stored in the backend.
