# Attack Surface Analysis for jaegertracing/jaeger

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) on Agent/Collector/Query/Ingester](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__on_agentcollectorqueryingester.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker overwhelms a Jaeger component, making it unavailable.
    *   **Jaeger's Contribution:** Jaeger's reliance on network communication (UDP, gRPC, HTTP) for data transmission and querying creates DoS entry points.
    *   **Example:** Flooding the Jaeger Agent with malformed UDP packets, causing it to crash.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of tracing data, potential application performance degradation, inability to monitor.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rate Limiting (all components).
        *   Strict Input Validation.
        *   Resource Quotas.
        *   Network Segmentation.
        *   Monitoring and Alerting.
        *   Use gRPC instead of UDP.
        *   Load Balancing (Collector/Query).

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to Trace Data (Query Service)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_trace_data__query_service_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains unauthorized access to trace data via the Query Service API.
    *   **Jaeger's Contribution:** The Jaeger Query Service API is a direct entry point for accessing trace data; if unsecured, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Attacker accesses the Query Service endpoint without authentication, retrieving all traces.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive application logic, potential for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on data sensitivity).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strong Authentication and Authorization (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
        *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
        *   API Gateway.
        *   Network Segmentation.
        *   Audit Logging.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Agent-Collector, Collector-Backend, etc.)](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__agent-collector__collector-backend__etc__.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker intercepts/modifies communication between Jaeger components.
    *   **Jaeger's Contribution:** Jaeger's distributed architecture relies on network communication; unencrypted communication is vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Intercepting unencrypted communication between Agent and Collector, capturing sensitive span data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   TLS Encryption (all communication).
        *   Mutual TLS (mTLS).
        *   Network Segmentation.

## Attack Surface: [Storage Backend Attacks (Indirect via Collector/Query/Ingester](./attack_surfaces/storage_backend_attacks__indirect_via_collectorqueryingester.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker targets the storage backend (e.g., Cassandra, Elasticsearch) used by Jaeger.
    *   **Jaeger's Contribution:** Jaeger components (collector, query, ingester) interact with the backend; backend vulnerabilities expose the tracing system.
    *   **Example:** Exploiting a vulnerability in Elasticsearch to steal Jaeger data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data loss, tracing system disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on data sensitivity and backend security).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Backend Configuration (strong passwords, access control, encryption).
        *   Least Privilege (for Jaeger component access).
        *   Regular Security Updates (for the backend).
        *   Monitoring and Alerting (for the backend).
        *   Data Backup and Recovery.
        *   Use dedicated user with restricted permissions.
