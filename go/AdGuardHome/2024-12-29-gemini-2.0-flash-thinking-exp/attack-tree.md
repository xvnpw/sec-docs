Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

*   **Exploit AdGuard Home Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
    *   **[CRITICAL] Remote Code Execution (RCE) on AdGuard Home [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Exploit Known Vulnerability in AdGuard Home Core (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            *   **Attempt exploit using known techniques (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in AdGuard Home's core code. This involves scanning for vulnerable versions and using readily available exploit code or tools (e.g., Metasploit modules) to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
        *   **Exploit Vulnerability in AdGuard Home Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            *   **Exploit known vulnerabilities in those dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH):** AdGuard Home relies on third-party libraries. Attackers identify outdated or vulnerable dependencies and exploit known vulnerabilities within them to gain RCE. This often involves finding and adapting existing exploits for the specific dependency version used by AdGuard Home.
        *   **Identify and exploit other web interface vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection) (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers identify weaknesses in the AdGuard Home web interface beyond XSS, such as command injection flaws. By crafting malicious input through web requests, they can trick the server into executing arbitrary system commands, leading to RCE.

*   **Manipulate AdGuard Home Functionality (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
    *   **[CRITICAL] DNS Manipulation [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Poison DNS Cache (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers send forged DNS responses to the AdGuard Home server, tricking it into caching incorrect DNS records. This allows them to redirect the application's network traffic to malicious servers under their control.
        *   **Modify DNS Settings (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit authentication bypass in the web interface [CRITICAL]**
                *   **Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the login mechanism (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers find and exploit flaws in the AdGuard Home web interface's authentication process, allowing them to bypass login requirements and gain administrative access. This could involve SQL injection, brute-force attacks on weak credentials (if default credentials haven't been changed), or exploiting logical flaws in the authentication logic.
            *   **Exploit API vulnerabilities to change DNS settings (HIGH-RISK PATH):** AdGuard Home exposes an API for configuration. Attackers identify and exploit vulnerabilities in this API (e.g., lack of authentication, insecure endpoints) to directly modify DNS settings, such as changing upstream DNS servers or adding malicious DNS records.
        *   **Add Malicious Filtering Rules (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit authentication bypass in the web interface [CRITICAL]:** (Same as above - gaining unauthorized access to the web interface).
            *   **Exploit API vulnerabilities to add malicious filtering rules (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers exploit API vulnerabilities to inject malicious filtering rules. These rules can be used to block legitimate traffic to or from the application, or to redirect users to malicious content by manipulating how domains are resolved or blocked.

*   **Leverage AdGuard Home as a Pivot Point (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
    *   **[CRITICAL] Gain Access to AdGuard Home Server [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Exploit RCE vulnerability (as described above) (HIGH-RISK PATH):** (Refer to the "Exploit AdGuard Home Vulnerabilities" section for details on gaining RCE).
        *   **Exploit weak credentials or default passwords (HIGH-RISK PATH):** If the administrator has not changed the default credentials or is using weak passwords, attackers can easily gain access to the AdGuard Home server through brute-force attacks or by using commonly known default credentials.
    *   **Lateral Movement (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Once the attacker has compromised the AdGuard Home server, they can use it as a base to launch further attacks on other systems within the network. This involves scanning the network for vulnerabilities, exploiting network services, or using stolen credentials to gain access to the application server or other critical infrastructure.
