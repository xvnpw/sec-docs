# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for adguardteam/adguardhome

## Mitigation Strategy: [DNSSEC Validation](./mitigation_strategies/dnssec_validation.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enable and Enforce DNSSEC

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access AdGuard Home Interface:** Log in to the AdGuard Home web interface.
    2.  **Navigate to Settings:** Go to "Settings" -> "DNS settings".
    3.  **Enable DNSSEC:** Find the option for "Enable DNSSEC" (or similar wording) and ensure it is checked.
    4.  **Save Changes:** Click "Save" or "Apply" to apply the changes.
    5.  **Verification (Optional):** Use an external DNSSEC validation tool (e.g., online validators) to confirm that DNSSEC is working correctly for known DNSSEC-signed domains.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DNS Cache Poisoning:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from injecting forged DNS records into AdGuard Home's cache.
    *   **DNS Spoofing:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from impersonating legitimate DNS servers.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (related to DNS):** (Severity: High) - Helps prevent attackers from intercepting and modifying DNS responses.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DNS Cache Poisoning:** Risk reduced significantly (close to elimination if upstream servers also support DNSSEC).
    *   **DNS Spoofing:** Risk reduced significantly.
    *   **MitM (DNS-related):** Risk reduced significantly.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, enabled in the AdGuard Home configuration file (`AdGuardHome.yaml`) and verified via the web interface.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to add automated monitoring to check if DNSSEC validation is consistently successful (e.g., alert if validation failures increase). This would require external tooling, so it's not strictly an *internal* AdGuard Home mitigation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Multiple Diverse Upstream DNS Servers](./mitigation_strategies/multiple_diverse_upstream_dns_servers.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Multiple, Diverse Upstream DNS Servers

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access AdGuard Home Interface:** Log in to the AdGuard Home web interface.
    2.  **Navigate to Settings:** Go to "Settings" -> "DNS settings".
    3.  **Upstream DNS Servers:** Locate the section for configuring "Upstream DNS servers".
    4.  **Add Multiple Servers:** Enter the IP addresses or hostnames of *at least three* reputable and diverse DNS providers (e.g., Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), Google (8.8.8.8), Quad9 (9.9.9.9), OpenDNS, etc.).  Avoid using only one provider.
    5.  **Prioritize (Optional):**  If desired, set priorities for the servers (e.g., prefer faster or more reliable ones).
    6.  **Save Changes:** Click "Save" or "Apply".

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Upstream DNS Server Compromise:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the impact if one upstream server is compromised or becomes unavailable.
    *   **DNS Outages:** (Severity: Medium) - Provides redundancy and improves availability if one upstream server experiences an outage.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Upstream DNS Server Compromise:** Risk significantly reduced; impact limited to a fraction of DNS queries.
    *   **DNS Outages:** Risk significantly reduced; AdGuard Home can continue functioning using other upstream servers.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially.  We have three upstream servers configured, but they are all from the same provider (Google).

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to add upstream servers from *different* providers (Cloudflare, Quad9) to achieve true diversity.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/strong_authentication.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong, Unique Passwords

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access AdGuard Home Interface:** Log in to the AdGuard Home web interface.
    2.  **Navigate to Settings:** Go to "Settings" -> "General settings" or a similar section related to authentication.
    3.  **Change Password:** Locate the option to change the administrative password.
    4.  **Use a Strong Password:** Create a strong, unique password that is *at least 12 characters long* and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.  Use a password manager to generate and store the password.
    5.  **Save Changes:** Click "Save" or "Apply".

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** (Severity: Medium) - Makes it significantly harder for attackers to guess the administrative password.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents attackers from using credentials stolen from other breaches to access AdGuard Home.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access due to weak or compromised credentials.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced; strong passwords are exponentially harder to crack.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Risk significantly reduced; unique passwords prevent reuse of compromised credentials.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, a strong password is in use, generated by a password manager.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement a policy to require periodic password changes (e.g., every 90 days). This is a policy, not a direct AdGuard Home setting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Software Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_software_updates.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Keep AdGuard Home Updated

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access AdGuard Home Interface:** Log in to the AdGuard Home web interface.

    3.  **Install Updates:** If updates are available, follow the instructions to install them.
    4.  **Enable Automatic Updates (Recommended):** If possible, enable automatic updates to ensure that AdGuard Home is always running the latest version.  This is usually found in the "Settings" area.
    5. **Configure update channel:** Select stable update channel.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: Critical to Low, depending on the vulnerability) - Patches security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Indirectly):** (Severity: Critical) - Reduces the window of opportunity for attackers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk dramatically reduced.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Risk indirectly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, automatic updates are enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to configure monitoring to alert us if automatic updates fail (requires external tools).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting (DNS Queries)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting__dns_queries_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure DNS Query Rate Limiting

* **Description:**
    1.  **Access AdGuard Home Interface:** Log in to the AdGuard Home web interface.
    2.  **Navigate to Settings:** Go to "Settings" -> "DNS settings".
    3.  **Rate Limiting:** Find the section for "Rate limiting" or "Clients rate limit".
    4.  **Set Limits:** Configure the maximum number of DNS queries allowed per client (or IP address) per second (or other time interval).
    5.  **Save Changes:** Click "Save" or "Apply".

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (DNS Flooding):** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS (DNS Flooding):** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, rate limiting is enabled with a default value of 20 queries per second per client.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to monitor the effectiveness of the rate limiting and adjust the values if necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_features.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unused AdGuard Home Features

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Features:** Examine all features and settings in the AdGuard Home interface.
    2.  **Identify Unused Features:** Determine which features are *not* strictly required. Examples: API, DHCP server, certain advanced DNS settings.
    3.  **Disable Features:** Disable the identified unused features through the AdGuard Home interface or configuration file.
    4.  **Document:** Document which features have been disabled and why.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Unused Features:** (Severity: Variable)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Unused Features:** Risk reduced; the attack surface is minimized.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. The DHCP server is disabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to review other features (e.g., the API) and disable any that are not essential.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Filter List Management](./mitigation_strategies/filter_list_management.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use Curated and Updated Filter Lists

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access AdGuard Home Interface:** Log in to the AdGuard Home web interface.
    2.  **Navigate to Filters:** Go to "Filters" -> "DNS blocklists" (or similar).
    3.  **Add/Remove Lists:** Add or remove filter lists as needed.  Use *reputable* and *well-maintained* lists (e.g., AdGuard's lists, EasyList, etc.). Avoid obscure lists.
    4.  **Enable Automatic Updates:** Ensure that the "Update filters automatically" option (or similar) is enabled.  Set a reasonable update interval (e.g., daily).
    5.  **Whitelist/Blacklist (Manual):**  Use the "Custom filtering rules" section to manually add whitelist entries (for sites that are incorrectly blocked) or blacklist entries (for sites that should be blocked but aren't).
    6. **Save Changes:** Click "Save" or "Apply".

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **False Positives (Blocking Legitimate Sites):** (Severity: Low to Medium) - Using well-maintained lists reduces the chance of blocking legitimate sites.
    *   **False Negatives (Allowing Malicious/Unwanted Content):** (Severity: Medium to High) - Using up-to-date lists ensures that newly discovered malicious domains are blocked.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **False Positives:** Risk reduced; fewer legitimate sites are blocked.
    *   **False Negatives:** Risk reduced; more malicious/unwanted content is blocked.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, we are using several reputable filter lists with automatic updates enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to establish a more formal process for reviewing and managing whitelist/blacklist entries based on user feedback and monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Query Logging (Privacy and Security)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_query_logging__privacy_and_security_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Carefully Configure Query Logging

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access AdGuard Home Interface:** Log in to the AdGuard Home web interface.
    2.  **Navigate to Settings:** Go to "Settings" -> "General settings".
    3.  **Query Log Configuration:** Find the section for "Query log configuration".
    4.  **Disable or Configure:**
        *   **Disable:** If query logging is not *strictly* necessary, *disable* it entirely ("Do not keep logs"). This is the most privacy-preserving option.
        *   **Configure (if needed):** If logging is required (e.g., for troubleshooting), set a *short* retention period (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days).  *Avoid* storing logs indefinitely.
    5.  **Anonymize (if possible):** If the "Anonymize client IPs" option (or similar) is available, enable it to reduce the privacy impact of logging.
    6. **Save Changes:** Click "Save" or "Apply".

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privacy Violations (from Log Data):** (Severity: Medium to High) - Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive user browsing data.
    *   **Data Breach (of Log Data):** (Severity: Medium to High) - Limits the amount of sensitive data that could be compromised in a breach.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privacy Violations:** Risk significantly reduced (especially if logging is disabled).
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk reduced; less data is stored for a shorter period.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially.  Query logging is enabled with a 7-day retention period.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to evaluate whether logging is *strictly* necessary. If not, disable it. If it is, enable IP anonymization.
