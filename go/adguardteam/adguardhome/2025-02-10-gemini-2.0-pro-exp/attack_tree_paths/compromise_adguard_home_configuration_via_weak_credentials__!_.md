## Deep Analysis: Compromise AdGuard Home Configuration via Weak Credentials

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Compromise AdGuard Home Configuration via Weak Credentials" attack path.  We aim to:

*   Identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors related to weak credentials.
*   Assess the real-world feasibility and impact of this attack.
*   Propose concrete, actionable recommendations to enhance the security posture of AdGuard Home against this specific threat, going beyond the initial mitigation steps.
*   Prioritize recommendations based on their effectiveness and ease of implementation.
*   Consider the perspective of both a novice attacker and a more sophisticated adversary.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses solely on the attack path where an attacker gains unauthorized access to the AdGuard Home web interface *due to weak or default credentials*.  It does *not* cover other attack vectors such as:

*   Exploiting software vulnerabilities in AdGuard Home itself.
*   Compromising the underlying operating system.
*   Social engineering attacks targeting AdGuard Home administrators.
*   Physical access to the server running AdGuard Home.
*   Attacks against the network infrastructure (e.g., DNS spoofing *before* reaching AdGuard Home).

The scope includes:

*   The AdGuard Home web interface authentication mechanism.
*   Password storage and handling within AdGuard Home (to the extent publicly documented or reasonably inferable).
*   Common password attack techniques applicable to this scenario.
*   Relevant configuration options within AdGuard Home that impact credential security.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will systematically analyze the attack path, considering attacker motivations, capabilities, and potential attack steps.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will examine the AdGuard Home documentation, source code (where relevant and publicly available), and community discussions to identify potential weaknesses related to credential management.
3.  **Best Practice Review:** We will compare AdGuard Home's current security measures against industry best practices for authentication and password management.
4.  **Risk Assessment:** We will evaluate the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation, considering factors like the prevalence of default credential usage and the potential damage an attacker could inflict.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:** We will propose specific, actionable, and prioritized recommendations to mitigate the identified risks.  These recommendations will be tailored to the AdGuard Home context.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**2.1 Attack Scenario Breakdown:**

The attack unfolds in the following stages:

1.  **Target Identification:** The attacker identifies a target AdGuard Home instance. This can be done through:
    *   **Internet-wide scanning:**  Using tools like Shodan or Masscan to find exposed AdGuard Home instances (typically on ports 80, 443, or a custom port).
    *   **Targeted attacks:**  If the attacker knows a specific organization or individual uses AdGuard Home, they can directly target their known IP address or domain.
    *   **Opportunistic discovery:**  The attacker might stumble upon an exposed instance while performing other reconnaissance activities.

2.  **Credential Guessing/Brute-Forcing:** The attacker attempts to gain access using:
    *   **Default Credentials:**  Trying the well-known default username and password for AdGuard Home.  This is the most common and easiest attack vector.
    *   **Common Weak Passwords:**  Using lists of commonly used passwords (e.g., "password," "123456," "admin").
    *   **Dictionary Attacks:**  Using a dictionary of words and common password variations.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Systematically trying all possible combinations of characters (feasible for short or simple passwords).
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Using credentials obtained from data breaches of other services, hoping the user reused the same password.

3.  **Successful Authentication:** If the attacker guesses or cracks the correct credentials, they gain access to the AdGuard Home web interface.

4.  **Configuration Manipulation:**  The attacker now has full control and can:
    *   **Change DNS Servers:** Redirect DNS queries to malicious servers controlled by the attacker, enabling phishing, malware distribution, and censorship.
    *   **Disable Filtering:**  Turn off ad blocking and other security features, exposing users to unwanted content and potential threats.
    *   **Add Malicious Rules:**  Inject custom filtering rules that block legitimate websites or redirect traffic to malicious ones.
    *   **Modify Client Settings:**  Change settings for individual clients or groups, tailoring the attack to specific targets.
    *   **Exfiltrate Data:** Potentially access logs or other sensitive information stored within AdGuard Home.
    *   **Maintain Persistence:** Change the password to prevent the legitimate administrator from regaining access, or potentially install a backdoor (though this is outside the scope of *this specific* attack path).

**2.2 Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Default Credentials:** The existence of default credentials is a significant vulnerability.  Even if documented, many users fail to change them.
*   **Lack of Mandatory Password Change:**  If AdGuard Home doesn't *force* a password change on the first login, the risk of default credential usage remains high.
*   **Weak Password Enforcement:**  If AdGuard Home allows users to set weak passwords (e.g., short passwords, passwords without complexity requirements), it increases the success rate of brute-force and dictionary attacks.
*   **Insufficient Account Lockout:**  A lack of account lockout after multiple failed login attempts allows attackers to continue brute-forcing indefinitely.
*   **Absence of MFA:**  The lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) means that compromising the password is the *only* barrier to entry.
*   **Cleartext Password Storage (Hypothetical):** While unlikely, if AdGuard Home were to store passwords in plaintext (without hashing and salting), it would represent an extreme vulnerability.  This is *not* confirmed, but it's a crucial aspect to consider in a thorough analysis. We assume AdGuard Home uses proper hashing.
* **Session Management Weakness (Hypothetical):** If session tokens are predictable or not properly invalidated after logout, an attacker could hijack a valid session.

**2.3 Risk Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  The prevalence of default credential usage and weak passwords makes this a very likely attack vector, especially for publicly exposed instances.
*   **Impact:** High.  Complete control over DNS resolution can have severe consequences, including data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
*   **Overall Risk:** High.  The combination of a relatively high likelihood and a high impact results in a high overall risk.

**2.4 Mitigation Recommendations (Beyond Initial Steps):**

The initial mitigation steps are a good starting point, but we can go further:

1.  **Mandatory Strong Password Policy:**
    *   **Enforce Complexity:** Require a minimum length (e.g., 12 characters), a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    *   **Password Strength Meter:**  Provide real-time feedback on password strength during creation.
    *   **Block Common Passwords:**  Reject passwords found in common password lists (e.g., Have I Been Pwned's Pwned Passwords API).
    *   **Regular Password Expiration (Optional):** Consider forcing password changes periodically (e.g., every 90 days), although this is debated and should be balanced against user convenience.

2.  **Robust Account Lockout:**
    *   **Progressive Delay:**  Increase the lockout duration after each failed attempt (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour).
    *   **IP-Based Lockout:**  Lock out the IP address, not just the username, to prevent distributed brute-force attacks.
    *   **CAPTCHA:**  Introduce a CAPTCHA after a few failed login attempts to deter automated attacks.
    *   **Notification:**  Notify the administrator via email or other channels about failed login attempts and account lockouts.

3.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    *   **Offer Options:**  Support various MFA methods, such as TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy), email codes, or SMS codes.
    *   **Prioritize TOTP:**  Encourage the use of TOTP apps as they are generally more secure than SMS-based MFA.
    *   **Make MFA Easy to Enable:**  Provide clear instructions and a user-friendly interface for setting up MFA.

4.  **Security Hardening Guides:**
    *   **Publish Detailed Guides:**  Create comprehensive documentation on how to securely configure and deploy AdGuard Home, including specific recommendations for password management and network security.
    *   **Address Common Misconfigurations:**  Highlight common security mistakes and provide clear instructions on how to avoid them.

5.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   **Internal Audits:**  Conduct regular internal security audits of the AdGuard Home codebase and configuration.
    *   **External Audits (Optional):**  Consider engaging external security experts to perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

6.  **Session Management Improvements:**
    *   **Use HttpOnly and Secure Flags:** Ensure session cookies have the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags set to prevent client-side script access and ensure transmission over HTTPS only.
    *   **Short Session Lifetimes:**  Implement short session timeouts to minimize the window of opportunity for session hijacking.
    *   **Session Invalidation:**  Properly invalidate session tokens on logout and after a period of inactivity.
    *   **Random Session IDs:** Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to create session IDs.

7.  **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the login endpoint to slow down brute-force attacks. This is distinct from account lockout, as it limits the *overall* number of requests, even if they are for different usernames.

8. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Although not directly part of AdGuard Home, recommending the use of a WAF (like Cloudflare, AWS WAF, or ModSecurity) in front of AdGuard Home can provide an additional layer of defense against various web-based attacks, including brute-force attempts.
