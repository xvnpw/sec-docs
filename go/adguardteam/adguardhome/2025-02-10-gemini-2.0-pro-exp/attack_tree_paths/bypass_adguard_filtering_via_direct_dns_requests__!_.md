# Deep Analysis: Bypass AdGuard Filtering via Direct DNS Requests

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Bypass AdGuard Filtering via Direct DNS Requests" attack path, identify its root causes, assess its potential impact on the AdGuard Home deployment, and propose comprehensive mitigation strategies that go beyond the initial suggestions.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for developers and system administrators to enhance the security posture of AdGuard Home deployments.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where clients bypass AdGuard Home's filtering by directly querying external DNS servers.  This includes:

*   **Client-side bypass:**  Users manually configuring DNS settings on their devices.
*   **Network-configuration bypass:**  Network setups that allow clients to use alternative DNS servers without explicit user intervention.
*   **Encrypted DNS bypass:** Clients using DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT) to directly contact public resolvers, bypassing AdGuard Home even if traditional DNS (port 53) is blocked.
*   **IPv6 considerations:**  Ensuring that IPv6 DNS settings are also properly configured and enforced.
*   **Impact on AdGuard Home's functionality:**  Loss of filtering, tracking, and security features.

This analysis *does not* cover attacks against the AdGuard Home server itself (e.g., vulnerabilities in the software, denial-of-service attacks).  It focuses solely on the bypass of its filtering capabilities.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the provided attack tree path as a starting point and expand upon it by considering various attack vectors and scenarios.
2.  **Technical Analysis:**  We will examine the technical mechanisms involved in DNS resolution, network configuration, and client-side settings.
3.  **Best Practices Review:**  We will review industry best practices for securing DNS infrastructure and preventing DNS leaks.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  We will propose a layered defense approach, combining network-level, client-side, and monitoring solutions.
5.  **Prioritization:** We will prioritize mitigation steps based on their effectiveness, feasibility, and impact on user experience.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

### 2.1. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

The core attack vector is the ability of clients to use DNS servers other than the designated AdGuard Home instance.  This can manifest in several ways:

*   **Manual Configuration:**  Users with administrative privileges on their devices can manually change their DNS settings to use public DNS servers (e.g., Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS) or any other DNS server of their choice.
*   **DHCP Snooping/Spoofing (Advanced):**  A malicious actor on the local network could potentially intercept DHCP requests and provide a rogue DNS server address.  This is less common but more sophisticated.
*   **Router Misconfiguration:**  The router itself might be configured to use a different DNS server, or it might not be enforcing the use of the AdGuard Home instance for all connected devices.  This could be due to an oversight or a deliberate misconfiguration.
*   **IPv6 DNS Leakage:**  The router might be correctly configured for IPv4 DNS, but IPv6 DNS settings might be left unconfigured or misconfigured, allowing clients to bypass AdGuard Home via IPv6.
*   **Encrypted DNS (DoH/DoT):**  Modern browsers and operating systems increasingly support DoH and DoT.  If these are enabled and configured to use a public resolver, they will bypass AdGuard Home even if traditional DNS (port 53) is blocked.  This is a significant and growing threat.
*   **Split-Horizon DNS (Edge Case):** In some complex network setups, split-horizon DNS might be used, where internal and external DNS queries are handled differently.  If not configured correctly, this could lead to bypass scenarios.
*   **VPN/Proxy Usage:** Clients using VPNs or proxies might have their DNS queries routed through the VPN/proxy provider's DNS servers, bypassing AdGuard Home.
*   **Fallback DNS Servers:** Some devices or applications might have hardcoded fallback DNS servers that are used if the primary DNS server is unavailable.  These fallback servers could be external DNS servers.
* **Mobile Devices on Cellular Data:** Mobile devices, when connected to cellular networks, will use the mobile carrier's DNS servers, completely bypassing AdGuard Home unless a VPN or specific DNS-over-HTTPS/TLS configuration is used.

### 2.2. Technical Analysis

*   **DNS Resolution Process:**  Understanding the DNS resolution process is crucial.  When a client needs to resolve a domain name, it sends a DNS query to its configured DNS server.  If this server is not the AdGuard Home instance, the filtering is bypassed.
*   **DHCP Protocol:**  DHCP is used to automatically assign IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS server addresses to clients.  If the DHCP server is not configured to provide *only* the AdGuard Home IP address as the DNS server, clients can be configured to use other DNS servers.
*   **Network Address Translation (NAT):**  NAT allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.  However, NAT itself does not enforce DNS settings.
*   **Firewall Rules:**  Firewalls can be used to block outgoing traffic to specific IP addresses and ports.  This is essential for preventing clients from directly contacting external DNS servers.
*   **IPv6 Addressing:**  IPv6 uses a different addressing scheme than IPv4.  It's crucial to ensure that IPv6 DNS settings are also configured correctly to prevent bypass.
*   **Encrypted DNS Protocols (DoH/DoT):**  DoH and DoT encrypt DNS traffic, making it more difficult to monitor and filter.  They use standard HTTPS (port 443) and TLS, respectively, making them harder to block without impacting other services.

### 2.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of bypassing AdGuard Home's filtering is significant:

*   **Loss of Ad Blocking:**  Clients will be exposed to advertisements, trackers, and potentially malicious content.
*   **Loss of Security Features:**  AdGuard Home's security features, such as blocking known malicious domains, will be ineffective.
*   **Loss of Parental Controls:**  If AdGuard Home is used for parental controls, these controls will be bypassed.
*   **Loss of Privacy:**  DNS queries will be sent to external DNS servers, potentially exposing browsing history to third parties.
*   **Increased Bandwidth Consumption:**  Ads and trackers can consume significant bandwidth.
*   **Potential for Malware Infection:**  Exposure to malicious websites increases the risk of malware infection.
* **Compliance Issues:** In corporate environments, bypassing a designated DNS server may violate security policies and compliance requirements.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategies (Layered Defense)

A layered approach is essential for effectively mitigating this attack path.  No single solution is foolproof.

**2.4.1. Network-Level Enforcement (Highest Priority):**

*   **Firewall Rule (Port 53 Redirection):**  Configure the router/firewall to *redirect* all outgoing DNS traffic (UDP and TCP port 53) to the AdGuard Home instance's IP address.  This is more effective than simply blocking, as it ensures that DNS queries are still processed, but by AdGuard Home.  This should be done for both IPv4 and IPv6.
    *   **Example (iptables):**
        ```bash
        iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination <AdGuard_Home_IP>:53
        iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination <AdGuard_Home_IP>:53
        ```
        (Replace `<AdGuard_Home_IP>` with the actual IP address and `eth0` with the correct interface.)  Similar rules would be needed for IPv6 using `ip6tables`.
*   **Block Known Public DNS Servers:**  Block outgoing connections to well-known public DNS servers (e.g., 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1, 2001:4860:4860::8888, 2001:4860:4860::8844, 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2606:4700:4700::1001) at the firewall level.  This prevents clients from easily bypassing the redirection by manually configuring these servers.  *Crucially, ensure that the AdGuard Home instance itself is allowed to communicate with these servers if they are used as upstream resolvers.*
*   **DHCP Configuration:**  Ensure the DHCP server provides *only* the AdGuard Home IP address as the DNS server (both IPv4 and IPv6).  Avoid providing any secondary or fallback DNS servers.  If your router allows it, configure a static DHCP lease for the AdGuard Home server to prevent its IP address from changing.

**2.4.2. Client-Side Configuration (Medium Priority):**

*   **Group Policy (Corporate Environments):**  Use Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in Windows Active Directory to enforce DNS settings on client devices and prevent users from modifying them.
*   **Mobile Device Management (MDM):**  For managed mobile devices, use MDM solutions to enforce DNS settings.
*   **Configuration Profiles (macOS/iOS):**  Use configuration profiles to lock down DNS settings on Apple devices.
*   **Local Host File (Last Resort):**  As a last resort, and *only* if other methods are not feasible, you could modify the local host file on each client device to point all DNS queries to the AdGuard Home instance.  This is highly impractical for large networks and easily bypassed by users with administrative privileges.

**2.4.3. Encrypted DNS Mitigation (High Priority):**

*   **AdGuard Home as DoH/DoT Resolver:**  Configure AdGuard Home to act as a DoH/DoT resolver.  This allows clients to use encrypted DNS while still being filtered by AdGuard Home.  Provide clients with the appropriate DoH/DoT endpoint URL.
*   **Block Known DoH/DoT Servers:**  Identify and block the IP addresses and domains associated with popular public DoH/DoT resolvers.  This is an ongoing effort, as new resolvers may appear.  This is more challenging than blocking traditional DNS, as it uses port 443 (HTTPS).  Techniques like SNI filtering (if supported by your firewall) can help.
*   **Application-Level Control (Advanced):**  Some firewalls and security software allow for application-level control, which can be used to block or restrict the use of specific applications (e.g., browsers) that are known to use DoH/DoT.
*   **DNS Filtering of DoH/DoT Domains:** Add the domains of known DoH/DoT providers to AdGuard Home's blocklists. This will prevent clients from resolving the addresses of these providers, effectively blocking their use.

**2.4.4. Monitoring and Detection (Essential):**

*   **Firewall Logs:**  Regularly review firewall logs to identify any outgoing DNS traffic that is not directed to the AdGuard Home instance.
*   **Network Traffic Analysis:**  Use network monitoring tools (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump, ntopng) to analyze DNS traffic and identify unauthorized DNS servers.
*   **AdGuard Home Logs:**  Enable detailed logging in AdGuard Home (if available) to monitor DNS queries and identify clients that are not using the expected DNS server.  Look for queries originating from unexpected IP addresses or resolving to unexpected upstream servers.
*   **Alerting:**  Configure alerts to notify administrators of any detected DNS bypass attempts.

**2.4.5. User Education (Important):**

*   **Inform Users:**  Clearly communicate to users the importance of using the designated DNS server and the risks of bypassing it.  Explain the benefits of AdGuard Home (ad blocking, security, privacy).
*   **Provide Instructions:**  Provide clear and concise instructions on how to configure their devices to use the AdGuard Home instance as the DNS server.
*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Include DNS security as part of regular security awareness training.

**2.4.6. IPv6 Specific Considerations:**

*   **Router Advertisement (RA) Guard:** If supported by your network equipment, enable RA Guard to prevent rogue router advertisements that could include malicious DNS server information.
*   **DHCPv6 Server Configuration:** Ensure your DHCPv6 server is configured to provide *only* the AdGuard Home IPv6 address as the DNS server.
*   **IPv6 Firewall Rules:** Implement firewall rules similar to the IPv4 rules, but using `ip6tables` or your firewall's IPv6 configuration interface.

### 2.5. Prioritization of Mitigation Steps

1.  **Network-Level Enforcement (Firewall Redirection and DHCP):** This is the most critical and effective layer of defense.  It should be implemented first.
2.  **Encrypted DNS Mitigation (AdGuard Home as DoH/DoT Resolver and Blocking):**  This is increasingly important as DoH/DoT adoption grows.
3.  **Monitoring and Detection:**  Essential for identifying bypass attempts and ensuring the effectiveness of other mitigation steps.
4.  **Client-Side Configuration:**  Important in managed environments, but less effective in unmanaged environments.
5.  **User Education:**  A valuable supplement to technical controls.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Bypass AdGuard Filtering via Direct DNS Requests" attack path represents a significant threat to the effectiveness of AdGuard Home.  By employing a layered defense approach that combines network-level enforcement, client-side configuration, encrypted DNS mitigation, monitoring, and user education, administrators can significantly reduce the risk of this attack and ensure that AdGuard Home provides the intended level of protection.  Regular review and updates to these mitigation strategies are essential to stay ahead of evolving threats. The most important steps are redirecting all DNS traffic through the firewall to AdGuard Home and configuring AdGuard Home to handle DoH/DoT requests.
