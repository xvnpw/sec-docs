# Deep Analysis: AdGuard Home API Authentication Bypass

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "API Authentication Bypass" threat to AdGuard Home, identify potential attack vectors, assess the impact, and propose concrete, actionable recommendations to mitigate the risk.  This goes beyond the initial threat model entry to provide a detailed, actionable plan for developers.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the AdGuard Home API, particularly the `/control/*` endpoints, and the authentication/authorization mechanisms protecting them.  It considers both vulnerabilities within AdGuard Home itself and vulnerabilities introduced by the integrating application's handling of API keys and interactions.  The analysis *excludes* threats related to physical access to the server running AdGuard Home or network-level attacks (e.g., MITM) that are not directly related to API authentication.  It *includes* vulnerabilities related to:

*   **API Key Management:**  Generation, storage, transmission, and revocation.
*   **Session Management:**  Cookie handling, session timeouts, and session fixation vulnerabilities.
*   **Authentication Logic:**  Validation of API keys, tokens, and other credentials.
*   **Authorization Logic:**  Ensuring that authenticated users/applications have only the permitted level of access.
*   **Input Validation:**  Preventing injection attacks that could bypass authentication.
*   **Error Handling:**  Ensuring that error messages do not leak sensitive information that could aid an attacker.
* **Rate Limiting and Brute-Force Protection:** Preventing attackers from guessing API keys or overwhelming the authentication system.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methods:

*   **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  Examining the AdGuard Home source code (available on GitHub) for potential vulnerabilities in the API authentication and authorization logic.  This will focus on areas like:
    *   `github.com/adguardteam/adguardhome/internal/aghos/control` (and sub-packages) - This is likely where the core API control logic resides.
    *   Files related to session management, authentication, and authorization.
    *   Any code handling API key validation or generation.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  Performing penetration testing against a live AdGuard Home instance (in a controlled environment) to attempt to bypass authentication.  This will include:
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Sending malformed requests to the API to identify unexpected behavior.
    *   **Authentication Bypass Attempts:**  Trying to access protected endpoints without valid credentials, with modified credentials, or with expired/revoked credentials.
    *   **Session Manipulation:**  Attempting session fixation, hijacking, and other session-related attacks.
    *   **Injection Attacks:**  Testing for SQL injection (if applicable), command injection, and other injection vulnerabilities that might affect authentication.
*   **Threat Modeling Review:**  Revisiting the existing threat model and expanding upon the "API Authentication Bypass" threat with the findings from the code review and dynamic analysis.
*   **Best Practices Review:**  Comparing the AdGuard Home implementation against industry best practices for API security (e.g., OWASP API Security Top 10, NIST guidelines).
*   **Documentation Review:** Examining AdGuard Home's official documentation for any security recommendations or warnings related to API usage.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat: API Authentication Bypass

### 2.1. Potential Attack Vectors

Based on the methodology, the following attack vectors are considered high priority for investigation:

1.  **Weak API Key Generation:** If AdGuard Home uses a predictable algorithm or a weak source of randomness for generating API keys, an attacker might be able to guess or brute-force valid keys.
2.  **Insecure API Key Storage (AdGuard Home):** If API keys are stored insecurely on the server (e.g., in plain text, in a world-readable file, or in a database without proper encryption), an attacker who gains access to the server could easily retrieve them.
3.  **Insecure API Key Storage (Client Application):**  Hardcoding API keys in the client application's code, storing them in insecure configuration files, or transmitting them over insecure channels (e.g., HTTP) are major vulnerabilities.
4.  **Session Fixation:** If AdGuard Home does not properly invalidate old session identifiers after authentication or allows an attacker to set a known session ID, an attacker could hijack a user's session.
5.  **Missing or Inadequate Session Timeouts:**  If sessions do not expire after a period of inactivity, an attacker could gain access to a user's account if they leave their session unattended.
6.  **Insufficient Input Validation:**  Vulnerabilities like SQL injection (if the API interacts with a database) or command injection could allow an attacker to bypass authentication checks by injecting malicious code into API requests.
7.  **Broken Authentication Logic:**  Flaws in the code that validates API keys or tokens (e.g., incorrect comparison logic, timing attacks) could allow an attacker to bypass authentication with crafted requests.
8.  **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  The absence of rate limiting on authentication attempts could allow an attacker to brute-force API keys or user credentials.
9.  **Information Leakage in Error Messages:**  Verbose error messages that reveal details about the authentication process (e.g., "Invalid API key format" vs. "Invalid API key") could provide valuable information to an attacker.
10. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** While primarily a web application vulnerability, if the API relies on cookies for authentication and lacks CSRF protection, an attacker could trick a logged-in user into making unintended API requests.
11. **Replay Attacks:** If the API does not implement nonce or timestamp-based protection, an attacker could capture a valid API request and replay it later to gain unauthorized access.
12. **Default Credentials:** If AdGuard Home ships with default credentials for the API and the user doesn't change them, an attacker could easily gain access.

### 2.2. Impact Analysis

A successful API authentication bypass would have a **critical** impact, as stated in the original threat model.  The specific consequences include:

*   **Complete System Compromise:** The attacker could gain full control over AdGuard Home's configuration.
*   **DNS Hijacking:**  The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites, leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or data theft.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker could potentially access sensitive information stored within AdGuard Home, such as DNS query logs, client information, and configured filters.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker could disable DNS filtering, rendering the network vulnerable to ads and trackers, or even make the DNS server unresponsive.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack could damage the reputation of the organization using AdGuard Home and the application integrating with it.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Depending on the data exposed and the applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), the organization could face fines and legal action.

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The following mitigation strategies are recommended, categorized for clarity:

**2.3.1. AdGuard Home-Side Mitigations (Code-Level):**

*   **Strong API Key Generation:**
    *   Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate API keys.  In Go, this would be `crypto/rand`.
    *   Ensure sufficient entropy for the generated keys (at least 128 bits, preferably 256 bits).
    *   Consider using a standard format like UUIDv4, which inherently provides strong randomness.
*   **Secure API Key Storage:**
    *   **Never** store API keys in plain text.
    *   Use a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with a unique salt for each key before storing them.  This protects against rainbow table attacks even if the database is compromised.
    *   Consider using a dedicated key management system (KMS) or hardware security module (HSM) for storing and managing API keys, especially in high-security environments.
*   **Robust Session Management:**
    *   Use secure, HTTP-only, and same-site cookies for session management.
    *   Generate session IDs using a CSPRNG.
    *   Implement strict session timeouts (both idle and absolute timeouts).
    *   Invalidate session IDs after logout or password changes.
    *   Implement protection against session fixation attacks (e.g., regenerating the session ID after authentication).
*   **Thorough Input Validation:**
    *   Validate all input received from API requests, including API keys, parameters, and headers.
    *   Use a whitelist approach (allow only known-good input) rather than a blacklist approach (block known-bad input).
    *   Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., using prepared statements for SQL queries, escaping special characters).
*   **Secure Authentication Logic:**
    *   Implement constant-time comparisons for API keys and tokens to prevent timing attacks.
    *   Regularly review and update the authentication code to address any newly discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a well-vetted authentication library or framework instead of implementing custom authentication logic.
*   **Rate Limiting and Brute-Force Protection:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on authentication attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   Consider using account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts (with appropriate safeguards to prevent denial-of-service attacks against legitimate users).
*   **Minimal Information Leakage:**
    *   Provide generic error messages that do not reveal details about the authentication process.
    *   Avoid logging sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords.
*   **CSRF Protection:**
    *   If the API relies on cookies for authentication, implement CSRF protection using tokens or other mechanisms.
*   **Replay Attack Prevention:**
    *   Implement nonce or timestamp-based protection to prevent replay attacks.
*   **No Default Credentials:**
    *   **Never** ship AdGuard Home with default API credentials.  Require users to set a strong API key during the initial setup.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Keep all dependencies up-to-date to patch any known security vulnerabilities. Use tools like `go mod tidy` and vulnerability scanners.

**2.3.2. Application-Side Mitigations:**

*   **Secure API Key Storage:**
    *   **Never** hardcode API keys in the application code.
    *   Use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store API keys.
    *   Encrypt the configuration file if it contains sensitive information.
    *   Consider using a secrets management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) to store and manage API keys.
*   **Secure API Key Transmission:**
    *   Always use HTTPS to communicate with the AdGuard Home API.
    *   Avoid passing API keys in URL parameters.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Grant the application only the minimum necessary permissions to access the AdGuard Home API.
*   **Input Validation (Proxying):**
    * If the application acts as a proxy to the AdGuard Home API, ensure it performs its own input validation *before* forwarding requests.  Do not rely solely on AdGuard Home's validation.
*   **Error Handling:**
    * Handle API errors gracefully and avoid exposing sensitive information to the user.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to suspicious API activity.

**2.3.3. Operational Mitigations:**

*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the AdGuard Home server on a separate network segment to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the AdGuard Home API to only authorized clients.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep AdGuard Home and its dependencies up-to-date to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
