Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Unauthorized Configuration Modification" threat for an application using AdGuard Home, following a structured approach:

## Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Configuration Modification in AdGuard Home

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1. Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Unauthorized Configuration Modification" threat, identify its potential attack vectors, assess its impact, and propose comprehensive mitigation strategies beyond the initial threat model description.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for developers and operators to significantly reduce the risk associated with this threat.

**1.2. Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the threat of unauthorized modification of the AdGuard Home configuration, encompassing:

*   **Attack Vectors:**  All plausible methods an attacker could use to gain unauthorized access and modify the configuration.
*   **Configuration Targets:**  Specific settings within AdGuard Home that, if modified, could lead to the described impacts.
*   **Impact Analysis:**  A detailed breakdown of the consequences of successful exploitation, considering various attack scenarios.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  A comprehensive set of preventative and detective controls, including technical and operational measures.
* **Vulnerability Analysis:** Examination of potential vulnerabilities in AdGuard Home that could be exploited.
* **Detection Strategies:** Methods to detect unauthorized configuration changes.

This analysis *excludes* threats unrelated to configuration modification (e.g., DDoS attacks against the AdGuard Home server itself, unless those attacks are a *precursor* to configuration modification).

**1.3. Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Threat Modeling Review:**  Leveraging the provided threat model as a starting point.
*   **Code Review (Conceptual):**  While we won't have direct access to the AdGuard Home source code for this exercise, we will conceptually analyze potential vulnerabilities based on the known functionality and common web application security pitfalls.  We will refer to the public GitHub repository for context.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Analyzing the official AdGuard Home documentation for configuration options, security recommendations, and known limitations.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  Searching for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities or similar attack patterns in comparable software.
*   **Best Practices Analysis:**  Applying industry-standard security best practices for web applications, network security, and configuration management.
*   **Scenario Analysis:**  Developing realistic attack scenarios to illustrate the threat and its impact.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Attack Vectors (Expanded):**

The initial threat model mentions a few attack vectors.  Here's a more exhaustive list:

*   **Weak/Default Credentials:**  The most common attack vector.  Attackers may use default credentials (if not changed) or attempt to brute-force or guess weak passwords.
*   **Credential Stuffing:**  Using credentials leaked from other breaches to attempt login.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  If the web interface uses insecure session management (e.g., predictable session IDs, lack of HTTPS, insufficient cookie security), an attacker could hijack a legitimate user's session.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  If a vulnerability exists in the web interface that allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript, they could potentially modify the configuration through the user's browser.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  If the web interface lacks proper CSRF protection, an attacker could trick a logged-in user into unknowingly executing actions that modify the configuration.
*   **API Exploitation:**  Directly interacting with the AdGuard Home API (`/control/`) without proper authentication or authorization.  This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the API endpoints themselves.
*   **Configuration File Access (Direct):**
    *   **Server Compromise:**  Gaining shell access to the server running AdGuard Home (e.g., through SSH vulnerabilities, other compromised services) and directly modifying `AdGuardHome.yaml`.
    *   **Misconfigured Permissions:**  If `AdGuardHome.yaml` has overly permissive file permissions, other users on the system (or compromised processes) could modify it.
    *   **Backup Exposure:**  If backups of `AdGuardHome.yaml` are stored insecurely (e.g., on a publicly accessible web server), an attacker could obtain them and potentially use them to craft attacks.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:**  If AdGuard Home is accessed over HTTP (not recommended), an attacker could intercept and modify traffic, including configuration changes.  Even with HTTPS, a compromised certificate authority or a misconfigured client could allow MitM.
*   **Software Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in AdGuard Home itself or its dependencies (e.g., the web server, Go runtime).
* **Social Engineering:** Tricking an administrator into making configuration changes or revealing credentials.

**2.2. Configuration Targets (Specific Settings):**

These are specific settings within AdGuard Home that an attacker would likely target:

*   **`upstream_dns`:**  Changing the upstream DNS servers to malicious ones, allowing the attacker to control DNS resolution and redirect traffic.
*   **`filters`:**  Adding, removing, or modifying filtering rules.  This could disable ad blocking, block legitimate sites, or allow malicious content.
*   **`clients`:**  Modifying client settings, potentially to bypass filtering or track specific users.
*   **`dns.ratelimit`:** Disabling or lowering the rate limit, making the server more vulnerable to DoS attacks.
*   **`tls`:**  Disabling or weakening TLS settings, making the DNS traffic vulnerable to interception.
*   **`bind_host` and `bind_port`:**  Changing the listening address and port, potentially exposing the service to unintended networks.
*   **`users`:** Adding new administrator accounts or modifying existing ones.
* **`querylog_enabled` and `statistics_enabled`:** Disabling logging and statistics to cover their tracks.

**2.3. Impact Analysis (Scenario-Based):**

Let's consider a few scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: DNS Hijacking:** An attacker changes the `upstream_dns` to their controlled server.  When users attempt to access legitimate websites (e.g., `bank.com`), the attacker's DNS server returns the IP address of a phishing site.  Users unknowingly enter their credentials on the fake site, leading to a data breach.
*   **Scenario 2: Targeted Blocking:** An attacker adds a filter rule to block access to a specific competitor's website.  Users within the network are unable to access the competitor's site, causing business disruption.
*   **Scenario 3: Malware Distribution:** An attacker modifies the filtering rules to allow access to known malware distribution sites.  Users are then more likely to be infected with malware.
*   **Scenario 4: Service Disruption:** An attacker modifies the configuration to disable filtering entirely or to introduce conflicting rules, causing DNS resolution to fail and disrupting internet access for all users.
*   **Scenario 5: Privacy Violation:** An attacker modifies the configuration to enable extensive query logging and disables anonymization features, allowing them to track users' browsing activity.

**2.4. Mitigation Strategies (Comprehensive):**

The initial threat model provides some mitigations.  Here's a more detailed and expanded list:

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all AdGuard Home accounts.  Use a password manager.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA (e.g., TOTP) for web interface access. This is a *critical* mitigation.
    *   **Account Lockout:**  Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  If possible, implement RBAC to limit the privileges of different users.  Not all users need full administrative access.
*   **Web Interface Security:**
    *   **HTTPS Only:**  Enforce HTTPS for all web interface access.  Use a valid, trusted TLS certificate.
    *   **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):**  Enable HSTS to prevent downgrade attacks.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong CSP to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **CSRF Protection:**  Ensure robust CSRF protection is in place for all state-changing actions.
    *   **Session Management:**  Use secure session management practices:
        *   Random, unpredictable session IDs.
        *   Short session timeouts.
        *   Secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure flags).
        *   Session invalidation on logout.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user input on the server-side to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the web interface, including penetration testing.
*   **Configuration File Security:**
    *   **File Permissions:**  Set the most restrictive file permissions possible for `AdGuardHome.yaml`.  Only the user running AdGuard Home should have read/write access.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Implement FIM (e.g., using tools like `AIDE`, `Tripwire`, or `osquery`) to detect unauthorized changes to the configuration file.
    *   **Secure Backups:**  Store backups of `AdGuardHome.yaml` securely, with appropriate access controls and encryption.
    *   **Change Management:**  Implement a formal change management process for all configuration changes.  This should include:
        *   Documentation of all changes.
        *   Approval workflows.
        *   Testing of changes in a non-production environment.
        *   Rollback plans.
*   **Network Security:**
    *   **Firewall:**  Restrict access to the AdGuard Home web interface and API to trusted networks/IP addresses using a firewall.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):**  Deploy an IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block malicious traffic targeting AdGuard Home.
    *   **VPN:**  Consider accessing the AdGuard Home interface only over a VPN for added security.
*   **System Security:**
    *   **Operating System Hardening:**  Harden the operating system running AdGuard Home, following best practices for security.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep AdGuard Home and all its dependencies (including the operating system) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run AdGuard Home with the least privileges necessary.  Avoid running it as root.
    *   **Containerization:**  Run AdGuard Home in a container (e.g., Docker) to isolate it from the host system and limit the impact of a potential compromise.
* **API Security:**
    * **Authentication:** Require authentication for all API access.
    * **Authorization:** Implement authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific API actions.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API requests to prevent abuse.
    * **Input Validation:** Validate all API input to prevent injection attacks.
* **Monitoring and Logging:**
    * **Audit Logging:** Enable detailed audit logging within AdGuard Home to track all configuration changes and access attempts.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate AdGuard Home logs with a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and alerting.
    * **Alerting:** Configure alerts for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts, unauthorized configuration changes, and unusual network traffic.

**2.5 Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Potential XSS/CSRF:** Web interfaces are always susceptible to these.  Regular penetration testing and code review are crucial.
*   **API Vulnerabilities:**  If the API doesn't properly validate input or enforce authorization, it could be exploited.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in libraries used by AdGuard Home could be exploited.  Regular updates are essential.
*   **Race Conditions:**  If configuration changes are not handled atomically, there might be race conditions that could lead to inconsistent states or be exploited.

**2.6 Detection Strategies:**

*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** As mentioned above, FIM is crucial for detecting changes to `AdGuardHome.yaml`.
*   **Audit Logs:** Regularly review AdGuard Home's audit logs for any suspicious activity, including:
    *   Failed login attempts.
    *   Successful logins from unexpected IP addresses.
    *   Configuration changes made outside of the normal change management process.
    *   Unusual API requests.
*   **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic to and from the AdGuard Home server for anomalies.
*   **SIEM Integration:** Integrate AdGuard Home logs with a SIEM system to correlate events and detect patterns of malicious activity.
