**Critical Node:** Compromise AdGuard Home's Filtering Configuration

**Description:** This critical node represents a significant security breach where an attacker gains the ability to modify AdGuard Home's content filtering rules. This allows the attacker to manipulate DNS resolution, potentially redirecting users to malicious websites, disabling protection against harmful content, or exfiltrating data.

**Attack Vectors:**

#### 4.1. Exploiting Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in the Web Interface or API.

**Description:** This attack vector involves bypassing the authentication mechanisms of AdGuard Home's web interface or API to gain unauthorized access.

**Prerequisites:**

* **Vulnerable Authentication Implementation:**  Weaknesses in the authentication logic, such as:
    * **Default Credentials:**  Using easily guessable or default usernames and passwords.
    * **SQL Injection:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in database queries used for authentication.
    * **Session Hijacking:**  Stealing or manipulating valid user session identifiers.
    * **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Repeatedly trying different username and password combinations.
    * **Insecure Password Storage:**  Storing passwords in plaintext or using weak hashing algorithms.
    * **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Absence of an additional layer of security beyond username and password.
* **Accessible Web Interface or API:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the AdGuard Home web interface or API endpoints.

**Attack Steps:**

1. **Identify Potential Vulnerabilities:** The attacker probes the web interface or API for authentication weaknesses. This might involve:
    * Trying default credentials.
    * Analyzing network traffic for session identifiers.
    * Attempting SQL injection through login forms or API parameters.
    * Launching brute-force attacks against the login endpoint.
2. **Exploit the Vulnerability:** Once a vulnerability is identified, the attacker exploits it to bypass authentication. This could involve:
    * Logging in with default credentials.
    * Injecting malicious SQL code to bypass authentication checks.
    * Stealing a valid session cookie.
    * Successfully guessing credentials through brute-force.
3. **Gain Unauthorized Access:**  With authentication bypassed, the attacker gains access to the administrative interface or API with elevated privileges.
4. **Modify Filtering Configuration:** The attacker navigates to the filtering configuration section and makes unauthorized changes, such as:
    * Whitelisting malicious domains.
    * Blacklisting legitimate domains.
    * Disabling filtering rules entirely.

**Potential Impact:**

* **Exposure to Malware and Phishing:** Users may be redirected to malicious websites, increasing the risk of malware infection and phishing attacks.
* **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers could redirect traffic through their own servers to intercept sensitive data.
* **Loss of Privacy:**  Blocking legitimate privacy-enhancing services or allowing tracking domains.
* **Reputational Damage:**  If the compromised AdGuard Home instance is publicly accessible, it could be used for malicious purposes, damaging the reputation of the owner.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Implement Strong Authentication Mechanisms:**
    * Enforce strong password policies.
    * Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    * Use secure password hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2).
    * Regularly review and update authentication logic.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other injection attacks.
    * Implement proper session management and prevent session hijacking.
    * Avoid storing sensitive information in cookies or local storage.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Identify and address potential authentication vulnerabilities proactively.
* **Rate Limiting and Account Lockout:**  Prevent brute-force attacks by limiting login attempts and locking accounts after multiple failed attempts.
* **Keep Software Up-to-Date:**  Apply security patches promptly to address known vulnerabilities in AdGuard Home and its dependencies.

#### 4.2. Exploiting Command Injection Vulnerabilities in the Web Interface or API.

**Description:** This attack vector involves injecting malicious commands into the system through vulnerable input fields or API parameters that are not properly sanitized.

**Prerequisites:**

* **Vulnerable Input Handling:**  The web interface or API must have functionalities that process user-supplied input without proper validation or sanitization. This could occur in:
    * Configuration settings that accept arbitrary values.
    * API endpoints that execute commands based on user input.
* **Insufficient Input Validation:** Lack of proper checks to ensure that user input conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious commands.
* **Execution of Unsanitized Input:** The application directly executes the user-provided input as system commands.

**Attack Steps:**

1. **Identify Injection Points:** The attacker identifies input fields or API parameters that might be vulnerable to command injection. This could involve:
    * Analyzing API documentation for parameters that seem to control system behavior.
    * Experimenting with different input values in web interface forms.
2. **Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker crafts payloads containing operating system commands that, when executed, will grant them control or allow them to modify the filtering configuration. Examples include:
    * Using shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&&`) to chain commands.
    * Using commands like `sed` or `echo` to modify configuration files.
3. **Inject the Payload:** The attacker submits the malicious payload through the vulnerable input field or API parameter.
4. **Command Execution:** The vulnerable application executes the injected command on the underlying operating system.
5. **Modify Filtering Configuration:** The attacker uses the executed commands to directly modify the AdGuard Home configuration file or use API calls (if the application exposes such functionality internally) to change filtering rules.

**Potential Impact:**

* **Complete System Compromise:** Command injection vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the AdGuard Home process, potentially leading to full control of the server.
* **Data Breach:** Attackers can use commands to access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored on the server.
* **Malware Installation:**  Attackers can download and execute malware on the server.
* **Denial of Service:**  Attackers can execute commands to crash the AdGuard Home service or the entire system.
* **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:**  Specifically, modifying filtering rules to disable protection or redirect traffic.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input before processing it. Use whitelisting techniques to allow only expected characters and formats.
* **Avoid Direct Command Execution:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly executing user-provided input as system commands.
* **Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements:**  For database interactions, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the AdGuard Home process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection attack.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Regularly review code for potential command injection vulnerabilities.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement CSP to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can sometimes be chained with command injection.

#### 4.3. Gaining Access to the AdGuard Home Configuration File Through Vulnerabilities.

**Description:** This attack vector involves exploiting vulnerabilities to directly access and modify the AdGuard Home configuration file, bypassing the intended administrative interface.

**Prerequisites:**

* **Vulnerable File Access Mechanisms:**  Weaknesses that allow unauthorized access to files on the server, such as:
    * **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting flaws in file path handling to access files outside the intended directory.
    * **Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerabilities:**  Tricking the application into including and potentially executing arbitrary local files.
    * **Insecure File Permissions:**  Configuration files having overly permissive access rights.
    * **Exploiting Other Vulnerabilities:**  Leveraging other vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, authentication bypass) to gain shell access and then access the configuration file.
* **Known Location of Configuration File:** The attacker needs to know the location and format of the AdGuard Home configuration file.

**Attack Steps:**

1. **Identify Vulnerabilities:** The attacker probes the system for vulnerabilities that could allow file access. This might involve:
    * Testing for path traversal vulnerabilities in URL parameters or file upload functionalities.
    * Looking for LFI vulnerabilities in include statements or file processing logic.
    * Scanning for open ports or services that might provide access to the file system.
2. **Exploit the Vulnerability:** Once a vulnerability is identified, the attacker exploits it to gain access to the configuration file. This could involve:
    * Using ".." sequences in file paths to navigate to the configuration file's directory.
    * Including the configuration file using an LFI vulnerability.
    * Gaining shell access through another vulnerability and navigating to the file.
3. **Access and Modify Configuration File:** The attacker reads the configuration file and modifies it to alter filtering rules. This could involve:
    * Directly editing the file content.
    * Replacing the entire configuration file with a malicious one.

**Potential Impact:**

* **Direct Manipulation of Filtering Rules:**  The attacker can directly alter the filtering configuration without going through the intended administrative interface.
* **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The configuration file might contain sensitive information, such as API keys or other credentials.
* **Persistence:**  Modifying the configuration file can provide a persistent foothold for the attacker.
* **Bypassing Security Controls:**  Direct file modification bypasses any security checks implemented in the web interface or API.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Secure File Handling Practices:**
    * Avoid constructing file paths based on user input without proper validation.
    * Implement strict access controls and permissions on configuration files.
    * Ensure that the web server and application have the minimum necessary permissions to access files.
* **Disable Directory Listing:**  Prevent attackers from browsing directories and discovering the location of configuration files.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Identify and address potential file access vulnerabilities.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the AdGuard Home process with the minimum necessary file system permissions.
* **Consider Encrypting Sensitive Configuration Data:**  If the configuration file contains sensitive information, consider encrypting it at rest.
