# Attack Surface Analysis for adguardteam/adguardhome

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured AdGuard Home Web Interface](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_adguard_home_web_interface.md)

*   **Description:** The AdGuard Home web interface, if exposed without proper authentication or authorization, allows unauthorized access to its settings and data.
*   **AdGuard Home Contribution:** AdGuard Home provides a web interface for configuration and monitoring, which, if not secured, becomes a direct entry point.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses the AdGuard Home web interface without credentials or by exploiting default credentials. They then disable filtering, modify blocklists to allow malicious domains, or change the upstream DNS server to a malicious one.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of DNS filtering, redirection of network traffic to malicious sites, exposure of DNS query logs, potential disruption of network services.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:** Ensure strong, unique passwords are set for the administrative user.
    *   **Developers/Users:** Enable HTTPS for the web interface using a valid TLS certificate.
    *   **Developers/Users:** Restrict access to the web interface to trusted networks or IP addresses.
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Implement robust authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication if feasible.
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in the Web Interface](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_the_web_interface.md)

*   **Description:**  The AdGuard Home web interface might be vulnerable to XSS, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of users accessing the interface.
*   **AdGuard Home Contribution:** The web interface handles user input and displays data, creating potential injection points if not properly sanitized.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a field within the AdGuard Home settings (e.g., a custom filtering rule). When an administrator views this setting, the script executes, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized modification of settings, information disclosure, potential for further attacks against administrators' machines.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Implement proper input sanitization and output encoding for all user-supplied data in the web interface.
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Regularly scan the codebase for XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [DNS Spoofing/Cache Poisoning Vulnerabilities in AdGuard Home's Resolver](./attack_surfaces/dns_spoofingcache_poisoning_vulnerabilities_in_adguard_home's_resolver.md)

*   **Description:** While AdGuard Home aims to prevent DNS spoofing, vulnerabilities in its own DNS resolution or caching mechanisms could be exploited to poison its cache.
*   **AdGuard Home Contribution:** AdGuard Home acts as a DNS resolver and maintains a cache of DNS records.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious DNS response that is accepted and cached by AdGuard Home. When users behind AdGuard Home try to access a legitimate website, they are instead directed to a malicious site controlled by the attacker.
*   **Impact:** Redirection of users to malicious websites, potential for phishing attacks, malware distribution, and data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Implement robust validation of DNS responses to prevent accepting forged or malicious records.
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Follow best practices for DNS cache security, including using randomized query IDs and source ports.
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Stay up-to-date with security advisories and patches related to DNS resolution libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** If the process for updating AdGuard Home or its filter lists is not secure, attackers could inject malicious updates.
*   **AdGuard Home Contribution:** AdGuard Home has a mechanism for updating its software and filter lists.
*   **Example:** An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack during an update, intercepting the download and replacing the legitimate update with a compromised version containing malware.
*   **Impact:** Installation of malicious software, complete compromise of the AdGuard Home instance and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Ensure updates are downloaded over HTTPS.
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Implement cryptographic signing and verification of updates to ensure authenticity and integrity.
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Provide a mechanism for users to verify the integrity of downloaded updates.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** AdGuard Home relies on third-party libraries and dependencies, which might contain security vulnerabilities.
*   **AdGuard Home Contribution:** AdGuard Home integrates and uses external code.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a library used for handling network protocols or web interface components. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability through AdGuard Home.
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the severity of the vulnerability in the dependency, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Regularly update all third-party dependencies to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Implement dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Developers (AdGuard Home):** Carefully evaluate the security posture of any new dependencies before integrating them.
