### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Path 1.1.4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

#### 4.1. Vulnerability Definition: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), also known as "one-click attack" or "session riding," is a type of web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions on a web application when they are authenticated. In a CSRF attack, a malicious website, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site when the user is authenticated.

CSRF attacks exploit the trust that a website has in a user's browser. If a user is authenticated to a web application (e.g., logged into AdGuard Home's admin panel), the browser will automatically send session cookies with every request to that application.  CSRF leverages this behavior by crafting malicious requests that are sent to the web application from the user's browser, effectively impersonating the authenticated user.

**Key characteristics of CSRF:**

*   **Relies on authenticated sessions:** CSRF attacks target actions that require user authentication.
*   **Exploits browser behavior:**  Browsers automatically attach session cookies to requests to the origin server.
*   **Attacker does not steal credentials:** The attacker does not need to know the user's username or password. They simply leverage the user's existing authenticated session.
*   **Victim's browser performs the action:** The malicious request originates from the victim's browser, making it appear legitimate to the web application.

#### 4.2. AdGuard Home Contextualization: CSRF Attack Vectors

In the context of AdGuard Home, a CSRF attack could target the administrative web interface.  An attacker could attempt to force an authenticated administrator to perform various actions, such as:

*   **Changing Configuration Settings:**
    *   Disabling DNS filtering or protection features.
    *   Modifying DNS server settings to point to malicious servers.
    *   Changing privacy settings, potentially weakening protection.
    *   Modifying general settings like the web interface port or allowed hosts.
*   **Managing Filter Lists:**
    *   Disabling or removing essential filter lists.
    *   Adding malicious filter lists that allow harmful domains.
    *   Modifying existing filter lists to bypass security rules.
*   **User Management (if applicable):**
    *   Creating new administrator accounts for the attacker.
    *   Deleting administrator accounts.
    *   Changing user passwords.
*   **Disabling or Restarting Services:**
    *   Potentially disrupting AdGuard Home's functionality.

**Common CSRF Attack Vectors against AdGuard Home:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker hosts a website containing malicious HTML code (e.g., forms, JavaScript) that, when visited by an authenticated AdGuard Home administrator, triggers requests to the AdGuard Home server.
*   **Malicious Link (Phishing):** An attacker sends a phishing email or message containing a link that, when clicked by an authenticated administrator, executes a malicious request to the AdGuard Home server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (if present):** If AdGuard Home is vulnerable to XSS, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into a page that, when viewed by an administrator, executes CSRF attacks. (While CSRF and XSS are distinct, XSS can be used to facilitate CSRF attacks).

#### 4.3. Attack Scenario: Disabling DNS Filtering via CSRF

Let's consider a specific attack scenario: **Disabling DNS Filtering in AdGuard Home via CSRF.**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   An attacker identifies that AdGuard Home's administrative interface is vulnerable to CSRF (lacks CSRF protection).
    *   The attacker knows the URL and parameters required to disable DNS filtering in AdGuard Home (e.g., through inspecting legitimate requests or documentation).
    *   A legitimate AdGuard Home administrator is currently logged into the administrative interface.

2.  **Attack Execution:**
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that, when submitted, sends a request to AdGuard Home to disable DNS filtering. This form could be designed to be submitted automatically using JavaScript.

    ```html
    <html>
    <body>
    <form action="https://your_adguard_home_ip:3000/settings/dns" method="POST" id="csrf-form">
        <input type="hidden" name="dns_filtering_enabled" value="false">
        <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="<!-- MISSING CSRF TOKEN - VULNERABLE -->">
        <!-- Other necessary parameters for the settings update -->
    </form>
    <script>
        document.getElementById('csrf-form').submit();
    </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    *   The attacker lures the authenticated AdGuard Home administrator to visit this malicious website (e.g., through phishing, social engineering, or embedding it in a compromised website).
    *   When the administrator visits the malicious page, the JavaScript automatically submits the form.
    *   The administrator's browser, being authenticated to AdGuard Home, automatically includes the session cookies in the request to `https://your_adguard_home_ip:3000/settings/dns`.
    *   If AdGuard Home does not have CSRF protection, it will process this request as if it came from the legitimate administrator and disable DNS filtering.

3.  **Outcome:**
    *   DNS filtering is disabled in AdGuard Home without the administrator's knowledge or consent.
    *   The network is now vulnerable to threats that DNS filtering would normally block (malware, phishing, etc.).
    *   The administrator might not immediately notice the change, leading to a prolonged period of vulnerability.

#### 4.4. Impact Assessment: Medium (Configuration changes, potential service disruption)

The impact of a successful CSRF attack on AdGuard Home is rated as **Medium** for the following reasons:

*   **Configuration Changes:** As demonstrated in the scenario, CSRF can be used to modify critical configuration settings. This can directly weaken the security posture of the network protected by AdGuard Home. Disabling filtering, changing DNS servers, or altering privacy settings can have significant security implications.
*   **Potential Service Disruption:** While not directly causing a complete service outage, CSRF could lead to service disruption in several ways:
    *   **Misconfiguration:**  Incorrect configuration changes could lead to unexpected behavior or instability in AdGuard Home's operation.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (indirect):**  If an attacker can manipulate settings to cause excessive logging or processing, it could indirectly impact performance and potentially lead to service degradation.
*   **Compromise of Security Features:**  CSRF can be used to disable or bypass security features that AdGuard Home is designed to provide, effectively negating its protective capabilities.
*   **Limited Direct Data Breach (Likely):**  CSRF typically does not directly lead to the exfiltration of sensitive data. However, by weakening security controls, it can create opportunities for other attacks that *could* lead to data breaches.

While the impact is not rated as "High" (like direct data theft or complete system compromise), the ability to manipulate critical security configurations and potentially disrupt service justifies a "Medium" impact rating.  The consequences can be significant for users relying on AdGuard Home for network protection.

#### 4.5. Risk Factor Justification:

*   **Likelihood: Medium:** CSRF vulnerabilities are relatively common in web applications, especially if developers are not actively implementing CSRF protection measures.  Exploiting CSRF requires social engineering to lure the administrator to a malicious site or link, which is a feasible attack vector. Therefore, the likelihood is considered **Medium**.
*   **Impact: Medium:** As discussed in section 4.4, the potential impact of configuration changes and service disruption is significant enough to warrant a **Medium** rating.
*   **Effort: Low:** Exploiting CSRF is generally considered **Low effort**.  Tools and techniques for crafting CSRF attacks are readily available.  Creating a malicious HTML page or crafting a malicious link is not technically complex.
*   **Skill Level: Beginner:**  Exploiting basic CSRF vulnerabilities requires **Beginner** level skills.  Understanding HTML forms, HTTP requests, and basic web security concepts is sufficient.  No advanced programming or hacking skills are necessary.
*   **Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium:**  Simple CSRF attacks can be **Low** in detection difficulty, especially if logging and monitoring are not specifically configured to detect suspicious configuration changes or unusual request patterns.  More sophisticated CSRF attacks or attempts to cover tracks might increase the detection difficulty to **Medium**.  However, without specific CSRF protection mechanisms in place, detection after the fact might be challenging.

#### 4.6. Mitigation Strategies: Implement CSRF tokens, SameSite cookie attribute.

The recommended mitigation strategies are effective and industry best practices for preventing CSRF attacks:

*   **4.6.1. CSRF Tokens (Synchronizer Tokens):**

    *   **Mechanism:** CSRF tokens, also known as synchronizer tokens, are the most robust and widely recommended defense against CSRF. They work by generating a unique, unpredictable, and secret token for each user session. This token is embedded in forms and/or requests that perform state-changing operations (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE).
    *   **Implementation in AdGuard Home:**
        1.  **Token Generation:**  When a user logs into the AdGuard Home admin panel, the server should generate a unique CSRF token and associate it with the user's session.
        2.  **Token Embedding:**  The server must embed this CSRF token in all forms and AJAX requests that perform sensitive actions within the admin interface. This can be done as a hidden form field or as a custom HTTP header.
        3.  **Token Validation:**  When the server receives a request, it must validate the presence and correctness of the CSRF token. The token in the request must match the token associated with the user's session.
        4.  **Token Regeneration (Optional):**  For enhanced security, tokens can be regenerated periodically or after each successful request.
    *   **Benefits:** CSRF tokens provide strong protection against CSRF attacks because the attacker cannot easily guess or obtain the valid token associated with a user's session.
    *   **Considerations:** Proper implementation is crucial. Tokens must be:
        *   **Unique per session:**  Each user session should have a different token.
        *   **Unpredictable:**  Tokens should be cryptographically random and difficult to guess.
        *   **Secret:**  Tokens should be kept confidential and not exposed in URLs or client-side JavaScript.
        *   **Properly validated:**  Server-side validation must be implemented correctly for every sensitive request.

*   **4.6.2. SameSite Cookie Attribute:**

    *   **Mechanism:** The `SameSite` cookie attribute is a browser security feature that controls when cookies are sent with cross-site requests. It helps mitigate CSRF attacks by restricting cookie transmission in certain cross-site scenarios.
    *   **Values:**
        *   **`Strict`:**  Cookies with `SameSite=Strict` are only sent with requests originating from the *same site* as the cookie. They are *not* sent with cross-site requests, even for top-level navigations (e.g., clicking a link from an external site). This provides the strongest CSRF protection but might break some legitimate cross-site functionalities.
        *   **`Lax`:** Cookies with `SameSite=Lax` are sent with "safe" cross-site requests, such as top-level navigations (GET requests) but *not* with cross-site requests initiated by forms or JavaScript (POST requests). This offers a good balance between security and usability and is often a recommended default.
        *   **`None`:** Cookies with `SameSite=None` are sent with both same-site and cross-site requests.  When using `SameSite=None`, the `Secure` attribute *must* also be set, meaning the cookie will only be sent over HTTPS.  Using `SameSite=None` without `Secure` is generally discouraged due to security implications.
    *   **Implementation in AdGuard Home:**
        *   Set the `SameSite` attribute for session cookies used for authentication in AdGuard Home.
        *   Consider using `SameSite=Lax` as a good starting point for session cookies. Evaluate if `Strict` is feasible without disrupting legitimate user workflows.
        *   Ensure that if `SameSite=None` is used (which is generally not recommended for CSRF protection in this context), the `Secure` attribute is also set to enforce HTTPS.
    *   **Benefits:** `SameSite` cookies provide a valuable layer of defense against CSRF, especially when used in conjunction with CSRF tokens. They are relatively easy to implement and are supported by modern browsers.
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   **Browser Compatibility:**  Ensure that the target browsers for AdGuard Home support the `SameSite` attribute. Older browsers might not support it, so relying solely on `SameSite` might not be sufficient for all users.
        *   **Functionality Impact:**  `SameSite=Strict` might break some legitimate cross-site functionalities.  Careful testing is needed to ensure it doesn't negatively impact user experience. `Lax` is generally less likely to cause issues.
        *   **Not a Complete Solution:** `SameSite` cookies are a strong defense but might not protect against all CSRF attack scenarios, especially in older browsers or complex cross-site interactions.  CSRF tokens are still considered the primary and most robust mitigation.

#### 4.7. Conclusion

The Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability (1.1.4) in AdGuard Home's administrative interface poses a **Medium risk** due to its potential to allow attackers to manipulate critical configuration settings and potentially disrupt service.  The vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit with low effort and beginner-level skills, and detection can be challenging without specific security measures in place.

Implementing **CSRF tokens** is the most effective and recommended mitigation strategy.  Complementing this with the **`SameSite` cookie attribute** for session cookies provides an additional layer of defense.
