### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1. Weak Admin Credentials

**Attack Tree Node:** 2.1. Weak Admin Credentials [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]

**Insight:** Default or easily guessable admin passwords allow attackers to gain full control.

**Breakdown:**

*   **Detailed Explanation of "Weak Admin Credentials":**
    *   **Default Credentials:** AdGuard Home, like many applications, might have default credentials set during initial installation or setup. If these default credentials are not changed by the user, they become publicly known or easily discoverable, making the system immediately vulnerable.
    *   **Easily Guessable Passwords:** Users may choose passwords that are simple, predictable, or based on personal information (e.g., "password," "123456," "admin," pet names, birthdays). Attackers can use password dictionaries, common password lists, and brute-force techniques to guess these weak passwords.
    *   **Reused Passwords:** Users often reuse passwords across multiple accounts. If a user's password for another, less secure service is compromised, attackers may attempt to use the same credentials to access AdGuard Home.
    *   **Short or Simple Passwords:** Passwords that are too short or lack complexity (e.g., only lowercase letters, no numbers or symbols) are significantly easier to crack through brute-force attacks.

*   **Exploitation Scenarios:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Admin Panel:** The most direct consequence is gaining access to the AdGuard Home admin panel. This grants the attacker complete control over the application's configuration.
    *   **Disabling Protection:** An attacker can disable ad blocking, tracker blocking, and other security features of AdGuard Home, effectively rendering it useless and exposing the network to threats.
    *   **Monitoring and Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can monitor DNS queries and network traffic passing through AdGuard Home, potentially gaining access to sensitive information about user browsing habits, visited websites, and even credentials transmitted over unencrypted connections (though AdGuard Home primarily deals with DNS).
    *   **Malicious Configuration Changes:** Attackers can modify DNS settings, redirect traffic to malicious servers, inject malicious filtering rules, or whitelist malicious domains. This can lead to:
        *   **Phishing Attacks:** Redirecting users to fake login pages or malicious websites.
        *   **Malware Distribution:** Injecting malware into web traffic or redirecting downloads to malicious files.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Misconfiguring DNS settings to disrupt network connectivity.
    *   **Network Pivoting (in some scenarios):** If AdGuard Home is deployed in a more complex network environment, an attacker gaining admin access could potentially use it as a pivot point to access other systems on the network, although this is less direct and depends on network configuration.
    *   **Reputation Damage:** If AdGuard Home is used in a public or semi-public setting (e.g., a community network), a compromise due to weak credentials can severely damage the reputation and trust in the service.

*   **Risk Assessment Breakdown:**

    *   **Likelihood: High**
        *   **Justification:**  Default credentials are a persistent issue across many applications. Users often overlook or postpone changing default passwords.  Furthermore, the human tendency to choose weak or easily remembered passwords is well-documented. The ease of guessing common passwords and the availability of automated brute-force tools contribute to the high likelihood.
    *   **Impact: High (Admin Access)**
        *   **Justification:** As detailed in the exploitation scenarios, gaining admin access to AdGuard Home provides complete control over its functionality and configuration. This can lead to significant security breaches, privacy violations, and disruption of service for users relying on AdGuard Home for protection. The potential for malicious configuration changes and data monitoring makes the impact severe.
    *   **Effort: Very Low**
        *   **Justification:** Attempting default credentials requires minimal effort. Password guessing or brute-forcing common passwords is also relatively low effort, especially with readily available tools and password lists. No specialized skills or resources are needed to attempt these attacks.
    *   **Skill Level: Beginner**
        *   **Justification:** Exploiting weak credentials requires very little technical expertise.  Trying default passwords or using basic password guessing tools can be done by individuals with minimal cybersecurity knowledge.
    *   **Detection Difficulty: Low**
        *   **Justification:**  Simple login attempts, especially with common usernames like "admin" and default passwords, are often not logged or actively monitored by default in many systems.  Even if logs exist, distinguishing legitimate failed login attempts from malicious ones can be challenging without proper security monitoring and alerting mechanisms.  Successful login with weak credentials is virtually undetectable without active session monitoring or anomaly detection, which is not typically a standard feature for basic web interfaces.

*   **Action: Enforce strong password policies, change default credentials immediately, consider password managers.**

    *   **Expanded and Actionable Mitigation Strategies:**

        1.  **Eliminate Default Credentials:**
            *   **Best Practice:**  AdGuard Home should **not** ship with any default administrative credentials.
            *   **Implementation:**  Force users to set a strong admin password during the initial setup process. This could be part of the first-time setup wizard or require password creation before the admin panel becomes accessible.

        2.  **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**
            *   **Password Complexity Requirements:** Implement password complexity requirements (minimum length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, symbols).  Clearly communicate these requirements to the user during password creation and modification.
            *   **Password Strength Meter:** Integrate a password strength meter into the password creation/change interface to provide real-time feedback to users and encourage them to choose strong passwords.
            *   **Password History:** Consider implementing password history to prevent users from reusing recently used passwords.

        3.  **Password Change Reminders/Prompts:**
            *   **Periodic Password Change Prompts:**  Optionally, implement a feature to periodically remind users to change their admin password (e.g., every 90 days). This should be configurable and not mandatory to avoid user frustration.
            *   **Prompt on First Login (if default was somehow missed):** If, in an edge case, default credentials are still present, immediately prompt the user to change them upon the first login to the admin panel.

        4.  **Account Lockout Policy:**
            *   **Implement Account Lockout:**  Implement an account lockout policy after a certain number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5-10 failed attempts). This will mitigate brute-force attacks.  The lockout duration should be reasonable (e.g., 5-15 minutes) and automatically lifted after the timeout.
            *   **Consider Captcha:** For public-facing instances (if applicable and intended), consider implementing CAPTCHA after a few failed login attempts to further deter automated brute-force attacks.

        5.  **Security Auditing and Logging:**
            *   **Log Failed Login Attempts:**  Implement robust logging of failed login attempts, including timestamps, usernames (if provided), and source IP addresses. This information is crucial for detecting and investigating potential brute-force attacks.
            *   **Log Successful Admin Logins:** Log successful admin logins as well, to provide an audit trail of administrative actions.
            *   **Consider Alerting:**  For advanced deployments, consider integrating with alerting systems to notify administrators of suspicious login activity (e.g., multiple failed login attempts from the same IP).

        6.  **Promote Password Manager Usage:**
            *   **Documentation and Guidance:**  In documentation and setup guides, actively recommend and guide users towards using password managers to generate and store strong, unique passwords for AdGuard Home and all their online accounts.
            *   **Consider "Remember Me" Feature (with caution):** If a "Remember Me" feature is implemented for the admin panel, ensure it is implemented securely (e.g., using secure cookies with appropriate flags) and clearly communicate the security implications to the user.

        7.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
            *   **Include Password Security in Audits:**  During regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically test the strength of password policies and the effectiveness of implemented mitigation measures against weak credentials.

**Conclusion:**

The "Weak Admin Credentials" attack path is a critical vulnerability in AdGuard Home due to its high likelihood and significant impact.  The ease of exploitation by even beginner attackers and the low detection difficulty further emphasize the urgency of addressing this issue.  By implementing the expanded mitigation strategies outlined above, the development team can significantly strengthen the security of AdGuard Home, protect users from unauthorized access, and maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of the application.  Prioritizing the elimination of default credentials and enforcing strong password policies are crucial first steps in mitigating this high-risk attack path.
