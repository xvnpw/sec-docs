# Threat Model Analysis for adguardteam/adguardhome

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of AdGuard Home](./threats/misconfiguration_of_adguard_home.md)

An attacker might exploit incorrectly configured settings in AdGuard Home. This could involve leveraging weak or default settings, or exploiting overly permissive configurations to bypass filtering, redirect traffic, or gain unauthorized access. For example, an attacker could exploit an open resolver configuration to perform DNS amplification attacks or DNS cache poisoning.

## Threat: [Insecure Access to AdGuard Home Management Interface](./threats/insecure_access_to_adguard_home_management_interface.md)

An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the AdGuard Home web interface if it is not properly secured. This could be achieved through brute-force attacks on weak credentials, exploiting known vulnerabilities in the web interface (if any), or social engineering. Once accessed, the attacker can modify configurations, disable protection, exfiltrate logs, or take control of the AdGuard Home instance.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Control within AdGuard Home](./threats/insufficient_access_control_within_adguard_home.md)

If AdGuard Home's internal access control mechanisms are weak or misconfigured, unauthorized users or services within the same network or system could gain elevated privileges. An attacker who has already gained some level of access (e.g., to the server running AdGuard Home) could exploit weak internal access controls to escalate privileges within AdGuard Home and modify critical settings.

## Threat: [Failure to Regularly Update AdGuard Home](./threats/failure_to_regularly_update_adguard_home.md)

Running outdated versions of AdGuard Home exposes the system to known vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or compromise the integrity of the AdGuard Home instance. Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in older versions can be easily exploited using readily available tools.
