## Deep Analysis: Insecure Configuration File Permissions in AdGuard Home

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Insecure Configuration File Permissions (Sensitive Data Exposure)" attack surface in AdGuard Home, as identified in the provided description.

### 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the attack surface of "Insecure Configuration File Permissions" in AdGuard Home. This includes:

*   Understanding the potential risks and impact associated with this vulnerability.
*   Identifying specific sensitive data potentially exposed through configuration files.
*   Analyzing the mechanisms by which insecure permissions can lead to exploitation.
*   Developing comprehensive mitigation strategies for both AdGuard Home developers and users to effectively address this attack surface.
*   Providing actionable recommendations to enhance the security posture of AdGuard Home deployments.

### 2. Scope of Analysis

This analysis focuses specifically on the following aspects related to insecure configuration file permissions in AdGuard Home:

*   **Configuration Files:**  Primarily targeting `AdGuardHome.yaml` as the main configuration file, but also considering any other files used by AdGuard Home to store sensitive configuration data (e.g., TLS certificate keys, database connection strings if applicable, though `AdGuardHome.yaml` is the primary focus).
*   **Sensitive Data:** Identifying the types of sensitive information stored within these configuration files, such as administrator credentials, API keys, and potentially other security-relevant settings.
*   **File Permissions:** Examining the default file permissions applied to configuration files during installation and the potential for misconfiguration leading to overly permissive access.
*   **Local Attack Scenario:**  Focusing on the scenario where a local attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive data due to insecure file permissions on the server hosting AdGuard Home.
*   **Impact Assessment:** Evaluating the potential consequences of successful exploitation, including unauthorized access, account takeover, and data compromise.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Developing and detailing specific mitigation steps for both developers (within the AdGuard Home application) and users (in their deployment and configuration practices).

This analysis will **not** explicitly cover:

*   Remote exploitation of file permissions vulnerabilities (as file permissions are inherently a local system security concern). However, we will briefly touch upon how insecure file permissions can amplify the impact of other potential remote vulnerabilities.
*   Detailed code review of AdGuard Home source code. The analysis will be based on publicly available information, documentation, and general security principles.
*   Specific operating system level security hardening beyond file permissions directly related to AdGuard Home configuration files.

### 3. Methodology

The methodology employed for this deep analysis involves the following steps:

1.  **Information Gathering:**
    *   Reviewing AdGuard Home official documentation, including installation guides, configuration manuals, and security best practices (if available).
    *   Analyzing the structure of `AdGuardHome.yaml` (based on documentation and example configurations) to identify potential sensitive data fields.
    *   Researching common practices for storing sensitive data in configuration files and secure file permission management in similar applications.
    *   Searching for publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities or discussions related to AdGuard Home configuration file security.

2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Insecure Configuration File Permissions

#### 4.1. Sensitive Data in Configuration Files

AdGuard Home, like many applications, relies on configuration files to store settings and parameters necessary for its operation.  Based on common practices and the description provided, the `AdGuardHome.yaml` file is highly likely to contain sensitive information, including but not limited to:

*   **Administrator Credentials:**  Username and password used to access the AdGuard Home web interface for administration.  These are critical for controlling all aspects of AdGuard Home.
*   **API Keys:**  Keys used for programmatic access to the AdGuard Home API. These keys allow for automation, integration with other systems, and potentially full control over AdGuard Home functionalities.
*   **TLS/SSL Certificate Paths and Private Keys (Potentially):** While best practices dictate storing private keys separately and securely, configuration files might contain paths to these keys. In less secure scenarios, or due to misconfiguration, private keys themselves might inadvertently be included in configuration files (though this is less likely in well-designed applications, it's a potential risk to consider in a broad analysis).
*   **Database Credentials (If Applicable):** If AdGuard Home uses an external database or stores sensitive data in a database configured via `AdGuardHome.yaml`, database credentials could be present.
*   **Integration Keys/Tokens:**  If AdGuard Home integrates with external services (e.g., DNS providers, logging services), API keys or tokens for these services might be stored in the configuration.

**Crucially, if this sensitive data is stored in plaintext or weakly protected within `AdGuardHome.yaml`, it becomes a prime target for attackers if file permissions are not properly secured.**

#### 4.2. Default File Permissions and Misconfiguration

*   **Default Permissions:** The default file permissions assigned to `AdGuardHome.yaml` during installation are critical. If the installation process or the operating system defaults result in overly permissive permissions (e.g., world-readable - `644` or worse), the vulnerability is immediately present. The likelihood of insecure defaults depends on the installation method, operating system, and how AdGuard Home's installation scripts are designed.
*   **User Misconfiguration:** Even if default permissions are reasonably secure, users can easily misconfigure them. Common scenarios include:
    *   **Accidental `chmod 777`:**  Users might mistakenly apply overly permissive permissions while troubleshooting or during system administration tasks.
    *   **Incorrect Deployment Scripts:** Automated deployment scripts might inadvertently set incorrect permissions.
    *   **Lack of Awareness:** Users might not be aware of the security implications of file permissions and fail to secure configuration files properly.
    *   **Shared Hosting/Multi-user Environments:** In environments where AdGuard Home is hosted on a shared server, ensuring proper file permissions becomes even more critical to prevent access from other users on the same system.

#### 4.3. Attack Scenario: Local Privilege Escalation and Data Exposure

1.  **Local Attacker Access:** A local attacker gains access to the server hosting AdGuard Home. This could be through various means, such as:
    *   Compromising a less privileged user account on the system.
    *   Exploiting a vulnerability in another service running on the same server.
    *   Physical access to the server.

2.  **File Permission Check:** The attacker checks the file permissions of `AdGuardHome.yaml`. They discover that the file is readable by users other than the AdGuard Home process user and administrators (e.g., world-readable or group-readable where the attacker is a member of that group).

3.  **Sensitive Data Extraction:** The attacker reads the contents of `AdGuardHome.yaml`. They successfully extract sensitive information, such as:
    *   Administrator username and password.
    *   API keys.

4.  **Account Takeover and System Compromise:**
    *   **Web Interface Access:** Using the extracted administrator credentials, the attacker logs into the AdGuard Home web interface with full administrative privileges. They can now:
        *   Modify DNS settings, potentially redirecting traffic to malicious servers.
        *   Change filtering rules, disabling protection or injecting malicious filters.
        *   Access logs and potentially sensitive network traffic information.
        *   Modify other configuration settings, potentially causing denial of service or further compromising the system.
    *   **API Access:** Using the API keys, the attacker can programmatically control AdGuard Home, achieving the same level of control as through the web interface, enabling automated attacks and integration with other malicious tools.

5.  **Wider Impact:**  Compromise of AdGuard Home can have significant impact:
    *   **Loss of Privacy:** DNS queries and browsing activity might be logged and exposed to the attacker.
    *   **Network Disruption:** DNS resolution can be manipulated, leading to denial of service or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could inject malicious filtering rules to allow malware distribution or block legitimate security updates.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** If AdGuard Home is used in an organizational setting, a security breach can lead to reputational damage and loss of trust.

#### 4.4. Risk Severity Assessment

As indicated in the initial description, the risk severity is **High**. This is justified because:

*   **High Likelihood:** Insecure default permissions or user misconfiguration are reasonably likely scenarios, especially if users are not explicitly guided to secure file permissions.
*   **High Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to full compromise of AdGuard Home, potentially exposing sensitive data, disrupting network services, and enabling further malicious activities.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The core vulnerability is direct exposure of sensitive credentials and API keys, which are critical for security.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

##### 4.5.1. Developer-Side Mitigations (AdGuard Home Developers)

*   **Secure Storage of Sensitive Data:**
    *   **Encryption:**  Encrypt sensitive data within `AdGuardHome.yaml` or consider moving sensitive data storage to a more secure mechanism outside of plaintext configuration files. Use robust encryption algorithms and proper key management practices.
    *   **Secure Key Storage:** Explore using operating system-provided secure key storage mechanisms (e.g., Credential Manager on Windows, Keychain on macOS, Secret Service API on Linux) to store sensitive credentials instead of directly in configuration files.
    *   **Hashing:** At a minimum, hash passwords using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with salt. However, hashing API keys is less effective for preventing unauthorized access if the hash itself is exposed.
*   **Default File Permissions:**
    *   **Restrictive Defaults:** Ensure that the installation process sets the most restrictive reasonable default file permissions for `AdGuardHome.yaml` and other configuration files.  Ideally, permissions should be set to be readable only by the AdGuard Home process user and the system administrator (e.g., `600` or `640`).
    *   **Documentation and Guidance:** Clearly document the recommended file permissions in installation guides, security best practices documentation, and potentially within the application itself (e.g., during initial setup or in a security dashboard).
    *   **Permission Check on Startup:** Consider implementing a check within AdGuard Home on startup to verify the file permissions of `AdGuardHome.yaml`. If permissions are detected as overly permissive, issue a warning message in the logs and potentially in the web interface, guiding the user to correct them.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the AdGuard Home process runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage if the process itself is compromised.
*   **Configuration File Security Audits:** Regularly review the structure and security of configuration files as part of the development process to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

##### 4.5.2. User-Side Mitigations (AdGuard Home Users)

*   **Restrict File Permissions:** **Immediately after installation and periodically thereafter, users MUST ensure that `AdGuardHome.yaml` and any other configuration files have restrictive file permissions.**  The recommended permissions are typically `600` (readable and writable only by the owner) or `640` (readable by owner and group, writable by owner).  The owner should be the user account under which the AdGuard Home process runs.
    *   **Example command (Linux/macOS):** `sudo chmod 600 /opt/adguardhome/AdGuardHome.yaml` (adjust path as needed).
    *   **Example command (Linux/macOS - if AdGuard Home runs as user `adguard`):** `sudo chown adguard:adguard /opt/adguardhome/AdGuardHome.yaml` followed by `sudo chmod 600 /opt/adguardhome/AdGuardHome.yaml`
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodically review file permissions, system configurations, and AdGuard Home settings to ensure ongoing security.
*   **Follow Security Best Practices:** Implement general server hardening best practices for the system hosting AdGuard Home, including:
    *   Keeping the operating system and all software up to date with security patches.
    *   Using strong passwords and practicing good password management.
    *   Limiting access to the server to only authorized users.
    *   Implementing firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems.
*   **Awareness and Training:** Users should be educated about the importance of file permissions and the security risks associated with insecure configurations.

### 5. Conclusion

Insecure configuration file permissions represent a significant attack surface in AdGuard Home, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure and full system compromise.  Both developers and users have crucial roles to play in mitigating this risk. Developers should prioritize secure storage of sensitive data and ensure secure default configurations. Users must take responsibility for properly securing their deployments by setting restrictive file permissions and following security best practices. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the risk associated with this attack surface can be significantly reduced, enhancing the overall security posture of AdGuard Home deployments.
