## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Authentication Bypass [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__authentication_bypass__high_risk_path_.md)

*   Insight: Enumerate common default credentials, brute-force weak passwords, exploit authentication flaws (if any).
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High (Admin Access)
        *   Effort: Low to Medium
        *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   Action: Enforce strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, regular security audits.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3__cross-site_scripting__xss___high_risk_path_.md)

*   Insight: Inject malicious scripts via vulnerable input fields to execute in admin's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or further attacks.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Medium to High (Session Hijacking, Admin Actions)
        *   Effort: Low to Medium
        *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   Action: Implement strict input validation and output encoding, use Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4__cross-site_request_forgery__csrf___high_risk_path_.md)

*   Insight: Force authenticated admin to perform actions against their will (e.g., changing settings, disabling filters).
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Medium (Configuration changes, potential service disruption)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Beginner
        *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
        *   Action: Implement CSRF tokens, SameSite cookie attribute.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.7. Remote Code Execution (RCE) - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_7__remote_code_execution__rce__-__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   Insight: Exploit critical vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the AdGuard Home server.
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: Critical (Full System Compromise)
        *   Effort: High
        *   Skill Level: Advanced
        *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
        *   Action: Keep AdGuard Home updated, apply security patches promptly, conduct regular vulnerability scanning.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Weak Admin Credentials [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__weak_admin_credentials__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   Insight: Default or easily guessable admin passwords allow attackers to gain full control.
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: High (Admin Access)
        *   Effort: Very Low
        *   Skill Level: Beginner
        *   Detection Difficulty: Low
        *   Action: Enforce strong password policies, change default credentials immediately, consider password managers.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Publicly Exposed Admin Interface [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__publicly_exposed_admin_interface__high_risk_path_.md)

*   Insight: Admin interface accessible from the public internet increases attack surface.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Medium (Increased attack surface, facilitates other attacks)
        *   Effort: Very Low
        *   Skill Level: Beginner
        *   Detection Difficulty: Low
        *   Action: Restrict admin interface access to trusted networks (e.g., VPN, internal network), use firewall rules.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Bypassing Application Security Controls via DNS Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__bypassing_application_security_controls_via_dns_manipulation__high_risk_path_.md)

*   Insight: If the application relies on DNS-based security (e.g., domain whitelisting), an attacker who compromises AdGuard Home can manipulate DNS responses to bypass these controls.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Medium to High (Bypassing security controls, unauthorized access)
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to High
        *   Action: Implement defense-in-depth, don't solely rely on DNS for critical security controls, use application-level security measures.
