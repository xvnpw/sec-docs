## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strong Authentication for Web Interface](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strong_authentication_for_web_interface.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strong Authentication for Web Interface (AdGuard Home)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Password Complexity within AdGuard Home:** Utilize AdGuard Home's user management features to ensure strong passwords are required for all administrative accounts. This includes enforcing password length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) during account creation and password changes.
    2.  **Disable Default/Weak Credentials in AdGuard Home:**  During initial AdGuard Home setup, explicitly change any default administrative usernames and passwords. Ensure no accounts are left with easily guessable credentials.
    3.  **Explore Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Options (if available in future AdGuard Home versions):**  Monitor AdGuard Home release notes for potential future MFA support. If implemented, enable MFA for administrative accounts to add an extra layer of security.
    4.  **Regular Password Rotation Policy (External to AdGuard Home, but related to its users):**  Establish an organizational policy for regular password rotation for AdGuard Home administrative accounts, even if AdGuard Home doesn't directly enforce it.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from guessing passwords through repeated attempts against the AdGuard Home web interface.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of attackers using compromised credentials from other services to gain access to AdGuard Home.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to AdGuard Home Configuration (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from modifying AdGuard Home settings via the web interface.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: **High** risk reduction.
    *   Credential Stuffing: **High** risk reduction.
