## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] Exploit AdGuard Home Web Interface Vulnerabilities**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_adguard_home_web_interface_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the AdGuard Home web interface code (e.g., XSS, command injection).
    *   Exploiting logical flaws in the web application logic.
    *   Leveraging insecure handling of user input.
    *   Bypassing security controls implemented in the web interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] Gain Unauthorized Access to AdGuard Home Admin Panel**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__gain_unauthorized_access_to_adguard_home_admin_panel.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **Brute-force Weak Credentials:** Attempting to guess usernames and passwords through repeated login attempts.
    *   **Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (if any):**  Leveraging a flaw in the authentication mechanism to bypass login requirements without valid credentials.
    *   **Exploit Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to Change Credentials:**  Tricking an authenticated administrator into making a request that changes their password without their knowledge.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Brute-force Weak Credentials**](./attack_tree_paths/brute-force_weak_credentials.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (if any)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_bypass_vulnerability__if_any_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to Change Credentials**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__to_change_credentials.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] Execute Malicious Actions via Admin Panel**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__execute_malicious_actions_via_admin_panel.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Using the legitimate administrative interface to perform unauthorized actions after gaining access.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] Modify DNS Settings to Redirect Application Traffic**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__modify_dns_settings_to_redirect_application_traffic.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Changing the upstream DNS servers used by AdGuard Home to malicious servers controlled by the attacker.
    *   Adding custom DNS records that override legitimate DNS entries for the application's domain.
    *   Modifying existing DNS records to point to attacker-controlled infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Redirect Application to Phishing Site**](./attack_tree_paths/redirect_application_to_phishing_site.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Redirecting user traffic intended for the legitimate application to a fake website designed to steal credentials or other sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Redirect Application to Malicious Content**](./attack_tree_paths/redirect_application_to_malicious_content.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Redirecting user traffic to websites hosting malware, exploit kits, or other harmful content that can compromise the user's device.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Disable Security Features**](./attack_tree_paths/disable_security_features.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Using the administrative interface to disable features like DNSSEC validation, making the application vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks.
    *   Disabling query logging to hinder detection and forensic analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] Exploit Underlying Operating System Vulnerabilities via AdGuard Home**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_underlying_operating_system_vulnerabilities_via_adguard_home.md)

*   Attack Vectors:

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Successfully exploiting a vulnerability that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting AdGuard Home.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerabilities in AdGuard Home Dependencies**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_adguard_home_dependencies.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Identifying and exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or components used by AdGuard Home.
