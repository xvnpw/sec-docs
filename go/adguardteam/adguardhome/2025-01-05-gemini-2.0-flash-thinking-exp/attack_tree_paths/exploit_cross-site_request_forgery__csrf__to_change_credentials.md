## Deep Analysis: Exploit Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to Change Credentials in AdGuard Home

This analysis delves into the attack path "Exploit Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to Change Credentials" within the context of AdGuard Home. We will explore the mechanics of this attack, its potential impact, and provide recommendations for mitigation.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

This attack leverages the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability to trick a logged-in administrator of AdGuard Home into unknowingly executing actions that change their account credentials (username and/or password).

**Phase 1: Vulnerability Identification and Exploitation Planning**

* **Attacker Goal:** To gain unauthorized access to the AdGuard Home instance by changing the administrator's credentials.
* **Target:** The AdGuard Home web interface, specifically the functionality responsible for updating user credentials.
* **Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability is the lack of sufficient CSRF protection on the credential change functionality. This means the application doesn't adequately verify if the request to change credentials originated from the legitimate user's session within the AdGuard Home interface.
* **Attacker Actions:**
    1. **Identify the Target Endpoint:** The attacker needs to identify the specific URL and HTTP method (likely POST) used by AdGuard Home to update user credentials. This can be done by:
        * **Analyzing the AdGuard Home web interface:** Inspecting the HTML source code of the settings page where credentials are changed, looking for form submissions.
        * **Intercepting legitimate requests:** Using browser developer tools or a proxy while a legitimate administrator changes their credentials to observe the request details.
        * **Reverse engineering:** Examining the AdGuard Home codebase (if accessible) to understand the credential update logic.
    2. **Determine Required Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the names of the form fields or API parameters required to change the credentials (e.g., `username`, `password`, `new_password`, `confirm_password`, etc.). This information is usually evident from the identified endpoint.
    3. **Craft the Malicious Request:** The attacker constructs a malicious HTTP request that mimics a legitimate credential change request. This request will contain the necessary parameters to set new credentials chosen by the attacker. Crucially, this request will be crafted to be executed by the victim's browser while they are authenticated to AdGuard Home.
    4. **Choose an Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to deliver the malicious request to the victim's browser. Common methods include:
        * **Malicious Website:** Embedding the malicious request within a hidden form or an `<img>` tag on a website controlled by the attacker. When the victim visits this website while logged into AdGuard Home, the browser will automatically send the forged request.
        * **Phishing Email:** Sending an email containing a link that, when clicked, executes the malicious request. This might involve a seemingly innocuous link that redirects to the forged request.
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If an XSS vulnerability exists on another website the victim trusts, the attacker could inject malicious JavaScript to trigger the forged request. While not directly part of this CSRF path, it can be a related attack vector.

**Phase 2: Victim Interaction and Request Execution**

* **Victim State:** The victim is a legitimate administrator of the AdGuard Home instance and is currently logged into the web interface.
* **Victim Action:** The victim unknowingly interacts with the attacker's chosen attack vector (visits the malicious website, clicks the phishing link, etc.).
* **Browser Action:** The victim's browser, because they are authenticated to AdGuard Home (session cookies are present), automatically includes the session cookies when sending the forged request to the AdGuard Home server.
* **AdGuard Home Server Processing:** The AdGuard Home server receives the request. Due to the lack of proper CSRF protection, the server incorrectly assumes the request is legitimate and originates from the authenticated user's session. It then processes the request and updates the administrator's credentials to the values specified in the malicious request.

**Phase 3: Attack Outcome and Impact**

* **Successful Credential Change:** The attacker has successfully changed the administrator's credentials without their knowledge or consent.
* **Account Takeover:** The attacker can now log in to the AdGuard Home instance using the newly set credentials.
* **Impact:** The consequences of a successful CSRF attack leading to credential change can be severe:
    * **Loss of Control:** The legitimate administrator is locked out of their AdGuard Home instance.
    * **Malicious Configuration Changes:** The attacker can modify AdGuard Home settings, potentially disabling filtering, adding malicious blocklists/allowlists, or changing DNS settings, compromising the network's security and privacy.
    * **Data Manipulation/Exfiltration:** Depending on AdGuard Home's functionalities in the future, an attacker with administrative access could potentially manipulate or exfiltrate sensitive data.
    * **Denial of Service:** The attacker could configure AdGuard Home to disrupt network services or cause a denial of service.
    * **Further Attacks:** The compromised AdGuard Home instance could be used as a launchpad for further attacks within the network.

**Technical Details and Example Scenario:**

Let's assume the AdGuard Home credential change form has the following structure:

```html
<form method="POST" action="/settings/users/update">
  <input type="text" name="username" value="current_username">
  <input type="password" name="password">
  <input type="password" name="new_password">
  <input type="password" name="confirm_password">
  <button type="submit">Change Password</button>
</form>
```

An attacker could craft a malicious HTML page containing the following:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://your_adguard_home_domain/settings/users/update" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="username" value="admin">
      <input type="hidden" name="password" value="current_password_might_be_optional">
      <input type="hidden" name="new_password" value="attacker_password">
      <input type="hidden" name="confirm_password" value="attacker_password">
      <input type="submit" value="Click Me for a Prize!">
    </form>
    <script>
      document.forms[0].submit(); // Automatically submit the form
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

If a logged-in administrator visits this page, their browser will automatically submit the form to the AdGuard Home server. If CSRF protection is absent, the server will process this request and change the administrator's password to "attacker_password".

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent this CSRF attack, the development team should implement robust CSRF protection mechanisms:

* **Synchronizer Token Pattern (CSRF Tokens):** This is the most common and effective defense.
    * **Implementation:** The server generates a unique, unpredictable token for each user session. This token is included in the credential change form (as a hidden field) and stored in the user's session.
    * **Verification:** When the server receives a credential change request, it verifies the presence and validity of the CSRF token against the token stored in the user's session. If they don't match, the request is rejected.
    * **AdGuard Home Implementation:**  The development team should add a hidden input field containing the CSRF token to the credential change form and implement server-side logic to validate this token on submission.

* **SameSite Cookie Attribute:** This browser security mechanism helps prevent CSRF attacks by controlling when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
    * **Implementation:** Setting the `SameSite` attribute of the session cookie to `Strict` or `Lax` can significantly reduce the risk of CSRF. `Strict` is generally recommended for sensitive applications like AdGuard Home.
    * **Considerations:**  Ensure compatibility with older browsers. `Lax` offers a balance between security and usability but might not fully protect against all CSRF vectors.

* **Double-Submit Cookie Pattern:** This pattern involves setting a random value in both a cookie and a form field. The server verifies that both values match.
    * **Implementation:** The server sets a random value in a cookie. The client-side JavaScript reads this cookie value and includes it as a hidden field in the credential change form. The server then compares the cookie value with the form field value.

* **User Interaction for Sensitive Actions:** For highly sensitive actions like changing credentials, consider adding an extra layer of confirmation:
    * **Re-authentication:** Require the user to re-enter their current password before allowing the password change.
    * **Confirmation Step:** Implement a two-step process where the user confirms the password change on a separate page or through a confirmation email.

* **Input Validation:** While not a direct CSRF defense, ensure proper input validation on the server-side to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities that could be combined with CSRF.

* **Security Headers:** Implement security headers like `Referrer-Policy` and `Content-Security-Policy` to further enhance security and potentially mitigate some CSRF attack vectors.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

1. **Prioritize CSRF Protection:** Implementing robust CSRF protection on all state-changing endpoints, especially those related to user management and settings, is crucial.
2. **Implement Synchronizer Tokens:** This is the recommended approach for AdGuard Home. Ensure proper generation, storage, and validation of tokens.
3. **Set SameSite Cookie Attribute:** Configure the session cookie with the `SameSite=Strict` attribute.
4. **Consider Double-Submit Cookie as a Backup:**  While Synchronizer Tokens are preferred, Double-Submit Cookies can provide an additional layer of defense.
5. **Evaluate User Interaction Enhancements:** Consider adding re-authentication or confirmation steps for credential changes.
6. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including CSRF.
7. **Security Awareness Training:** Educate users about the risks of clicking suspicious links and visiting untrusted websites.

**Conclusion:**

The "Exploit Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to Change Credentials" attack path poses a significant security risk to AdGuard Home. By understanding the mechanics of this attack and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly enhance the security of the application and protect its users from unauthorized access and control. Focusing on robust CSRF protection, particularly the implementation of Synchronizer Tokens, is paramount to addressing this vulnerability.
