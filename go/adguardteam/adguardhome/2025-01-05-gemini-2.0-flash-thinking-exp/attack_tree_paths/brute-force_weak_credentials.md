## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Brute-force Weak Credentials on AdGuard Home

As a cybersecurity expert working with your development team, I've conducted a deep analysis of the "Brute-force Weak Credentials" attack path within the context of AdGuard Home. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the attack, its potential impact, and actionable recommendations for mitigation.

**Attack Tree Path:** Brute-force Weak Credentials

**Target:** AdGuard Home Administrative Interface

**Description of the Attack:**

This attack path involves an attacker attempting to gain unauthorized access to the AdGuard Home administrative interface by systematically trying various username and password combinations. The attacker leverages the fact that some users may choose weak, easily guessable credentials or stick with default credentials if not properly prompted to change them.

The attacker can employ various tools and techniques for this:

* **Dictionary Attacks:** Using a pre-compiled list of common passwords.
* **Brute-force Attacks:** Trying all possible combinations of characters within a defined length and character set.
* **Credential Stuffing:** Using previously compromised username/password pairs obtained from other data breaches.

**Prerequisites for a Successful Attack:**

* **Accessible AdGuard Home Instance:** The attacker needs network access to the AdGuard Home instance, specifically the port hosting the administrative interface (typically port 3000 by default). This could be through direct internet exposure or within a local network.
* **Enabled Administrative Interface:** The AdGuard Home administrative interface must be enabled and accessible.
* **Weak or Default Credentials:** The target user account must have a weak password that can be guessed or a default password that hasn't been changed.
* **Lack of Rate Limiting or Account Lockout:** The AdGuard Home instance should ideally lack robust mechanisms to prevent repeated failed login attempts.

**Steps Involved in the Attack:**

1. **Target Identification:** The attacker identifies an AdGuard Home instance potentially vulnerable to this attack. This might involve scanning network ranges or searching for publicly exposed instances.
2. **Access to Login Interface:** The attacker accesses the login page of the AdGuard Home administrative interface.
3. **Credential Guessing:** The attacker uses automated tools or manual attempts to input various username and password combinations.
4. **Successful Authentication:** If a guessed credential matches a valid user account, the attacker gains unauthorized access.

**Potential Impact of a Successful Attack:**

Gaining unauthorized access to the AdGuard Home administrative interface can have severe consequences:

* **Complete Control over DNS Settings:** The attacker can modify DNS settings, redirecting traffic to malicious servers, blocking legitimate websites, or injecting advertisements. This can lead to:
    * **Phishing Attacks:** Redirecting users to fake login pages to steal credentials.
    * **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to websites hosting malware.
    * **Denial of Service:** Blocking access to essential online services.
* **Modification of Filtering Rules:** The attacker can disable or modify filtering rules, exposing users to unwanted content, advertisements, and potentially malicious domains.
* **Access to Query Logs:** The attacker can access DNS query logs, potentially revealing sensitive information about the user's browsing habits and online activities.
* **Configuration Changes:** The attacker can modify other AdGuard Home settings, potentially disrupting its functionality or creating backdoors for future access.
* **Data Exfiltration (Potentially):** Depending on the configuration and network setup, the attacker might be able to leverage the compromised AdGuard Home instance to pivot to other systems on the network.
* **Reputational Damage:** If the compromised AdGuard Home instance is used in malicious activities, it can damage the reputation of the user or organization running it.

**Likelihood of Success:**

The likelihood of a successful brute-force attack depends on several factors:

* **Password Strength:** The primary factor. Strong, unique passwords significantly reduce the chances of success.
* **Exposure of the Admin Interface:** Publicly exposed instances are at a higher risk.
* **Presence of Rate Limiting and Account Lockout:** These mechanisms effectively hinder brute-force attempts.
* **Complexity of the Username:** While less impactful than password strength, using common usernames can slightly increase the likelihood.
* **Availability of Credential Lists:** The effectiveness of credential stuffing depends on the availability of relevant leaked credentials.

**Detection Methods:**

Identifying an ongoing brute-force attack is crucial for timely response:

* **Failed Login Attempt Logs:** Monitoring the AdGuard Home logs for a high volume of failed login attempts from the same IP address or user agent.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** These systems can detect patterns indicative of brute-force attacks based on login attempts.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can identify and block malicious login attempts based on predefined rules and behavioral analysis.
* **Unusual Network Traffic:** Monitoring network traffic for suspicious patterns related to login requests.
* **Account Lockout Notifications:** If account lockout is implemented, monitoring for frequent lockout events.

**Prevention Strategies:**

Implementing robust security measures is essential to prevent brute-force attacks:

* **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**
    * **Minimum Length:** Require passwords of a minimum length (e.g., 12 characters or more).
    * **Complexity Requirements:** Enforce the use of a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    * **Password History:** Prevent users from reusing recently used passwords.
* **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** This adds an extra layer of security, requiring a second form of verification beyond the password. This is highly recommended.
* **Implement Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of failed login attempts allowed within a specific timeframe from a single IP address.
* **Implement Account Lockout:** Temporarily lock user accounts after a certain number of consecutive failed login attempts.
* **Use CAPTCHA or Similar Mechanisms:** Implement challenges to distinguish between human users and automated bots.
* **Change Default Credentials:** Force users to change default usernames and passwords upon initial setup.
* **Minimize Exposure of the Admin Interface:** If possible, restrict access to the administrative interface to specific IP addresses or networks. Consider using a VPN for remote access.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Periodically assess the security of the AdGuard Home instance to identify vulnerabilities.
* **Educate Users on Password Security:** Emphasize the importance of strong, unique passwords and the risks of using weak credentials.

**Mitigation Strategies (If an Attack is Successful):**

Even with preventative measures, a successful attack can occur. Mitigation strategies are crucial:

* **Immediate Password Reset:** Force a password reset for the compromised account.
* **Review Audit Logs:** Analyze the AdGuard Home logs to understand the extent of the attacker's access and actions.
* **Identify and Revert Malicious Changes:** Carefully review and revert any unauthorized changes to DNS settings, filtering rules, or other configurations.
* **Investigate the Source of the Attack:** Identify the attacker's IP address and report it to relevant authorities if necessary.
* **Implement or Strengthen Prevention Measures:** Analyze the attack and identify any weaknesses in the existing security measures to prevent future incidents.
* **Consider Reinstalling AdGuard Home:** In severe cases, a complete reinstall might be necessary to ensure the system is clean.

**Specific Considerations for AdGuard Home:**

* **Default Port:** Be aware that the default port for the administrative interface (3000) is well-known. Consider changing it to a less common port, although this provides security through obscurity and shouldn't be the primary defense.
* **Configuration Backup:** Regularly back up the AdGuard Home configuration to facilitate quick recovery after a compromise.
* **Update Regularly:** Keep AdGuard Home updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Prioritize Implementation of MFA:** This is the single most effective measure against brute-force attacks.
* **Strengthen Rate Limiting and Account Lockout Mechanisms:** Ensure these features are robust and configurable.
* **Implement Clear Password Complexity Requirements:** Guide users towards creating strong passwords.
* **Force Password Changes on First Login:**  Mandate changing default credentials.
* **Consider Implementing a CAPTCHA or Similar Challenge on the Login Page:**  This can significantly hinder automated attacks.
* **Provide Clear Security Guidance to Users:** Include best practices for password management in the documentation.
* **Log All Login Attempts (Successful and Failed):** Ensure comprehensive logging for security auditing and incident response.
* **Consider Integrating with Existing Authentication Systems:** If applicable, integrate with existing user authentication systems for centralized management and potentially stronger security features.

**Conclusion:**

The "Brute-force Weak Credentials" attack path, while seemingly simple, poses a significant threat to AdGuard Home instances. By understanding the mechanics of the attack, its potential impact, and implementing the recommended prevention and mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly enhance the security of AdGuard Home and protect its users from unauthorized access and malicious activities. A layered security approach, combining strong authentication, access controls, and monitoring, is crucial for effectively defending against this and other attack vectors.
