# Attack Surface Analysis for adguardteam/adguardhome

## Attack Surface: [Exposed DNS Port (UDP/TCP 53)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_dns_port__udptcp_53_.md)

*   **Description:** AdGuard Home, by design, listens on the standard DNS port to intercept and process DNS queries.
    *   **How AdGuard Home Contributes:** This is a core function of AdGuard Home, making it a direct participant in handling network traffic.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could send a large number of spoofed DNS requests to the AdGuard Home server, overwhelming its resources and potentially disrupting service (DNS amplification attack).
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, making internet access unreliable or impossible for users relying on AdGuard Home. Potential for the server to be used in larger DDoS attacks against other targets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement rate limiting on DNS queries to prevent abuse. Harden the DNS resolver against known vulnerabilities (though AdGuard Team actively works on this). Ensure proper handling of malformed DNS packets to prevent crashes.
        *   **Users:** Restrict access to the DNS port to trusted networks or clients using firewall rules. If possible, avoid exposing the DNS port directly to the public internet.

## Attack Surface: [Web Management Interface](./attack_surfaces/web_management_interface.md)

*   **Description:** AdGuard Home provides a web interface for configuration and management, typically accessible via a specific port (default 3000).
    *   **How AdGuard Home Contributes:** This interface allows users to control the application's settings and filtering rules, making it a target for unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could attempt to brute-force login credentials to gain access to the web interface and modify DNS settings, block legitimate websites, or redirect traffic. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the interface, potentially stealing cookies or performing actions on behalf of an authenticated user.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over AdGuard Home's functionality, leading to manipulation of DNS settings, data exfiltration (logs), and potential compromise of the underlying system if vulnerabilities exist.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms, including password complexity requirements and account lockout policies. Enforce HTTPS for all web interface communication. Implement robust input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS and other injection vulnerabilities. Include anti-CSRF tokens to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. Regularly update dependencies to patch known security flaws.
        *   **Users:** Use strong, unique passwords for the web interface. Enable HTTPS and ensure the certificate is valid. Restrict access to the web interface port to trusted networks or IP addresses.

## Attack Surface: [API Access](./attack_surfaces/api_access.md)

*   **Description:** AdGuard Home offers an API for programmatic interaction, allowing users or other applications to manage its settings.
    *   **How AdGuard Home Contributes:** The API provides a powerful interface that, if not properly secured, can be exploited for unauthorized actions.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could obtain API credentials (if not properly secured) and use the API to disable filtering, add malicious blocklists, or extract sensitive information. Injection vulnerabilities in API endpoints could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands or access data they shouldn't.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to web interface compromise, attackers could gain control over AdGuard Home's functionality and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication and authorization for API access (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0). Ensure proper input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints to prevent injection attacks. Rate-limit API requests to prevent abuse. Securely store and manage API keys.
        *   **Users:** Protect API keys and avoid exposing them in insecure locations. Only grant API access to trusted applications or users.

## Attack Surface: [Software Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/software_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** AdGuard Home needs to update its software and filter lists to remain effective and secure.
    *   **How AdGuard Home Contributes:** A compromised update mechanism could allow attackers to inject malicious code into the application.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack during an update process, replacing the legitimate update with a compromised version containing malware.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the AdGuard Home instance and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement secure update mechanisms, including verifying the integrity and authenticity of updates using digital signatures. Enforce HTTPS for update downloads.
        *   **Users:** Ensure that AdGuard Home is configured to automatically update or regularly check for updates.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File (e.g., `AdGuardHome.yaml`)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file__e_g____adguardhome_yaml__.md)

*   **Description:** AdGuard Home's configuration is often stored in a file that defines its settings and behavior.
    *   **How AdGuard Home Contributes:** If access to this file is not properly restricted, attackers could modify it to compromise the application.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gaining unauthorized access to the server could modify the configuration file to disable filtering, change DNS settings, or expose sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over AdGuard Home's functionality and potential compromise of the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure that sensitive information within the configuration file is properly protected (e.g., encrypted if necessary). Implement mechanisms to detect unauthorized modifications to the configuration file.
        *   **Users:** Restrict file system permissions on the configuration file to only allow the AdGuard Home process and authorized administrators to access it.
