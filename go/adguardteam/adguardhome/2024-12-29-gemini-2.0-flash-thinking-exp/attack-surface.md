## Key Attack Surface List for AdGuard Home (High & Critical)

Here's an updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve AdGuard Home, focusing on those with high and critical risk severity.

### Web Interface Authentication Bypass

*   **Description:**  An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the AdGuard Home administrative interface without providing valid credentials.
*   **How AdGuardHome Contributes:** AdGuard Home provides a web interface for configuration and management. Flaws in its authentication logic are the direct cause of this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in the login form allows bypassing authentication checks by manipulating a specific request parameter or exploiting a default/weak credential.
*   **Impact:** Full control over AdGuard Home settings, including disabling filtering, redirecting DNS, and potentially gaining access to the underlying system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strong and secure authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA). Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing of the authentication process. Avoid default or weak credentials. Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
    *   **Users:** Enable multi-factor authentication if available. Use strong, unique passwords and avoid default credentials. Regularly update AdGuard Home to patch known vulnerabilities.

### Web Interface Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the AdGuard Home web interface, which are then executed in the browsers of other users (typically administrators).
*   **How AdGuardHome Contributes:** AdGuard Home's web interface accepts user input in various fields (e.g., custom filtering rules, client names). If this input is not properly sanitized and escaped before being displayed, it can lead to XSS.
*   **Example:** An administrator adds a client name containing a malicious JavaScript payload. When another administrator views the client list, the script executes, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, defacement of the web interface, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-supplied data displayed in the web interface. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. Regularly scan for XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:** Be cautious about the source of any configuration data you import or manually enter. Keep your web browser updated with the latest security patches.

### DNS Resolver Cache Poisoning (Implementation Flaws)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious DNS records into AdGuard Home's DNS cache, causing it to return incorrect IP addresses for legitimate domains.
*   **How AdGuardHome Contributes:** While AdGuard Home aims to *prevent* cache poisoning, vulnerabilities in its own DNS resolver implementation could make it susceptible. This could involve flaws in how it handles DNS responses or validates DNSSEC signatures (if enabled).
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in AdGuard Home's DNS resolver to inject a record that resolves `yourbank.com` to the attacker's server. Users querying through this AdGuard Home instance would be redirected to the malicious site.
*   **Impact:** Redirection to malicious websites, phishing attacks, and potential compromise of user credentials and data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust DNSSEC validation and adhere to best practices for DNS resolver implementation. Thoroughly test the DNS resolver for vulnerabilities. Implement rate limiting and other security measures to prevent abuse.
    *   **Users:** Ensure AdGuard Home is configured to use DNSSEC validation if supported by your upstream resolvers. Regularly update AdGuard Home to patch any identified DNS resolver vulnerabilities.

### Unsecured API Endpoints

*   **Description:**  API endpoints used by the web interface or potentially exposed for other integrations lack proper authentication or authorization, allowing unauthorized access and manipulation.
*   **How AdGuardHome Contributes:** AdGuard Home likely uses internal APIs for its web interface functionality. If these APIs are not properly secured, they can become an attack vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers an API endpoint that allows adding filtering rules without requiring authentication. They can directly send requests to this endpoint to inject malicious rules.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of AdGuard Home settings, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints. Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access. Thoroughly document and secure all API endpoints.
    *   **Users:** If an API is exposed for external use, ensure it is properly secured with strong authentication and authorization. Limit access to trusted sources.

### Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Update Channels

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between AdGuard Home and its update servers, potentially injecting malicious updates.
*   **How AdGuardHome Contributes:** AdGuard Home relies on update mechanisms to fetch new filter lists and software updates. If these channels are not properly secured, they are vulnerable to MITM attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the download of a new filter list and replaces it with a modified list that allows ads from their own domains or blocks legitimate content.
*   **Impact:** Installation of malicious filter lists or compromised software updates, leading to a complete compromise of AdGuard Home's functionality and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Use HTTPS for all update communication and implement robust certificate validation (pinning). Digitally sign updates to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
    *   **Users:** Ensure your network connection is secure when AdGuard Home is performing updates. Verify the integrity of updates if possible.
