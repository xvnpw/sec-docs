* **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to AdGuard Home Web Interface
    * **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the AdGuard Home web interface, potentially through brute-forcing weak credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism, or through compromised administrator accounts. Once inside, they can modify settings, view logs, and control the DNS filtering.
    * **Impact:** Complete control over DNS filtering for the application's users, potential exposure of browsing history if logging is enabled, ability to disable security features, and potential for denial of service by misconfiguration.
    * **Affected Component:** AdGuard Home Web Interface (authentication module, configuration management).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce strong and unique passwords for the AdGuard Home administrator account.
        * Enable and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the web interface if available.
        * Restrict access to the web interface to trusted networks or IP addresses.
        * Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.
        * Keep AdGuard Home updated to patch potential authentication vulnerabilities.

* **Threat:** Manipulation of DNS Filtering Rules
    * **Description:** An attacker with access to the AdGuard Home configuration (either through the web interface or direct file access if insecurely stored) modifies the DNS filtering rules. This could involve whitelisting malicious domains, blacklisting legitimate services, or redirecting traffic.
    * **Impact:** Bypassing intended ad blocking and security measures, potentially exposing users to malware or phishing attacks, disruption of application functionality if legitimate domains are blocked.
    * **Affected Component:** AdGuard Home Filtering Engine (rule processing), Configuration Storage.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure access to the AdGuard Home configuration (as mentioned above).
        * Implement version control or backups of the AdGuard Home configuration to allow for rollback.
        * Regularly review and audit the configured filter lists for unexpected or malicious entries.
        * Consider using signed or verified filter lists if supported.

* **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in AdGuard Home Software
    * **Description:** Attackers discover and exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the AdGuard Home software itself. This could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the AdGuard Home instance, potentially leading to control over the server it's running on, exposure of sensitive data, and disruption of DNS services.
    * **Affected Component:** Various modules and functions within the AdGuard Home application.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement a robust patch management process to ensure AdGuard Home is always running the latest stable version with security updates.
        * Subscribe to security advisories from the AdGuard Home team or community.
        * Consider using a vulnerability scanner to identify potential weaknesses.

* **Threat:** Rogue DHCP Server (if AdGuard Home is used as DHCP server)
    * **Description:** If AdGuard Home is configured as a DHCP server, an attacker could introduce a rogue DHCP server on the network. This rogue server could provide clients with malicious DNS server addresses (potentially pointing to the attacker's infrastructure instead of AdGuard Home).
    * **Impact:** Clients on the network could be directed to malicious DNS servers, bypassing AdGuard Home's filtering and potentially exposing them to various online threats.
    * **Affected Component:** AdGuard Home DHCP Server Module.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * If AdGuard Home is used as a DHCP server, implement DHCP snooping on network switches to prevent rogue DHCP servers.
        * Secure the network infrastructure to prevent unauthorized devices from being connected.
        * Regularly monitor the network for unexpected DHCP server activity.
