    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the gRPC service, unauthorized data access, data manipulation, service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** gRPC Server, Interceptors (or lack thereof)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authentication using gRPC interceptors.
        *   Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) for client and server authentication.
        *   Utilize API keys or OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
        *   Regularly review and enforce authentication policies.

## Threat: [Credential Leakage and Management](./threats/credential_leakage_and_management.md)

**Threat:** Credential Exposure
    *   **Description:** Attacker gains access to sensitive authentication credentials (e.g., API keys, TLS private keys) due to insecure storage, logging, or accidental exposure in code or configuration files.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the gRPC service, long-term unauthorized access, data breaches, impersonation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Credential Management, Deployment Configuration
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass Vulnerabilities](./threats/authorization_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

**Threat:** Authorization Logic Flaws
    *   **Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the authorization logic implemented in gRPC interceptors or service handlers to bypass access controls and perform actions they are not permitted to. This could involve manipulating request parameters or exploiting logic errors.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, data manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authorization Interceptors, Service Handlers
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust and well-tested authorization logic based on the principle of least privilege.
        *   Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
        *   Regularly review and audit authorization rules and code.
        *   Perform thorough testing of authorization logic, including negative testing.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via gRPC Metadata](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_grpc_metadata.md)

**Threat:** Internal Resource Access
    *   **Description:** Attacker crafts malicious gRPC metadata values that are then used by the server to construct requests to internal resources. This allows the attacker to bypass firewalls and access internal systems or data.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal systems, data breaches, potential for further exploitation of internal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** gRPC Metadata Handling, Server-Side Logic
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input, including gRPC metadata.
        *   Avoid using metadata values directly to construct requests to internal or external systems.
        *   If metadata must be used, implement strict validation and sanitization.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege for server-side outbound requests.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Payload Execution
    *   **Description:** Attacker sends a specially crafted gRPC message that, when deserialized by the server, exploits a vulnerability in the deserialization process (potentially in protobuf libraries or custom serialization logic). This could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, complete server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Protobuf Libraries, Serialization/Deserialization Logic
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if vulnerability exists) to Medium (if mitigated by updates) - *Included as potentially High and directly related to gRPC's data handling.*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `grpc-go` and its dependencies, including protobuf libraries, up to date with the latest security patches.
        *   Avoid custom serialization logic if possible.
        *   If custom serialization is necessary, ensure it is thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement input validation even before deserialization if feasible.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Threat:** Software Vulnerability Exploitation
    *   **Description:** Attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in `grpc-go` itself or its dependencies (e.g., protobuf libraries) to compromise the gRPC service.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `grpc-go` library, Dependencies (protobuf, etc.)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability) - *Included as potentially High and directly related to `grpc-go` and its ecosystem.*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `grpc-go` and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Monitor security advisories for `grpc-go` and its dependencies.
        *   Implement a vulnerability scanning process for dependencies.

## Threat: [Indirect Injection Attacks](./threats/indirect_injection_attacks.md)

**Threat:** Backend System Compromise
    *   **Description:** Attacker injects malicious code or commands indirectly by providing crafted input to the gRPC service. This input is then used by the server to interact with backend systems (databases, operating system commands, etc.) without proper sanitization, leading to injection vulnerabilities in those systems.
    *   **Impact:** Database compromise (SQL injection), operating system command execution (command injection), access to sensitive backend data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Service Handlers, Backend Interaction Logic
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all input received from gRPC clients before using it to interact with backend systems.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Avoid constructing system commands directly from user input.
        *   Use secure coding practices for backend interactions.

## Threat: [Insecure Server Configuration](./threats/insecure_server_configuration.md)

**Threat:** Weakened Security Posture
    *   **Description:** Misconfiguration of the `grpc-go` server (e.g., disabling TLS, weak TLS settings, exposing unnecessary endpoints, default ports) weakens the overall security of the service and increases the attack surface.
    *   **Impact:** Increased vulnerability to various attacks, potential data breaches, service compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** gRPC Server Configuration, Deployment Environment
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Medium (depending on the misconfiguration) - *Included as High because insecure configuration can easily lead to critical vulnerabilities.*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow security best practices for gRPC server configuration.
        *   **Enforce TLS with strong configurations.**
        *   Only expose necessary endpoints.
        *   Change default ports if needed (security through obscurity is not primary).
        *   Regularly review and audit server configurations.
