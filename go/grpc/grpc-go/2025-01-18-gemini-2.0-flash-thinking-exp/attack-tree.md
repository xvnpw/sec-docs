## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in gRPC-Go Library [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_grpc-go_library__critical_node_.md)

*   **Trigger Vulnerability:** This is the core of exploiting flaws within the `grpc-go` library itself.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Send Maliciously Crafted Request [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   An attacker crafts a specific gRPC request designed to trigger a known vulnerability in the `grpc-go` library. This could be a buffer overflow, a logic error, or another type of flaw. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, denial of service, or data breaches.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Deserialization Flaw [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   gRPC uses Protocol Buffers for message serialization. If the application doesn't properly validate incoming messages, an attacker can send a maliciously crafted serialized payload that, when deserialized by the server, leads to code execution or other harmful actions. This is a common and dangerous class of vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit HTTP/2 Protocol Vulnerabilities (Underlying gRPC) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_http2_protocol_vulnerabilities__underlying_grpc___critical_node_.md)

*   **Trigger Vulnerability:** This involves exploiting weaknesses in the HTTP/2 implementation within `grpc-go`.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Request Smuggling/Spoofing [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   By manipulating HTTP/2 framing, an attacker can inject requests into another user's HTTP/2 stream. This can allow them to bypass security controls, access sensitive data belonging to other users, or perform actions on their behalf. This often relies on inconsistencies in how intermediaries and the server interpret HTTP/2.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Bypass Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___critical_node__bypass_authentication_and_authorization_mechanisms.md)

*   This represents a successful circumvention of the security measures designed to control access to the gRPC application.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Weaknesses in Custom Authentication Logic [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   If the application implements its own authentication scheme, vulnerabilities in this logic can be exploited.
            *   **Exploit Flaws (e.g., insecure token generation, weak password hashing) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   This includes exploiting weaknesses in how authentication tokens are generated (making them predictable or forgeable) or using weak hashing algorithms for passwords, allowing attackers to crack them and gain access.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Weaknesses in Credential Management [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   This focuses on vulnerabilities in how client credentials are stored, transmitted, or managed.
            *   **Obtain or Forge Credentials (e.g., replay attacks, credential stuffing) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   Attackers might steal valid credentials through replay attacks (capturing and re-sending authentication requests) or by using lists of known username/password combinations (credential stuffing) against the application. Successfully obtaining or forging credentials allows them to bypass authentication.
