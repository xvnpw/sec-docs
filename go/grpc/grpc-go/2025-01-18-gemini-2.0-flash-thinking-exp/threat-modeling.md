# Threat Model Analysis for grpc/grpc-go

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Protobuf](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_protobuf.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends maliciously crafted protobuf messages that exploit vulnerabilities in the `grpc-go` library's deserialization process of the `protoc`-generated code. This could lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Server crashes, data corruption, potential for remote code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** `grpc-go` message handling, `protoc`-generated code
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `protoc` compiler updated.
    *   Carefully review and sanitize any external input before it's used to construct protobuf messages (though this is less directly a `grpc-go` mitigation).
    *   Consider using a serialization format with built-in security features if the risk is deemed very high (though this moves away from standard gRPC usage).

## Threat: [Bypassing Security Interceptors](./threats/bypassing_security_interceptors.md)

*   **Description:** If interceptors within the `grpc-go` framework are not correctly implemented or ordered, a malicious request might bypass crucial security checks (e.g., authentication, authorization) implemented within those interceptors.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources or methods, security policy violations.
*   **Affected Component:** `grpc-go` interceptor framework
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design and implement interceptor chains, ensuring that security-related interceptors are executed before business logic interceptors.
    *   Thoroughly test interceptor logic to ensure it functions as expected and cannot be bypassed.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Interceptors](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_interceptors.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities in custom interceptors developed for the application using the `grpc-go` interceptor framework can introduce new attack vectors, such as authentication bypasses, authorization flaws, or information leaks.
*   **Impact:** Various security vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the flaw in the interceptor.
*   **Affected Component:** Custom interceptor implementations within the `grpc-go` framework
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if security-critical logic is flawed)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply secure coding practices when developing custom interceptors.
    *   Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of custom interceptor code.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configurations](./threats/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Using default configurations of `grpc-go` without proper hardening might leave the application vulnerable (e.g., insecure credentials being accepted, lack of enforced TLS).
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized access, other security vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** `grpc-go` configuration options
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Explicitly configure security-related options when initializing the gRPC server and client, such as enabling TLS with strong ciphers using `grpc.Creds`.
    *   Avoid using insecure credentials or allowing insecure connections in production environments.
    *   Review the `grpc-go` documentation for recommended security configurations and best practices.
