# Threat Model Analysis for grpc/grpc-go

## Threat: [Excessive Stream Creation](./threats/excessive_stream_creation.md)

**Description:** An attacker repeatedly opens a large number of gRPC streams without properly closing them. This can exhaust server resources (memory, file descriptors) managed by `grpc-go`, leading to denial of service.

**Impact:** Server becomes unresponsive or crashes, impacting availability of the gRPC service.

**Affected Component:** `transport` package within `grpc-go`, specifically stream management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement timeouts for idle streams on the server-side using `grpc.KeepaliveServerParameters`.
*   Set limits on the maximum number of concurrent streams allowed per connection or client using `ServerOptions` like `MaxConcurrentStreams`.
*   Monitor the number of active streams and connections on the server.
*   Implement client-side logic to ensure proper stream closure.

## Threat: [Large Message Attack](./threats/large_message_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends gRPC requests with excessively large messages, even if they conform to the defined protobuf schema. `grpc-go` will attempt to allocate resources to handle these messages, potentially overwhelming server memory and processing capabilities, leading to denial of service.

**Impact:** Server becomes unresponsive or crashes, impacting availability of the gRPC service.

**Affected Component:** `encoding` package within `grpc-go`, specifically message serialization and deserialization.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Define and enforce maximum message sizes on both the client and server using `grpc.MaxCallRecvMsgSize` and `grpc.MaxCallSendMsgSize` options.
*   Implement pagination or streaming for large datasets instead of sending them in a single message.
*   Monitor network traffic and server resource usage for unusually large messages.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Custom Message Handling](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_custom_message_handling.md)

**Description:** If custom logic is used within a `grpc-go` service to handle message deserialization (beyond standard protobuf handling), vulnerabilities in this custom code could be exploited by sending crafted messages. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other unexpected behavior within the gRPC server process.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the server, data corruption, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** User-defined code within gRPC service implementations that handles message processing.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly review and test any custom deserialization logic for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Avoid implementing custom deserialization if possible and rely on the built-in protobuf handling provided by `grpc-go`.
*   Apply secure coding practices to all message processing logic, including input validation.

## Threat: [Weak or Missing Authentication](./threats/weak_or_missing_authentication.md)

**Description:** The `grpc-go` service might not implement proper authentication, allowing unauthorized clients to access its methods. This is a direct configuration or implementation issue within the `grpc-go` application.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.

**Affected Component:** `credentials` package within `grpc-go`, and user-defined authentication logic integrated with `grpc-go`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always use strong authentication mechanisms supported by `grpc-go` like mutual TLS (mTLS) or secure per-RPC credentials (e.g., using `grpc.WithPerRPCCredentials`).
*   Properly configure and enforce authentication on the gRPC server using `grpc.Creds`.
*   Regularly review and update authentication credentials and mechanisms.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass](./threats/authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** Even with authentication in place, the authorization logic implemented within the `grpc-go` service or interceptors might have flaws, allowing authenticated users to access methods or data they are not authorized for. This is a direct issue with how authorization is handled within the `grpc-go` application.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.

**Affected Component:** User-defined authorization logic within gRPC service implementations or interceptors registered with the `grpc-go` server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust and well-tested authorization logic within gRPC service methods or interceptors.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access.
*   Regularly review and audit authorization rules.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Malicious Protobuf Definitions](./threats/denial_of_service_through_malicious_protobuf_definitions.md)

**Description:** If the protobuf definitions used by the `grpc-go` application are sourced from an untrusted location or tampered with, they could be crafted in a way that leads to excessive resource consumption when `grpc-go` attempts to process messages based on these definitions.

**Impact:** Difficulty in running the gRPC application, potential for denial of service if the server attempts to process maliciously defined messages.

**Affected Component:** `protobuf` definitions used by `grpc-go` and the code generated using `protoc-gen-go-grpc`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure protobuf definitions are sourced from trusted locations.
*   Implement integrity checks for protobuf definition files.
*   Regularly review and audit protobuf definitions for unusual complexity or potential vulnerabilities.
