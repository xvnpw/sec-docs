# Attack Surface Analysis for grpc/grpc-go

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Interceptor Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/server-side_interceptor_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Interceptor Vulnerabilities
    - **Description:** Security flaws within custom server-side interceptors, a mechanism provided by `grpc-go` to add custom logic to the request/response lifecycle, can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.
    - **How grpc-go Contributes:** `grpc-go`'s interceptor feature allows developers to implement authentication, authorization, and other crucial security checks. Vulnerabilities in these `grpc-go` interceptors directly compromise the service's security.
    - **Example:** An authentication interceptor implemented using `grpc-go`'s interceptor API might incorrectly validate client credentials due to flawed logic, allowing unauthorized access to gRPC methods.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, privilege escalation.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Thoroughly test all custom interceptor logic implemented using `grpc-go`'s interceptor API.
        - Follow secure coding practices specific to `grpc-go` interceptor development.
        - Implement robust input validation within `grpc-go` interceptors.
        - Regularly review and audit `grpc-go` interceptor code for security vulnerabilities.
        - Consider using well-vetted, open-source interceptor libraries compatible with `grpc-go` where applicable.

## Attack Surface: [Metadata Injection](./attack_surfaces/metadata_injection.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Metadata Injection
    - **Description:** Malicious clients can inject unexpected or harmful data through gRPC metadata, a feature of the `grpc-go` framework, if the server doesn't properly sanitize it.
    - **How grpc-go Contributes:** `grpc-go` provides the mechanism for clients to send metadata. If the server-side `grpc-go` application doesn't validate this metadata, it can be exploited.
    - **Example:** A server-side application using `grpc-go` might use metadata values in database queries without proper escaping, leading to SQL injection if a malicious client injects malicious SQL code in the metadata sent via `grpc-go`.
    - **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions, server-side vulnerabilities.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Sanitize and validate all incoming metadata within the `grpc-go` server-side application.
        - Avoid directly using metadata values in sensitive operations within the `grpc-go` service implementation without proper validation and escaping.
        - Implement strict whitelisting for expected metadata keys and values within the `grpc-go` application.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion
    - **Description:**  Attacking a `grpc-go` server by sending requests that consume excessive resources, leveraging the persistent connection nature of gRPC, leading to service unavailability.
    - **How grpc-go Contributes:** The persistent connections and potential for complex message handling in `grpc-go` can make it susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks if not properly managed.
    - **Example:** A malicious client could send a large number of concurrent requests to a `grpc-go` server or requests with extremely large payloads, overwhelming the server's resources due to `grpc-go`'s handling of these connections.
    - **Impact:** Service disruption, application downtime.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement rate limiting on the `grpc-go` server-side to restrict the number of requests from a single client.
        - Set appropriate timeouts for gRPC operations within the `grpc-go` application.
        - Implement connection management within the `grpc-go` server to limit the number of concurrent connections.
        - Utilize `grpc-go`'s built-in features or external libraries for managing resource consumption.

## Attack Surface: [TLS Configuration Issues](./attack_surfaces/tls_configuration_issues.md)

- **Attack Surface:** TLS Configuration Issues
    - **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from improper configuration of TLS when setting up secure gRPC connections using `grpc-go`.
    - **How grpc-go Contributes:** `grpc-go` relies on the underlying Go standard library for TLS. Misconfigurations during the TLS setup within the `grpc-go` application can weaken the security of the communication channel.
    - **Example:** Using weak or outdated cipher suites when configuring TLS for a `grpc-go` server, failing to validate server certificates on the client-side using `grpc-go`'s dial options, or not enforcing TLS within the `grpc-go` application can expose communication to eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - **Impact:** Data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Enforce TLS for all gRPC connections when configuring the `grpc-go` server and client.
        - Use strong and up-to-date cipher suites when setting up TLS within `grpc-go`.
        - Properly validate server certificates on the client-side when establishing `grpc-go` connections.
        - Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for strong client authentication where necessary using `grpc-go`'s authentication mechanisms.
        - Regularly review and update TLS configurations within the `grpc-go` application.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    - **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in the `grpc-go` library itself or its underlying dependencies.
    - **How grpc-go Contributes:** Applications using `grpc-go` directly inherit any vulnerabilities present in the `grpc-go` library and its dependencies.
    - **Example:** A known vulnerability in the `grpc-go` library itself or a dependency like `golang.org/x/net` could be exploited to cause a denial of service or other security issues in the gRPC application.
    - **Impact:** Various security impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure.
    - **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical).
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Regularly update the `grpc-go` library and its dependencies to the latest versions.
        - Monitor security advisories specifically for `grpc-go` and its dependencies.
        - Use Go's dependency management tools (like `go mod`) to track and manage dependencies effectively for your `grpc-go` project.
