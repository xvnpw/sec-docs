# Attack Surface Analysis for grpc/grpc-go

## Attack Surface: [HTTP/2 Protocol Exploits](./attack_surfaces/http2_protocol_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks targeting vulnerabilities in the HTTP/2 protocol implementation, including framing errors, stream multiplexing abuse, and HPACK compression attacks.
*   **How grpc-go Contributes:** `grpc-go` relies entirely on HTTP/2 for its transport layer. Vulnerabilities in `grpc-go`'s HTTP/2 handling or its underlying, *integrated* HTTP/2 library directly impact the application.  This is a *direct* involvement because `grpc-go` *includes* and manages the HTTP/2 implementation.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted HPACK header that expands to a massive size, exploiting a vulnerability in the HTTP/2 library *bundled with* `grpc-go`, consuming all available server memory.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential remote code execution (RCE) in rare cases of severe HTTP/2 implementation flaws *within the grpc-go library*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific HTTP/2 vulnerability within `grpc-go` or its bundled components).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Updated:** Maintain the latest version of `grpc-go`. This is crucial as it directly updates the embedded HTTP/2 implementation.
    *   **Limit Resources:** Configure `MaxConcurrentStreams`, `MaxHeaderListSize`, and other relevant HTTP/2 settings *within* `grpc-go` to limit resource consumption per connection.  These are `grpc-go` specific configurations.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor server resource usage, but focus on metrics exposed by `grpc-go` itself related to HTTP/2 connections.

## Attack Surface: [Protobuf Parsing Vulnerabilities (within grpc-go's bundled parser)](./attack_surfaces/protobuf_parsing_vulnerabilities__within_grpc-go's_bundled_parser_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the parsing of Protocol Buffers (protobuf) messages, specifically within the parsing library *bundled with or directly used by* `grpc-go`.
*   **How grpc-go Contributes:** `grpc-go` uses protobuf as its primary data serialization format and *includes or directly depends on* a specific protobuf library. Vulnerabilities in *this specific library* directly expose the application *through* `grpc-go`.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a malformed protobuf message designed to trigger a vulnerability in the protobuf parsing library *that is part of or directly used by the specific version of* `grpc-go`.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential remote code execution (RCE) in rare cases, potential information disclosure.  The impact stems from a flaw *within the grpc-go ecosystem*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific protobuf vulnerability within the `grpc-go` used library).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Update Libraries:** Keep `grpc-go` up-to-date. This is the primary mitigation, as it updates the bundled or directly used protobuf library.
    *   **Fuzzing (Targeted):** If you have the capability, perform fuzzing specifically targeting the protobuf parsing logic *as used by your version of grpc-go*.

## Attack Surface: [`Any` Type Misuse](./attack_surfaces/_any__type_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** Improper handling of the `google.protobuf.Any` type within the application logic *using* `grpc-go`, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary protobuf messages.
*   **How grpc-go Contributes:** `grpc-go` *provides support for* the `Any` type. The misuse is a direct consequence of how the application *utilizes* this `grpc-go` feature.
*   **Example:** An application using `grpc-go` blindly unpacks an `Any` message without validating the `type_url`, leading to unexpected behavior because of how *the application code interacts with grpc-go's API*.
*   **Impact:** Potentially arbitrary code execution (RCE), data corruption, or other application-specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Type URL Whitelist:** Within your application code *that uses grpc-go*, strictly validate the `type_url` field of `Any` messages against a whitelist.
    *   **Avoid `Any`:** Prefer strongly-typed messages whenever possible. Use `Any` only when absolutely necessary, a decision made within the context of using `grpc-go`.
    *   **Secure Unpacking:** Implement robust checks and error handling *in your application code* when unpacking `Any` messages received via `grpc-go`.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass (within grpc-go Interceptors)](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass__within_grpc-go_interceptors_.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to properly implement or configure authentication and authorization mechanisms *within grpc-go interceptors*, leading to unauthorized access.
*   **How grpc-go Contributes:** `grpc-go` *provides the interceptor mechanism* which is the *direct* location where authentication and authorization logic is typically implemented. Flaws here are directly tied to `grpc-go` usage.
*   **Example:** A `grpc-go` interceptor intended for authentication has a logic flaw that allows requests with invalid credentials to bypass the checks *within the interceptor itself*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, unauthorized execution of actions, potential privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Interceptor Review:** Thoroughly review and test all authentication and authorization interceptors *written for use with grpc-go*.
    *   **Secure Interceptor Logic:** Ensure interceptors *specifically designed for grpc-go* handle errors correctly and don't introduce any security weaknesses.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (via grpc-go specific settings)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__via_grpc-go_specific_settings_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks that aim to consume excessive server resources, exploiting misconfigurations or lack of limits *within grpc-go's settings*.
*   **How grpc-go Contributes:** `grpc-go` *provides specific settings* to control resource usage (e.g., message sizes, connection limits).  Failure to configure these properly *within grpc-go* directly leads to the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends very large protobuf messages, exceeding the default limits because `grpc.MaxRecvMsgSize` was not explicitly set *within the grpc-go server configuration*.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Message Size Limits:** Set appropriate limits on message sizes using `grpc.MaxRecvMsgSize` and `grpc.MaxSendMsgSize` *within the grpc-go configuration*.
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for RPC calls and connections *using grpc-go's timeout mechanisms*.
    * **Keepalive:** Use `grpc.KeepaliveParams` *within grpc-go* to detect and close idle connections. These are all *direct configurations of grpc-go*.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using insecure transport credentials (e.g., `grpc.WithInsecure()`) *within the grpc-go client or server setup*, exposing the communication to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
*   **How grpc-go Contributes:** `grpc-go` *provides the API functions* for setting credentials. Using `grpc.WithInsecure()` is a *direct misuse of the grpc-go API*.
*   **Example:** A developer uses `grpc.WithInsecure()` for convenience during development and forgets to change it before deploying to production. This is a *direct misconfiguration of grpc-go*.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, modification, and potential impersonation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Use TLS:** Use TLS/SSL for all production deployments *by correctly using* `grpc.WithTransportCredentials(credentials.NewTLS(...))` *within your grpc-go setup*.
    *   **Code Review:** Enforce code reviews to ensure that `grpc.WithInsecure()` is never used in production code *that interacts with grpc-go*.
