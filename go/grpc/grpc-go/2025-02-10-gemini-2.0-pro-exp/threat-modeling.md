# Threat Model Analysis for grpc/grpc-go

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Client Access](./threats/unauthenticated_client_access.md)

*   **Threat:**  Unauthenticated Client Access

    *   **Description:** An attacker connects to the gRPC server and invokes methods without providing valid credentials.  This exploits the *absence* of authentication enforcement within the `grpc-go` server setup.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data/functionality, data breaches, system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `grpc.Server` (specifically, the lack of authentication interceptors *before* request handling), `credentials` package (if TLS/mTLS is not enforced).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mandatory authentication using server-side interceptors (`grpc.UnaryInterceptor`, `grpc.StreamInterceptor`).
        *   Use TLS with mutual authentication (mTLS) (`credentials.NewTLS` with a properly configured `tls.Config`).
        *   Employ a secure token-based system (e.g., JWT) and validate tokens in the interceptor.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

*   **Threat:**  Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts gRPC communication, eavesdropping or modifying messages. This directly exploits weaknesses in the TLS configuration or the *absence* of TLS within the `grpc-go` setup.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data tampering, loss of confidentiality and integrity.
    *   **Affected Component:** `credentials` package (improper TLS configuration), `grpc.Dial` (client-side, if server verification is disabled).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Always* use TLS for all gRPC communication.
        *   Clients *must* verify the server's certificate against a trusted CA (configure `tls.Config` correctly).
        *   Servers should use valid certificates from a trusted CA.

## Threat: [Data Tampering in Transit](./threats/data_tampering_in_transit.md)

*   **Threat:**  Data Tampering in Transit

    *   **Description:**  An attacker modifies gRPC messages in transit. This is only possible if TLS is not used or is compromised, making it a direct consequence of improper `grpc-go` configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect data processing, unauthorized actions, denial of service, data integrity compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** The lack of TLS usage or a compromised TLS connection directly impacts the security of data handled by `grpc.Server` and `grpc.ClientConn`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS for all gRPC communication. This is the *primary* defense.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:**  Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion

    *   **Description:** An attacker floods the gRPC server with requests or large messages, exhausting resources.  This directly targets the `grpc.Server` and its handling of incoming connections and messages.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, disruption of operations.
    *   **Affected Component:** `grpc.Server`, `grpc.MaxRecvMsgSize`, `grpc.MaxSendMsgSize` (if not configured).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting using server-side interceptors.
        *   Set timeouts for gRPC calls (`context.WithTimeout`).
        *   Configure `grpc.MaxRecvMsgSize` and `grpc.MaxSendMsgSize`.
        *   Use connection pooling.

## Threat: [Slowloris Attack](./threats/slowloris_attack.md)

*   **Threat:**  Slowloris Attack

    *   **Description:** An attacker establishes many connections but sends data slowly, tying up server resources. This directly targets the connection handling of the `grpc.Server`.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability.
    *   **Affected Component:** `grpc.Server` (connection handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure appropriate timeouts for connections and read/write operations (using `net.ListenConfig` with `KeepAlive` settings).

## Threat: [Unauthorized Method Invocation (Bypassing Authorization)](./threats/unauthorized_method_invocation__bypassing_authorization_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Unauthorized Method Invocation (Bypassing Authorization)

    *   **Description:** An authenticated client invokes methods they are not authorized to access. This highlights a failure in the authorization logic *within* the `grpc-go` server's interceptor chain.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data/functionality, data modification/deletion, system integrity compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `grpc.Server` (specifically, the *absence* or incorrect implementation of authorization checks in server-side interceptors *before* the handler).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks in server-side interceptors.
        *   Use a well-defined authorization model (RBAC, ABAC).
        *   Ensure checks are performed for *every* method call.
