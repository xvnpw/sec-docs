Okay, let's create a design document for the gRPC-Go project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

gRPC-Go is Google's implementation of the gRPC framework in Go. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework, that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. gRPC is designed for building scalable and low-latency distributed systems. It's used for connecting services in and across data centers, and it also supports pluggable load balancing, tracing, health checking, and authentication.

Priorities:

- Provide a robust, efficient, and reliable RPC framework for Go developers.
- Maintain compatibility with the gRPC specification and other language implementations.
- Support a wide range of use cases, from microservices to mobile applications.
- Ensure high performance and low latency.
- Provide a secure and extensible platform.

Goals:

- Enable developers to easily build distributed systems using Go.
- Facilitate communication between services, regardless of their underlying infrastructure.
- Promote interoperability between different programming languages and platforms.

Business Risks:

- Incompatibility with other gRPC implementations could lead to fragmentation and limit adoption.
- Performance bottlenecks could hinder the use of gRPC-Go in high-throughput scenarios.
- Security vulnerabilities could expose user data and compromise system integrity.
- Lack of features or poor usability could drive developers to alternative solutions.
- Failure to keep up with evolving standards and technologies could lead to obsolescence.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: TLS support for secure communication. Implemented in the transport layer.
- security control: Authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2, JWT). Described in the authentication documentation and examples.
- security control: Interceptors for implementing custom security logic (e.g., authorization). Described in the interceptor documentation.
- security control: Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning. Part of the gRPC project's development process.
- security control: Fuzz testing. Part of continuous integration.
- security control: Support for ALTS (Application Layer Transport Security). Described in ALTS documentation.

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: The framework relies on the underlying operating system and network infrastructure for some security guarantees.
- accepted risk: Users are responsible for securely managing their credentials and keys.
- accepted risk: Users are responsible for implementing appropriate authorization logic for their applications.
- accepted risk: Complex configuration may lead to misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities if not carefully managed.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Implement comprehensive input validation to prevent injection attacks.
- security control: Provide clear guidance and examples for securely configuring and deploying gRPC-Go applications.
- security control: Integrate with security linters and static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities during development.
- security control: Consider adding support for additional authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication:
    - Support for mutual TLS authentication.
    - Integration with common identity providers (e.g., Google, AWS, Azure).
    - Support for token-based authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth2).
    - Mechanisms for securely managing and rotating credentials.

- Authorization:
    - Support for role-based access control (RBAC).
    - Ability to define fine-grained access control policies.
    - Integration with external authorization services.

- Input Validation:
    - Strict validation of all incoming data based on Protobuf definitions.
    - Protection against common injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
    - Sanitization of user-provided input.

- Cryptography:
    - Use of strong, well-vetted cryptographic algorithms.
    - Secure key management practices.
    - Protection against replay attacks.
    - Support for data encryption at rest and in transit.

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Commits Code" --> GitRepository["Git Repository (GitHub)"]
    GitRepository -- "Triggers" --> CIWorkflow["CI Workflow (GitHub Actions)"]
    CIWorkflow -- "Runs Tests" --> Tests["Unit & Integration Tests"]
    CIWorkflow -- "Builds" --> Build["Build Process (go build)"]
    Build -- "Generates" --> Binary["Go Binary"]
    CIWorkflow -- "Scans" --> SecurityChecks["Security Checks (SAST, SCA)"]

    CIWorkflow -- "Packages" --> DockerBuild["Docker Build"]
    DockerBuild -- "Creates" --> DockerImage["Docker Image"]
    DockerImage -- "Pushes to" --> ContainerRegistry["Container Registry"]
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  The commit triggers a CI workflow (GitHub Actions).
3.  The CI workflow runs unit and integration tests.
4.  The CI workflow executes the build process using `go build`, generating a Go binary.
5.  Security checks (SAST - Static Application Security Testing, SCA - Software Composition Analysis) are performed on the code and its dependencies.  Tools like `gosec`, `snyk`, or GitHub's built-in dependency scanning could be used.
6.  The CI workflow builds a Docker image using a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile should follow best practices for security, such as using a minimal base image, running as a non-root user, and avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
7.  The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, AWS ECR).

Security Controls in Build Process:

- security control: Code review: All code changes are reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged.
- security control: Automated testing: Unit and integration tests are run automatically on every commit.
- security control: SAST: Static analysis tools are used to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
- security control: SCA: Software composition analysis tools are used to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- security control: Docker image scanning: The Docker image is scanned for vulnerabilities before being pushed to the container registry.
- security control: Signed commits: Developers sign their commits to ensure authenticity.
- security control: Least privilege: Build processes run with minimal necessary privileges.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

- Reliable and efficient inter-service communication: gRPC-Go is fundamental for communication between services in distributed systems. Any disruption or performance degradation directly impacts the functionality of applications relying on it.
- Data integrity and confidentiality: gRPC-Go handles potentially sensitive data. Ensuring its integrity and confidentiality during transmission is crucial.

Data Sensitivity:

- The sensitivity of the data handled by gRPC-Go depends entirely on the specific applications using it.  It can range from non-sensitive metadata to highly confidential information like PII (Personally Identifiable Information), financial data, or healthcare records.  Therefore, the design and implementation of applications using gRPC-Go *must* consider the sensitivity of the data being transmitted and implement appropriate security controls.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR) must applications built with gRPC-Go adhere to? This will influence the necessary security controls.
- What are the expected performance requirements (throughput, latency) for typical use cases?
- What are the existing security policies and procedures of organizations that will be using gRPC-Go?
- What level of access do developers have to production environments?
