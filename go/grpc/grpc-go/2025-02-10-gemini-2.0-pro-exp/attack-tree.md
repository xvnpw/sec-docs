# Attack Tree Analysis for grpc/grpc-go

Objective: To achieve *at least one* of the following:

1.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Render the gRPC service unavailable to legitimate clients.
2.  **Unauthorized Data Access/Modification:** Read or modify data the attacker shouldn't have access to.
3.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the gRPC service.
4.  **Information Disclosure:** Leak sensitive information about the service, its configuration, or its data.
