# Threat Model Analysis for containerd/containerd

## Threat: [Malicious Container Image Execution](./threats/malicious_container_image_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could upload a malicious container image to a registry that the application trusts or is configured to pull from. When containerd pulls and runs this image, the malicious code within the container could execute on the host system, potentially gaining unauthorized access or causing damage. This directly involves containerd's image pulling and container execution functionalities.

**Impact:** Host system compromise, data breach, denial of service, lateral movement to other containers or infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** containerd's `image` service (pulling and storing images) and the `runtime` service (executing containers).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement container image scanning and vulnerability analysis tools to identify known vulnerabilities before deployment.
*   Enforce the use of trusted container registries and restrict pulling from untrusted sources.
*   Utilize content trust mechanisms (e.g., Notary) to verify the integrity and authenticity of container images.
*   Implement strong access controls on container registries.

## Threat: [Container Escape via containerd Vulnerability](./threats/container_escape_via_containerd_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability within containerd itself to break out of the container's isolation and gain access to the underlying host operating system. This directly involves flaws within containerd's code related to namespace handling, cgroup management, or other core functionalities.

**Impact:** Full host system compromise, access to sensitive data on the host, ability to control other containers running on the same host.

**Affected Component:** containerd's core runtime components, specifically those responsible for container isolation (namespaces, cgroups).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep containerd updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
*   Implement strong container runtime security configurations (e.g., seccomp profiles, AppArmor or SELinux policies).
*   Regularly audit containerd configurations for potential weaknesses.
*   Minimize the privileges granted to containers.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to containerd API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_containerd_api.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the containerd API (e.g., via the gRPC socket) if it's not properly secured. This directly involves containerd's API and its security mechanisms. This would allow them to perform actions such as creating, deleting, or modifying containers, pulling images, and potentially gaining control over the entire container environment.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary container manipulation, data exfiltration, denial of service, potential host compromise.

**Affected Component:** containerd's gRPC API and authentication/authorization mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the containerd gRPC socket using appropriate file system permissions and network controls.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the containerd API.
*   Restrict access to the containerd API to only authorized users and processes.
*   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for API communication.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of containerd Binaries](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_containerd_binaries.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise the build or distribution process of containerd itself, injecting malicious code into the binaries. This directly involves the integrity of the containerd software.

**Impact:** Running a backdoored version of containerd, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Affected Component:** The entire containerd codebase and build/release pipeline.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Download containerd from trusted and official sources.
*   Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums and signatures.
*   Monitor for any unusual behavior after deploying or updating containerd.
