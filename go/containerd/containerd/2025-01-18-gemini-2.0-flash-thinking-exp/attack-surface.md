# Attack Surface Analysis for containerd/containerd

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated containerd API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_containerd_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** The containerd API (typically gRPC) is exposed without proper authentication or authorization mechanisms.
    *   **How containerd Contributes:** containerd provides the gRPC API for managing containers. If this API is accessible without authentication, it becomes a direct entry point for malicious actors.
    *   **Example:** An attacker connects to the containerd gRPC port and uses the API to create a privileged container that mounts the host filesystem, allowing them to execute commands on the host.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the host system, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Ensure the containerd API is only accessible to authorized users or processes. Implement strong authentication mechanisms like mutual TLS (mTLS).
        *   **Developers/Users:** Use network firewalls or access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to the containerd API port.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Avoid exposing the containerd socket directly to untrusted networks or containers.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting containerd API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_containerd_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist within the containerd API implementation itself (e.g., bugs in gRPC handling, parsing errors).
    *   **How containerd Contributes:** containerd's codebase includes the implementation of the gRPC API, making it susceptible to software vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted gRPC request that exploits a buffer overflow in containerd's API handling, leading to arbitrary code execution on the containerd process.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution on the host system, denial of service of container management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Keep containerd updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Monitor containerd security advisories and apply patches promptly.
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the containerd API handlers.

## Attack Surface: [Access to the containerd Socket](./attack_surfaces/access_to_the_containerd_socket.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the containerd socket (`/run/containerd/containerd.sock`) allows direct interaction with containerd.
    *   **How containerd Contributes:** containerd uses a Unix socket for local communication. If permissions are too permissive, it becomes a direct attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A compromised container or a malicious process on the host gains access to the containerd socket and uses it to create or manipulate other containers.
    *   **Impact:** Container escape, host compromise, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Restrict access to the containerd socket to only trusted users and processes using file system permissions.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Consider using alternative communication methods if direct socket access is not required.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in containerd's Image Handling](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_containerd's_image_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how containerd pulls, stores, or manages container images can be exploited.
    *   **How containerd Contributes:** containerd is responsible for managing container images, making it a target for attacks related to image processing.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious container image that exploits a vulnerability in containerd's image unpacking logic, leading to code execution on the host when the image is pulled or run.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution on the host, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Keep containerd updated to patch known image handling vulnerabilities.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Implement image scanning and vulnerability analysis tools to identify potentially malicious images before pulling them.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Use trusted container registries and verify image signatures.

## Attack Surface: [Container Escape via containerd's Interaction with the Runtime (runc)](./attack_surfaces/container_escape_via_containerd's_interaction_with_the_runtime__runc_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the communication or interaction between containerd and the underlying container runtime (like runc) can lead to container escapes.
    *   **How containerd Contributes:** containerd orchestrates the container lifecycle using runc. Weaknesses in this interaction can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in how containerd passes parameters to runc during container creation, allowing them to bypass security restrictions and gain access to the host.
    *   **Impact:** Host compromise, access to sensitive data on the host.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Keep both containerd and the underlying container runtime (runc) updated to the latest versions.
        *   **Developers:** Carefully review and secure the interface between containerd and the runtime.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in containerd Plugins](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_containerd_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in third-party plugins used to extend containerd's functionality.
    *   **How containerd Contributes:** containerd's plugin architecture allows for extending its capabilities, but these plugins can introduce new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A malicious or vulnerable containerd plugin allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the containerd process or gain access to sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution within containerd, host compromise (depending on plugin privileges).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Only use trusted and well-vetted containerd plugins.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Keep containerd plugins updated to their latest versions.
        *   **Developers:** Implement security reviews and vulnerability scanning for custom containerd plugins.
