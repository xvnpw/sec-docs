# Attack Surface Analysis for containerd/containerd

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated gRPC API Access (Critical)](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_grpc_api_access__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of the containerd gRPC API without proper authentication allows unauthorized interaction with containerd.
*   **Containerd Contribution:** Containerd *itself* exposes the gRPC API as its primary management interface. Lack of authentication is a direct containerd configuration issue.
*   **Example:** A containerd instance is deployed with the gRPC API listening on a network interface without authentication enabled. An attacker on the same network can use `ctr` or a custom gRPC client to connect and manage containers, images, and namespaces *directly through containerd's API*.
*   **Impact:** Full container and image management control, potential host compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service *via direct control of containerd*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication:** Configure containerd to use authentication for gRPC API access (e.g., TLS client certificates, mutual TLS) *within containerd's configuration*.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the gRPC API to only trusted networks or localhost *using network firewalls external to containerd, but essential for securing containerd's API*.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** If possible, avoid exposing the gRPC API directly and use a more restricted interface or control plane *that interacts with containerd securely*.

## Attack Surface: [Image Pulling from Untrusted Registries (High)](./attack_surfaces/image_pulling_from_untrusted_registries__high_.md)

*   **Description:** Pulling container images from compromised or untrusted registries can introduce malicious code into the system.
*   **Containerd Contribution:** Containerd is the component *responsible for pulling images* from configured registries based on image names.  It directly interacts with registries.
*   **Example:** A developer configures containerd to pull images from a public registry without verifying image signatures or using a trusted private registry. An attacker compromises the public registry and injects malware into a popular image. Containerd *pulls this malicious image* and makes it available for container creation.
*   **Impact:** Execution of malicious code within containers, container escape, data compromise, supply chain compromise *originating from images pulled by containerd*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Trusted Registries:**  Pull images only from trusted private registries or reputable public registries *configured for containerd*.
    *   **Image Verification:** Implement image signature verification using technologies like Docker Content Trust or Sigstore to ensure image integrity and authenticity *during the image pull process managed by containerd*.
    *   **Registry Access Control:** Restrict access to registries and enforce authentication and authorization for image pulls *at the registry level, impacting how containerd interacts with them*.

## Attack Surface: [Container Escape Vulnerabilities in Runtime (Critical)](./attack_surfaces/container_escape_vulnerabilities_in_runtime__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the container runtime itself (containerd or its components like runc) can allow attackers to break out of container isolation and gain access to the host system.
*   **Containerd Contribution:** Containerd, along with runc, is the core *container runtime*. Vulnerabilities *within containerd or its core components* directly compromise container isolation.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in runc (used by containerd). An attacker exploits this vulnerability from within a container to escape the container sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the host system with root privileges *due to a flaw in the runtime managed by containerd*.
*   **Impact:** Full host compromise, privilege escalation, data breach, denial of service *resulting from a breach of containerd's core isolation mechanisms*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Containerd and runc Updated:** Regularly update containerd and its dependencies, especially runc, to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities *in the runtime itself*.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:**  Implement vulnerability scanning and monitoring for containerd and its components to proactively identify and address security issues *within the containerd runtime*.
    *   **Security Hardening:** Apply security hardening best practices to the host operating system and container runtime environment *to reduce the attack surface of the environment containerd operates in*.
    *   **Seccomp and AppArmor/SELinux:** Utilize security profiles like seccomp and AppArmor/SELinux to restrict the syscalls and capabilities available to containers, reducing the attack surface for container escape vulnerabilities *that might exploit weaknesses in containerd or runc*.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities and Malicious Plugins (High to Critical, depending on plugin)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities_and_malicious_plugins__high_to_critical__depending_on_plugin_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in containerd plugins or the use of malicious plugins can compromise containerd and the host system.
*   **Containerd Contribution:** Containerd's *plugin architecture* is a core feature.  Plugins extend containerd's functionality, and vulnerabilities *within these plugins directly impact containerd's security*.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable third-party containerd plugin is installed. An attacker exploits a vulnerability in this plugin to gain control over containerd and potentially the host system *by exploiting a flaw in a containerd plugin*. Alternatively, a malicious plugin is installed that is designed to exfiltrate data or compromise the system *through containerd's plugin mechanism*.
*   **Impact:** Containerd compromise, host compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, depending on the plugin's capabilities *and the level of access the plugin has within containerd*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High to Critical** (depending on plugin and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Auditing:** Carefully audit and review plugins before installation. Only use plugins from trusted sources *for containerd*.
    *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:**  Use only necessary plugins and avoid installing unnecessary or untrusted plugins *in containerd*.
    *   **Plugin Updates:** Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities *in containerd plugins*.
    *   **Plugin Security Scans:**  If possible, scan plugins for vulnerabilities before deployment *within the containerd environment*.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Plugins):**  Grant plugins only the necessary permissions and capabilities *within containerd's plugin configuration*.
