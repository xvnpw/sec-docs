#### 4.5 Technical Details of Exploitation (Hypothetical Examples)

*   **Scenario 1: Compromised Build Script:** An attacker compromises the CI/CD pipeline and injects a malicious script into the build process. This script could:
    *   Download and include a malicious dependency during the build.
    *   Modify the compiled binaries to include a backdoor (e.g., adding a network listener, modifying existing functionality).
    *   Alter the checksum generation process to hide the modifications.
*   **Scenario 2: Malicious Dependency Injection:** An attacker compromises a popular Go module dependency used by containerd. This malicious dependency could:
    *   Execute arbitrary code during the build process.
    *   Introduce vulnerabilities into the compiled containerd binaries.
    *   Exfiltrate build artifacts or secrets from the build environment.
*   **Scenario 3: Distribution Channel Manipulation:** An attacker compromises the GitHub Releases mechanism or a package repository. They could:
    *   Replace legitimate containerd binaries with backdoored versions.
    *   Modify package metadata to point to malicious binaries.
    *   Use social engineering to trick users into downloading and installing compromised versions.

#### 4.6 Detection and Prevention (Expanded Mitigation Strategies)

**Expanding on the provided mitigation strategies and adding more granular measures:**
