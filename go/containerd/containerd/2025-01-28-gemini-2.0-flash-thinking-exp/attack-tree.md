## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit containerd API [CRITICAL NODE - High Impact Area, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_containerd_api__critical_node_-_high_impact_area__high-risk_path_.md)

**1. Exploit containerd API [CRITICAL NODE - High Impact Area, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Vulnerable API Endpoint:**
        *   **Known Vulnerability (CVE):**
            *   Attackers research publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in containerd API.
            *   They obtain exploit code or develop their own based on CVE details.
            *   They execute the exploit against a vulnerable containerd API endpoint to gain unauthorized access or control.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerability:**
            *   Attackers discover previously unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days) in the containerd API through fuzzing, reverse engineering, or code analysis.
            *   They develop exploits for these zero-day vulnerabilities.
            *   They execute these exploits to compromise the containerd API.
    *   **Abuse API Misconfiguration/Weak Access Control:**
        *   **Weak Authentication/Authorization:**
            *   Attackers exploit default or weak credentials if they exist for the containerd API.
            *   They exploit the lack of proper authentication mechanisms, potentially accessing the API without any or with easily bypassed authentication.
        *   **Overly Permissive API Access:**
            *   Attackers leverage authorized API calls, even with valid credentials, if the authorization is overly permissive.
            *   They use these authorized calls for malicious purposes such as:
                *   Creating malicious containers with elevated privileges.
                *   Modifying container configurations to gain further access.
                *   Exposing host resources to attacker-controlled containers.

    *   **Supply Chain Attack - Malicious Base Image:**
        *   **Compromise Upstream Image Registry:**
            *   Attackers compromise an upstream image registry (public or private).
            *   They inject malicious images or backdoors into existing images within the registry.
            *   Applications using containerd pull and utilize these compromised base images, unknowingly deploying malicious code.

            *   Attackers compromise the image build process.
            *   They inject malicious layers or code during the image build stages.
            *   The resulting container images contain malicious code from the build process itself.
    *   **Image Layer Manipulation:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) during image pull:**
            *   Attackers perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack during the image pull process.
            *   They intercept image pull requests and inject malicious layers into the image being downloaded.
        *   **Exploit Registry Vulnerabilities:**
            *   Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the container registry itself.
            *   They gain write access to the registry and directly modify image layers, injecting malicious content.

**3. Container Escape [CRITICAL NODE - Highest Impact Area, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Kernel Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **Known Kernel Vulnerabilities:**
            *   Attackers identify known kernel vulnerabilities that are exploitable from within a container.
            *   They research CVE details and obtain or develop exploit code for container escape.
            *   They execute these exploits from inside a container to escape the container and gain access to the host system.
        *   **Zero-Day Kernel Vulnerability:**
            *   Attackers discover zero-day vulnerabilities in the host kernel.
            *   They develop exploits for these zero-day kernel vulnerabilities that can be triggered from within a container to achieve escape.
    *   **Exploit containerd Vulnerabilities for Escape:**
        *   **Known containerd Escape Vulnerabilities:**
            *   Attackers identify known vulnerabilities in containerd itself that lead to container escape.
            *   They research CVEs and obtain or develop exploit code for escaping via containerd.
            *   They execute these exploits from within a container to escape to the host through containerd vulnerabilities.
        *   **Zero-Day containerd Escape Vulnerability:**
            *   Attackers discover zero-day vulnerabilities in containerd that allow for container escape.
            *   This could involve analyzing containerd code for namespace or security flaws, or exploiting resource management weaknesses.
            *   They develop exploits to bypass container isolation and escape to the host.
    *   **Misconfiguration leading to Escape:**
        *   **Privileged Container Exploitation:**
            *   Attackers target applications running in "privileged" containers (e.g., using `--privileged` flag).
            *   Privileged containers bypass many security features, allowing attackers to leverage these privileges to access host resources and escape.
        *   **Volume Mount Exploitation:**
            *   Attackers exploit insecure volume mounts where host paths are mounted into containers without proper restrictions.
            *   They use these mounts to access sensitive host files, execute binaries on the host, or modify host system configurations.
        *   **Weak Security Profiles (AppArmor/SELinux):**
            *   Attackers exploit situations where security profiles (AppArmor or SELinux) are not properly configured or are too weak.
            *   Containers gain excessive capabilities that are not restricted by the profiles, enabling them to perform actions that facilitate container escape.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Misconfigurations in containerd Setup [CRITICAL NODE - Configuration Weakness, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_misconfigurations_in_containerd_setup__critical_node_-_configuration_weakness__high-risk__1e563d8e.md)

**4. Exploiting Misconfigurations in containerd Setup [CRITICAL NODE - Configuration Weakness, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure API Exposure:**
        *   Attackers exploit situations where the containerd API is exposed without proper network restrictions.
        *   This allows unauthorized access to the containerd API from external networks, potentially the internet.
    *   **Default Credentials/Weak Secrets:**
        *   Attackers exploit the use of default or weak credentials for containerd or related services.
        *   This grants them unauthorized access to containerd management functions, allowing them to control containers and potentially the host.
    *   **Insufficient Security Hardening:**
        *   Attackers exploit the failure to apply security best practices during containerd deployment.
        *   This leaves containerd vulnerable to known attack vectors and misconfigurations, increasing the likelihood of successful attacks from other high-risk paths.
