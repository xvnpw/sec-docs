# Threat Model Analysis for containerd/containerd

## Threat: [Container Escape](./threats/container_escape.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within containerd's runtime components (like `runc` or `containerd-shim`) or its interaction with the kernel. This allows them to break out of the container's isolation boundaries.  Attackers might leverage syscall vulnerabilities, namespace weaknesses, or bugs in containerd's privileged operations to gain access to the host system.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the host system. Attackers can access sensitive host data, install persistent malware, pivot to other systems, and cause complete system disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Containerd Runtime (runc, containerd-shim), Kernel Interaction, Namespaces, Cgroups.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain up-to-date containerd and kernel versions with the latest security patches.
    *   Implement and enforce strong container security profiles (e.g., AppArmor, SELinux) to restrict container capabilities and syscall access.
    *   Utilize user namespaces to enhance container isolation and limit the impact of potential escapes.
    *   Regularly audit containerd and kernel configurations for security weaknesses.
    *   Deploy runtime security monitoring and intrusion detection systems to detect and respond to escape attempts.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Containerd API Access](./threats/unauthorized_containerd_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the containerd gRPC API. This could be achieved by exploiting weak authentication mechanisms, network misconfigurations exposing the API, or vulnerabilities in the API itself.  With API access, attackers can directly control containerd, allowing them to manage containers, images, namespaces, and other resources. They could start/stop containers, delete data, deploy malicious containers, or disrupt services managed by containerd.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Compromise of the container environment and applications managed by containerd. Potential data loss, denial of service, and unauthorized control over containerized workloads.
*   **Affected Component:** gRPC API, Authentication/Authorization Modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for the containerd API, such as mutual TLS and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
    *   Enforce TLS encryption for all communication with the containerd API to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   Restrict network access to the containerd API using firewalls and network segmentation, allowing access only from authorized networks or services.
    *   Regularly audit API access logs to detect and investigate any suspicious or unauthorized activity.
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when granting API access, ensuring users and services only have the necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Insecure Containerd Configuration](./threats/insecure_containerd_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Containerd is deployed with insecure configurations. This can include running containerd with excessive privileges, disabling crucial security features (like seccomp or AppArmor enforcement), using weak default settings, or exposing sensitive information in configuration files. Attackers can exploit these misconfigurations to bypass security controls, escalate privileges, or more easily exploit other vulnerabilities in the system.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Increased attack surface and weakened security posture. Misconfigurations can lead to easier privilege escalation, broader impact of container escapes, and exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration Files (containerd.conf), Daemon Startup Parameters, Security Modules Configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly adhere to containerd security hardening guides and best practices during deployment and configuration.
    *   Regularly review and audit containerd configuration files for any security misconfigurations or deviations from best practices.
    *   Utilize configuration management tools to enforce consistent and secure configurations across all containerd deployments.
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege for containerd processes and users, minimizing the permissions granted to containerd itself.
    *   Disable any unnecessary features or modules within containerd to reduce the attack surface.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Container Context via Containerd](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_container_context_via_containerd.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in containerd's privilege handling mechanisms or its interaction with the kernel to escalate privileges from within a container. Even if a container is designed to run as a non-root user, a containerd vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain root privileges on the host system. This might involve exploiting setuid binaries within containers in conjunction with containerd bugs, abusing capabilities handling, or leveraging kernel vulnerabilities exposed through containerd's operations.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Host system compromise. Successful privilege escalation from a container to the host's root level grants the attacker full control over the host.
*   **Affected Component:** Privilege Handling, User Namespaces, Capability Management, Kernel Interaction.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Run containerd with the minimal necessary privileges required for its operation.
    *   Apply security patches promptly to both containerd and the underlying kernel to address known privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
    *   Utilize user namespaces to further isolate container user IDs from the host user namespace, reducing the potential impact of privilege escalation attempts.
    *   Carefully drop unnecessary capabilities from containers to limit the attack surface for privilege escalation.
    *   Implement security auditing and monitoring to detect and alert on suspicious privilege escalation attempts within containers and containerd.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of Containerd](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_containerd.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the supply chain of containerd. This could involve injecting malicious code into containerd binaries, its dependencies, or the build and distribution processes. If successful, users downloading and deploying compromised versions of containerd will be vulnerable from the outset. This is a wide-reaching and potentially highly impactful attack, affecting numerous systems relying on the compromised containerd version.
*   **Impact:** **Critical to High**. Widespread compromise of systems utilizing the affected containerd version. Potential for large-scale data breaches, malware distribution, and widespread system compromise. The severity depends on the nature and capabilities of the malicious code injected.
*   **Affected Component:** Build Process, Distribution Channels, Dependencies, Binaries.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical to High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always obtain containerd binaries and dependencies from trusted and official sources, such as the official containerd GitHub repository or trusted distribution channels.
    *   Thoroughly verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums and digital signatures provided by the official sources.
    *   Implement a secure software supply chain for building and deploying containerd within your own infrastructure, if applicable.
    *   Regularly scan containerd binaries and dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   Establish robust vulnerability management and patching processes to quickly address any identified vulnerabilities in containerd and its dependencies.
