## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via containerd Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_containerd_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a critical point. Success here means the application's integrity, confidentiality, or availability has been compromised through exploiting `containerd`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code within a Container (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_within_a_container__high-risk_path_.md)

This path represents a significant risk as it allows the attacker to gain control within the application's execution environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Container Image (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_container_image__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical node because the container image is the foundation of the container. Exploiting vulnerabilities here allows the attacker to inject malicious code that will be executed when the container starts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deliver Malicious Image (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/deliver_malicious_image__high-risk_path_.md)

This step involves getting a malicious image onto the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Registry and Push Malicious Image (AND) (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_registry_and_push_malicious_image__and___high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This is a highly critical node. If the container registry is compromised, the attacker can replace legitimate images with malicious ones, affecting all applications using those images.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Registry Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_registry_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities in the registry software itself allows direct access for malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Registry Credentials (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_registry_credentials__critical_node_.md)

Gaining valid credentials provides access to push and pull images, enabling the introduction of malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Image Pull (AND)](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_image_pull__and_.md)

This involves intercepting the communication between the application server and the registry to replace the legitimate image with a malicious one.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Network (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_network__critical_node_.md)

Network compromise is a critical enabler for many attacks, including MitM.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and Replace Image (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_replace_image__critical_node_.md)

Successfully intercepting and replacing the image during the pull process leads to the execution of attacker-controlled code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Application Running in Container (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_application_running_in_container__high-risk_path_.md)

If the application code within the container has vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them to execute arbitrary code within the container's context.
* Likelihood: Medium to High
* Impact: Significant
* Effort: Low to Moderate (if vulnerability is known)
* Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate (if vulnerability is known)
* Detection Difficulty: Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Container Configuration Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/container_configuration_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

Incorrect container configurations can weaken security and provide attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overly Permissive Security Context (e.g., privileged mode) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/overly_permissive_security_context__e_g___privileged_mode___high-risk_path_.md)

Running containers in privileged mode bypasses many security features and grants the container almost full access to the host.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Host Resources from within Container (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_host_resources_from_within_container__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

A privileged container can directly interact with the host kernel, leading to full host compromise.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: Critical
* Effort: Low to Moderate
* Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
* Detection Difficulty: Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Mounts/Volumes (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_mountsvolumes__high-risk_path_.md)

Incorrectly configured mounts can expose sensitive host files or directories to the container.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Host Files/Directories (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_host_filesdirectories__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Gaining access to sensitive host files can lead to data breaches or privilege escalation.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: Significant to Critical
* Effort: Low
* Skill Level: Beginner
* Detection Difficulty: Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Escape Container and Gain Host Access (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/escape_container_and_gain_host_access__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This path represents a critical breach of container isolation, allowing the attacker to gain control over the underlying host system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit containerd Vulnerability for Container Escape (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_containerd_vulnerability_for_container_escape__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities within `containerd` itself can allow an attacker to break out of the container's isolation.
* Likelihood: Low
* Impact: Critical
* Effort: Moderate to High
* Skill Level: Advanced
* Detection Difficulty: Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Namespaces or Cgroups (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_namespaces_or_cgroups__high-risk_path_.md)

Incorrect configurations of namespaces or cgroups, which provide isolation, can be exploited to escape the container.

## Attack Tree Path: [Break out of Container Isolation (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/break_out_of_container_isolation__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Successfully breaking out of container isolation grants access to the host system.
* Likelihood: Low to Medium
* Impact: Critical
* Effort: Moderate
* Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
* Detection Difficulty: Difficult
