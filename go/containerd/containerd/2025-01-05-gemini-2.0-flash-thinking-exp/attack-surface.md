# Attack Surface Analysis for containerd/containerd

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured containerd gRPC API Access](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_containerd_grpc_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** The containerd daemon exposes a gRPC API for management. If this API is not properly secured, unauthorized entities can interact with it.
    *   **How containerd contributes:** containerd *is* the provider of this API, making its security paramount. Lack of authentication or authorization mechanisms on this API directly exposes containerd's core functionalities.
    *   **Example:** A publicly exposed containerd API without TLS and authentication allows an attacker to remotely create and run a privileged container that mounts the host's root filesystem.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the host system, data exfiltration, denial of service, execution of arbitrary code on the host.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS encryption for the gRPC API and enforce client certificate authentication (mTLS).
        *   Restrict network access to the API endpoint using firewalls or network policies.
        *   Implement proper authorization mechanisms to control which clients can perform specific actions on the API.
        *   Avoid exposing the containerd API directly to the public internet.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure containerd Unix Socket Permissions](./attack_surfaces/insecure_containerd_unix_socket_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** The containerd daemon communicates via a Unix socket. If the permissions on this socket are too permissive, local users or compromised processes can interact with containerd without proper authorization.
    *   **How containerd contributes:** containerd creates and uses this socket for local communication. Its default permissions and the system's handling of these permissions are critical.
    *   **Example:** A low-privileged user gaining access to the containerd socket due to overly permissive file permissions could instruct containerd to create a container with elevated privileges, effectively escalating their own privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Local privilege escalation, container escape, potential host compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the containerd Unix socket has restrictive permissions, allowing access only to the root user and authorized groups.
        *   Regularly audit the permissions of the containerd socket.
        *   Consider using a dedicated user and group for containerd operations.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in containerd Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_containerd_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** containerd uses a plugin architecture for extending its functionality (e.g., snapshotters, runtimes, image stores). Vulnerabilities in these plugins can be exploited.
    *   **How containerd contributes:** containerd's design allows for loading and executing external code through plugins. The security of these plugins is a direct concern for containerd users.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a third-party snapshotter plugin could allow an attacker to write arbitrary data to the host filesystem outside of container boundaries.
    *   **Impact:** Container escape, host compromise, data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use trusted and well-maintained containerd plugins.
        *   Keep containerd and its plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Carefully review the security implications of any new plugins before enabling them.
        *   Consider disabling unnecessary plugins to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Snapshotter Implementation](./attack_surfaces/insecure_snapshotter_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** containerd uses snapshotters to manage container filesystem layers. Vulnerabilities in the chosen snapshotter implementation can lead to security issues.
    *   **How containerd contributes:** containerd integrates with and relies on the chosen snapshotter for managing container images and layers. The security of the snapshotter directly impacts containerd's security.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the overlayfs snapshotter could allow a malicious container to access or modify files in other containers or on the host filesystem.
    *   **Impact:** Container escape, data corruption, potential host compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use well-vetted and secure snapshotter implementations.
        *   Keep containerd and the snapshotter implementation updated.
        *   Understand the security implications of the chosen snapshotter and configure it appropriately.
