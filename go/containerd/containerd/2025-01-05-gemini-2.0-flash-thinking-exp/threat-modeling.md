# Threat Model Analysis for containerd/containerd

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to containerd API](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_containerd_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the containerd API socket without providing valid credentials. They might then create, start, stop, or delete containers, pull malicious images, or retrieve sensitive information about running containers and the host.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the container environment, potential data breaches, denial of service, and the ability to pivot to the host system.
    *   **Affected Component:** containerd API (gRPC endpoint, Unix socket)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) for the containerd API socket and enforce client certificate authentication.
        *   Use a proper authorization mechanism (e.g., containerd's built-in authz plugins or external authorization services) to control access to API endpoints.
        *   Restrict access to the containerd API socket using file system permissions.

## Threat: [Container Escape via Kernel Vulnerability](./threats/container_escape_via_kernel_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious container exploits a vulnerability in the Linux kernel to break out of its isolation boundaries and gain unauthorized access to the host system. This could involve exploiting flaws in namespaces, cgroups, or other kernel features used by containerd.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the host system, access to sensitive data, and the ability to control other containers.
    *   **Affected Component:** Runtime (runc interaction, kernel namespaces and cgroups)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the host operating system kernel up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Enable and properly configure security features like SELinux or AppArmor to provide mandatory access control.
        *   Minimize the capabilities granted to containers (drop unnecessary capabilities).
        *   Consider using a hardened kernel or a container-optimized operating system.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion Attack](./threats/resource_exhaustion_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker deploys or manipulates a container to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on the host, leading to a denial of service for other containers or the host itself.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, performance degradation, and potential host instability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Resource Management (cgroup integration)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource quotas and limits for containers using cgroups.
        *   Monitor container resource usage and set up alerts for abnormal consumption.
        *   Use quality of service (QoS) mechanisms to prioritize critical containers.
        *   Regularly review and adjust resource limits based on application needs.

## Threat: [Volume Mount Vulnerabilities](./threats/volume_mount_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** A container with improperly configured volume mounts gains unauthorized access to sensitive data or can modify critical files on the host system. This could occur due to incorrect mount permissions or mounting sensitive host paths into containers.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, host system compromise, and potential disruption of services.
    *   **Affected Component:** Volume Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring volume mounts. Only mount necessary paths with the minimum required permissions.
        *   Avoid mounting sensitive host paths into containers unless absolutely necessary.
        *   Use read-only mounts where appropriate.
        *   Implement security context constraints to restrict volume mount capabilities.

## Threat: [Containerd API Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/containerd_api_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the containerd API itself (e.g., a bug in a specific API endpoint or a parsing error) to gain unauthorized control or cause a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Container environment compromise, potential host compromise, and service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** containerd API (specific endpoints or modules)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep containerd updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor containerd release notes and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization when interacting with the containerd API.

## Threat: [Compromised CNI Plugin](./threats/compromised_cni_plugin.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin used by containerd. This could allow them to manipulate network traffic, bypass network isolation, or gain access to container networks.
    *   **Impact:** Network segmentation bypass, data interception, and potential lateral movement within the container environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** CNI Integration (network namespace management, IP address allocation)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use trusted and well-maintained CNI plugins.
        *   Keep CNI plugins updated to the latest versions.
        *   Implement network policies to restrict communication between containers and networks.
        *   Regularly audit the configuration of CNI plugins.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on containerd Binaries](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_containerd_binaries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the build or distribution process of containerd binaries, injecting malicious code into the containerd runtime itself.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the container environment, as the core runtime is compromised.
    *   **Affected Component:** Distribution and Build Process
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download containerd binaries from official and trusted sources.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums or signatures.
        *   Consider using a supply chain security tool to verify the provenance of the containerd installation.
