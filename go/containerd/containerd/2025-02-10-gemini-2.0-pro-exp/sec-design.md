# Project Design Document: containerd

## BUSINESS POSTURE

containerd is a core container runtime, initially developed by Docker and later donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Its primary goal is to provide a stable, performant, and secure foundation for running containers. It's designed to be embedded into larger systems, rather than being used directly by end-users.

Business priorities:

- Reliability: As a core component of container orchestration systems (like Kubernetes), containerd must be highly reliable. Downtime or instability directly impacts all applications running on top of it.
- Performance: Container startup time and overall runtime performance are critical for many use cases, especially in serverless and high-density environments.
- Security: containerd must provide a secure environment for running containers, isolating them from each other and the host system.
- Extensibility: The ability to integrate with different container ecosystems and support various plugins (for networking, storage, etc.) is crucial.
- Maintainability: As an open-source project, maintainability and a clear codebase are essential for long-term sustainability and community contributions.
- Compliance: Meeting industry standards and compliance requirements (e.g., OCI specifications) is necessary for broad adoption.

Most important business risks:

- Security vulnerabilities in containerd could lead to container escapes or other exploits, compromising the entire system.
- Performance bottlenecks could impact application performance and scalability.
- Incompatibility with evolving container standards or orchestration tools could limit adoption.
- Lack of maintainability could hinder future development and bug fixes.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Namespaces: containerd leverages Linux namespaces extensively to isolate containers from each other and the host system (process, network, mount, IPC, UTS, user). Described in the core code and design documentation.
- security control: Cgroups: Control groups (cgroups) are used to limit and monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) by containers. Described in the core code and design documentation.
- security control: Seccomp: Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) profiles are used to restrict the system calls that containers can make, reducing the attack surface. Described in the core code and design documentation. Configurable via CRI.
- security control: AppArmor/SELinux: Support for mandatory access control systems like AppArmor and SELinux provides an additional layer of security. Described in the core code and design documentation. Configurable via CRI.
- security control: Rootless containers: containerd supports running containers as non-root users, further enhancing security. Described in documentation and implemented in the codebase.
- security control: Image signature verification: containerd can verify the signatures of container images to ensure they haven't been tampered with. Implemented via plugins and described in documentation.
- security control: Regular security audits: The CNCF and the containerd community conduct regular security audits and penetration testing. Reports are typically published publicly.
- security control: Secure development practices: The project follows secure coding guidelines and uses static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities. Described in contribution guidelines.
- security control: OCI Compliance: Adherence to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) specifications ensures interoperability and a baseline level of security.

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Complexity: The inherent complexity of container runtimes introduces a large attack surface.
- accepted risk: Plugin security: The security of containerd relies partly on the security of its plugins (e.g., for networking, storage).
- accepted risk: Kernel vulnerabilities: containerd is ultimately dependent on the security of the underlying Linux kernel.

Recommended security controls:

- Implement a robust vulnerability management process, including regular scanning of dependencies.
- Enhance fuzzing efforts to identify potential vulnerabilities proactively.
- Provide more detailed security documentation and best practices guides for users and integrators.

Security requirements:

- Authentication:
  - Authentication is typically handled by the higher-level system that embeds containerd (e.g., Kubernetes API server).
  - containerd itself primarily deals with authorization based on pre-authenticated requests.
- Authorization:
  - containerd uses a gRPC API with authorization checks to ensure that only authorized clients can perform specific actions (e.g., creating containers, pulling images).
  - Authorization policies can be configured to restrict access based on user roles or other attributes.
- Input Validation:
  - All inputs to the containerd API (e.g., container configurations, image names) should be strictly validated to prevent injection attacks or other vulnerabilities.
  - Image names and references should be parsed and validated according to the OCI specification.
- Cryptography:
  - TLS should be used to secure communication between containerd and its clients.
  - Image signatures should be verified using cryptographic algorithms (e.g., RSA, ECDSA).
  - Sensitive data (e.g., secrets) should be encrypted at rest and in transit.

### DEPLOYMENT

containerd can be deployed in various ways, depending on the environment and the orchestration system used. Here are a few common scenarios:

1.  **As part of Kubernetes:** This is the most common deployment model. containerd is typically installed on each node of a Kubernetes cluster and configured as the container runtime via the CRI (Container Runtime Interface).
2.  **Standalone:** containerd can be deployed as a standalone daemon on a single machine, without Kubernetes. This is useful for development, testing, or specialized use cases.
3.  **Embedded in other systems:** containerd is designed to be embedded into other systems, such as cloud platforms or IoT devices.

We'll describe the Kubernetes deployment model in detail:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Node1[Kubernetes Node 1]
        kubelet[Kubelet] --> containerd[containerd]
        containerd --> OCI_Runtime[(OCI Runtime)]
    end
    subgraph Node2[Kubernetes Node 2]
        kubelet2[Kubelet] --> containerd2[containerd]
        containerd2 --> OCI_Runtime2[(OCI Runtime)]
    end
    API_Server[(Kubernetes API Server)] --> kubelet
    API_Server --> kubelet2
```

### BUILD

containerd's build process is automated using Go build tools and Makefiles. The build process includes several security checks:

1.  **Code linting:** Static analysis tools (like `go vet`, `golint`) are used to identify potential code quality issues and style violations.
2.  **Dependency management:** Go modules are used to manage dependencies, and tools like `dependabot` are used to track and update vulnerable dependencies.
3.  **Static analysis:** Static analysis security testing (SAST) tools are used to scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
4.  **Fuzzing:** Fuzz testing is used to identify potential vulnerabilities by providing random inputs to the system.
5.  **Unit and integration tests:** A comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests ensures that the code behaves as expected and helps prevent regressions.
6.  **Release signing:** Official releases of containerd are signed with a cryptographic key to ensure their authenticity and integrity.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes to protect:

-   Container orchestration: containerd is a critical component of container orchestration systems like Kubernetes. Its failure or compromise would disrupt the operation of all applications running on the cluster.
-   Image management: containerd is responsible for pulling, storing, and managing container images. Compromise of this process could lead to the execution of malicious images.
-   Container execution: containerd is responsible for creating and running containers. Vulnerabilities in this area could lead to container escapes or other exploits.

Data to protect and their sensitivity:

-   Container images: Container images may contain sensitive data, such as application code, configuration files, or secrets. Sensitivity: High.
-   Container metadata: Container metadata (e.g., environment variables, labels) may contain sensitive information. Sensitivity: Medium to High.
-   Runtime data: Data processed by running containers may be highly sensitive, depending on the application. Sensitivity: Varies, potentially High.
-   containerd configuration: containerd's configuration files may contain sensitive information, such as credentials for accessing image registries. Sensitivity: High.
