## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Containerd Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_containerd_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1. Exploit Containerd Vulnerabilities**

    *   **1.1 Vulnerability in containerd daemon (shim, API, etc.) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** This involves finding and exploiting vulnerabilities directly within the core components of containerd. This could be in the `containerd` daemon, the `containerd-shim`, the gRPC API, or other internal parts. Examples include buffer overflows, race conditions, improper input validation, or logic errors that could lead to arbitrary code execution or information disclosure.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   CVE-2020-15257: Unprivileged access to host network namespaces via the containerd API.
            *   CVE-2021-41190: Data leak in containerd's CRI implementation.
            *   A hypothetical zero-day in the shim allowing arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (if regularly updated) to Medium (if updates are delayed).
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High.
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High.
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.
        *   **Actionable Insights:**
            *   Regularly update containerd to the latest stable release.
            *   Implement vulnerability scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
            *   Consider fuzzing the containerd API.
            *   Conduct code audits of critical components.
            *   Run containerd with the least necessary privileges.

*   **2. Escape Container Boundaries**
    *   **2.1 Vulnerability in Kernel / cgroups / namespaces [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying Linux kernel features (cgroups, namespaces) that provide container isolation. A successful exploit allows a process inside a container to break out and gain access to the host system, often with elevated privileges.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   "Dirty COW" (CVE-2016-5195): Kernel vulnerability leading to privilege escalation.
            *   Vulnerabilities in specific cgroup implementations.
            *   Namespace-related vulnerabilities allowing escape from the container's isolated view.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium.
        *   **Impact:** Very High.
        *   **Effort:** High to Very High.
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard.
        *   **Actionable Insights:**
            *   Keep the host operating system's kernel up-to-date.
            *   Use strict Seccomp profiles to limit system calls.
            *   Employ AppArmor/SELinux for mandatory access control.
            *   Utilize user namespaces to map container root to an unprivileged host user.
            *   Drop unnecessary Linux capabilities from containers.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Abuse Weak Containerd Configuration [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/4__abuse_weak_containerd_configuration__critical___high_risk_.md)

*   **4. Abuse Weak Containerd Configuration [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in how containerd is configured or how its API is exposed. This often involves taking advantage of insecure defaults, missing security controls, or overly permissive settings.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Exposing the containerd gRPC API to the public internet without authentication or TLS.
        *   Using weak or default credentials for API access.
        *   Misconfiguring registry settings to allow pulling images from untrusted sources.
        *   Running containerd with excessive privileges.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.

        *   Isolate the network where containerd is running.
        *   Review and harden the `config.toml` file.
        *   Run containerd with the minimum necessary privileges (avoid root).
        *   Enable and monitor containerd's audit logs.
        *   Only pull images from trusted registries and verify signatures.

    *   **4.1 Vulnerability in containerd configuration / API [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** This is a specific, highly dangerous instance of abusing weak configuration, focusing on direct, unauthorized access to the containerd API.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   Directly connecting to an unauthenticated containerd API endpoint and issuing commands.
            *   Exploiting weak authentication mechanisms to gain API access.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High.
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate.
