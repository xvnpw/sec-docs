# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for containerd/containerd

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Containerd](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_containerd.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Containerd

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Monitor Releases:** Subscribe to containerd's GitHub releases and security advisories.  This can be done via GitHub notifications, RSS feeds, or by regularly checking the release page.
        2.  **Establish Update Process:** Define a clear process for applying updates. This should include:
            *   **Testing:**  Deploy updates to a staging environment first.  Run thorough tests to ensure compatibility with your applications and infrastructure.
            *   **Rollback Plan:** Have a plan to revert to the previous version if issues arise.
            *   **Automation:**  Ideally, use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools (e.g., Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes operators) to automate the update process. This reduces manual errors and ensures consistency.
            *   **Downtime Considerations:** Plan for potential downtime during updates, especially if you're not using a rolling update mechanism.
        3.  **Update Frequency:**  Establish a regular update cadence (e.g., monthly, quarterly).  Prioritize security updates immediately upon release.
        4.  **Verification:** After updating, verify the containerd version and check logs for any errors.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs):**  Severity: **High to Critical**.  Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in containerd can lead to container escape, host compromise, denial of service, or information disclosure.  Regular updates patch these vulnerabilities.
        *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Less Likely):** Severity: **Critical**. While updates primarily address known issues, they can sometimes indirectly mitigate zero-day exploits by fixing underlying code weaknesses.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduction: **High**.  Regular updates are the *primary* defense against known exploits.
        *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Risk reduction: **Low to Moderate**. Updates offer some protection, but dedicated zero-day defenses are also needed.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   *Example:* Partially implemented. Updates are performed manually on a quarterly basis. Staging environment is used, but the process is not automated.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   *Example:* Full automation of the update process using IaC.  Real-time monitoring of new releases and immediate application of security patches.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Containerd Configuration (`config.toml`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_containerd_configuration___config_toml__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Containerd Configuration (`config.toml`)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Review `config.toml`:** Obtain the current `config.toml` file.
        2.  **`root` and `state` Permissions:** Ensure the directories specified by `root` and `state` are owned by the containerd user and have restrictive permissions (e.g., `700` or `750`).  Use `chown` and `chmod` to adjust permissions if necessary.
        3.  **Runtime Configuration:**
            *   Navigate to the `plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes` section.
            *   For each runtime (e.g., `runc`, `gvisor`), ensure it's configured securely (see separate runtime mitigation strategies below). This includes setting runtime-specific options *within* the `config.toml`.
        4.  **Registry Configuration:**
            *   Go to `plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry`.
            *   If using private registries, configure authentication securely.  *Avoid* storing credentials directly in `config.toml`. Use a secrets management solution (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, environment variables) and reference those secrets within the `config.toml`.
            *   Configure mirror registries if needed, ensuring they are trusted, *within* the `config.toml`.
        5.  **CNI Configuration:**
            *   Check `plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".cni`.
            *   Verify that the CNI plugin is correctly configured. Refer to the CNI plugin's documentation for security best practices. While the CNI plugin itself is external, its *configuration* is managed within containerd's `config.toml`.
        6.  **Disable Unused Plugins:**  Comment out or remove any plugins within the `config.toml` that are not actively used.
        7.  **Dedicated User:** Ensure containerd is running as a non-root user. Check the systemd unit file (or equivalent) to verify this. *This is not directly in config.toml, but is a crucial related step.*
        8.  **Restart Containerd:** After making changes, restart the containerd service to apply them.
        9. **Validate:** Verify the configuration by running test containers and checking logs.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Severity: **High**.  Misconfigured permissions or running containerd as root can allow attackers to gain elevated privileges on the host.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Severity: **Medium to High**.  Exposed credentials in `config.toml` can lead to unauthorized access to registries or other resources.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Severity: **Medium**.  Misconfigured resource limits or CNI settings can lead to denial-of-service attacks.
        *   **Compromised Runtimes/Plugins:** Severity: **High**.  Vulnerabilities in configured runtimes or plugins can be exploited if they are not properly secured.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduction: **High**.  Proper permissions and running as a non-root user are fundamental security measures.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: **High**.  Secure credential management is crucial.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduction: **Moderate**.  Proper configuration helps prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   **Compromised Runtimes/Plugins:** Risk reduction: **Moderate**.  Secure configuration complements runtime-specific security measures.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   *Example:* Partially implemented.  `root` and `state` permissions are correct. Containerd runs as a non-root user.  Basic runtime configuration is in place.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   *Example:* Secure credential management for private registries is not implemented (credentials are in `config.toml`).  CNI plugin security is not regularly reviewed.  Unused plugins are not disabled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Runtime Configuration - `runc` (Example - within `config.toml`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_runtime_configuration_-__runc___example_-_within__config_toml__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Runtime Configuration - `runc` (Example - within `config.toml`)

    *   **Description:**  All of these settings are configured *within* containerd's `config.toml` file, under the specific runtime configuration section (e.g., `plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.runc`).
        1.  **AppArmor/SELinux:**
            *   **Apply Profiles:** Configure containerd to use AppArmor or SELinux profiles for containers. This is done using annotations or options within the `runc` runtime configuration in `config.toml`.  You would specify the profile name to be used.
        2.  **Seccomp:**
            *   **Apply Profile:** Configure containerd to use a seccomp profile. This is done by specifying the path to the seccomp profile JSON file within the `runc` runtime configuration in `config.toml`.
        3.  **User Namespaces:**
            *   **Enable:** Enable user namespaces. This usually involves setting options in the `runc` section of `config.toml`.
            *   **Configure Mapping:** Configure the user ID mapping. This might involve setting specific UID/GID mappings within the `config.toml`.
        4.  **Capabilities:**
            *   **Drop Unnecessary Capabilities:** Use the `capabilities` option within the `runc` runtime configuration in `config.toml` to specify which capabilities to *keep*.  All others will be dropped.  Start with an empty list and add only what's absolutely necessary.
        5. **Test:** Thoroughly test after modifying the `config.toml`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Container Escape:** Severity: **Critical**. AppArmor/SELinux, seccomp, and user namespaces significantly reduce the risk.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (within container):** Severity: **High**. Dropping capabilities limits actions.
        *   **System Call Exploitation:** Severity: **High**. Seccomp restricts system calls.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Container Escape:** Risk reduction: **High**. Essential mitigations.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduction: **High**. Capabilities are key.
        *   **System Call Exploitation:** Risk reduction: **High**. Seccomp is powerful.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   *Example:* User namespaces are enabled (via `config.toml`). Default seccomp profile is used (via `config.toml`).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   *Example:* Custom AppArmor/SELinux profiles are not configured in `config.toml`. Capabilities are not explicitly dropped (relying on defaults). Seccomp profile is not tailored to the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Containerd's Privileges (via systemd or init system)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_containerd's_privileges__via_systemd_or_init_system_.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Containerd's Privileges (via systemd or init system)

    * **Description:**
        1.  **Non-Root User:** Ensure containerd runs as a non-root user. This is typically configured in the systemd unit file (or equivalent init system configuration).  *This is not directly within `config.toml`, but is a critical, directly related step.*
        2.  **Restrict Capabilities (systemd):**  If using systemd, use the `CapabilityBoundingSet=` directive in the containerd service unit file to restrict the capabilities of the containerd *daemon* itself (not the containers it runs).  This limits what containerd can do, even if compromised.
        3. **Read-Only Root Filesystem (systemd):** If possible and appropriate for your setup, consider using `ReadOnlyPaths=/` in the systemd unit file to make the host's root filesystem read-only for the containerd daemon.
        4. **PrivateTmp (systemd):** Use `PrivateTmp=true` in the systemd unit file to give containerd its own private `/tmp` directory, preventing potential issues with shared temporary files.
        5. **NoNewPrivileges (systemd):** Use `NoNewPrivileges=true` to prevent containerd (and potentially its child processes) from gaining new privileges.
        6. **Restart systemd and containerd:** After modifying the systemd unit file, reload systemd (`systemctl daemon-reload`) and restart containerd (`systemctl restart containerd`).

    * **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Compromise of Containerd Daemon:** Severity: **High**. Limiting the privileges of the containerd daemon itself reduces the impact of a vulnerability in containerd.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (from containerd to host):** Severity: **High**. Restricting capabilities and using a non-root user make it harder for an attacker to escalate privileges from a compromised containerd daemon to the host.

    * **Impact:**
        *   **Compromise of Containerd Daemon:** Risk reduction: **High**. These are crucial steps to limit the blast radius of a containerd compromise.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduction: **High**. These measures directly address privilege escalation risks.

    * **Currently Implemented:**
        *   *Example:* Containerd runs as a non-root user.

    * **Missing Implementation:**
        *   *Example:* Capabilities are not restricted for the containerd daemon. `ReadOnlyPaths`, `PrivateTmp`, and `NoNewPrivileges` are not used in the systemd unit file.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Communication with Containerd (TLS and Authentication)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_communication_with_containerd__tls_and_authentication_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Communication with Containerd (TLS and Authentication)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **TLS Configuration:**
            *   **Generate Certificates:** Generate TLS certificates (server and client certificates) for the containerd API.
            *   **Configure `config.toml`:** Configure the `grpc` section of `config.toml` to use TLS. This involves specifying the paths to the server certificate, server key, and CA certificate.
            *   **Client Configuration:** Configure clients that interact with the containerd API (e.g., `ctr`, Kubernetes kubelet) to use TLS and provide the client certificate and key.
        2.  **Authentication:**
            *   **Choose an Authentication Method:**  Select an authentication method (e.g., client certificate authentication, token-based authentication). Containerd supports various authentication mechanisms.
            *   **Configure `config.toml`:** Configure authentication in the `grpc` section of `config.toml`. This will depend on the chosen authentication method.
        3. **Restart Containerd:** Restart containerd after making changes.
        4. **Test:** Verify that clients can connect securely and that authentication is enforced.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Containerd API:** Severity: **High**. TLS and authentication prevent unauthorized clients from interacting with the containerd daemon.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Severity: **High**. TLS encrypts communication, preventing attackers from eavesdropping on or modifying API requests.
        *   **Credential Theft:** Severity: **Medium**. Using client certificates avoids the need to store passwords.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduction: **High**. This is the primary defense against unauthorized access.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduction: **High**. TLS is essential for secure communication.
        *   **Credential Theft:** Risk reduction: **Moderate**. Client certificates improve security.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   *Example:*  None. The containerd API is accessed without TLS or authentication.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   *Example:*  TLS configuration and authentication are not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure containerd Audit Logs](./mitigation_strategies/configure_containerd_audit_logs.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure containerd Audit Logs

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Enable Auditing:**  Containerd uses the system's audit framework (typically `auditd` on Linux). Ensure that `auditd` is installed and running.
        2.  **Configure Audit Rules:** Create audit rules to log containerd-related events. This involves adding rules to `/etc/audit/rules.d/` (or the appropriate directory for your distribution).  You'll need to create rules that specifically target the containerd executable and related system calls.
        3.  **Log Format:**  Consider the log format and how you will collect and analyze the logs.
        4.  **Log Rotation:** Configure log rotation for the audit logs to prevent them from consuming excessive disk space.
        5. **Restart auditd:** After modifying the audit rules, restart the `auditd` service.
        6. **Test:** Generate some containerd activity (e.g., create a container) and verify that the events are logged.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Intrusion Detection:** Severity: **Medium**. Audit logs provide a record of containerd activity, which can be used to detect suspicious behavior.
        *   **Forensic Analysis:** Severity: **Medium**. Audit logs are crucial for investigating security incidents.
        *   **Compliance:** Severity: **Low to Medium**. Audit logs can help meet compliance requirements.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Intrusion Detection:** Risk reduction: **Moderate**. Audit logs are a valuable tool for detecting intrusions, but they require monitoring and analysis.
        *   **Forensic Analysis:** Risk reduction: **High**. Audit logs are essential for post-incident analysis.
        *   **Compliance:** Risk reduction: **Variable**. Depends on the specific compliance requirements.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   *Example:*  No specific audit rules for containerd are configured.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   *Example:*  Audit rules targeting containerd events are not created. Log collection and analysis are not set up.
