# Threat Model Analysis for containerd/containerd

## Threat: [Container Escape (Privilege Escalation) - via containerd-shim/runc](./threats/container_escape__privilege_escalation__-_via_containerd-shimrunc.md)

*   **1. Threat: Container Escape (Privilege Escalation) - via containerd-shim/runc**

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within* `containerd-shim` or the OCI runtime (`runc`, which containerd uses) to break out of the container's isolation. This is *not* about a general container escape due to a kernel bug, but a specific flaw in how containerd interacts with the runtime or manages the container. The attacker would need to have code execution inside the container *and* exploit a containerd/runc-specific vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Complete host system compromise, access to all other containers, data exfiltration, persistence.
    *   **Affected Component:** `containerd-shim`, `runc` (as invoked by containerd), containerd's cgroup and namespace management *logic*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediate Patching:** Keep `containerd` and `runc` *absolutely* up-to-date.  Prioritize security releases. This is the most critical mitigation.
        *   **Runtime Hardening:**  Even with patching, consider using seccomp, AppArmor/SELinux, and capability dropping to limit the *impact* of a potential `runc` or `containerd-shim` vulnerability.  These are defense-in-depth measures.
        *   **Minimal Base Images:** While not directly preventing a containerd escape, using minimal images reduces the attack surface *within* the container, making it harder for an attacker to find tools to exploit a vulnerability.
        *   **Runtime Monitoring:** Use runtime security tools that can detect anomalous system calls or process behavior that might indicate an escape attempt *even if the vulnerability is unknown*.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Containerd API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_containerd_api.md)

*   **2. Threat: Unauthorized Access to Containerd API**

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the containerd gRPC API. This is a direct threat to containerd because it's about exploiting weaknesses in *containerd's own API*. The attacker could then issue commands to start, stop, create, or modify containers, potentially leading to container escape or other malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over containerd, ability to manage all containers, potential for host compromise (if a container escape is then possible), data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected Component:** `containerd/api` (gRPC server), containerd's authentication and authorization implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory mTLS:**  *Always* secure the containerd API with TLS encryption *and* mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.  Do not rely on network isolation alone.
        *   **Strong Authorization:** Implement robust authorization policies using containerd's authorization plugin mechanism.  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to API clients.
        *   **API Gateway/Proxy:**  Do *not* expose the containerd API directly. Use a reverse proxy or API gateway to handle authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
        *   **Auditing:** Enable and regularly review audit logs for the containerd API to detect unauthorized access attempts.

## Threat: [Snapshotter Vulnerability (Exploitation *through* Containerd)](./threats/snapshotter_vulnerability__exploitation_through_containerd_.md)

*   **3. Threat: Snapshotter Vulnerability (Exploitation *through* Containerd)**

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a snapshotter plugin *used by containerd*. This is distinct from a general filesystem issue; it's about how containerd *interacts* with the snapshotter.  The vulnerability could allow the attacker to corrupt container images, gain unauthorized access to data, or cause a denial of service *by leveraging containerd's use of the snapshotter*.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, denial of service, potential for unauthorized data access (if the vulnerability allows reading outside the intended container filesystem).
    *   **Affected Component:** `containerd/snapshots` (specifically, the vulnerable snapshotter plugin being used, e.g., overlayfs, btrfs).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prompt Snapshotter Updates:**  Keep all snapshotter plugins used by containerd updated to the latest versions.  Monitor for security advisories specific to the snapshotters you use.
        *   **Snapshotter Choice:**  If possible, choose snapshotters with a strong security track record and active maintenance.
        *   **Filesystem Integrity (Defense-in-Depth):** While not preventing the initial vulnerability, using filesystem integrity checking tools *within* the container can help detect if a snapshotter vulnerability has been exploited to modify files.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Against Containerd Itself](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__against_containerd_itself.md)

*   **4. Threat: Denial of Service (DoS) Against Containerd Itself**

    *   **Description:** An attacker targets containerd *directly* with a denial-of-service attack. This is *not* about a container consuming resources, but about attacking containerd's own processes or API.  This could involve flooding the API with requests, exploiting a vulnerability in containerd's request handling, or causing containerd to crash.
    *   **Impact:** Inability to manage containers, inability to start new containers, potential disruption of existing containers (if containerd crashes).
    *   **Affected Component:** `containerd/api` (gRPC server), core containerd daemon processes, potentially specific plugins depending on the attack vector.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **API Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the containerd API to prevent request flooding. This should be done at the API gateway/proxy level.
        *   **Resource Limits (for containerd):** Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for the containerd daemon itself to prevent it from being overwhelmed.
        *   **Input Validation:** Ensure that containerd properly validates all input received through the API and other interfaces to prevent attacks that exploit parsing or handling vulnerabilities. (This is primarily a developer responsibility).
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor containerd's resource usage and API responsiveness, and set up alerts for any anomalies that might indicate a DoS attack.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the containerd codebase to identify and address potential DoS vulnerabilities.
