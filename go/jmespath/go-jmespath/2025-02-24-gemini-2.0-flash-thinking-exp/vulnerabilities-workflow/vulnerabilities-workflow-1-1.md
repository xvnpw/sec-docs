Okay, based on your instructions and the current assessment that there are no high or critical vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria, the vulnerability list remains as you provided.

## Vulnerability List

There are no identified vulnerabilities of high or critical rank in the provided project files that meet the specified criteria.

**Explanation:**

Based on the provided instructions, the analysis focused on identifying vulnerabilities of high or critical rank that are:

*   **Valid and not mitigated:**  Only vulnerabilities that are confirmed to be present and are not already fixed in the project are considered.
*   **Ranked High or Critical:**  The vulnerabilities must be classified as at least "high" in severity.
*   **Triggerable by an external attacker:** The vulnerability must be exploitable by an attacker from outside the application's internal network, targeting a publicly accessible instance.
*   **Not due to insecure code patterns in PROJECT FILES:** Vulnerabilities stemming directly from developers using insecure functions or libraries provided within "PROJECT FILES" are excluded.
*   **Not solely missing documentation:** Vulnerabilities that are only due to a lack of documentation to guide secure usage are excluded.
*   **Not Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities:** Vulnerabilities that primarily lead to denial of service are excluded.

After analyzing the project files (which are not provided to me, so I am assuming this is based on your analysis), no vulnerabilities meeting all of these criteria with a rank of high or critical were found.

If further analysis reveals vulnerabilities that meet these criteria, the list will be updated with the requested details in markdown format.
