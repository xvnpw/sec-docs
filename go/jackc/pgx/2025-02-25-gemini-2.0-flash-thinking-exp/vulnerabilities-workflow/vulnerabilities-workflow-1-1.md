### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Integer Overflow in Message Size Calculation leading to SQL Injection (CVE-2024-27304)

* Description:
    1. A threat actor crafts a single SQL query or bind message exceeding 4 GB in size.
    2. Due to an integer overflow in the message size calculation within pgx versions prior to 5.5.4, the large message's size is incorrectly calculated.
    3. This incorrect size calculation leads to the oversized message being fragmented and sent as multiple smaller messages.
    4. The attacker gains control over these fragmented messages, enabling them to inject malicious SQL commands within the message stream.
    5. When the server processes these fragmented messages, the injected SQL is executed, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability.

* Impact:
    * Critical. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary SQL injection, potentially leading to full database compromise, data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * **Mitigated**: This vulnerability is fixed in pgx version 5.5.4 and later. The fix is mentioned in `CHANGELOG.md` under version 5.5.4 with the title "Fix CVE-2024-27304". The specific code changes are not included in the provided PROJECT FILES, but the changelog entry confirms the mitigation.

* Missing Mitigations:
    * No further mitigations are needed as the vulnerability is already addressed in the latest versions. Users should upgrade to pgx v5.5.4 or later.

* Preconditions:
    * The application must be using a pgx version prior to 5.5.4.
    * An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted query or bind message larger than 4GB to the application that uses pgx to communicate with PostgreSQL.

* Source Code Analysis:
    * The provided PROJECT FILES do not contain the specific code where the integer overflow occurred and was fixed. However, the `CHANGELOG.md` clearly indicates that CVE-2024-27304 was addressed in version 5.5.4.
    * To understand the root cause, one would need to examine the code diff between pgx v5.5.3 and v5.5.4, specifically looking at how message size calculations are handled, especially for large queries and bind messages within the `pgproto3` package, which is responsible for encoding and decoding the PostgreSQL wire protocol. It is likely that the fix involved changing the data type used for message size calculation to a larger integer type (e.g., from `int32` to `int64`) to prevent overflow when dealing with messages exceeding 4GB.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**: Use a pgx version prior to 5.5.4 in a test environment connected to a PostgreSQL database.
    2. **Craft Malicious Payload**: Construct a SQL query or bind message that is larger than 4GB. This payload should include a malicious SQL injection part, for example, a `SELECT` statement that attempts to extract sensitive data or modify data. The exact method to create a >4GB message will depend on PostgreSQL and pgx protocol details. It might involve extremely long strings or binary data.
    3. **Send Payload**: Send this crafted payload to the application which uses the vulnerable pgx library to communicate with the PostgreSQL database.
    4. **Verify Exploitation**: Check if the malicious SQL injection was executed on the database server. This can be verified by observing database logs, checking for data modifications, or confirming data exfiltration if the injected SQL was designed to do so. For instance, if the injected SQL was intended to create a new user with admin privileges, attempt to log in with those new credentials.
    5. **Expected Result (Vulnerable Version)**: The malicious SQL injection should be successful, proving the vulnerability.
    6. **Test Fixed Version**: Repeat steps 1-4 with pgx version 5.5.4 or later.
    7. **Expected Result (Fixed Version)**: The malicious SQL injection should fail, and the application should handle large messages correctly without allowing SQL injection, confirming the mitigation.
