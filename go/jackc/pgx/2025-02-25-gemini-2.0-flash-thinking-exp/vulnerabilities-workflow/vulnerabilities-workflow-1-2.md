### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Integer Overflow in Message Size Calculation (CVE-2024-27304 Fix Verification)
- Description:
    1. An attacker sends a single query or bind message exceeding 4 GB in size to the PostgreSQL server through pgx.
    2. Due to an integer overflow in the message size calculation within pgx, the large message is incorrectly split into multiple smaller messages.
    3. These smaller messages are then processed by the PostgreSQL server under the attacker's control, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
- Impact: SQL injection or other undefined behavior due to mishandling of large messages.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Fix for CVE-2024-27304 was implemented in version 5.5.4. The CHANGELOG.md file mentions: "Fix CVE-2024-27304 SQL injection can occur if an attacker can cause a single query or bind message to exceed 4 GB in size. An integer overflow in the calculated message size can cause the one large message to be sent as multiple messages under the attacker's control."
- Missing Mitigations: None, the vulnerability is likely mitigated in version 5.5.4 and later. Verification is needed to ensure the fix is effective.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker can send arbitrary queries to the PostgreSQL server through a pgx application.
    - The pgx library version is prior to 5.5.4 or the fix is not correctly implemented.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability was related to integer overflow when calculating message size. Reviewing the commit history around version 5.5.4 would be needed to pinpoint the exact code fix.
    - Based on the CHANGELOG, the issue was in handling message sizes exceeding 4GB. The fix should address the integer overflow in size calculation and ensure proper handling of large messages. Deeper code analysis of `pgconn` package, specifically message encoding/decoding functions around version 5.5.4 is required to confirm the fix.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a PostgreSQL server and a pgx application using a version prior to 5.5.4 or a version where the fix is suspected to be missing or incomplete.
    2. Construct a single SQL query or bind message that is larger than 4GB. This could be achieved by inserting a very large bytea value or a very long string.
    3. Send this crafted query to the PostgreSQL server through the pgx application.
    4. Observe the server-side behavior. If the vulnerability is present, the server might exhibit unexpected behavior, errors, or signs of SQL injection if the attacker can control parts of the split messages.
    5. Repeat the test with pgx version 5.5.4 or later. The vulnerability should be mitigated, and the server should handle the large message without unexpected behavior. Ideally, the connection should be closed or an error returned gracefully, preventing potential injection.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential SQL Injection in Simple Protocol due to Incomplete Sanitization (CVE-2024-27304 related - although different vector)
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious SQL query designed to exploit vulnerabilities in simple protocol sanitization.
    2. The attacker uses specific characters or sequences that are not properly escaped or handled by the `sanitize.SanitizeSQL` function, potentially bypassing the intended sanitization.
    3. If the crafted query is executed using the simple protocol (QueryExecModeSimpleProtocol), the malicious SQL code could be injected and executed by the PostgreSQL server.
- Impact: SQL Injection, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data, or execute arbitrary SQL commands.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - pgx uses `internal/sanitize.SanitizeSQL` for simple protocol query sanitization.
    - Version 5.5.5 CHANGELOG mentions "Use spaces instead of parentheses for SQL sanitization.", indicating an attempt to strengthen sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Current sanitization in `internal/sanitize.SanitizeSQL` might be incomplete, especially against sophisticated injection attempts.
    - Lack of comprehensive testing for simple protocol sanitization against various SQL injection vectors.
- Preconditions:
    - Application uses `QueryExecModeSimpleProtocol`.
    - Application constructs SQL queries dynamically based on user input and uses simple protocol to execute them.
    - `standard_conforming_strings` is set to `on` and `client_encoding` is set to `UTF8` as required by simple protocol.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Analyze `internal/sanitize/sanitize.go` and `conn.go`'s `sanitizeForSimpleQuery` function.
    - Verify the effectiveness of `sanitize.SanitizeSQL` against known SQL injection techniques, especially around edge cases and complex queries.
    - Check if all special characters and SQL keywords are properly escaped or handled.
    - Review the changes introduced in version 5.5.5 to understand the extent and limitations of the sanitization improvements.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a PostgreSQL server and a pgx application configured to use `QueryExecModeSimpleProtocol`.
    2. Identify SQL injection vectors that might bypass `sanitize.SanitizeSQL`. Examples could include:
        - Exploiting encoding issues.
        - Using specific SQL functions or operators that are not correctly sanitized.
        - Crafting queries with unusual syntax or edge cases.
    3. Construct a malicious SQL query incorporating these vectors and user-controlled input.
    4. Execute the crafted query through the pgx application using `QueryExecModeSimpleProtocol`.
    5. Observe if the SQL injection is successful. For example, try to bypass authentication, read unauthorized data, or modify data.
    6. If injection is successful, this confirms a vulnerability in simple protocol sanitization.
    7. Develop more robust sanitization logic or recommend against using `QueryExecModeSimpleProtocol` with dynamic queries based on untrusted input. Consider enforcing the use of prepared statements even in simple protocol if possible.
