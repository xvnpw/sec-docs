## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Moby

This list details high and critical security threats directly involving the `moby/moby` library.

### 1. Threat: Malicious Image Pull and Execution

- **Description:**
    - **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts a malicious container image and publishes it to a public or private registry. The application, using `moby/moby`'s image pulling functionality, retrieves and executes this image. The malicious image then performs actions like installing malware, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data.
- **Impact:**
    - Compromise of the container environment managed by `moby/moby`.
    - Potential compromise of the host system if container escape vulnerabilities within `moby/moby` exist.
    - Data breaches through exfiltration from within the container.
    - Denial of service by consuming resources managed by `moby/moby`.
- **Affected Moby Component:**
    - "Image Service" (responsible for pulling and managing images within `moby/moby`).
    - "Container Runtime" (responsible for executing the image, a core component of `moby/moby`).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use trusted and verified container image registries.
    - Implement container image scanning for vulnerabilities and malware *before* using `moby/moby` to run them.
    - Enforce image signing and verification to ensure image integrity before `moby/moby` processes them.
    - Regularly update base images to patch known vulnerabilities that could be exploited within the `moby/moby` environment.
    - Implement runtime security monitoring to detect suspicious container behavior managed by `moby/moby`.

### 2. Threat: Container Escape via Moby Vulnerability

- **Description:**
    - **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the `moby/moby` codebase itself (e.g., in the container runtime, the daemon, or related libraries). This allows them to break out of the container's isolation and gain privileged access to the host system.
- **Impact:**
    - Full control over the host operating system where `moby/moby` is running.
    - Access to sensitive data on the host.
    - Ability to compromise other containers managed by the same `moby/moby` instance.
    - Potential for denial of service of the host.
- **Affected Moby Component:**
    - "Container Runtime" (a core part of `moby/moby` responsible for isolation).
    - "Docker Daemon" (the central component of `moby/moby`).
    - Potentially other internal modules or libraries within `moby/moby`.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep `moby/moby` updated to the latest version with security patches.
    - Utilize security profiles like seccomp, AppArmor, or SELinux to restrict container capabilities, limiting the impact of potential escapes.
    - Regularly audit `moby/moby` configurations and security settings.
    - Consider using a hardened container runtime environment that integrates with `moby/moby`.

### 3. Threat: Docker Daemon API Exploitation

- **Description:**
    - **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Docker Daemon API, a key component of `moby/moby`. This can occur through network exposure without proper authentication or by exploiting vulnerabilities within the API implementation in `moby/moby`. This allows them to perform privileged operations like creating, starting, stopping, or deleting containers and images managed by `moby/moby`.
- **Impact:**
    - Full control over the container environment managed by `moby/moby`.
    - Potential for privilege escalation on the host if the `moby/moby` daemon itself is compromised.
    - Data breaches through access to container data or manipulation of running containers managed by `moby/moby`.
    - Denial of service by stopping or deleting critical containers managed by `moby/moby`.
- **Affected Moby Component:**
    - "Docker Daemon API" (the interface for managing Docker within `moby/moby`).
    - "Authentication and Authorization Modules" (within `moby/moby` responsible for securing API access).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Secure the Docker Daemon API with TLS and strong authentication as recommended by `moby/moby` documentation.
    - Restrict network access to the Docker Daemon API. Avoid exposing it publicly.
    - Regularly update `moby/moby` to patch API vulnerabilities.
    - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for Docker API access within `moby/moby`.
    - Consider using a dedicated management tool with enhanced security features that interacts with the `moby/moby` API securely.

### 4. Threat: Volume Mount Vulnerability Exploitation via Moby

- **Description:**
    - **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits insecurely configured volume mounts managed by `moby/moby`. This allows them to gain unauthorized access to files and directories on the host system or other containers. This can involve `moby/moby` mounting sensitive host paths into a container without proper read/write restrictions.
- **Impact:**
    - Data breaches by accessing sensitive host files through `moby/moby`'s volume mounting.
    - Data tampering by modifying host files via a container with improper volume permissions managed by `moby/moby`.
    - Privilege escalation if sensitive system files are accessible and modifiable through `moby/moby`'s volume management.
- **Affected Moby Component:**
    - "Volume Management" (the component within `moby/moby` responsible for managing volume mounts).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring volume mounts within `moby/moby`. Only mount necessary paths.
    - Set appropriate read-only or read-write permissions for volume mounts managed by `moby/moby`.
    - Avoid mounting sensitive host directories into containers unless absolutely necessary when using `moby/moby`.
    - Consider using named volumes instead of bind mounts for better isolation within the `moby/moby` environment.

### 5. Threat: Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Base Image (Impacting Moby)

- **Description:**
    - **Attacker Action:** An attacker compromises a base container image used in the application's build process. When `moby/moby` is used to build an image based on this compromised base, the resulting image inherits the malicious components.
- **Impact:**
    - Execution of malicious code within containers built and managed by `moby/moby`.
    - Backdoors allowing persistent access to the application environment managed by `moby/moby`.
    - Data exfiltration from containers built and run by `moby/moby`.
- **Affected Moby Component:**
    - "Image Builder" (the component within `moby/moby` responsible for building container images).
    - "Image Layers" (where the malicious code resides within the `moby/moby` image structure).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use official and trusted base images from reputable sources when building images with `moby/moby`.
    - Regularly scan base images for vulnerabilities before using them in `moby/moby` builds.
    - Implement a secure image build pipeline with integrity checks when using `moby/moby`.
    - Minimize the number of layers in your images built with `moby/moby` to reduce the attack surface.
