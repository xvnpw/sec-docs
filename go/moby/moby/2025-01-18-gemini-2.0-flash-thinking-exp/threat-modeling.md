# Threat Model Analysis for moby/moby

## Threat: [Container Escape](./threats/container_escape.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within the `moby/moby` components like `containerd` or `runc`, or leverages misconfigurations handled by the Docker daemon, to break out of the container's isolation and execute code on the host operating system.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the host system, potential access to sensitive data on the host, ability to compromise other containers running on the same host, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Moby Component:**
        *   `containerd` (container runtime interface)
        *   `runc` (container runtime) - while a separate project, it's tightly integrated with Moby.
        *   Docker Daemon (handling of namespaces, cgroups, and security profiles).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Docker daemon, `containerd`, and `runc` updated to the latest stable versions with security patches.
        *   Avoid running containers in privileged mode unless absolutely necessary.
        *   Utilize security profiles like AppArmor or SELinux, configured through Docker, to restrict container capabilities.
        *   Regularly audit container configurations for potential escape vectors.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Base Images](./threats/vulnerable_base_images.md)

*   **Description:** The application utilizes Docker images built upon base images containing known vulnerabilities. While the vulnerabilities reside in the image content, `moby/moby` is responsible for pulling, storing, and running these images, making it a direct participant in the risk. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities after the image is deployed by Moby.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the containerized application, potential data breaches, malware installation within the container, denial of service affecting the application.
    *   **Affected Moby Component:**
        *   Image management within the Docker daemon (pulling, storing, running).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools that integrate with the Docker daemon or registry.
        *   Choose official and well-maintained base images.
        *   Implement a process for regularly updating base images and rebuilding application images.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Docker Images](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_docker_images.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious actors compromise public or private Docker registries, injecting backdoors or malware into images that `moby/moby` pulls and runs. The Docker daemon is the mechanism by which these compromised images are introduced into the system.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application environment, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to systems, or the deployment of malware.
    *   **Affected Moby Component:**
        *   Image pulling and management within the Docker daemon.
        *   Interaction with Docker Hub or private registries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify the integrity and authenticity of Docker images using image signing and content trust (Docker Content Trust), a feature supported by Moby.
        *   Prefer using private registries with strong access controls.
        *   Carefully audit the source and build process of Docker images.

## Threat: [Insecure Docker API Access](./threats/insecure_docker_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** The Docker API, a core component of `moby/moby`, is exposed without proper authentication or authorization. This allows unauthorized users or processes to interact with the Docker daemon, potentially leading to the compromise of containers and the host.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the host, manipulation of containers, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Moby Component:**
        *   Docker API (exposed through the Docker daemon).
        *   Authentication and authorization mechanisms within the Docker daemon.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Docker daemon socket using TLS and client certificate authentication.
        *   Restrict access to the Docker API using network firewalls and access control lists.
        *   Avoid exposing the Docker API directly to the internet.

## Threat: [Insecure Container Configuration](./threats/insecure_container_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  `moby/moby` allows for various container configurations. Insecure configurations, such as running containers in privileged mode or with insecure volume mounts, can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Impact:** Increased attack surface, potential for container escape, data breaches due to exposed host resources, unauthorized access to containerized applications.
    *   **Affected Moby Component:**
        *   Container configuration parameters within the Docker daemon.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning capabilities to containers through Docker's configuration options.
        *   Avoid running containers in privileged mode unless absolutely necessary.
        *   Carefully manage volume mounts and ensure they are read-only when appropriate.

## Threat: [Docker Daemon Vulnerabilities](./threats/docker_daemon_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist within the `moby/moby` codebase itself. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can grant attackers full control over the Docker daemon, the host system, and all managed containers.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the host system and all running containers, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Moby Component:**
        *   Various modules and components within the `moby/moby` codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Docker daemon updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Follow security best practices for the host operating system where the Docker daemon is running.
        *   Regularly review security advisories for `moby/moby`.

## Threat: [Leaked Secrets in Docker Images](./threats/leaked_secrets_in_docker_images.md)

*   **Description:** While the secrets are within the image content, `moby/moby` is the platform that pulls, stores, and runs these images, making it a direct enabler of this threat. Attackers can extract secrets from image layers managed by Moby.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, compromise of other systems or accounts.
    *   **Affected Moby Component:**
        *   Image layering and storage within the Docker daemon.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid including secrets directly in Dockerfiles.
        *   Utilize Docker secrets management features.
        *   Use multi-stage builds to minimize the inclusion of sensitive data in the final image.
        *   Scan Docker images for exposed secrets.
