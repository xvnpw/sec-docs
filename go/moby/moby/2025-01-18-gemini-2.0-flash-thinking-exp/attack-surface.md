# Attack Surface Analysis for moby/moby

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Docker Daemon API](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_docker_daemon_api.md)

*   **Description:** The Docker daemon API, if exposed without proper authentication and authorization, allows direct interaction with the Docker engine.
    *   **How Moby Contributes:** `moby/moby` provides the core functionality for the Docker daemon and its API. The security of this API is paramount.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network (or remotely if exposed) uses `docker` CLI or API calls to create a privileged container, gaining root access to the host.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the host system, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS authentication and authorization for the Docker daemon API.
        *   Use tools like `iptables` or firewall rules to restrict access to the API port.
        *   Avoid binding the API to `0.0.0.0`. Bind it to `127.0.0.1` and use a secure tunnel if remote access is needed.
        *   Regularly audit and rotate API keys/certificates.

## Attack Surface: [Pulling Malicious Container Images](./attack_surfaces/pulling_malicious_container_images.md)

*   **Description:**  Downloading and running container images from untrusted sources can introduce malware or vulnerabilities into the application environment.
    *   **How Moby Contributes:** `moby/moby` provides the functionality to pull and run container images. It's the mechanism through which these external components are introduced.
    *   **Example:** The application pulls a seemingly legitimate image from an unofficial registry. This image contains a cryptominer that starts running within the container, consuming resources and potentially exfiltrating data.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malware, data breaches, resource exhaustion, supply chain compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only pull images from trusted and verified registries.
        *   Implement automated vulnerability scanning of container images before deployment.
        *   Use image signing and verification mechanisms (e.g., Docker Content Trust).
        *   Maintain an inventory of approved base images.

## Attack Surface: [Container Escape Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/container_escape_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs in the container runtime (runc, containerd) or the Linux kernel can allow attackers to break out of the container's isolation and gain access to the host system.
    *   **How Moby Contributes:** `moby/moby` relies on these underlying components for containerization. Vulnerabilities in these components directly impact the security of applications using Moby.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in `runc` to gain root access on the host system from within a compromised container.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the host system, access to sensitive data of other containers, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Docker Engine and underlying container runtime components up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in `runc`, `containerd`, and the Linux kernel.
        *   Implement strong container security profiles (Seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux).
        *   Consider using virtualization-based container runtimes for stronger isolation.

## Attack Surface: [Privileged Containers](./attack_surfaces/privileged_containers.md)

*   **Description:** Running containers with the `--privileged` flag disables most security features and grants the container almost all capabilities of the host system.
    *   **How Moby Contributes:** `moby/moby` provides the option to run containers in privileged mode.
    *   **Example:** A developer runs a container with `--privileged` for debugging purposes and forgets to remove it in production. An attacker compromising this container gains full control over the host.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the host system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using privileged containers whenever possible.
        *   If privileged mode is absolutely necessary, carefully document the reasons and implement strict access controls.
        *   Use Linux capabilities to grant only the necessary privileges instead of full privileged mode.
        *   Regularly audit container configurations to identify and remove unnecessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Container Networking Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_container_networking_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigured container networks can allow unauthorized access between containers or from the external network.
    *   **How Moby Contributes:** `moby/moby` manages container networking, including port mappings and network configurations.
    *   **Example:** A container port is mapped to the host without proper firewall rules, allowing external attackers to directly access services running inside the container.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to containerized applications, data breaches, lateral movement within the container environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement network segmentation and isolation for containers.
        *   Use Docker's built-in networking features (e.g., user-defined networks) to control container communication.
        *   Carefully manage port mappings and use firewalls to restrict access to exposed ports.
        *   Avoid exposing container ports directly to the host if not necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Volume Mount Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/volume_mount_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Mounting host directories into containers without proper access controls can allow attackers within the container to modify files on the host system.
    *   **How Moby Contributes:** `moby/moby` provides the functionality to mount volumes into containers.
    *   **Example:** A container has a volume mount to a sensitive directory on the host with read-write permissions. An attacker compromising the container can modify critical system files.
    *   **Impact:** Host system compromise, data corruption, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the use of volume mounts from the host.
        *   Mount volumes with read-only permissions whenever possible.
        *   Carefully control the directories and files mounted into containers.
        *   Use Docker volumes instead of bind mounts when data persistence is needed within the container environment.

## Attack Surface: [Leaked Secrets in Container Images](./attack_surfaces/leaked_secrets_in_container_images.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, passwords, certificates) can be inadvertently included in container images.
    *   **How Moby Contributes:** `moby/moby` builds and manages container images, and developers might mistakenly include secrets during the image creation process.
    *   **Example:** A developer hardcodes an API key into a Dockerfile. This key is then present in every layer of the built image and can be extracted by anyone with access to the image.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding secrets in Dockerfiles.
        *   Use Docker secrets management features or other secure secret management solutions.
        *   Employ multi-stage builds to avoid including build-time dependencies and secrets in the final image.
        *   Regularly scan container images for exposed secrets.
