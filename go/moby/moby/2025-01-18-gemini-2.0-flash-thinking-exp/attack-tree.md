## Attack Tree Path: [Host Compromise via Volume Mounting](./attack_tree_paths/host_compromise_via_volume_mounting.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates the application's container creation process to mount sensitive host directories (e.g., `/`, `/var/run/docker.sock`) into a container they control.
*   **Impact:** This grants the attacker direct access to the host filesystem, allowing them to read sensitive data, modify system configurations, and potentially execute arbitrary commands on the host.

## Attack Tree Path: [Host Compromise via Privileged Container](./attack_tree_paths/host_compromise_via_privileged_container.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application's logic allows the creation or interaction with "privileged" containers. An attacker exploits this to gain root-level access within the container, which can often be leveraged to escape the container and compromise the host.
*   **Impact:** Similar to volume mounting, this can lead to full host compromise, allowing the attacker to control the entire system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Container Compromise via Malicious Base Image](./attack_tree_paths/container_compromise_via_malicious_base_image.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Developers, either through negligence or by being tricked, pull a base container image from an untrusted or compromised registry. This image contains pre-installed malware or backdoors.
*   **Impact:** Upon running containers based on this malicious image, the malware is activated, potentially allowing the attacker to gain a foothold within the container, steal data, or use it as a stepping stone for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Breach via Shared Volumes](./attack_tree_paths/data_breach_via_shared_volumes.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application uses shared volumes to exchange data between containers. However, proper access controls are not implemented, allowing an attacker who has compromised one container to access sensitive data residing in the shared volume.
*   **Impact:** This leads to a breach of confidentiality, as the attacker can access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive application data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Full Control via Unsecured API](./attack_tree_paths/full_control_via_unsecured_api.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The Moby API is exposed without proper authentication or authorization mechanisms. An attacker can directly interact with the API, creating, modifying, and deleting containers, effectively gaining full control over the container environment.
*   **Impact:** This is a critical vulnerability, allowing the attacker to manipulate the entire container infrastructure, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or further host compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Full Control via Publicly Exposed API](./attack_tree_paths/full_control_via_publicly_exposed_api.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Due to misconfiguration, the Moby API is exposed on a public network without any authentication. This allows any attacker on the internet to interact with the API.
*   **Impact:** Similar to the unsecured API, this grants complete control over the container environment to external attackers, posing a significant security risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Moby](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_moby.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the most critical failure state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Container Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_container_management_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Success in exploiting vulnerabilities related to how containers are managed (creation, configuration, lifecycle) often leads to severe consequences like host compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Privilege Escalation via Container Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/privilege_escalation_via_container_configuration.md)

*   This node represents a direct path to gaining elevated privileges, often leading to host compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Mount Sensitive Host Paths into Container](./attack_tree_paths/mount_sensitive_host_paths_into_container.md)

*   This specific action directly grants access to the host filesystem, making it a critical vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Privileged Containers](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_privileged_containers.md)

*   The use of privileged containers inherently introduces significant risk, making this a critical node.

## Attack Tree Path: [Container Escape](./attack_tree_paths/container_escape.md)

*   Successfully escaping the container sandbox is a critical breach of security, typically leading to host compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Kernel Vulnerabilities via Container](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_kernel_vulnerabilities_via_container.md)

*   Exploiting kernel vulnerabilities from within a container is a critical attack vector for container escape.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Moby Daemon Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_moby_daemon_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Compromising the Moby daemon grants control over the entire container infrastructure, making this a critical node.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Moby API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_moby_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Moby API provides a direct route to controlling the container environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Access to Moby API](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_access_to_moby_api.md)

*   Gaining unauthorized access to the API is a critical step towards exploiting it for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak or Missing Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_or_missing_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   This represents a fundamental security flaw in the API, making it a critical vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Moby API on Public Network](./attack_tree_paths/expose_moby_api_on_public_network.md)

*   This severe misconfiguration creates a direct and easily exploitable attack vector, making it a critical node.
