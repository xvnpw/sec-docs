## Project Design Document: Moby (Docker) for Threat Modeling (Improved)

**1. Introduction**

This document provides an enhanced architectural overview of the Moby project (also known as Docker Engine) as of the current understanding of its open-source codebase. This document is specifically designed to serve as a robust foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities. It details the key components, their interactions, and the data flows within the system, with a stronger emphasis on potential security vulnerabilities and attack surfaces.

**2. Project Overview**

The Moby project is an open-source project that offers a toolkit for building container systems. It acts as the upstream project for Docker Engine. Fundamentally, Moby facilitates the creation, management, and execution of containerized applications. Containers package software with all its dependencies into standardized units, promoting consistency and portability across different environments.

**Key Features:**

* **Core Containerization:**  Enabling the packaging of applications and their dependencies into isolated containers using kernel features like namespaces and cgroups.
* **Container Image Management:** Providing mechanisms for building, storing, distributing, and managing container images, which are the building blocks of containers.
* **Single-Host Container Lifecycle Management:** Managing the creation, starting, stopping, and deletion of containers on a single host.
* **Container Networking:**  Establishing networking capabilities for containers to communicate internally and with the external network, including features like port mapping and DNS resolution.
* **Container Storage Management:**  Managing persistent storage volumes for containers, allowing data to persist beyond the container's lifecycle.
* **Programmable API:** Exposing a comprehensive RESTful API for interacting with the container engine programmatically, enabling automation and integration with other tools.

**3. Architectural Overview**

The Moby architecture comprises the following core components, each with distinct responsibilities and security implications:

* **Docker Client (CLI):** The primary user interface, a command-line tool that allows users to interact with the Docker daemon by sending commands over a REST API.
* **Docker Daemon (dockerd):** The central background service responsible for orchestrating all container-related activities, including building images, managing containers, and handling networking and storage.
* **Container Runtime Interface (CRI) - containerd:** A high-level container runtime that manages the complete container lifecycle on a host system. It handles image pulling, storage management, network namespace setup, and supervision of container execution.
* **Open Container Initiative (OCI) Runtime - runc:** A lightweight and portable implementation of the OCI runtime specification. It interacts directly with the operating system kernel to create and run containers based on OCI image specifications.
* **Docker Images:**  Immutable, read-only templates used to instantiate containers. They contain the application code, libraries, dependencies, and the necessary runtime environment. Images are structured in layers for efficient storage and distribution.
* **Docker Registry:** A stateless, scalable service for storing and distributing Docker images. Registries can be public (e.g., Docker Hub) or private.
* **Operating System Kernel:** The underlying operating system kernel, which provides the core isolation and resource management features essential for containerization (e.g., namespaces, cgroups, seccomp).

**4. Detailed Component Descriptions and Interactions**

* **Docker Client (CLI):**
    * **Functionality:**  Parses user commands, constructs corresponding API requests, and transmits them to the Docker daemon. Receives and formats responses for user display.
    * **Communication:** Communicates with the Docker daemon over a local Unix socket or a remote TCP port (typically secured with TLS).
    * **Security Considerations:**
        * **Client-Side Vulnerabilities:** Potential vulnerabilities in the CLI binary itself could be exploited.
        * **Insecure Communication:** If TLS is not properly configured, communication with the daemon could be intercepted.
        * **Credential Management:**  Improper handling or storage of credentials used to authenticate with registries or the daemon.
        * **Command Injection:**  Vulnerabilities if user input is not properly sanitized before being used in API requests.

* **Docker Daemon (dockerd):**
    * **Functionality:** The core orchestrator. Receives API requests from the client, manages images (pull, push, build), creates and manages container lifecycles, configures networking and storage for containers, and interacts with the container runtime.
    * **Sub-components (Logical):**
        * **API Server:**  Listens for and processes API requests from the Docker client and potentially other services. Enforces authentication and authorization policies.
        * **Image Management Subsystem:** Handles the retrieval, storage, and management of container images. Includes the build process.
        * **Container Management Subsystem:**  Manages the lifecycle of containers, including creation, starting, stopping, pausing, and deletion.
        * **Networking Subsystem:** Configures and manages container networking, including virtual networks, port mappings, DNS, and network policies.
        * **Storage Subsystem:** Manages container storage, including volume mounting, copy-on-write layers, and storage drivers.
        * **Authentication and Authorization Module:**  Verifies the identity of clients and determines their permissions to perform actions.
    * **Communication:** Listens on a Unix socket or TCP port for API requests. Communicates with `containerd` over gRPC. Interacts with the kernel through system calls.
    * **Security Considerations:**
        * **API Security:**  A critical attack surface. Weak authentication or authorization can lead to unauthorized container management.
        * **Privilege Escalation:**  Vulnerabilities in the daemon could allow attackers to gain root privileges on the host.
        * **Insecure Image Handling:**  Failure to validate image content or origins could lead to the execution of malicious code.
        * **Resource Exhaustion:**  Improper resource management could lead to denial-of-service attacks.
        * **Container Escape:**  Vulnerabilities in the daemon's interaction with the kernel or the container runtime could allow containers to break out of their isolation.

* **Container Runtime Interface (CRI) - containerd:**
    * **Functionality:** Provides an abstraction layer for managing container runtimes. It handles the complete container lifecycle, from image pulling to process execution and monitoring.
    * **Sub-components (Logical):**
        * **Image Service:** Manages the pulling, storing, and unpacking of container images.
        * **Container Service:** Manages the creation, starting, stopping, and deletion of containers.
        * **Task Service:** Manages the execution of processes within containers.
        * **Snapshotter:** Manages the filesystem layers of containers, enabling efficient storage and sharing.
        * **Networking (CNI Plugin):** Integrates with Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins to configure container networking.
    * **Communication:** Communicates with the Docker daemon over gRPC. Interacts with the OCI runtime (`runc`) to execute containers. Interacts with the kernel for namespace and cgroup management.
    * **Security Considerations:**
        * **Container Isolation:**  Responsible for ensuring strong isolation between containers. Vulnerabilities could lead to container breakouts.
        * **Image Verification:**  Must ensure the integrity and authenticity of pulled images.
        * **Resource Management:**  Properly managing resources allocated to containers to prevent abuse.
        * **Vulnerabilities in CNI Plugins:** Security issues in the networking plugins used by `containerd`.

* **Open Container Initiative (OCI) Runtime - runc:**
    * **Functionality:** A minimal and portable runtime that creates and runs containers according to the OCI specification. It directly interacts with the operating system kernel to set up namespaces, cgroups, and other isolation mechanisms.
    * **Communication:** Invoked by `containerd`. Interacts directly with the kernel through system calls.
    * **Security Considerations:**
        * **Kernel Exploitation:**  Vulnerabilities in `runc` that allow direct exploitation of the kernel.
        * **Namespace and Cgroup Escapes:**  Bugs that permit containers to break out of their assigned namespaces and cgroups.
        * **File System Access Issues:**  Incorrectly configured file system permissions or mount points that could lead to security breaches.

* **Docker Images:**
    * **Functionality:**  Serve as the blueprint for creating containers. They are composed of layered filesystems and include metadata describing the container's configuration.
    * **Storage:** Stored in a layered file system format, optimizing storage and distribution.
    * **Security Considerations:**
        * **Software Vulnerabilities:**  Images can contain vulnerable software packages.
        * **Malicious Content:**  Images could be intentionally crafted to contain malware or backdoors.
        * **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Compromised base images or dependencies can introduce vulnerabilities.
        * **Secret Exposure:**  Accidental inclusion of sensitive information (credentials, API keys) within image layers.

* **Docker Registry:**
    * **Functionality:**  Stores and distributes Docker images. Provides an API for pushing and pulling images, managing image tags, and potentially enforcing access control policies.
    * **Types:** Public registries (e.g., Docker Hub), private registries (self-hosted or cloud-based).
    * **Communication:** Clients and daemons communicate with registries over HTTPS, ideally with TLS certificate verification.
    * **Security Considerations:**
        * **Authentication and Authorization:**  Weak or missing authentication can allow unauthorized access to images.
        * **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**  If TLS is not properly enforced, image transfers can be intercepted.
        * **Content Poisoning:**  Attackers could upload malicious images with legitimate names.
        * **Denial of Service:**  Overloading the registry with requests.
        * **Data Breaches:**  Exposure of image data if the registry's storage is compromised.

* **Operating System Kernel:**
    * **Functionality:** Provides the fundamental isolation and resource management mechanisms for containers, including namespaces (PID, network, mount, UTS, IPC, user), cgroups (resource limits), and security features like seccomp (system call filtering) and AppArmor/SELinux.
    * **Security Considerations:**
        * **Kernel Vulnerabilities:**  Exploitable bugs in the kernel can undermine all container security measures.
        * **Misconfiguration:**  Incorrectly configured kernel security features can weaken container isolation.
        * **Lack of Updates:**  Running an outdated kernel with known vulnerabilities.

**Illustrative Data Flow (e.g., `docker run`):**

1. A user issues a command (e.g., `docker run nginx`) to the **Docker Client (CLI)**.
2. The CLI translates the command into an API request and sends it to the **Docker Daemon's API Server**.
3. The **API Server** authenticates and authorizes the request using the **Authentication & Authorization** module.
4. If authorized, the API Server instructs the **Image Management** subsystem to check for the image locally.
5. If the image is not local, **Image Management** requests the image manifest from the **Docker Registry**.
6. The **Docker Registry** provides the image manifest.
7. **Image Management** then requests the image layers from the **Docker Registry**.
8. The **Docker Registry** streams the image layers.
9. **Image Management** stores the image layers using the **Storage Subsystem**.
10. The API Server instructs the **Container Management** subsystem to create a container.
11. **Container Management** communicates with **containerd's Container Service** to initiate container creation.
12. **containerd's Container Service** ensures the image is available via the **Image Service**.
13. **containerd's Image Service** pulls the image if necessary.
14. **containerd's Snapshotter** prepares the container's root filesystem.
15. **containerd's Container Service** instructs **runc** to create the container process.
16. **runc** interacts with the **Kernel** to set up namespaces, cgroups, and seccomp profiles for isolation.
17. **containerd's Container Service** uses the **CNI Plugin** to configure container networking, which interacts with the **Kernel**.
18. The **Storage Subsystem** manages volume mounts by interacting with the **Kernel**.
19. The Docker Daemon monitors the container's status and sends updates back to the Docker Client.

**6. Key Security Considerations for Threat Modeling (Expanded)**

* **Docker Daemon API Security:**
    * **Threats:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, container manipulation, privilege escalation.
    * **Considerations:** Implement strong authentication (TLS client certificates, mutual TLS), robust authorization policies (Role-Based Access Control), secure communication channels (HTTPS), rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service.
* **Container Isolation (Kernel Namespaces and Cgroups):**
    * **Threats:** Container escape, access to host resources, cross-container interference.
    * **Considerations:** Ensure proper kernel configuration, utilize security profiles (seccomp, AppArmor/SELinux), regularly patch the kernel, be aware of known namespace escape vulnerabilities.
* **Container Image Security:**
    * **Threats:** Execution of vulnerable or malicious code, data breaches, supply chain compromise.
    * **Considerations:** Implement image scanning for vulnerabilities, use trusted base images, enforce image signing and verification, minimize image size, regularly rebuild images to incorporate security patches.
* **Docker Registry Security:**
    * **Threats:** Unauthorized image access, malicious image injection, data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * **Considerations:** Enforce strong authentication and authorization, use HTTPS with TLS certificate verification, implement content trust mechanisms, regularly scan registry for vulnerabilities, secure the underlying storage of the registry.
* **Container Networking Security:**
    * **Threats:** Unauthorized network access, eavesdropping, container compromise, network segmentation breaches.
