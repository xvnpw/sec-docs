# Threat Model Analysis for moby/moby

## Threat: [Malicious Image Pull](./threats/malicious_image_pull.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could trick the application into pulling a malicious container image from an untrusted registry. This could involve manipulating image names, tags, or registry URLs used by the application.
*   **How:** The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in how the application handles image references or by compromising a registry.
**Impact:**
*   The malicious image could contain malware that executes on the host system, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
**Affected Moby Component:**
*   `image`: Specifically the image pulling functionality within the `image` module.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement Image Whitelisting: Only allow pulling images from trusted and verified registries.
*   Use Content Trust: Enable Docker Content Trust to verify the integrity and publisher of images.
*   Image Scanning: Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into the image pull process to identify known vulnerabilities before running containers.
*   Secure Registry Configuration: Ensure the configured container registries are secure and require authentication.

## Threat: [Container Escape via Kernel Vulnerability](./threats/container_escape_via_kernel_vulnerability.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker inside a container could exploit a vulnerability in the host kernel to break out of the container's isolation and gain access to the host system.
*   **How:** This could involve exploiting kernel bugs related to namespaces, cgroups, or other containerization primitives that `moby/moby` relies upon.
**Impact:**
*   Full compromise of the host system, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.
**Affected Moby Component:**
*   `containerd`: The underlying container runtime managed by `moby`, specifically the kernel interaction for namespace and cgroup management.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Host Kernel Updated: Regularly patch the host operating system kernel with the latest security updates.
*   Use Security Profiles: Implement security profiles like AppArmor or SELinux to restrict container capabilities.
*   Minimize Privileges: Avoid running containers with the `--privileged` flag unless absolutely necessary. If required, carefully assess and minimize the granted capabilities.

## Threat: [Docker API Exposure Without Authentication](./threats/docker_api_exposure_without_authentication.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Docker Engine API if it's exposed without proper authentication and authorization.
*   **How:** This could happen if the API listens on a network interface without TLS and authentication, or if authentication credentials are weak or compromised.
**Impact:**
*   Full control over the Docker Engine, allowing the attacker to create, start, stop, and delete containers, pull images, and potentially compromise the host system.
**Affected Moby Component:**
*   `dockerd`: The Docker daemon, specifically the API endpoint and authentication mechanisms provided by `moby`.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable TLS Authentication: Configure the Docker Engine to use TLS for secure communication and require client certificates for authentication.
*   Restrict API Access: Limit network access to the Docker API to authorized hosts and networks. Avoid exposing the API publicly.
*   Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement RBAC to control user and application permissions for interacting with the Docker API.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion Leading to Denial of Service](./threats/resource_exhaustion_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** A malicious or compromised container could consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on the host system, leading to a denial of service.
*   **How:** This could be intentional (e.g., a fork bomb within a container) or unintentional (e.g., a poorly written application with memory leaks). `moby/moby`'s resource management features might be bypassed or abused.
**Impact:**
*   The host system or other containers running on the same host become unresponsive or perform poorly, disrupting the application's functionality.
**Affected Moby Component:**
*   `containerd`: Responsible for managing container resources through cgroups, a feature integrated with `moby`.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement Resource Limits: Use Docker's resource constraints (`--cpus`, `--memory`, etc.) to limit the resources available to each container.
*   Monitor Resource Usage: Implement monitoring tools to track container resource consumption and detect anomalies.
*   Set Quotas and Limits: Configure system-level quotas and limits to prevent a single container from monopolizing resources.

## Threat: [Volume Data Exposure](./threats/volume_data_exposure.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data stored in Docker volumes if the volumes are not properly secured.
*   **How:** This could happen if volume permissions are too permissive, if volumes are shared unnecessarily between containers managed by `moby`, or if an attacker compromises a container with access to the volume.
**Impact:**
*   Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches, compliance violations, or financial loss.
**Affected Moby Component:**
*   `volume`: The volume management subsystem within `moby`.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict Volume Access: Configure appropriate permissions for volumes to limit access to authorized containers and users.
*   Use Volume Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data stored in volumes using Docker volume plugins or other encryption mechanisms.
*   Principle of Least Privilege: Only mount volumes into containers that absolutely need access to them.
