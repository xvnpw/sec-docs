# Attack Surface Analysis for moby/moby

## Attack Surface: [Docker API Exposure](./attack_surfaces/docker_api_exposure.md)

* **Description:** The Docker API allows for programmatic interaction with the Docker daemon, enabling management of images, containers, volumes, and networks.
    * **How Moby Contributes:** `moby/moby` is the core of the Docker Engine, and it's the component that exposes this API. Applications using `moby` will inherently interact with this API.
    * **Example:** An application exposes the Docker API socket (e.g., `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` or a TCP port) without proper authentication or authorization.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can gain complete control over the Docker daemon, allowing them to create, start, stop, and remove containers, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the host system or within other containers.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the Docker API using TLS and client certificate authentication.
        * Avoid exposing the Docker API over a network if possible.
        * If network exposure is necessary, use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        * Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to the API.
        * Consider using tools like Docker Contexts to manage access to different Docker environments.

## Attack Surface: [Image Pulling and Supply Chain Attacks](./attack_surfaces/image_pulling_and_supply_chain_attacks.md)

* **Description:** The process of retrieving Docker images from registries. If not done securely, it can introduce malicious software into the environment.
    * **How Moby Contributes:** `moby/moby` provides the functionality to pull images from registries. The security of this process directly impacts the overall security.
    * **Example:** An application pulls a Docker image from an untrusted or compromised registry that contains malware or vulnerabilities.
    * **Impact:**  Execution of malicious code within containers managed by the application, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only pull images from trusted and verified registries.
        * Utilize image scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in images before deployment.
        * Implement a process for verifying image signatures and content digests.
        * Consider using private registries to control the source of images.
        * Regularly update base images to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Container Execution and Configuration](./attack_surfaces/container_execution_and_configuration.md)

* **Description:** The way containers are configured and executed can introduce security vulnerabilities if not done with care.
    * **How Moby Contributes:** `moby/moby` provides extensive options for configuring container execution (e.g., user, privileges, volumes, networking). Misconfigurations can create attack vectors.
    * **Example:** An application starts a container with the `--privileged` flag, granting it excessive privileges on the host system.
    * **Impact:** A compromised container can potentially escape its isolation and gain root access to the host system, compromising the entire environment.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Adhere to the principle of least privilege when configuring containers.
        * Avoid using the `--privileged` flag unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        * Implement and enforce security profiles like AppArmor or SELinux for containers.
        * Carefully manage volume mounts to prevent containers from accessing sensitive host data.

## Attack Surface: [Docker Daemon Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/docker_daemon_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  Security flaws in the Docker Daemon itself can be exploited by attackers.
    * **How Moby Contributes:**  `moby/moby` *is* the Docker Daemon. Vulnerabilities within its codebase are direct attack vectors.
    * **Example:** A known vulnerability in the Docker Daemon allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the host system.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the host system and potentially other connected systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep the Docker Engine updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
        * Regularly review security advisories for the Docker Engine.
        * Implement security best practices for the host operating system running the Docker Daemon.

## Attack Surface: [Application Code Interaction with Docker API](./attack_surfaces/application_code_interaction_with_docker_api.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the application's code that interacts with the Docker API can be exploited.
    * **How Moby Contributes:** The application uses `moby/moby`'s API to perform actions. Insecure coding practices when making these API calls can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** The application constructs Docker API calls based on user input without proper sanitization, leading to command injection within the Docker daemon.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the Docker daemon, potentially leading to container compromise or host system takeover.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly sanitize and validate all input used to construct Docker API calls.
        * Implement secure coding practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
        * Use Docker SDKs or libraries that provide built-in security features.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to the application to interact with the Docker API.

## Attack Surface: [Container Escape Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/container_escape_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the container runtime or the underlying kernel can allow attackers to escape the container and gain access to the host system.
    * **How Moby Contributes:** While the vulnerabilities are not directly in `moby/moby`'s code, `moby` manages the lifecycle of containers that *could* be vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the container runtime (e.g., runc) to escape the container and gain root access to the host.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the host system and potentially other connected systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep the host operating system and the container runtime updated with the latest security patches.
        * Implement security profiles like AppArmor or SELinux to restrict container capabilities.
        * Regularly audit container configurations and runtime environments for potential vulnerabilities.
        * Consider using more secure containerization technologies or sandboxing techniques if the risk is deemed too high.
