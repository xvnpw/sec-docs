## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement and Enforce Container Resource Limits (Docker cgroups)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_and_enforce_container_resource_limits__docker_cgroups_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement and Enforce Container Resource Limits (Docker cgroups)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Container Resource Needs:** Analyze the CPU, memory, and I/O requirements of your application *within the Docker container context*.
    2.  **Utilize Docker Resource Flags:** Employ Docker's built-in resource limiting flags during container runtime. Use flags like `--cpus`, `--memory`, `--memory-swap`, and `--blkio-weight` with `docker run` or their equivalents in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., `cpu_count`, `mem_limit`). These flags leverage Linux cgroups, which Docker uses for resource isolation.
    3.  **Set Docker-Specific Limits:** Configure resource limits directly within your Docker container definitions or orchestration configurations. Avoid relying solely on host-level resource management outside of Docker's control.
    4.  **Monitor Docker Container Resource Usage:** Use Docker-specific monitoring tools like `docker stats` or integrate with container monitoring solutions that understand Docker metrics to track resource consumption *at the container level*.
    5.  **Adjust Docker Limits Based on Container Metrics:** Fine-tune resource limits based on the observed resource usage of your Docker containers, ensuring optimal performance and security within the Docker environment.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Docker Container Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** A runaway Docker container consuming excessive resources can impact other containers or the Docker host. Docker resource limits directly mitigate this by restricting container resource usage.
    *   **Docker Host Resource Starvation due to Container (Severity: Medium):**  Uncontrolled Docker containers can exhaust host resources, affecting the Docker daemon and other host processes. Docker resource limits help prevent this host-level impact.
    *   **"Noisy Neighbor" Effect in Docker Environment (Severity: Medium):** One Docker container impacting the performance of others due to resource contention within the Docker environment. Docker resource limits ensure fairer resource allocation *among Docker containers*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Docker Container Denial of Service (DoS): High reduction - Directly prevents Docker containers from monopolizing resources and causing DoS *within the Docker environment*.
    *   Docker Host Resource Starvation due to Container: Medium reduction - Reduces the risk of Docker containers causing host-level resource starvation.
    *   "Noisy Neighbor" Effect in Docker Environment: High reduction - Ensures fair resource allocation and prevents performance degradation for other Docker containers.

*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined - Implementation status within Docker configurations (Dockerfiles, `docker-compose.yml`, orchestration manifests) needs to be assessed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Potentially missing in Docker configurations across development, staging, and production environments. Resource limits might not be consistently defined or enforced for all Docker containers.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Docker Container Escape via Root Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Docker user namespaces prevent root *inside a Docker container* from being root on the host, limiting host compromise from Docker containers.
    *   **Docker Host File System Damage from Container Root (Severity: High):** Even if a Docker container process runs as root *inside the container*, it's unprivileged on the host, reducing host file system damage risk *from Docker containers*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Docker Container Escape via Root Privilege Escalation: High reduction - Significantly reduces host compromise risk from root privilege escalation *within Docker containers*.
    *   Docker Host File System Damage from Container Root: High reduction - Protects the host file system from damage by root processes *in Docker containers*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined - Docker daemon configuration needs to be checked to see if user namespaces are enabled.

    3.  **Avoid Mounting Docker Socket Inside Containers (Unless Necessary):**  Do not mount the Docker daemon socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) inside Docker containers unless absolutely necessary for Docker-in-Docker scenarios. If needed, mount read-only and with strict access control *within the Docker container*.
    4.  **Run Processes as Non-Root User Inside Docker Containers:** Configure Docker images to run application processes as non-root users. Use the `USER` instruction in Dockerfiles. This is a Docker image best practice.

### Mitigation Strategy: Use Docker `--security-opt` for Enhanced Security

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Explore Docker `--security-opt` Options:** Explore and utilize various Docker `--security-opt` options to enhance container security. These are Docker-specific security options.
    2.  **Implement `no-new-privileges`:** Use `--security-opt no-new-privileges` to prevent Docker containers from gaining new privileges (e.g., via setuid binaries).
    3.  **Explicitly Specify AppArmor or SELinux Profiles:** Use `--security-opt apparmor` or `--security-opt label` to explicitly specify AppArmor or SELinux profiles for Docker containers.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Docker Containers (Severity: Medium):** `--security-opt no-new-privileges` prevents certain privilege escalation techniques within Docker containers.
    *   **Insufficiently Applied MAC Profiles (Severity: Medium):** Explicitly specifying AppArmor or SELinux profiles via `--security-opt` ensures profiles are applied as intended to Docker containers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Privilege Escalation within Docker Containers: Medium reduction - Reduces the risk of privilege escalation within Docker containers.
    *   Insufficiently Applied MAC Profiles: Medium reduction - Ensures MAC profiles are correctly applied to Docker containers.

*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined - Docker `--security-opt` usage needs to be assessed in Docker configurations.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Potentially underutilized. Docker `--security-opt` options, especially `no-new-privileges`, should be more widely implemented in Docker configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Audit Docker Container Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_audit_docker_container_configurations.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Regularly Review and Audit Docker Container Configurations

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Docker Configuration Audit Schedule:** Define a schedule for regularly reviewing and auditing Docker container configurations.
    2.  **Audit Dockerfiles, `docker-compose.yml`, and Orchestration Manifests:** Review Dockerfiles, `docker-compose.yml` files, and container orchestration manifests for security best practices and potential misconfigurations.
    3.  **Automate Docker Configuration Auditing (Where Possible):** Automate Docker configuration auditing using tools or scripts to identify deviations from security standards.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Docker Container Misconfigurations (Severity: Medium):** Regular audits help identify and remediate Docker container misconfigurations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Drift from Docker Security Best Practices (Severity: Medium):** Audits ensure ongoing adherence to Docker security best practices and prevent configuration drift over time.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Docker Container Misconfigurations: Medium reduction - Helps identify and remediate Docker container misconfigurations.
    *   Drift from Docker Security Best Practices: Medium reduction - Ensures ongoing adherence to Docker security best practices.

*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined - Docker configuration audit process needs to be defined and implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Potentially missing a formalized process for regularly reviewing and auditing Docker container configurations. Needs to be implemented as part of ongoing security practices.
