# Attack Surface Analysis for moby/moby

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Docker Daemon API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_docker_daemon_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing the Docker Daemon API without proper authentication allows unauthorized users to interact with the Docker daemon.
*   **How Moby Contributes:** Moby's `dockerd` exposes an API for managing containers and images. By default, this API might be exposed without authentication on a local socket or potentially over a network if misconfigured.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains network access to a server running `dockerd` with the API exposed on port 2376 without TLS and client certificate authentication. They use the Docker CLI or API calls to create a privileged container mounting the host's root filesystem, gaining full control of the host.
*   **Impact:** Full host compromise, data breach, denial of service, malware deployment.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS Authentication: Configure `dockerd` to use TLS for API communication and enforce client certificate verification.
    *   Restrict API Access: Use firewall rules or network policies to limit network access to the Docker API to only authorized clients.
    *   Avoid Exposing API over Network: If possible, avoid exposing the Docker API over the network. Use secure tunnels or jump hosts for remote management.
    *   Use Docker Contexts with TLS: When using the Docker CLI remotely, configure Docker contexts to use TLS and client certificates.

## Attack Surface: [Container Escape via Runtime Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/container_escape_via_runtime_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the container runtime (containerd, runc) allow attackers to break out of the container's isolation and gain access to the host system.
*   **How Moby Contributes:** Moby relies on containerd and runc as its container runtime. Vulnerabilities in these components directly impact the security of containers managed by Moby.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in `runc` (e.g., CVE-2019-5736) is exploited from within a container. The attacker leverages this vulnerability to overwrite the `runc` binary on the host, allowing subsequent container executions to execute malicious code on the host.
*   **Impact:** Host compromise, data breach, privilege escalation, lateral movement within the infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly Update Moby and Runtime Components: Keep `dockerd`, `containerd`, and `runc` updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Kernel Security Hardening: Implement kernel security measures like namespaces, cgroups, and seccomp profiles to limit container capabilities and reduce the attack surface for kernel exploits.
    *   Use Security Scanning Tools: Regularly scan container images and the host system for known vulnerabilities in runtime components.
    *   Consider Kata Containers or gVisor: For highly sensitive workloads, consider using more isolated container runtimes like Kata Containers or gVisor, which provide stronger isolation boundaries.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Container Images](./attack_surfaces/malicious_container_images.md)

*   **Description:** Running container images that contain malware, vulnerabilities, or backdoors.
*   **How Moby Contributes:** Moby is used to pull and run container images. If users pull images from untrusted sources or without proper verification, they risk running malicious containers.
*   **Example:** A developer pulls a seemingly legitimate image from an unofficial registry. This image contains a cryptominer that starts running within the container, consuming resources and potentially impacting application performance and security.
*   **Impact:** Malware infection, data theft, resource exhaustion, compromised application functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Trusted Registries: Pull images only from trusted registries like Docker Hub official images, private registries with security scanning, or verified vendor registries.
    *   Image Scanning: Implement automated image scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities and malware in container images before deployment.
    *   Image Signing and Verification: Use image signing and verification mechanisms (like Docker Content Trust) to ensure image integrity and authenticity.
    *   Minimal Base Images: Use minimal base images (e.g., Alpine Linux, distroless images) to reduce the attack surface and the number of potential vulnerabilities in the image.

## Attack Surface: [Privileged Containers](./attack_surfaces/privileged_containers.md)

*   **Description:** Running containers in privileged mode disables many security features and grants the container near-root access to the host system.
*   **How Moby Contributes:** Moby allows users to run containers in privileged mode using the `--privileged` flag. This feature, while sometimes necessary for specific use cases, significantly increases the attack surface.
*   **Example:** A developer runs a container in privileged mode for debugging purposes and accidentally exposes a service running in this container to the internet. An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the service and, due to the privileged mode, gains root access to the host system.
*   **Impact:** Full host compromise, privilege escalation, data breach, lateral movement.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid Privileged Mode:  Avoid using privileged mode unless absolutely necessary and only after careful security review and risk assessment.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege:  Instead of privileged mode, grant containers only the specific capabilities they require using `--cap-add` and `--cap-drop`.
    *   User Namespaces: Utilize user namespaces to remap container root user to a less privileged user on the host, reducing the impact of container compromise.
    *   Security Policies and Enforcement: Implement security policies (e.g., using tools like Open Policy Agent or Kubernetes Pod Security Policies/Admission Controllers) to prevent the deployment of privileged containers.

## Attack Surface: [Docker Socket Exposure (Local)](./attack_surfaces/docker_socket_exposure__local_.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) locally without proper access control allows local users or processes to control the Docker daemon.
*   **How Moby Contributes:** Moby uses the Docker socket for communication between the Docker CLI and the daemon. If the socket permissions are too permissive, it becomes an attack vector.
*   **Example:** A web application running on the same host as the Docker daemon is compromised due to a separate vulnerability. The attacker gains local access to the host and finds that the Docker socket is accessible to the web application's user. They use the Docker socket to create a container that mounts the host's root filesystem and gain root access.
*   **Impact:** Host compromise, privilege escalation, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict Docker Socket Permissions: Ensure that the Docker socket is only accessible to authorized users and groups (typically the `docker` group).
    *   Avoid Mounting Docker Socket into Containers:  Do not mount the Docker socket into containers unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. Consider alternative approaches like using Docker API clients within containers if container orchestration is needed.
    *   Use Docker Contexts for Remote Management: For remote management, use Docker contexts with TLS authentication instead of relying on local socket access.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege for Local Access:  Limit local user access to the Docker daemon and socket to only authorized administrators.
