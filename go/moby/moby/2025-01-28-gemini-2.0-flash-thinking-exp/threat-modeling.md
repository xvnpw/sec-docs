# Threat Model Analysis for moby/moby

## Threat: [Docker Daemon Code Exploitation](./threats/docker_daemon_code_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, race condition) in the Moby Docker daemon code itself. They could send specially crafted requests to the daemon or trigger vulnerable code paths to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the host.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Full host compromise, attacker gains root access to the underlying system, data breach, service disruption, complete control over the infrastructure managed by the Moby daemon.
*   **Moby Component Affected:** Docker Daemon (core daemon code, API handlers, image management modules within `dockerd`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Moby Docker Daemon updated to the latest stable version with security patches provided by the Moby project or distribution maintainers.
    *   Regularly monitor security advisories related to Moby and apply patches promptly.
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block malicious activity targeting the Moby daemon API and processes.
    *   Follow Docker security hardening guidelines specifically for daemon configuration, focusing on Moby daemon settings.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Docker Daemon API Access](./threats/unauthorized_docker_daemon_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Moby Docker Daemon API. This is often achieved by exploiting an exposed Docker socket or TCP port without proper authentication and authorization configured within Moby.  They can then use the Moby API to manage containers, images, volumes, and potentially execute commands within containers or on the host.
*   **Impact:** High - Container manipulation via Moby API, image manipulation (including injecting malicious images through Moby API calls), potential host compromise depending on API access level and exploited vulnerabilities within Moby API handlers, data exfiltration, denial of service by manipulating Moby managed resources.
*   **Moby Component Affected:** Docker Daemon API (API endpoints exposed by `dockerd`, authentication and authorization modules within `dockerd` API).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the Moby Docker Daemon API using TLS and strong authentication mechanisms supported by Moby (e.g., client certificates).
    *   Restrict access to the Docker socket to authorized users and processes only using file system permissions and access control lists on the socket file managed by Moby.
    *   Avoid exposing the Moby Docker socket over TCP unless absolutely necessary and with strong security measures like TLS and authentication enforced by Moby daemon configuration.
    *   Use a dedicated container orchestration platform (like Kubernetes) which often provides more robust API access control and management layers on top of the Moby daemon.

## Threat: [Docker Daemon Misconfiguration Exploitation](./threats/docker_daemon_misconfiguration_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits insecure configurations of the Moby Docker Daemon. This could involve leveraging disabled security features, overly permissive settings in Moby daemon configuration, or insecure logging configurations within Moby to gain unauthorized access or information.
*   **Impact:** High - Depending on the misconfiguration of Moby daemon, it can lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure (e.g., through insecure logs generated by Moby daemon), weakened security posture making other attacks against Moby easier, or denial of service.
*   **Moby Component Affected:** Docker Daemon Configuration (configuration files read by `dockerd`, command-line options for `dockerd`, security modules within `dockerd`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow Docker security hardening guidelines specifically for Moby daemon configuration.
    *   Regularly audit Moby daemon configuration against security best practices using automated tools and manual reviews.
    *   Use configuration management tools to enforce secure Moby daemon settings and prevent configuration drift.
    *   Minimize the attack surface of the Moby daemon by disabling unnecessary features and services through Moby daemon configuration options.

## Threat: [Container Escape Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/container_escape_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the container runtime components used by Moby (containerd, runc) to break out of the container's isolation and gain access to the host system. This could involve exploiting kernel vulnerabilities through container interfaces managed by Moby runtime components or vulnerabilities in the runtime's handling of namespaces or cgroups within Moby's runtime environment.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Host compromise, full control over the underlying system managed by Moby, ability to access and manipulate all containers and host resources managed by Moby, significant security breach of the Moby environment.
*   **Moby Component Affected:** Container Runtime (containerd, runc, kernel interfaces utilized by Moby runtime).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the container runtime components used by Moby (containerd, runc) updated to the latest stable version with security patches provided by Moby project or distribution maintainers.
    *   Use security-focused container runtimes like gVisor or Kata Containers as alternatives to runc within Moby for increased isolation and reduced attack surface, if supported and applicable to your Moby setup.
    *   Implement security hardening measures at the host OS level, including kernel hardening and security modules like SELinux or AppArmor, to strengthen the underlying security of the Moby host.
    *   Regularly monitor for and patch kernel vulnerabilities that could be exploited for container escape within the Moby environment.

## Threat: [Container Runtime Misconfiguration Exploitation](./threats/container_runtime_misconfiguration_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits insecure configurations of the container runtime components used by Moby (containerd, runc). This could involve leveraging disabled security features, overly permissive settings in runtime configuration, or insecure default configurations of Moby runtime components to weaken container isolation and potentially facilitate container escape or other attacks.
*   **Impact:** High - Reduced container isolation within Moby environment, potential for container escape or other attacks against Moby managed containers, weakened security posture of the Moby runtime, increased attack surface of the Moby platform.
*   **Moby Component Affected:** Container Runtime Configuration (containerd configuration files, runc configuration, security modules configuration within Moby runtime environment).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow security hardening guidelines for the container runtime configuration specifically for Moby's runtime components (containerd, runc).
    *   Regularly audit runtime configuration against security best practices relevant to Moby's runtime environment.
    *   Use configuration management tools to enforce secure runtime settings for Moby components and prevent configuration drift.
    *   Minimize the attack surface by disabling unnecessary features and services in the runtime configuration of Moby components.

## Threat: [Host Path Volume Mount Escape](./threats/host_path_volume_mount_escape.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigured volume mounts, especially bind mounts of host paths into containers managed by Moby, can allow containers to access sensitive host filesystems or escape container isolation enforced by Moby. Attackers within a Moby container can leverage these mounts to access and manipulate host files, potentially leading to host compromise.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Host compromise, data breach on the host filesystem accessible by Moby, privilege escalation on the host system managed by Moby, ability to modify host configurations or execute commands on the host from within a Moby container.
*   **Moby Component Affected:** Container Storage (volume mounting functionality within Moby, bind mounts managed by Moby, volume management modules in Moby).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid bind mounts whenever possible when using Moby and prefer using named volumes, which are managed by Moby and provide better isolation.
    *   Restrict volume mounts to only necessary directories and files when using Moby.
    *   Enforce strict permissions on mounted volumes to limit Moby container access to only required files and directories on the host.
    *   Use security context constraints (e.g., SELinux, AppArmor profiles) in conjunction with Moby to further limit container access to host resources, including mounted volumes.

## Threat: [Privileged Container Exploitation](./threats/privileged_container_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Running containers in privileged mode within Moby disables many security features and grants containers almost root-level access to the host system managed by Moby. Attackers exploiting a vulnerability in a privileged Moby container can easily escape container isolation and gain root access to the host.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Host compromise, container escape becomes trivial in Moby environment, significantly increased attack surface of Moby managed containers, full control over the underlying system managed by Moby, ability to access and manipulate all containers and host resources managed by Moby.
*   **Moby Component Affected:** Container Runtime (security features within Moby runtime, privilege management in Moby, capability management in Moby).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid running privileged containers within Moby whenever possible.
    *   If privileged containers are absolutely necessary in Moby, carefully justify and document the need and implement strict access control and monitoring for these privileged Moby containers.
    *   Minimize the use of privileged containers in Moby and explore alternative solutions that do not require privileged mode.
    *   Consider using capability-based security instead of privileged mode within Moby to grant only specific necessary capabilities to containers.

## Threat: [Excessive Container Capabilities Exploitation](./threats/excessive_container_capabilities_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Granting unnecessary Linux capabilities to containers within Moby expands their attack surface and increases the potential for exploitation within the Moby environment. Attackers can leverage these capabilities to perform actions that would otherwise be restricted by Moby's security mechanisms, potentially leading to privilege escalation or container escape.
*   **Impact:** High - Increased attack surface of Moby managed containers, potential for privilege escalation and container escape within Moby environment, ability to bypass security restrictions enforced by Moby within the container, potential for unauthorized access to host resources from within a Moby container.
*   **Moby Component Affected:** Container Runtime (capability management within Moby, security context handling in Moby).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege and only grant necessary capabilities to containers running within Moby.
    *   Drop all capabilities by default using `--cap-drop=all` when running containers with Moby and selectively add only required capabilities using `--cap-add`.
    *   Regularly review and audit container capabilities granted within Moby to ensure they are still necessary and minimize the granted capabilities.
    *   Use security context constraints to define and enforce capability restrictions for containers managed by Moby.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Host Filesystem Access from Container](./threats/unauthorized_host_filesystem_access_from_container.md)

*   **Description:** Containers gaining unauthorized access to the host filesystem, even without explicit volume mounts, through vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within Moby. This could be due to container escape vulnerabilities in Moby runtime, insecure container configurations allowed by Moby, or exploitation of kernel vulnerabilities in conjunction with Moby features.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Host compromise, data breach on the host filesystem accessible by Moby, privilege escalation on the host system managed by Moby, ability to modify host configurations or execute commands on the host from within a Moby container, even without intended volume mounts.
*   **Moby Component Affected:** Container Runtime (security features within Moby, isolation mechanisms enforced by Moby, kernel interfaces utilized by Moby, filesystem access control mechanisms in Moby).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize container access to the host filesystem in general when using Moby.
    *   Enforce strict security context constraints (e.g., SELinux, AppArmor profiles) in conjunction with Moby to limit container filesystem access and prevent unauthorized access to host resources.
    *   Regularly monitor for and patch container escape vulnerabilities and kernel vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized filesystem access from Moby containers.
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block suspicious filesystem access attempts from containers managed by Moby.
