# Threat Model Analysis for moby/moby

## Threat: [Threat 1: Malicious Image Pull from Untrusted Registry (Moby Pull Mechanism)](./threats/threat_1_malicious_image_pull_from_untrusted_registry__moby_pull_mechanism_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a container registry or sets up a malicious one. They publish a malicious image, potentially mimicking a legitimate one (typosquatting). A user, through the `docker pull` command (or equivalent API call), downloads this image to their system. The Moby engine's pull mechanism, without sufficient validation, facilitates this.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, potential for lateral movement. The attacker gains control *because* Moby pulled and made available a malicious image.
*   **Moby Component Affected:**  Docker Engine's image pulling mechanism (`docker pull` and related API calls). The core issue is the lack of inherent trust verification *within* the pull process itself (unless explicitly configured).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Registry Restriction:** Configure Docker Engine (via `daemon.json` or command-line flags) to *only* pull images from trusted registries. This is a Moby-level configuration.
    *   **Docker Content Trust (Notary):**  Enable and *enforce* Docker Content Trust. This uses digital signatures to verify the integrity and publisher of images *before* Moby pulls them. This is a core Moby feature.
    *   **Image Scanning (Post-Pull, Pre-Run):** While not a *direct* prevention of the pull, scanning images *after* pulling but *before* running them with a tool integrated with Moby can mitigate the impact.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Container Escape via Kernel/Runtime Exploit (Moby Runtime)](./threats/threat_2_container_escape_via_kernelruntime_exploit__moby_runtime_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Linux kernel *or* in the container runtime components of Moby (specifically `containerd` and `runc`). The attacker crafts a payload *within* a container, but the exploit targets the underlying Moby/kernel interaction. This allows escaping the container's isolation and gaining host access.
*   **Impact:**  Complete host compromise, access to all other containers, potential for lateral movement. The attacker succeeds because of a flaw in how Moby *implements* containerization.
*   **Moby Component Affected:**  The container runtime components: `containerd` and `runc`. These are core parts of Moby that interact directly with the kernel to create and manage containers. The vulnerability might be in the kernel itself, but the *exploitation path* is through these Moby components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Runtime Updates:**  Regularly update the Docker Engine (which includes `containerd` and `runc`) to the latest stable version. This is *critical* for patching runtime vulnerabilities. This is a direct Moby mitigation.
    *   **Kernel Patching:** Keep the host operating system's kernel up-to-date. While not *directly* a Moby component, it's essential for mitigating kernel-level escapes.
    *   **Seccomp Profiles:**  Use seccomp profiles (configured through Moby) to restrict the system calls a container can make. This limits the attacker's ability to exploit kernel vulnerabilities *from within* the container, even if one exists. This is a Moby-level security feature.
    *   **AppArmor/SELinux:** Use AppArmor or SELinux (configured on the host, but affecting container behavior) to enforce mandatory access control. This provides an additional layer of defense *against* container escapes.
    *   **User Namespaces:** Enable user namespaces (a Moby feature, configured via `daemon.json` or command-line flags). This maps the container's root user to a non-privileged user on the host, reducing the impact of a successful escape.
    *   **Capability Dropping:** Use the `--cap-drop` flag (a Moby feature) to remove unnecessary Linux capabilities from the container, reducing its attack surface at the kernel interaction level.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Docker Socket Exposure Leading to Host Compromise (Moby Daemon API)](./threats/threat_3_docker_socket_exposure_leading_to_host_compromise__moby_daemon_api_.md)

*   **Description:**  The Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is mounted inside a container. This gives the containerized process direct access to the Docker daemon's API. An attacker gaining control of this container can then issue commands to the daemon, effectively controlling the host. The vulnerability is in the *configuration* that allows this mounting, exposing the Moby daemon's API insecurely.
*   **Impact:**  Complete host compromise, ability to start, stop, manipulate any container, access all host resources. The attacker gains control *because* of the exposed Moby API.
*   **Moby Component Affected:**  The Docker daemon (specifically, its API exposed via the socket). The core issue is the insecure *exposure* of this API, a configuration choice related to how Moby is used.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Socket Mounting:**  The primary mitigation is to *avoid* mounting the Docker socket inside containers. This removes the direct attack vector.
    *   **Restrictive Security Context (If Unavoidable):** If mounting is absolutely necessary, use a *very* restrictive AppArmor or SELinux profile for the container. This limits what the container can do *even if* it has access to the socket. This is a host-level mitigation that interacts with Moby's container isolation.
    *   **Docker-in-Docker (dind) (with extreme caution):**  dind creates a nested Docker environment. While it can isolate the inner Docker daemon, it introduces its own complexities and potential security risks. It's a Moby-specific approach, but requires careful consideration.
    *   **API Proxy (Instead of Direct Socket Access):**  Use a secure, authenticated proxy to mediate access to the Docker API. This avoids exposing the raw socket.

## Threat: [Threat 4: Unauthenticated/Insecure Docker Daemon API Access (Moby Daemon Configuration)](./threats/threat_4_unauthenticatedinsecure_docker_daemon_api_access__moby_daemon_configuration_.md)

* **Description:** The Docker daemon is configured to listen on a network port *without* TLS encryption or authentication. An attacker on the network can connect directly to the daemon's API and issue commands, gaining full control of the host and all containers. This is a direct misconfiguration of the Moby daemon itself.
* **Impact:** Complete host compromise, ability to start, stop, and manipulate any container. The attacker gains control *because* the Moby daemon's API is exposed without protection.
* **Moby Component Affected:** Docker daemon (specifically, the configuration of its API endpoint and network listeners). This is a core configuration aspect of Moby.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS:** Configure the Docker daemon (via `daemon.json`) to use TLS encryption and authentication. This requires generating certificates and configuring both the daemon and any clients that connect to it. This is a *core* Moby security feature.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Use a firewall to restrict access to the Docker daemon's port to only authorized hosts and networks. This is a network-level defense, but it protects the Moby daemon.
    *   **Local Access Only:** If remote access is not required, configure the daemon (via `daemon.json`) to listen *only* on the local loopback interface (127.0.0.1). This prevents any network-based access.
