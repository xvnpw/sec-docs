## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Container Escape Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_container_escape_vulnerabilities.md)

-> HIGH RISK -> 1. Exploit Container Escape Vulnerabilities
    -> HIGH RISK -> 1.3 Privileged Containers [CRITICAL]

*   **Overall Rationale:** This is a high-risk area because container escape vulnerabilities, if present and exploitable, provide a direct path to host compromise. The isolation mechanisms of containers are designed to prevent this, but vulnerabilities can circumvent these protections.

    *   **1.3 Privileged Containers [CRITICAL]**

        *   **Description:** Running a container with the `--privileged` flag grants it near-complete access to the host's resources and capabilities. This effectively disables most of the security features that containers provide, making it trivial for an attacker who compromises the container to gain root access to the host.
        *   **Likelihood:** High. Privileged containers are sometimes used due to convenience or a lack of understanding of the security implications.
        *   **Impact:** Very High. Compromising a privileged container is almost equivalent to compromising the host directly.
        *   **Effort:** Very Low. If a privileged container exists, exploiting it is trivial.
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner. Requires minimal technical skill.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy. The use of `--privileged` is easily detectable through configuration inspection. The *exploitation* might be harder to detect, but the *presence* of the vulnerability is obvious.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Avoid `--privileged`:** This is the most important step. Do not use privileged containers unless absolutely necessary, and only after a thorough security review.
            *   **Use Capabilities:** Instead of `--privileged`, use specific Linux capabilities (e.g., `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`) to grant only the necessary permissions to the container. This provides a much more granular level of control.
            *   **Least Privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege. Grant the container only the absolute minimum permissions required for its operation.
            *   **Auditing:** Implement strict auditing of privileged container usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Misconfigured Docker Daemon](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_misconfigured_docker_daemon.md)

-> HIGH RISK -> 2. Leverage Misconfigured Docker Daemon
    -> HIGH RISK -> 2.1 Exposed Docker Daemon Socket [CRITICAL]

*   **Overall Rationale:** The Docker daemon (dockerd) is the core process that manages containers. If it's misconfigured, particularly if its control socket is exposed without proper authentication, it becomes a direct target for attackers.

    *   **2.1 Exposed Docker Daemon Socket (TCP/Unix) [CRITICAL]**

        *   **Description:** The Docker daemon listens on a socket (either a Unix socket or a TCP socket) for commands. If this socket is exposed to untrusted networks (e.g., the public internet) *without* proper authentication and encryption, anyone can connect to it and issue commands to the Docker daemon. This effectively grants them complete control over the Docker daemon, and therefore, the host system.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low. Most administrators are aware of this risk, but accidental misconfigurations can happen, especially in development or testing environments.
        *   **Impact:** Very High. Full control of the Docker daemon means full control of the host.
        *   **Effort:** Very Low. If the socket is exposed and unprotected, connecting to it and issuing commands is trivial.
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner. Requires minimal technical skill.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy. Network scans can easily detect exposed Docker daemon ports. Firewall logs would show connection attempts.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Never Expose to Untrusted Networks:** This is the most crucial step. Do not expose the Docker daemon socket directly to the public internet or any untrusted network.
            *   **Use TLS Encryption and Authentication:** If remote access to the Docker daemon is required, *always* use TLS encryption and client certificate authentication. This ensures that only authorized clients can connect and that the communication is secure.
            *   **Firewall Rules:** Use firewall rules (e.g., `iptables`, `ufw`, or cloud provider firewalls) to restrict access to the Docker daemon socket to only authorized IP addresses or networks.
            *   **Unix Socket Permissions:** If using a Unix socket, ensure that the socket file has appropriate permissions so that only authorized users can access it.
            *   **Docker Contexts:** Use Docker contexts to manage connections to different Docker daemons securely.
