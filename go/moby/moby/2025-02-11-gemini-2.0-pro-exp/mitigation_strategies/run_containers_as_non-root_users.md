Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Run Containers as Non-Root Users" mitigation strategy, tailored for a development team using Moby/Docker:

# Deep Analysis: Run Containers as Non-Root Users

## 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness, implementation status, and potential gaps of the "Run Containers as Non-Root Users" mitigation strategy within our application's Docker-based deployment.  We aim to:

*   Confirm the strategy's ability to mitigate identified threats.
*   Assess the completeness of its current implementation.
*   Identify any missing components or areas for improvement.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for full and consistent implementation.
*   Understand the potential impact on application functionality and performance.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Run Containers as Non-Root Users" strategy as applied to our application's Docker containers.  It encompasses:

*   All Dockerfiles used to build our application's images (specifically mentioned: `web-server` and `database`).
*   The runtime behavior of containers launched from these images.
*   The interaction between the non-root user and the application's processes and files.
*   Verification methods to confirm the correct user context within running containers.
*   Potential impact on the application.

This analysis *does not* cover other security aspects of the application or Docker environment, such as network security, image vulnerability scanning, or host-level security.  Those are important but outside the scope of this specific mitigation strategy.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Review of Dockerfiles:**  Examine the `Dockerfile` for both `web-server` and `database` services.  Check for the presence and correctness of `USER`, `groupadd`, `useradd`, and `chown` instructions.
2.  **Image Inspection:**  Build the Docker images and inspect them using `docker history` to verify the layers created by the user-related instructions.
3.  **Runtime Verification:**  Run containers from the built images and use `docker exec` to:
    *   Confirm the running user with `whoami`.
    *   Inspect process ownership using `ps aux`.
    *   Test file access permissions within the container.
4.  **Threat Model Validation:**  Revisit the identified threats (Privilege Escalation, Container Breakout, Filesystem Modification) and assess how the non-root user configuration mitigates each threat.  Consider specific attack scenarios.
5.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate any potential impact on application functionality or performance due to running as a non-root user.  This includes considering necessary file permissions and potential conflicts.
6.  **Gap Analysis:**  Identify any discrepancies between the intended implementation and the actual state.  Highlight missing configurations or areas needing improvement.
7.  **Recommendation Generation:**  Provide clear, actionable recommendations to address identified gaps and ensure consistent, complete implementation.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy: Run Containers as Non-Root Users

### 4.1.  Dockerfile Review and Image Inspection

**`web-server` (Partially Implemented):**

We assume the `web-server` Dockerfile *currently* looks something like this (or should):

```dockerfile
FROM some-base-image

# Create a group and user
RUN groupadd -r webusergroup && useradd -r -g webusergroup webuser

# ... (other instructions) ...

# Set ownership of application files
COPY --chown=webuser:webusergroup . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Switch to the non-root user
USER webuser

# ... (CMD or ENTRYPOINT) ...
```

*   **`groupadd -r webusergroup`**: Creates a system group (no login shell).  Good practice.
*   **`useradd -r -g webusergroup webuser`**: Creates a system user belonging to the `webusergroup`.  Good practice.
*   **`COPY --chown=webuser:webusergroup . /app`**:  Crucially, this sets the ownership of the copied application files to the non-root user.  This is essential for the application to run correctly.
*   **`USER webuser`**:  This is the key instruction that ensures subsequent commands and the main application process run as `webuser`.
*   **`docker history <web-server-image>`**:  We would use this command to verify that the layers corresponding to these commands exist and are in the correct order.

**`database` (Missing Implementation):**

The `database` Dockerfile *currently lacks* the necessary instructions.  This is a significant security gap.  A likely scenario is that the database process is running as `root` within the container.

### 4.2. Runtime Verification

**`web-server`:**

*   **`docker exec -it <web-server-container-id> whoami`**:  This *should* return `webuser`.  If it returns `root`, there's a problem with the `Dockerfile` or the build process.
*   **`docker exec -it <web-server-container-id> ps aux`**:  This should show the application processes running under the `webuser` user ID.
*   **File Access Tests:**  We should attempt to create, modify, and delete files within the container, both in directories owned by `webuser` and in system directories.  This verifies that the permissions are correctly restricting the non-root user.

**`database`:**

*   **`docker exec -it <database-container-id> whoami`**:  This will likely return `root`, confirming the missing implementation.
*   **`docker exec -it <database-container-id> ps aux`**:  This will likely show the database processes (e.g., `mysqld`, `postgres`) running as `root`.
*   **File Access Tests:**  Running as root, the database process will have unrestricted access to the container's filesystem, posing a significant risk.

### 4.3. Threat Model Validation

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  If an attacker gains a shell within the `web-server` container (e.g., through a web application vulnerability), they will be limited to the privileges of the `webuser`.  They won't be able to directly modify system files, install packages, or perform other privileged operations.  In the `database` container, running as root, an attacker would have full control.

*   **Container Breakout:**  Many container breakout exploits rely on vulnerabilities in the kernel or Docker daemon that can be triggered by privileged processes.  Running as a non-root user reduces the attack surface.  While not a foolproof defense, it makes breakout significantly harder.  The `database` container, running as root, is much more vulnerable to breakout.

*   **Filesystem Modification:**  The `web-server` container, with proper `chown` usage, should limit the attacker's ability to modify critical application files or system files.  The `database` container, running as root, offers no such protection.  An attacker could potentially corrupt the database files or inject malicious code.

### 4.4. Impact Assessment

*   **Potential Issues:**  The most common issue when switching to a non-root user is incorrect file permissions.  The application might need to write to specific directories (e.g., for logs, temporary files, or data storage).  These directories must be explicitly owned by the non-root user or have appropriate group permissions.
*   **Database Considerations:**  Database containers often require specific permissions for data directories.  The `database` Dockerfile needs to carefully set the ownership of the data volume or directory to the non-root user that the database process will run as.  This might involve using the database's official image as a base and modifying it, or consulting the database's documentation for best practices.
* **Performance:** There is no significant performance impact expected.

### 4.5. Gap Analysis

*   **Major Gap:** The `database` service is not running as a non-root user.  This is a critical vulnerability.
*   **Potential Gaps (Verification Needed):**
    *   Are all necessary directories and files within the `web-server` container correctly owned by the `webuser`?  Thorough testing is required.
    *   Are there any hardcoded assumptions about user IDs or file paths within the application code that might break when running as a non-root user?

### 4.6. Recommendations

1.  **Implement Non-Root User for `database`:**  This is the highest priority.  Create a dedicated user and group within the `database` Dockerfile, set appropriate ownership for the data directory, and use the `USER` instruction.  Consult the database's documentation for specific recommendations.  Example (for a hypothetical MySQL container):

    ```dockerfile
    FROM mysql:latest

    # Create a group and user
    RUN groupadd -r mysqlusergroup && useradd -r -g mysqlusergroup mysqluser

    # ... (other instructions, potentially setting environment variables) ...

    # Set ownership of the data directory (adjust path if needed)
    RUN chown -R mysqluser:mysqlusergroup /var/lib/mysql

    # Switch to the non-root user
    USER mysqluser

    # ... (CMD or ENTRYPOINT, likely already defined in the base image) ...
    ```

2.  **Thoroughly Test `web-server`:**  Even though it's partially implemented, rigorously test the `web-server` container to ensure all necessary file permissions are correct and the application functions as expected.

3.  **Automated Verification:**  Integrate checks into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically verify that containers are running as the intended non-root user.  This could involve scripting `docker exec` commands and checking the output.

4.  **Documentation:**  Clearly document the non-root user configuration for each service, including the user and group names, and the ownership of critical directories.

5.  **Regular Review:**  Periodically review the Dockerfiles and runtime configurations to ensure the non-root user strategy remains consistently implemented and effective.

6. **Consider using `USER` directive with UID/GID:** Instead of relying on usernames, which might be changed, consider using numeric UIDs and GIDs in the `USER` directive. This provides a more robust and consistent approach. For example: `USER 1001:1001`.

7. **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that the non-root user has only the *absolutely necessary* permissions within the container. Avoid granting unnecessary access.

By addressing these recommendations, the development team can significantly improve the security posture of the application by fully and consistently implementing the "Run Containers as Non-Root Users" mitigation strategy. This will reduce the risk of privilege escalation, container breakout, and unauthorized filesystem modification.
