Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Mount Root Filesystem as Read-Only" mitigation strategy, tailored for a development team using Moby/Docker:

# Deep Analysis: Mount Root Filesystem as Read-Only

## 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness, implementation gaps, and potential impact of mounting the root filesystem as read-only for Docker containers within our application, specifically focusing on the `database` and `message-queue` services where it is currently not implemented.  The goal is to identify concrete steps to improve the security posture of these services.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following:

*   **Target Services:**  `database` (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) and `message-queue` (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis) containers.  We will *not* re-evaluate the `web-server` container, as it's already implemented there.
*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Specifically, the use of `--read-only` (or `read_only: true` in Compose) and appropriate volume/tmpfs mounts.
*   **Threat Model:**  We'll consider the threats outlined in the provided description (Malware Installation, Persistent Threats, Configuration Tampering) and potentially others relevant to databases and message queues.
*   **Moby/Docker Version:**  We assume a reasonably up-to-date version of Docker Engine and Compose, but will note any version-specific considerations if they arise.
*   **Operational Impact:** We will assess the potential impact on application functionality, performance, and development workflows.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Expand the threat model to include specific threats relevant to databases and message queues (e.g., data exfiltration, denial-of-service via filesystem exhaustion).
2.  **Implementation Review:**  Examine the current Dockerfiles and Compose files for the `database` and `message-queue` services to understand their current filesystem usage.
3.  **Dependency Analysis:** Identify any dependencies (libraries, tools) within the containers that might require write access to the root filesystem.
4.  **Writable Area Identification:**  Determine the *minimum* set of directories that *must* be writable for the services to function correctly.  This is crucial for minimizing the attack surface.
5.  **Volume/tmpfs Strategy:**  Develop a specific plan for using volumes and/or tmpfs to provide writable access *only* to those identified directories.
6.  **Testing Plan:**  Outline a testing strategy to verify that the read-only implementation doesn't break functionality and that the security benefits are achieved.
7.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential impact on performance, development workflows, and operational procedures.
8.  **Recommendations:**  Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for implementing the read-only root filesystem, including specific Dockerfile/Compose changes.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy: Mount Root Filesystem as Read-Only

### 4.1. Threat Modeling Refinement (Database & Message Queue Specific)

In addition to the general threats, we need to consider:

*   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High - Database):**  An attacker gaining write access could potentially plant tools to exfiltrate data from the database.  A read-only filesystem prevents the installation of such tools *within the container*.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Filesystem Exhaustion (Severity: Medium - Both):**  An attacker could attempt to fill the filesystem with junk data, potentially crashing the service.  While `--read-only` helps, we need to ensure writable volumes/tmpfs are appropriately sized and monitored.
*   **Log Tampering (Severity: Medium - Both):**  An attacker might try to modify log files to cover their tracks.  Properly configured logging (to a separate volume or external service) is crucial, and `--read-only` helps prevent modification of the logging *configuration*.
*   **Database-Specific Exploits (Severity: High - Database):** Some database vulnerabilities might involve writing to specific files or directories.  `--read-only` provides a strong defense-in-depth layer.
*   **Message Queue Poisoning (Severity: High - Message Queue):** An attacker with write access could potentially inject malicious messages or alter the queue's internal state. `--read-only` limits the ability to modify the queue's core files.

### 4.2. Implementation Review (Current State)

*   **Assumption:** We assume the `database` and `message-queue` containers are currently running with writable root filesystems (as stated in "Currently Implemented").
*   **Dockerfile Analysis (Example - PostgreSQL):**  A typical PostgreSQL Dockerfile might look like this:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM postgres:latest
    # ... (other instructions)
    ```

    This inherits the base image's filesystem permissions, which are likely writable.
*   **Compose File Analysis (Example):**

    ```yaml
    services:
      database:
        image: postgres:latest
        # ... (other configurations)
        volumes:
          - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data  # Data directory is writable
    ```

    This example shows a common pattern: mounting the data directory as a volume.  However, the *rest* of the filesystem is still writable.

### 4.3. Dependency Analysis

*   **Database (PostgreSQL Example):**
    *   PostgreSQL itself primarily needs write access to its data directory (`/var/lib/postgresql/data` by default).
    *   It might also write temporary files to `/tmp`.
    *   Configuration files are typically in `/etc/postgresql` (should be read-only).
    *   Log files are often in `/var/log/postgresql` (should be on a separate volume or sent to an external logging service).
*   **Message Queue (RabbitMQ Example):**
    *   RabbitMQ needs write access to its data and log directories (configurable, often under `/var/lib/rabbitmq` and `/var/log/rabbitmq`).
    *   It might also use `/tmp` for temporary files.
    *   Configuration files are typically in `/etc/rabbitmq` (should be read-only).

### 4.4. Writable Area Identification

*   **Database (PostgreSQL):**
    *   **Essential:** `/var/lib/postgresql/data` (data directory)
    *   **Potentially:** `/tmp` (if used for temporary files; consider `tmpfs`)
    *   **Logs:** `/var/log/postgresql` (should be a separate volume or external)
*   **Message Queue (RabbitMQ):**
    *   **Essential:** Data directory (e.g., `/var/lib/rabbitmq`)
    *   **Essential:** Log directory (e.g., `/var/log/rabbitmq`)
    *   **Potentially:** `/tmp` (if used; consider `tmpfs`)

### 4.5. Volume/tmpfs Strategy

*   **Database (PostgreSQL):**

    ```yaml
    services:
      database:
        image: postgres:latest
        read_only: true
        volumes:
          - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data  # Data directory
          - ./logs:/var/log/postgresql      # Log directory
        tmpfs:
          - /tmp
    ```

*   **Message Queue (RabbitMQ):**

    ```yaml
    services:
      message-queue:
        image: rabbitmq:latest
        read_only: true
        volumes:
          - ./rabbitmq_data:/var/lib/rabbitmq  # Data directory
          - ./rabbitmq_logs:/var/log/rabbitmq  # Log directory
        tmpfs:
          - /tmp
    ```

**Explanation:**

*   `read_only: true`:  Enforces the read-only root filesystem.
*   `volumes`:  Mounts specific directories as writable volumes.  These are persistent across container restarts.  We use separate volumes for data and logs.
*   `tmpfs`:  Mounts `/tmp` as a temporary, in-memory filesystem.  This is *not* persistent and is a good choice for temporary files.  It also helps prevent filesystem exhaustion attacks targeting `/tmp`.

### 4.6. Testing Plan

1.  **Functionality Tests:**
    *   **Database:**  Run standard database operations (CRUD, backups, restores).  Verify data integrity.
    *   **Message Queue:**  Send, receive, and process messages.  Test various queue configurations (durable, transient, etc.).
2.  **Security Tests:**
    *   **Attempt to write to read-only areas:**  Try creating files, modifying existing files, and installing packages within the container.  These attempts should *fail*.
    *   **Verify volume/tmpfs permissions:**  Ensure that only the intended directories are writable.
    *   **Log inspection:**  Verify that logs are being written to the correct location (the mounted volume).
3.  **Performance Tests:**
    *   Measure database and message queue performance (throughput, latency) before and after implementing `--read-only`.  There should be minimal impact, but it's important to verify.
4.  **Restart/Recovery Tests:**
    *   Restart the containers and ensure data persistence (for volumes) and proper cleanup (for tmpfs).

### 4.7. Impact Assessment

*   **Performance:**  Minimal impact expected.  In some cases, using `tmpfs` for `/tmp` might even *improve* performance.
*   **Development Workflows:**  Developers might need to adjust how they interact with the containers (e.g., using `docker exec` to access writable volumes instead of directly modifying files within the container).  This is a minor inconvenience but improves security.
*   **Operational Procedures:**  Deployment scripts and monitoring tools might need to be updated to account for the new volume mounts.

### 4.8. Recommendations

1.  **Implement `read_only: true`:**  Apply the changes outlined in the "Volume/tmpfs Strategy" section to the `docker-compose.yml` files for the `database` and `message-queue` services.
2.  **Update Dockerfiles (Optional):**  Consider adding `USER` directives to the Dockerfiles to run the services as non-root users.  This provides an additional layer of security.
3.  **Review Log Configuration:**  Ensure logs are being sent to the designated volume or an external logging service.  Avoid logging sensitive information.
4.  **Monitor Volume Usage:**  Implement monitoring to track the disk space usage of the mounted volumes.  Set alerts for high usage to prevent potential DoS issues.
5.  **Regularly Update Base Images:**  Keep the base images (e.g., `postgres:latest`, `rabbitmq:latest`) up-to-date to benefit from security patches.
6.  **Document Changes:**  Clearly document the changes made to the Dockerfiles and Compose files, explaining the rationale and the expected behavior.
7.  **Thorough Testing:** Execute the testing plan described above to ensure functionality and security.
8. **Consider using more specific image tags:** Instead of `postgres:latest` use `postgres:15.4-bullseye` for example.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive plan for implementing the "Mount Root Filesystem as Read-Only" mitigation strategy, significantly enhancing the security of the `database` and `message-queue` services.  By following these recommendations, the development team can reduce the attack surface and improve the overall resilience of the application.
