# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for moby/moby

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Kernel Hardening (Namespaces, Cgroups, Capabilities)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_kernel_hardening__namespaces__cgroups__capabilities_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Kernel Hardening (Namespaces, Cgroups, Capabilities)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Namespaces:** Docker, built upon Moby, inherently utilizes Linux namespaces (PID, Network, Mount, UTS, IPC, User) for container isolation. Ensure these are active and functioning as intended. This is largely default behavior in Docker/Moby. Verify namespace isolation by inspecting container processes and network configurations.
    2.  **Cgroups:** Moby leverages cgroups to enforce resource limits (CPU, memory, I/O) for containers. Define and apply resource constraints in your `docker-compose.yml` or `docker run` commands (e.g., `cpu_shares`, `mem_limit`). Developers should specify appropriate limits based on application needs and infrastructure capacity.
    3.  **Capabilities:** Moby, by default, drops numerous Linux kernel capabilities for containers, enhancing security. Review the default dropped capabilities and avoid re-adding unnecessary ones using `--cap-add` in `docker run` or `capabilities` in `docker-compose.yml`. Only add capabilities strictly required by the application and document the justification.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Container Escape (High Severity):** Exploiting kernel vulnerabilities to bypass container isolation and access the host system.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** A container consuming excessive resources, impacting other containers or the host.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Container (Medium Severity):** Gaining elevated privileges inside a container due to excessive capabilities, potentially leading to further exploits.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Container Escape:** Significant risk reduction by limiting the attack surface and increasing the difficulty of escapes.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Moderate risk reduction by preventing resource monopolization.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Moderate risk reduction by limiting available privileges within containers.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Docker/Moby namespaces are used by default. Cgroup resource limits are defined in `docker-compose.yml` for production services. Default capabilities are used, but explicit review and documentation are missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic review and documentation of required capabilities for each containerized service.
    *   Automated checks in CI/CD to verify that only necessary capabilities are added and resource limits are defined in Docker configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Seccomp Profiles](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_seccomp_profiles.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Seccomp Profiles
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Profile Selection:** Begin with the default Seccomp profile provided by Docker/Moby.
    2.  **Customization (if needed):** If the default profile is too restrictive, create a custom Seccomp profile in JSON format. Carefully analyze the application's system call requirements. Tools like `strace` can help identify necessary syscalls.
    3.  **Profile Application:** Apply the Seccomp profile to containers using `--security-opt seccomp=profile.json` in `docker run` or `security_opt` in `docker-compose.yml`. This leverages Moby's Seccomp integration.
    4.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the application with the Seccomp profile to ensure proper functionality. Monitor container logs for syscall denials, indicating potential issues or overly restrictive profiles.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Container Escape (High Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by limiting available syscalls, making kernel exploitation more challenging.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Container (Medium Severity):** Prevents malicious code from utilizing certain syscalls for privilege escalation attempts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Container Escape:** Significant risk reduction by restricting syscall access.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Moderate risk reduction by limiting syscalls used for privilege escalation.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Default Seccomp profile is not explicitly enforced or customized within Docker/Moby configurations.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enforce the default Seccomp profile for all containers using Docker/Moby configurations.
    *   Analyze application syscall needs and create custom profiles where necessary, leveraging Docker/Moby's profile application mechanisms.
    *   Integrate Seccomp profile enforcement into container build and deployment processes using Docker tooling.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize AppArmor or SELinux](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_apparmor_or_selinux.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** AppArmor or SELinux Mandatory Access Control
*   **Description:**
    1.  **MAC System Choice:** Select either AppArmor or SELinux based on your Linux distribution and expertise. Docker/Moby supports integration with both.
    2.  **Installation and Enablement:** Ensure AppArmor or SELinux is installed and enabled on the host system where Moby/Docker is running.
    3.  **Policy Definition:** Create AppArmor or SELinux policies specifically tailored for your containers. These policies, enforced by the kernel and interpreted by Docker/Moby, define allowed file access, network access, capabilities, etc. Tools like `docker-gen-security-policy` can assist in generating initial policies.
    4.  **Policy Application:** Apply the policies to containers using `--security-opt apparmor=profile-name` or `--security-opt selinux-options=level:s0:c123,c456` in `docker run` or `security_opt` in `docker-compose.yml`. This utilizes Docker/Moby's security options.
    5.  **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test applications with MAC policies and refine policies based on application behavior and security needs. Monitor audit logs for policy violations reported by the kernel and potentially surfaced by Docker/Moby.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Container Escape (High Severity):** Provides an additional layer of defense against container escapes by enforcing access control beyond standard Linux permissions, through Docker/Moby's integration.

    *   **Data Breach (Medium Severity):** Restricts container access to sensitive data on the host system, controlled by MAC policies and Docker/Moby.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Container Escape:** Significant risk reduction by adding a strong layer of access control enforced by the kernel and utilized by Docker/Moby.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Moderate risk reduction by limiting container access to other resources through MAC policies and Docker/Moby.
    *   **Data Breach:** Moderate risk reduction by restricting access to sensitive data via MAC policies and Docker/Moby.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. AppArmor or SELinux policies are not defined or enforced for containers within the Docker/Moby environment.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Choose and implement either AppArmor or SELinux for container security within the Docker/Moby setup.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Alternative Container Runtimes (gVisor, Kata Containers)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Alternative Evaluation:** Research and evaluate alternative container runtimes like gVisor or Kata Containers that can be integrated with Docker/Moby. Understand their security benefits, isolation models, and performance implications compared to the default `runc` runtime used by Moby.
    2.  **POC and Compatibility Testing:** Conduct a proof-of-concept (POC) with a chosen alternative runtime in a non-production Docker environment. Test application compatibility, performance, and integration with existing Docker workflows.
    3.  **Deployment (if suitable):** If the alternative runtime meets security and performance requirements, plan for deployment in production Docker environments. Configure Docker/Moby to use the alternative runtime (e.g., using `containerd` configuration, as Docker uses `containerd` as its container runtime).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Container Escape (High Severity):** Significantly reduces the risk of container escapes by providing stronger isolation boundaries (lightweight VMs or user-space kernels) compared to the standard `runc` runtime in Moby.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Docker Daemon Socket](./mitigation_strategies/secure_docker_daemon_socket.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Docker Daemon Socket
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Socket Exposure Minimization:** Avoid exposing the Docker daemon socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`), which is the primary control interface for Moby, directly to containers or networks unless absolutely necessary. Direct access bypasses Docker's API security.
    2.  **Restricted Access (if exposure unavoidable):** If socket exposure is unavoidable, implement strict access controls at the host OS level to limit which users or processes can access the socket. Consider using tools like `socket-proxy` to mediate and restrict access to the Docker API through the socket.
    3.  **Alternative API Access:** Explore using the Docker API over HTTP/TLS instead of the socket for remote management, as TLS provides encryption and authentication.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Docker Daemon Control (High Severity):**  Gaining unauthorized control over the Docker daemon (Moby) by exploiting exposed sockets, allowing attackers to manage containers, images, and potentially the host system.
    *   **Container Escape via Socket Abuse (High Severity):**  Escaping containers by abusing direct access to the Docker daemon socket from within a container.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Docker Daemon Control:** Significant risk reduction by preventing unauthorized access to the core Moby control interface.
    *   **Container Escape via Socket Abuse:** Significant risk reduction by eliminating a direct path for container escapes through socket abuse.
