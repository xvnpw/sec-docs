### High and Critical v2ray-core Threats

This list contains high and critical threats directly involving v2ray-core.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the v2ray-core configuration file (config.json). This allows them to read sensitive information like private keys, user credentials, server addresses, and routing rules configured within v2ray-core.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the v2ray-core instance, potential for impersonation, data theft, and unauthorized access to internal networks facilitated by v2ray-core's routing capabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration loading and storage mechanisms within v2ray-core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict file system permissions on the configuration file to only the necessary user running the v2ray-core process.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data within the configuration file if supported by v2ray-core or the deployment environment.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the configuration file if possible (e.g., use environment variables or secure key management systems that v2ray-core can integrate with).
        *   Regularly back up and securely store configuration files.

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Access Controls for Management API
    *   **Description:** If the v2ray-core management API is enabled without proper authentication and authorization configured within v2ray-core, an attacker can remotely access and manipulate the v2ray-core instance. This could involve changing configurations, disrupting service, or gaining insights into network traffic routed by v2ray-core.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption of the v2ray-core instance, unauthorized access to internal network resources proxied by v2ray-core, potential for data manipulation or theft through the compromised proxy.
    *   **Affected Component:** Management API module within v2ray-core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the management API within v2ray-core's configuration (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).
        *   Enforce strict authorization policies within v2ray-core to limit access to specific API endpoints based on user roles.
        *   Restrict network access to the management API to trusted sources only, ideally configured within the network or host firewall in addition to v2ray-core's access controls.
        *   Regularly audit access logs for suspicious activity related to the management API.

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Communication Channels
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between v2ray-core clients and servers (or between v2ray-core instances) if TLS/SSL is not properly configured or enforced within v2ray-core. This allows them to eavesdrop on or modify the traffic being proxied by v2ray-core.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality of data being transmitted through v2ray-core, potential for data manipulation, and impersonation of clients or servers communicating via v2ray-core.
    *   **Affected Component:** Inbound and outbound connection handling, protocol implementations (e.g., VMess, Shadowsocks, Trojan) within v2ray-core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS/SSL for all communication channels configured within v2ray-core.
        *   Use strong and up-to-date TLS/SSL configurations within v2ray-core.
        *   Verify the authenticity of certificates used by v2ray-core.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS for enhanced security within v2ray-core's configuration.

*   **Threat:** Protocol Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities might exist in the specific protocols implemented by v2ray-core (e.g., VMess, Shadowsocks, Trojan). Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities within v2ray-core to bypass security measures, inject malicious traffic into the proxied connections, or cause denial of service to the v2ray-core instance.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could include remote code execution on the v2ray-core instance, service disruption, or data compromise of traffic being handled by v2ray-core.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific protocol implementation modules within v2ray-core (e.g., `proxy/vmess`, `proxy/shadowsocks`, `proxy/trojan`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest v2ray-core releases and security patches.
        *   Carefully evaluate the security implications of different protocols before using them within v2ray-core.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues affecting v2ray-core's protocol implementations.

*   **Threat:** Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Bugs in the v2ray-core codebase could lead to memory corruption issues (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free). Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the system running v2ray-core.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the v2ray-core instance, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core functionality, memory management within v2ray-core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest v2ray-core releases and security patches.
        *   Report any potential bugs or vulnerabilities to the v2ray-core developers.

*   **Threat:** Weak or Default Credentials for Protocol Authentication
    *   **Description:** If protocols like Shadowsocks or VMess are configured within v2ray-core with weak or default passwords, attackers can easily authenticate and gain unauthorized access to the proxy service provided by that v2ray-core instance.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the proxy, potential for misuse of resources provided by the v2ray-core instance, and exposure of user traffic routed through the compromised proxy.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific protocol authentication mechanisms within v2ray-core (e.g., `proxy/shadowsocks/auth`, `proxy/vmess/auth`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce the use of strong and unique passwords for protocol authentication within v2ray-core's configuration.
        *   Avoid using default credentials.
        *   Consider using more secure authentication methods if available within the chosen protocol in v2ray-core.
