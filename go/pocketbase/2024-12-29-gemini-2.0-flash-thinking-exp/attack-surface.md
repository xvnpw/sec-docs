Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving PocketBase, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Default Admin Credentials
    *   **Description:**  PocketBase, upon initial setup, might have a default administrative user with well-known or easily guessable credentials.
    *   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase requires an initial admin user to be created. If this step is skipped or default/weak credentials are used, it creates an immediate entry point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses common default credentials like "admin/password" or "pb_admin/pb_password" to log into the administrative panel.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the PocketBase instance, including access to all data, user accounts, and the ability to modify the application's configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change the default admin credentials during the initial setup process.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for the admin user.
        *   Consider disabling or renaming the default admin user after creating a new one.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure API Rules
    *   **Description:**  PocketBase's API rules, which control access to collections and records, are misconfigured or overly permissive.
    *   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase's role-based access control is defined through these rules. Incorrectly configured rules directly expose data and functionality.
    *   **Example:** An API rule allows any authenticated user to read all records in a sensitive collection, even if they should only have access to their own data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, potential data manipulation or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design and implement API rules based on the principle of least privilege.
        *   Thoroughly test API rules to ensure they function as intended and don't expose unintended data.
        *   Regularly review and audit API rules as application requirements evolve.
        *   Utilize the different rule types (read, create, update, delete) effectively to restrict access.

*   **Attack Surface:** Unrestricted File Uploads
    *   **Description:**  PocketBase allows users to upload files without proper restrictions on file types, size, or content.
    *   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase provides built-in file storage functionality, and the security of this feature depends on how the application configures and uses it.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image, which is then executed on the server, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, denial of service (through large file uploads), cross-site scripting (if uploaded files are served without proper content-type headers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation based on file extensions and MIME types.
        *   Sanitize uploaded file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   Set appropriate file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root and serve them through a secure mechanism that prevents direct execution.
        *   Implement content security policies (CSP) to mitigate potential XSS issues from served files.

*   **Attack Surface:** JWT Secret Exposure
    *   **Description:** The secret key used by PocketBase to sign JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication is exposed or easily compromised.
    *   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase uses JWTs for authentication. The security of this mechanism relies entirely on the secrecy of the signing key.
    *   **Example:** The JWT secret key is hardcoded in the application's source code, stored in a publicly accessible configuration file, or leaked through a server misconfiguration.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can forge valid JWTs, allowing them to impersonate any user, including administrators, and gain unauthorized access to the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store the JWT secret key securely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.
        *   Ensure the secret key has sufficient entropy (is long and random).
        *   Regularly rotate the JWT secret key.
        *   Avoid hardcoding the secret key in the application's codebase.

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Admin UI
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the PocketBase administrative interface that allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that are executed in the context of an administrator's browser.
    *   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase provides a built-in admin UI, and vulnerabilities within this UI can expose administrators to XSS attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious script into a field within the admin panel (e.g., a collection name), which is then executed when an administrator views that page, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover of administrators, ability to modify application settings, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the PocketBase version is up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Implement proper input sanitization and output encoding within the admin UI.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the admin UI can load resources.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Deserialization in Go Extensions
    *   **Description:** If using custom Go extensions, vulnerabilities in deserializing user-provided data can lead to remote code execution.
    *   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase allows for extending its functionality with Go plugins, which introduces the risk of vulnerabilities within these extensions.
    *   **Example:** A Go extension receives serialized data from a user request. If this data is not properly validated and deserialized, an attacker can craft malicious input that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit any third-party Go extensions.
        *   Implement secure deserialization practices, avoiding unsafe deserialization methods.
        *   Validate all user-provided data before deserialization.
        *   Run Go extensions with the least necessary privileges.
