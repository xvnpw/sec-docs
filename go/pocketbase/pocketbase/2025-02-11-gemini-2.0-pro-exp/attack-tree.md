## Attack Tree Path: [1. Gain Unauthorized Admin Access [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__gain_unauthorized_admin_access__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Admin Authentication/Authorization [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **1.1.1 Brute-Force Admin Credentials [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker attempts to guess the administrator's password by trying many different combinations.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if weak passwords/no lockout), Low (if strong passwords/lockout)
        *   **Impact:** High (full admin access) [CRITICAL]
        *   **Effort:** Low (automated tools available)
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (failed login attempts logged)
        *   **Mitigation:** Strong password policy, rate limiting, account lockout, 2FA (if possible).

    *   **1.1.4 Bypass Authentication via API Misconfiguration [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits incorrectly configured API rules to access administrative functions without proper authentication.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (full admin access) [CRITICAL]
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**  Strictly define API rules and permissions. Thoroughly review PocketBase's API documentation and your implementation. Test all API endpoints.

    *   **1.1.5 Exploit a Zero-Day Vulnerability in PocketBase's Admin Auth [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker uses a previously unknown vulnerability in PocketBase's authentication system to gain administrative access.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High (full admin access, potentially RCE) [CRITICAL]
        *   **Effort:** Very High
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep PocketBase updated. Monitor security advisories. Consider a WAF.

*   **1.2 Exploit PocketBase Server-Side Vulnerabilities**

    *   **1.2.1 Remote Code Execution (RCE) in PocketBase Core [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in PocketBase's core code to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High (full server compromise) [CRITICAL]
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep PocketBase updated. Run PocketBase in a restricted environment. Regular security audits.

*   **1.3 Exploit Misconfigured Hooks or Extensions [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **1.3.1 Bypass Authentication/Authorization via Custom Hook [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a flaw in a custom-written hook to bypass authentication or authorization checks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (full admin access or unauthorized data access) [CRITICAL]
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly review and audit all custom hooks. Apply the principle of least privilege. Use a linter and static analysis tools.

    *   **1.3.3 RCE via Custom Hook (if using unsafe operations) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a custom hook that uses unsafe functions (like `os/exec`) to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High (full server compromise) [CRITICAL]
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
        *   **Mitigation:** Avoid using `os/exec` or similar functions in hooks unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. Sanitize all inputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exfiltrate Sensitive Data [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exfiltrate_sensitive_data__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Direct Data Access (After Gaining Admin Access - See Branch 1)**
    *   This path inherits the risk and criticality of the chosen admin access method.

*   **2.2 Exploit API Misconfiguration (Read-Only Access) [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **2.2.1 Access Unprotected Collections/Records via API [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker accesses data through the API that should be protected but is accessible due to misconfigured API rules.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on data sensitivity) [CRITICAL]
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Define strict API rules. Ensure collections and records intended to be private are *explicitly* protected. Test API endpoints thoroughly.

*   **2.3 Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities (Read Access)**

    *   **2.3.2 Exploit a Zero-Day Vulnerability Allowing Data Read [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker uses a previously unknown vulnerability in PocketBase to read sensitive data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High (full data access) [CRITICAL]
        *   **Effort:** Very High
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep PocketBase updated. Monitor security advisories. Consider a WAF.

*   **2.4 Exploit Misconfigured Hooks or Extensions (Read Access) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **2.4.1 Data Leakage via Custom Hook [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a flaw in custom-written hook to access and exfiltrate sensitive data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High [CRITICAL]
