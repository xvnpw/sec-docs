**Scope:**

This analysis focuses on the PocketBase core application as defined by the provided GitHub repository (https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase).  It considers the built-in functionalities and does *not* extend to custom applications built *using* PocketBase, except where those applications directly interact with PocketBase's core features.  The analysis considers both the codebase (inferred from the repository) and the provided documentation.  External services (OAuth2 providers, S3-compatible storage, email providers) are considered only in terms of their interaction with PocketBase, not their internal security.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Architecture and Component Inference:**  Based on the provided C4 diagrams, documentation, and GitHub repository, we infer the architecture, components, and data flow of PocketBase.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  For each identified component, we perform threat modeling using a combination of STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) and known attack vectors relevant to web applications and backend systems.
3.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  We identify potential vulnerabilities based on the threat modeling and known security best practices.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Recommendation:**  For each identified vulnerability, we propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies tailored to PocketBase's architecture and design.  These recommendations are prioritized based on their impact and feasibility.
5.  **Security Control Review:** We analyze existing security controls and recommend improvements or additions.
