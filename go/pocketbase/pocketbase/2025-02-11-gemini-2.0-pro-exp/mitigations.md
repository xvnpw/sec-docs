# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pocketbase/pocketbase

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege (API Rules)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege__api_rules_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce the principle of least privilege for all API access rules within Pocketbase.

**Description:**
1.  **Start with Zero Access:** Begin by setting all collection rules (create, read, update, delete) in Pocketbase's admin UI (or via the API) to `false` or `@request.auth.id = ""`. This denies all access by default.
2.  **Identify User Roles:** Define user roles within your Pocketbase application (or categorize users based on their intended interaction).
3.  **Grant Specific Permissions:** For each role and collection, use Pocketbase's rule editor to define the *minimum* necessary permissions. Utilize the `@request.auth` object extensively:
    *   `@request.auth.id = record.userId`:  Allows access only to records created by the user.
    *   `@request.auth.role = "admin"`:  Allows access only to users with the "admin" role (assuming you've defined roles).
    *   `@request.auth.id != ""`: Allows access to any authenticated user.
    *   Combine conditions: `@request.auth.role = "editor" || @request.auth.id = record.ownerId`.
4.  **Field-Level Restrictions:**  Use the "Fields" tab in the Pocketbase admin UI (or API) to restrict access to specific fields within a collection.
5.  **Filter Expressions:** Use `filter` expressions carefully within Pocketbase rules. Test them thoroughly to avoid unintended data exposure.
6.  **Regular Audits:** Regularly review all API rules within the Pocketbase admin UI.
7.  **Automated Testing:** Develop automated tests that interact with the Pocketbase API, simulating different user roles and requests to verify rule enforcement.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents users from accessing data they shouldn't via the Pocketbase API.
*   **Data Tampering (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized modification/deletion via the Pocketbase API.
*   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents users from gaining higher privileges than allowed through the Pocketbase API.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces the risk of leaking sensitive information through the Pocketbase API.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Data Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (Medium/High to Low/Medium).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic rules based on `@request.auth.id` are in place.
*   Field-level restrictions are used in the `users` collection.
*   Basic automated tests exist.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive RBAC is not fully implemented.
*   Automated tests don't cover all filter expressions and edge cases.
*   Regular audits are not part of the workflow.
*   Field-level restrictions are not consistently applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Real-time Subscriptions](./mitigation_strategies/secure_real-time_subscriptions.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Enforce authentication and authorization *before* allowing real-time subscriptions using Pocketbase's hooks.

**Description:**
1.  **`OnRealtimeConnectRequest` Hook:** Implement the `OnRealtimeConnectRequest` hook in your Pocketbase Go code.
2.  **Authentication Check:** Within the hook, check for user authentication using `e.HttpContext.Get("user")`.  Return an error if the user is not authenticated.
3.  **Authorization Check:** After authentication, check if the user has permissions to subscribe to the requested collection/record. Access user information from `e.HttpContext.Get("user")` and compare it to the subscription request. Return an error if unauthorized.
4.  **Subscription ID (Optional):** Consider adding a unique identifier to each subscription request (passed from the client). Store this ID with user information for tracking.
5.  **Subscription Revocation:** Implement a mechanism (potentially using other Pocketbase hooks or external systems) to revoke subscriptions when user permissions change or sessions end.
6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test subscription logic with different user roles and permissions using Pocketbase's API.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Real-time Data Leakage (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized clients from receiving real-time updates via Pocketbase.
*   **Unauthorized Subscription (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized subscriptions to collections/records via Pocketbase.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low to Medium Severity):** Reduces the potential for overwhelming the Pocketbase server with subscriptions.

**Impact:**
*   **Real-time Data Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Unauthorized Subscription:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced (Low/Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic authentication check in `OnRealtimeConnectRequest`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Authorization checks based on roles/permissions.
*   Subscription ID tracking.
*   Subscription revocation mechanism.
*   Comprehensive testing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Hook Implementation (Pocketbase Hooks)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_hook_implementation__pocketbase_hooks_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Implement Pocketbase hooks with robust input validation, error handling, and non-blocking operations.

**Description:**
1.  **Input Validation:** Within your Pocketbase hooks (e.g., `OnRecordBeforeCreateRequest`, `OnRecordBeforeUpdateRequest`), treat *all* data as potentially untrusted, including `e.Record`, `e.Mail`, and `e.HttpContext`.
2.  **Sanitization:** Sanitize user input within hooks to prevent XSS and other injection attacks. Use a Go sanitization library.
3.  **Parameterized Queries:** If you're writing *raw* SQL within a hook (generally discouraged), use parameterized queries. Pocketbase's DAO methods usually handle this, but be cautious.
4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling within hooks. Do *not* expose internal error details to the client. Return generic error messages using `return errors.New(...)`.
5.  **Logging:** Log errors and exceptions within hooks, including relevant context (user ID, request data). Use a consistent logging format within your Pocketbase application.
6.  **Non-Blocking Operations:** Avoid long-running or blocking operations within Pocketbase hooks. If necessary, use a background worker or queue system (external to Pocketbase, but triggered from the hook).
7.  **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all Pocketbase hook code.
8.  **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests that specifically target your Pocketbase hooks, verifying their behavior and security.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevented by sanitizing input within hooks.
*   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Prevented by using parameterized queries (or relying on Pocketbase's DAO) within hooks.
*   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Prevented by input validation and avoiding execution of arbitrary code within hooks.
*   **Data Corruption (High Severity):** Prevented by validating data within hooks before database operations.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevented by avoiding blocking operations within hooks.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevented by proper error handling and logging within hooks.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS, SQL Injection, Code Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic error handling in some hooks.
*   Parameterized queries are used (via Pocketbase's DAO).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive input validation and sanitization are inconsistent.
*   Centralized logging is not fully implemented.
*   Background worker/queue system is not implemented.
*   Thorough code review and testing of all hooks are not routine.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Admin UI Access (Pocketbase Admin UI)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_admin_ui_access__pocketbase_admin_ui_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict access to the Pocketbase Admin UI and enforce strong authentication.

**Description:**
1.  **Strong Password:** Immediately change the default Pocketbase admin password to a strong, unique password.
2.  **IP Address Restriction:** If possible, restrict access to the Admin UI to specific IP addresses. This is often done at the *infrastructure* level (firewall, reverse proxy), but it directly impacts the security of the Pocketbase Admin UI.
3.  **Disable Admin UI (If Possible):** If the Admin UI is not *strictly* necessary in production, disable it entirely. You can manage Pocketbase programmatically through its Go API. This is a configuration option within Pocketbase.
4.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (Recommended):** While Pocketbase doesn't *natively* support 2FA for the Admin UI, implementing it at the infrastructure level (VPN, reverse proxy) significantly enhances the security of the Admin UI.
5. **Audit Logs:** Monitor Pocketbase logs for suspicious activity related to the Admin UI.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Admin Access (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from accessing the Pocketbase Admin UI.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of password guessing against the Pocketbase Admin UI.
*   **Credential Stuffing (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of using stolen credentials to access the Pocketbase Admin UI.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Admin Access:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **Credential Stuffing:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   A strong, unique password is used.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   IP address restriction is not implemented.
*   Two-factor authentication (2FA) is not implemented.
*   Regular auditing of Admin UI activity is not routine.
*   The Admin UI is not disabled in production.
