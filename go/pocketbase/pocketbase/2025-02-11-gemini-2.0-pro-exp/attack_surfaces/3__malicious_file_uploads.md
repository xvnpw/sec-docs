Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Malicious File Uploads" attack surface for a PocketBase application.

## Deep Analysis: Malicious File Uploads in PocketBase Applications

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1. Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with malicious file uploads in a PocketBase application, identify specific vulnerabilities, and propose robust, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview already provided.  We aim to provide developers with concrete guidance to minimize the attack surface related to file uploads.

**1.2. Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack surface presented by PocketBase's file upload and storage capabilities.  It encompasses:

*   The mechanisms PocketBase uses to handle file uploads.
*   Potential vulnerabilities arising from improper configuration or usage of these mechanisms.
*   Exploitation techniques attackers might employ.
*   Detailed mitigation strategies, including code-level considerations where applicable.
*   The interaction of PocketBase with underlying operating system and web server configurations.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other attack vectors unrelated to file uploads (e.g., SQL injection, XSS in other contexts).
*   General security best practices not directly related to file uploads.
*   Specific vulnerabilities in third-party libraries *unless* they directly impact PocketBase's file handling.

**1.3. Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Documentation Review:**  Thorough examination of the official PocketBase documentation, source code (where relevant), and community discussions related to file handling.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Investigation of known vulnerabilities and common exploitation techniques related to file uploads in web applications generally, and specifically in Go-based applications (since PocketBase is built with Go).
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identification of potential attack scenarios and the steps an attacker might take to exploit vulnerabilities.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluation of the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies and identification of potential weaknesses or limitations.
5.  **Best Practices Compilation:**  Summarization of recommended best practices for secure file upload handling in PocketBase.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

**2.1. PocketBase File Handling Mechanisms:**

PocketBase, by default, handles file uploads through its API.  Key aspects include:

*   **API Endpoints:**  PocketBase provides API endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting records, including those with associated files.  These endpoints are the primary entry point for file uploads.
*   **Storage:** PocketBase stores files in a designated directory (configurable).  By default, this is likely within the application's directory structure, but it *should* be configured to be outside the web root.
*   **Database Integration:**  PocketBase stores metadata about the uploaded files (filename, size, content type, etc.) in its database.  This metadata is crucial for managing and retrieving files.
*   **Hooks:** PocketBase provides hooks (e.g., `OnRecordBeforeCreateRequest`, `OnRecordBeforeUpdateRequest`) that allow developers to intercept and modify the file upload process.  These hooks are *essential* for implementing robust security measures.

**2.2. Potential Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Techniques:**

Beyond the general description, let's delve into specific vulnerabilities:

*   **2.2.1. Unrestricted File Type Upload (Critical):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  If PocketBase is configured to accept any file type, or if the file type validation is weak (e.g., relying solely on the file extension), an attacker can upload executable files (e.g., `.php`, `.asp`, `.exe`, `.sh`, `.py`, `.js`).
    *   **Exploitation:**  The attacker uploads a malicious script (e.g., a PHP web shell).  If the web server is configured to execute files with that extension, the attacker can gain remote code execution (RCE) on the server.  Even if the server doesn't directly execute the file, it could be used for other attacks (e.g., a JavaScript file for a stored XSS attack if served to other users).
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads `shell.php` disguised as `image.jpg`.  If the server executes PHP files, accessing `/uploads/shell.php` (or whatever path PocketBase uses) triggers the malicious code.

*   **2.2.2. Insufficient File Size Limits (High):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Large file uploads can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by consuming server resources (disk space, memory, bandwidth).
    *   **Exploitation:**  An attacker repeatedly uploads very large files, exhausting server resources and making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a 10GB file repeatedly, filling up the server's storage.

*   **2.2.3. Path Traversal (High):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  If the filename sanitization is inadequate, an attacker can use ".." sequences in the filename to write files outside the intended upload directory.
    *   **Exploitation:**  The attacker uploads a file named `../../../etc/passwd` (or a similar path).  If successful, this could overwrite critical system files or allow the attacker to read sensitive data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a file named `../../config.php`, potentially overwriting the application's configuration file.

*   **2.2.4. Content-Type Spoofing (Medium):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Relying solely on the `Content-Type` header provided by the client is dangerous, as it can be easily manipulated.
    *   **Exploitation:**  An attacker uploads a PHP file but sets the `Content-Type` header to `image/jpeg`.  If the server-side validation only checks the header, the malicious file might be accepted.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a `.php` file, but the browser sends `Content-Type: image/jpeg`.  If PocketBase only checks this header, it might treat the file as an image.

*   **2.2.5. Missing File Content Validation (Medium):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Even if the file extension and `Content-Type` seem correct, the file's actual content might be malicious.  For example, an image file might contain embedded malicious code (polyglot files).
    *   **Exploitation:**  An attacker uploads a seemingly valid image file that contains a hidden PHP script.  If the server processes the image (e.g., for resizing), the embedded code might be executed.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a JPEG file that also contains a valid PHP script at the end.  Image processing libraries might ignore the extra data, but a vulnerable server configuration could execute it.

*   **2.2.6. Lack of Virus Scanning (Medium):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Uploaded files might contain viruses or malware.
    *   **Exploitation:**  An attacker uploads a file containing a virus.  If other users download and execute this file, their systems can be infected.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a `.docx` file containing a macro virus.

*   **2.2.7. Double Extensions (Medium):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Attackers may try to bypass file type checks by using double extensions.
    *   **Exploitation:**  An attacker uploads a file named `malicious.php.jpg`.  If the server's configuration or the application's validation logic only checks the last extension, it might be treated as a JPEG, but the server might still execute the PHP code.
    *   **Example:** Apache's `mod_php` might be configured to execute files ending in `.php`, regardless of any subsequent extensions.

* **2.2.8. Null Byte Injection (Medium):**
    * **Vulnerability:** Attackers may use null bytes to bypass file extension checks.
    * **Exploitation:** An attacker uploads a file named `malicious.php%00.jpg`. Some systems may truncate the filename at the null byte, treating it as `malicious.php`.
    * **Example:** Older versions of PHP were vulnerable to this, where the null byte would effectively terminate the filename string.

**2.3. Detailed Mitigation Strategies:**

Let's expand on the initial mitigation strategies with more depth and practical considerations:

*   **2.3.1. Strict File Type Whitelisting (Essential):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Use PocketBase hooks (e.g., `OnRecordBeforeCreateRequest`) to *strictly* enforce a whitelist of allowed file extensions *and* MIME types.  Do *not* use a blacklist.
    *   **Code Example (Conceptual - Adapt to PocketBase's Hook System):**

        ```go
        func validateFileType(file *UploadedFile) error {
            allowedMimeTypes := map[string]bool{
                "image/jpeg": true,
                "image/png":  true,
                "image/gif":  true,
                // Add other allowed MIME types here
            }
            allowedExtensions := map[string]bool{
                ".jpg":  true,
                ".jpeg": true,
                ".png":  true,
                ".gif":  true,
            }

            if !allowedMimeTypes[file.ContentType] {
                return errors.New("invalid MIME type")
            }

            ext := filepath.Ext(file.Name)
            if !allowedExtensions[ext] {
                return errors.New("invalid file extension")
            }

            // Further content validation (see below) is crucial!
            return nil
        }
        ```
    *   **Considerations:**  Regularly update the whitelist as needed.  Consider using a library for MIME type detection based on file content (e.g., `net/http`'s `DetectContentType` in Go), *not* just the header.

*   **2.3.2. Robust File Size Limits (Essential):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Configure maximum file size limits at multiple levels:
        *   **PocketBase:** Use hooks to enforce a maximum file size.
        *   **Web Server:** Configure limits in your web server (e.g., Nginx's `client_max_body_size`, Apache's `LimitRequestBody`).
        *   **Reverse Proxy (if applicable):**  Configure limits in your reverse proxy.
    *   **Considerations:**  Choose limits appropriate for your application's needs.  Too low, and legitimate uploads will fail; too high, and you're vulnerable to DoS.

*   **2.3.3. Filename Sanitization and Path Traversal Prevention (Essential):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Use PocketBase hooks to sanitize filenames *before* saving them.  Remove or replace any potentially dangerous characters (e.g., `/`, `\`, `..`, control characters).  Use a well-tested library for this purpose.  *Never* use user-provided input directly to construct file paths.
    *   **Code Example (Conceptual):**

        ```go
        func sanitizeFilename(filename string) string {
            // Remove or replace dangerous characters
            filename = strings.ReplaceAll(filename, "..", "")
            filename = strings.ReplaceAll(filename, "/", "")
            filename = strings.ReplaceAll(filename, "\\", "")
            // ... other replacements ...

            // Generate a unique, safe filename (e.g., using a UUID)
            return uuid.New().String() + filepath.Ext(filename)
        }
        ```
    *   **Considerations:**  Consider generating completely random filenames (e.g., using UUIDs) and storing the original filename in the database.  This is the most secure approach.

*   **2.3.4. Content-Type Validation and Magic Number Checking (Essential):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Do *not* rely solely on the `Content-Type` header.  Use a library to detect the file type based on its content (magic number checking).  In Go, you can use `http.DetectContentType`.
    *   **Code Example (Conceptual):**

        ```go
        import "net/http"

        func validateContentType(fileContent []byte) error {
            detectedContentType := http.DetectContentType(fileContent)
            // Compare detectedContentType to your whitelist of allowed MIME types
            // ...
            return nil
        }
        ```
    *   **Considerations:**  Magic number checking is not foolproof, but it's significantly better than relying on the header alone.

*   **2.3.5. File Content Analysis (Strongly Recommended):**
    *   **Implementation:**  For certain file types (e.g., images), consider using libraries to parse the file and ensure it conforms to the expected format.  This can help detect polyglot files or other embedded malicious code.
    *   **Considerations:**  This can be computationally expensive.  Choose libraries carefully to avoid introducing new vulnerabilities.

*   **2.3.6. Virus Scanning (Strongly Recommended):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Integrate a virus scanner (e.g., ClamAV) to scan all uploaded files.  This can be done through a PocketBase hook or by using a separate service that monitors the upload directory.
    *   **Considerations:**  Keep the virus definitions up to date.  Virus scanning is not a silver bullet, but it adds a valuable layer of defense.

*   **2.3.7. Storage Outside Web Root (Essential):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Configure PocketBase to store uploaded files in a directory that is *not* accessible directly through the web server.  This prevents direct execution of uploaded files.
    *   **Considerations:**  Ensure the directory has appropriate permissions (read/write for the PocketBase process, but not for the web server user).

*   **2.3.8. Secure File Serving (Essential):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Serve uploaded files through a dedicated endpoint that performs authentication and authorization checks.  Do *not* allow direct access to the file storage directory.  Use PocketBase's API for this purpose.
    *   **Considerations:**  This prevents unauthorized access to uploaded files and ensures that only authenticated users can download them.

* **2.3.9. Input Validation and Output Encoding:**
    * **Implementation:** Always validate and sanitize any user input related to file uploads, including filenames, metadata, and any associated data. When displaying filenames or other file-related information, ensure proper output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

* **2.3.10. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Implementation:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities in your file upload handling.

### 3. Conclusion

Malicious file uploads represent a significant attack surface for any web application, including those built with PocketBase.  By understanding the specific vulnerabilities and implementing the detailed mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks.  A layered approach, combining multiple security measures, is crucial for robust protection.  Regular security audits and updates are essential to maintain a strong security posture.  The use of PocketBase hooks is *paramount* for implementing many of these mitigations effectively.  Remember that security is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix.
