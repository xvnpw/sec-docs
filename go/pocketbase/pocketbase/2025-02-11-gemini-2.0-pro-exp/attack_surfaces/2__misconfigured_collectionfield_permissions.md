### 4.1. PocketBase API Rule System Overview

PocketBase's security model hinges on its API rule system.  Each collection (analogous to a database table) has associated API rules that govern:

*   **List/View:**  Who can read records (either all records or specific records).
*   **Create:**  Who can add new records.
*   **Update:**  Who can modify existing records.
*   **Delete:**  Who can remove records.

These rules are expressed using a simple, yet powerful, syntax that allows for:

*   **User-Based Access Control:**  Checking the `@request.auth.id` (authenticated user ID) or `@request.auth.collectionId` (authenticated user's collection ID) to restrict access based on user identity or role.
*   **Data-Based Access Control:**  Inspecting the data being accessed or modified (`@request.data.*`) to make access decisions based on field values.  This is where many vulnerabilities arise.
*   **Contextual Access Control:** Using `@request.method` to differentiate between GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests.
*   **Boolean Logic:**  Combining conditions using `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT).
*   **Comparison Operators:**  Using `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `~` (contains), `!~` (does not contain).

### 4.2. Common Misconfiguration Patterns

Several common patterns lead to vulnerabilities:

1.  **Overly Permissive Rules:**  Using overly broad rules like `@request.auth.id != ""` (any authenticated user can access) when more specific rules are needed.  This is a violation of the principle of least privilege.

2.  **Incorrect `@request.data` Validation:**  Failing to properly validate data within API rules, leading to injection vulnerabilities.  Examples:
    *   **Missing Validation:**  `@request.data.userId = @request.auth.id` without checking if `userId` is a valid UUID or conforms to expected constraints.
    *   **Insufficient Validation:**  Using a simple string comparison when a more robust check (e.g., regular expression) is required.
    *   **Type Confusion:**  Assuming a field is a string when it could be an array or object, leading to unexpected behavior.
    *   **Bypassing Validation with crafted JSON:** If the field is JSON type, attacker can craft malicious JSON payload to bypass validation.

3.  **Logical Errors:**  Incorrectly using boolean operators or comparison operators, leading to unintended access grants.  For example, using `||` when `&&` is required, or using `>` when `>=` is intended.

4.  **Ignoring `@request.method`:**  Applying the same rule to all request methods when different rules are needed for `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.  For example, allowing anyone to `LIST` a collection but only admins to `DELETE`.

5.  **Relying on Client-Side Validation:**  Assuming that client-side validation is sufficient.  Attackers can bypass client-side checks by directly interacting with the API.

6.  **Using deprecated or unsafe functions:** PocketBase might have deprecated functions or functions that are considered unsafe.

7.  **Implicit Trust in Related Data:**  Failing to validate data from related collections.  For example, if a "comment" belongs to a "post," trusting the `postId` in the comment without verifying that the current user has access to that post.

### 4.3. Exploitation Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1: Data Leakage:** A "private_messages" collection has a `LIST` rule of `@request.auth.id != ""`.  Any authenticated user can list *all* private messages, not just their own.

*   **Scenario 2: Unauthorized Modification:** An "articles" collection has an `UPDATE` rule of `@request.data.authorId = @request.auth.id`.  However, the `authorId` field is not validated.  An attacker can send a request with a manipulated `authorId` (e.g., a different user's ID) and successfully update the article.

*   **Scenario 3: Privilege Escalation:** A "users" collection has an `UPDATE` rule that allows users to update their own profile.  However, the rule doesn't prevent users from modifying their `role` field.  An attacker can change their role to "admin," gaining full access to the system.

*   **Scenario 4: Data Injection:** A "comments" collection has a `CREATE` rule that allows any authenticated user to create comments. The rule doesn't validate the `commentText` field. An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into the comment, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Scenario 5: Denial of Service (DoS):** While not directly a permission issue, overly permissive rules combined with a lack of rate limiting can allow an attacker to flood the system with requests, causing a denial of service.

### 4.4. Advanced Mitigation Techniques

Beyond the basic mitigation strategies listed in the original document, consider these advanced techniques:

1.  **Formal Rule Specification:**  Instead of writing rules directly in the PocketBase UI, consider using a more formal specification language (e.g., a custom DSL or a subset of a policy language like Rego) to define rules.  This allows for better organization, version control, and automated analysis.

2.  **Rule-Based Testing Framework:**  Develop a testing framework specifically designed for PocketBase API rules.  This framework should:
    *   **Generate Test Cases:**  Automatically generate test cases based on the rule definitions, covering different user roles, data inputs, and request methods.
    *   **Support Mocking:**  Allow mocking of `@request` variables to simulate different scenarios.
    *   **Assert Expected Outcomes:**  Clearly define the expected outcome of each test case (e.g., access granted or denied).
    *   **Integrate with CI/CD:**  Run the tests automatically as part of the continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline.

3.  **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to analyze the API rule definitions for potential vulnerabilities.  This could involve:
    *   **Linting:**  Checking for common errors and style violations.
    *   **Data Flow Analysis:**  Tracking the flow of data through the rules to identify potential injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Constraint Solving:**  Using constraint solvers to identify inputs that could violate the rules.

4.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Use fuzzing techniques to test the API rules with a wide range of unexpected inputs.  This can help uncover vulnerabilities that are difficult to find through static analysis or manual testing.

5.  **Security Audits by Experts:**  Engage external security experts to conduct regular security audits of the PocketBase application, including a thorough review of the API rules.

6.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious activity related to API rule violations.  This could involve:
    *   **Logging:**  Logging all API requests and responses, including the evaluated API rules.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Using machine learning to detect unusual patterns of API requests.
    *   **Alerting:**  Sending alerts to administrators when suspicious activity is detected.

7. **Schema Validation:** Use PocketBase's built-in schema validation features to enforce data types and constraints on fields. This helps prevent injection attacks and ensures data integrity.

8. **Regular Expression Validation:** For string fields, use regular expressions within API rules to enforce strict input patterns. This is particularly important for fields that are used in security-sensitive contexts.

9. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from abusing overly permissive rules. This can mitigate denial-of-service attacks and brute-force attempts.

### 4.5. Tool Evaluation

*   **PocketBase Test Utils:** PocketBase provides some built-in testing utilities. These are a good starting point, but likely need to be extended for comprehensive rule testing.
*   **Custom Testing Framework:** Building a custom testing framework (as described above) provides the most flexibility and control.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:** Explore general-purpose static analysis tools that can be adapted to analyze PocketBase API rules (e.g., linters, code analysis tools).
*   **Fuzzing Tools:** Tools like `AFL++` or `libFuzzer` can be adapted to fuzz the PocketBase API.
*   **Postman/Insomnia:** These API testing tools are useful for manual testing and exploration of API rules.
*   **Burp Suite:** A powerful web security testing tool that can be used to intercept and modify API requests, helping to identify vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

Misconfigured collection and field permissions represent a significant attack surface in PocketBase applications.  By understanding the intricacies of the API rule system, common misconfiguration patterns, and advanced mitigation techniques, developers can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and privilege escalation.  A proactive approach that combines rigorous testing, static analysis, and ongoing monitoring is crucial for maintaining the security of PocketBase applications.  The principle of least privilege should be the guiding principle when designing and implementing API rules.
