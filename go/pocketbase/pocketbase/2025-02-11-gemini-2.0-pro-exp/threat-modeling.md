# Threat Model Analysis for pocketbase/pocketbase

## Threat: [Admin Account Compromise](./threats/admin_account_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the PocketBase admin dashboard. They might guess the password, use a stolen credential, exploit a vulnerability in the admin interface, or phish the administrator. Once in, they can modify application settings, data, users, collections, and potentially execute arbitrary code through custom hooks or by manipulating the database directly.
*   **Impact:** Complete application compromise. Data breach, data loss, data modification, application downtime, reputational damage, potential legal consequences.
*   **Affected Component:** Admin UI (`/_/`), Authentication logic (internal to PocketBase's user management).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a strong, unique, and randomly generated password for the admin account.
    *   Restrict access to the `/ _/` route (admin dashboard) to specific, trusted IP addresses or networks using firewall rules or a reverse proxy. *Do not expose the admin UI to the public internet without strong restrictions.*
    *   Implement a custom solution for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using a reverse proxy or by extending PocketBase (advanced).
    *   Regularly monitor PocketBase logs for suspicious login attempts or activity.
    *   Keep PocketBase updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Consider using a separate, less-privileged account for routine application management tasks.

## Threat: [User Account Impersonation (within the application)](./threats/user_account_impersonation__within_the_application_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a regular user's account within the application. They might guess the password, exploit a vulnerability in the user authentication flow, or use a stolen session token. The attacker can then access or modify data associated with that user, potentially escalating privileges if the user has elevated permissions within the application.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (limited to the compromised user's data), data modification, potential privilege escalation within the application.
*   **Affected Component:** User authentication logic (internal to PocketBase's user management), Collection rules (if improperly configured).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for application users (length, complexity, and regular changes).
    *   Implement email verification for user registration.
    *   Provide users with the ability to report suspicious activity on their accounts.
    *   *Carefully design and rigorously test collection rules (read/write/create/delete) to limit user access to only the data they should be able to access.* This is crucial.
    *   Consider implementing session timeouts and requiring re-authentication after a period of inactivity.
    *   If using OAuth providers, ensure they are configured securely and that the application only requests the necessary permissions.
    *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.

## Threat: [Collection Schema/Rule Manipulation](./threats/collection_schemarule_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, either through compromised admin access or a vulnerability in PocketBase, modifies the schema of a collection or its access rules. This could allow them to bypass security restrictions, access unauthorized data, create malicious collections, or cause a denial of service by making the database unusable.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data loss, denial of service, application instability.
*   **Affected Component:** Collection management logic (internal to PocketBase), Database schema.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   All mitigations for "Admin Account Compromise" apply here.
    *   Regularly review and audit collection schemas and rules for any unexpected changes.
    *   Implement a change management process for any modifications to the database schema or rules.
    *   Consider using version control (e.g., Git) for your PocketBase schema and rules by exporting them as JSON.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via API](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits improperly configured collection rules or API routes to access sensitive data they should not be able to see. This is often due to overly permissive read rules or exposing internal fields unintentionally.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violation, potential legal consequences.
*   **Affected Component:** Collection rules, API endpoint definitions (internal to PocketBase).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Thoroughly review and test all collection rules (read, write, create, delete) to ensure they enforce the principle of least privilege.* This is the most critical mitigation.
    *   Avoid exposing internal fields or data that are not necessary for the application's functionality. Use the `@collection` and `@request` objects in rules to carefully control access.
    *   Use appropriate data validation and sanitization to prevent unexpected data from being stored or returned.
    *   Regularly review the API documentation and ensure it accurately reflects the exposed endpoints and their access restrictions.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via API Manipulation](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_api_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to bypass collection rules by directly manipulating API requests, hoping to gain access to data or functionality they shouldn't have. This might involve modifying request parameters, headers, or the request body.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential execution of unauthorized actions.
*   **Affected Component:** API endpoint logic, Collection rule enforcement (internal to PocketBase).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Thoroughly test all collection rules to ensure they are enforced correctly, even with manipulated API requests.* This is crucial. Test edge cases and unexpected inputs.
    *   Implement server-side validation of *all* input data, regardless of the source. Do not rely solely on client-side validation.
    *   Regularly review and audit the API endpoints and their access restrictions.
    *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious API requests.

## Threat: [Exploitation of PocketBase Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_pocketbase_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in PocketBase code to gain unauthorized access, modify data, or cause a denial of service.
* **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, ranging from data breaches to complete system compromise.
* **Affected Component:** Any part of PocketBase code, depending on the specific vulnerability.
* **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical), depending on the vulnerability.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep PocketBase updated to the latest version. Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly.
    *   Monitor security advisories and mailing lists related to PocketBase to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   Contribute to PocketBase security by reporting any vulnerabilities you discover.
