Okay, let's create a design document for PocketBase based on the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

PocketBase aims to provide a simple, fast, and open-source backend solution for small to medium-sized projects, or even larger projects that can be built around its core features. It simplifies backend development by offering a single, portable executable that includes a database, authentication, file storage, and a real-time API.  The business priorities are likely:

*   Rapid Development: Enable developers to quickly build and prototype applications.
*   Ease of Use: Provide a user-friendly interface and simple deployment.
*   Cost-Effectiveness: Offer a free and open-source alternative to more complex backend solutions.
*   Portability: Allow easy deployment across various environments.
*   Extensibility: Allow extending default functionality with custom code.

The most important business risks that need to be addressed are:

*   Data Breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive user data or application data.
*   Service Downtime: Interruption of service due to bugs, misconfiguration, or attacks.
*   Data Loss: Loss of data due to hardware failure, software bugs, or malicious actions.
*   Abuse of Service: Malicious users exploiting the system for spam, phishing, or other harmful activities.
*   Lack of Scalability: Inability to handle increased load as the application grows.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of the PocketBase codebase or its dependencies.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Based on the GitHub repository and documentation, here's an assessment of the security posture:

*   security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC): The project appears to follow some secure development practices, including code reviews (visible through pull requests) and issue tracking. The extent of formal security testing is unclear from the repository alone.
*   security control: Deployment Model: PocketBase is designed for self-hosting, which places the responsibility for infrastructure security on the user. It can be deployed on various platforms, including bare metal servers, VMs, and containerized environments (Docker).
*   security control: Authentication: PocketBase provides built-in user authentication with email/password, and OAuth2 providers. (Implemented in Go code and Admin UI).
*   security control: Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented through collection API rules, allowing fine-grained control over data access. (Implemented in Go code and Admin UI).
*   security control: Input Validation: Data validation is performed on the server-side using Go structs and validation tags. (Implemented in Go code).
*   security control: Data Encryption: Data at rest encryption is not natively supported by the embedded SQLite database. Users are expected to implement full-disk encryption at the infrastructure level if required. Communication is expected to be secured via TLS (HTTPS) configured by the user.
*   security control: File Storage: PocketBase manages file storage and provides options for local storage or integration with S3-compatible services. Access control is managed through API rules. (Implemented in Go code and Admin UI).
*   security control: Real-time Subscriptions: PocketBase offers real-time updates to clients, which could be a potential vector for denial-of-service attacks if not properly managed.
*   security control: Admin UI: A web-based administrative interface is provided for managing the application. This interface must be properly secured.
*   accepted risk: Lack of built-in data-at-rest encryption within the SQLite database. Mitigation relies on user-implemented full-disk encryption.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on user-managed infrastructure security for self-hosted deployments.
*   accepted risk: Potential for denial-of-service attacks targeting the real-time subscription feature.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   Implement automated security testing (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Provide detailed security documentation and best practices for self-hosting deployments.
*   Consider adding support for data-at-rest encryption within the SQLite database.
*   Implement rate limiting and other measures to mitigate denial-of-service attacks, especially on the real-time subscription feature.
*   Provide options for audit logging of administrative actions and data access.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for strong password policies (length, complexity).
    *   Secure storage of password hashes (e.g., using bcrypt or similar).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks (e.g., account lockout).
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Secure session management (e.g., using HTTP-only cookies, secure cookies, and appropriate session timeouts).
*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control to all resources (data, files, API endpoints).
    *   Regular review and auditing of access control rules.
    *   Principle of least privilege should be enforced.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user-supplied input must be validated on the server-side.
    *   Use a whitelist approach to validation whenever possible.
    *   Sanitize output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    *   Securely manage cryptographic keys.
    *   Use TLS (HTTPS) for all communication.
    *   Consider data-at-rest encryption.

    *   Configuration Data: PocketBase configuration settings, including API keys and secrets. (High Sensitivity)

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   What is the expected scale of applications built with PocketBase (number of users, data volume)? This impacts scalability requirements.
    *   What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) for applications built with PocketBase?
    *   What level of security expertise is expected from users deploying PocketBase? This informs the need for detailed security documentation and guidance.
    *   Are there plans to implement more robust logging and auditing features?
    *   Are there plans to support data-at-rest encryption within the SQLite database?

*   Assumptions:
    *   Users deploying PocketBase are responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure (servers, networks, operating systems).
    *   Users will configure TLS (HTTPS) for secure communication with PocketBase.
    *   Users will implement appropriate backup and disaster recovery procedures.
    *   Users will regularly update PocketBase to the latest version to receive security patches.
    *   The primary threat model is external attackers attempting to gain unauthorized access to data or disrupt service.
    *   Internal threats (e.g., malicious administrators) are considered a lower risk, but should still be addressed through access controls and auditing.
    *   Developers using PocketBase will follow secure coding practices.
