# Attack Surface Analysis for pocketbase/pocketbase

## Attack Surface: [1. Admin Panel Exposure](./attack_surfaces/1__admin_panel_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the PocketBase administrative interface (`/_/`).
    *   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase provides a built-in, powerful admin UI for managing the application. This UI, if exposed, is a *direct* and primary target.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers the `/ _/` endpoint on a publicly accessible server and successfully brute-forces the admin password.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the application, data modification/deletion, configuration changes, potential server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Network Restrictions:** Restrict access to the `/ _/` endpoint to specific IP addresses or VPNs using firewall rules or a reverse proxy. *Never* expose it directly to the public internet.
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong, unique passwords and mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all admin accounts.
        *   **Account Auditing:** Regularly review admin accounts, permissions, and login activity. Remove unnecessary admin accounts.
        *   **Disable in Production (if possible):** If the admin UI is not strictly required in production, disable it entirely. Manage via the API or other secure methods.
        *   **Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect failed login attempts and suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [2. Misconfigured Collection/Field Permissions](./attack_surfaces/2__misconfigured_collectionfield_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured API rules leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
    *   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase's *core* data management relies on defining collections, fields, and associated API rules (permissions). These rules *directly* control data access within the PocketBase framework.
    *   **Example:** An API rule intended to restrict access to a "private_messages" collection is misconfigured, allowing any authenticated user to read all messages. A rule using `@request.data.someField` doesn't properly validate `someField`, allowing injection.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, potential privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users and roles for each collection and field.
        *   **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test *all* API rules, including edge cases and malicious inputs, to ensure they function as intended. Test with different user roles.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review and audit all collection and field permissions.
        *   **Simple Rules:** Avoid overly complex API rules.
        *   **Input Validation:** Use PocketBase's built-in validation rules for fields. Validate data *within* API rules, especially when using `@request.data`.

## Attack Surface: [3. Malicious File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/3__malicious_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Uploading malicious files that can compromise the server or other users.
    *   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase provides built-in file storage capabilities, *directly* handling file uploads and storage.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP file disguised as an image, which is then executed by the web server.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, malware distribution, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File Type Restrictions:** Strictly limit allowed file types (e.g., only specific image formats).
        *   **File Size Limits:** Enforce maximum file size limits.
        *   **File Scanning:** Integrate a virus scanner to scan all uploaded files.
        *   **Storage Location:** Store uploaded files outside of the web root.
        *   **Filename Sanitization:** Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal.
        *   **Content-Type Validation:** Validate the `Content-Type` header and match it to the file content. Do *not* rely solely on the file extension.

## Attack Surface: [4. PocketBase Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/4__pocketbase_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the PocketBase codebase itself.
    *   **How PocketBase Contributes:** This is *inherently* and *directly* related to PocketBase, as it concerns the security of the framework itself.
    *   **Example:** A zero-day vulnerability in PocketBase's authentication logic is discovered and exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, potentially ranging from data breaches to complete server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep PocketBase updated to the latest stable version.
        *   **Security Monitoring:** Monitor the PocketBase GitHub repository, forums, and security advisories.
        *   **Security Audits:** Consider a security audit of the PocketBase codebase (or a third-party audit) for high-sensitivity applications.
