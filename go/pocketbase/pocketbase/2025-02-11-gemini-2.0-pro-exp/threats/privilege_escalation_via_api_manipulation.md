# Deep Analysis: Privilege Escalation via API Manipulation in PocketBase

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Privilege Escalation via API Manipulation" threat within the context of a PocketBase application.  We aim to identify specific attack vectors, assess the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and recommend additional security measures to minimize the risk of successful exploitation.  This analysis will inform development practices and security testing procedures.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the PocketBase framework and its API endpoints.  It encompasses:

*   **PocketBase Collection Rules:**  How these rules are defined, enforced, and potentially bypassed.
*   **API Request Structure:**  The expected format and parameters of API requests, and how deviations might be exploited.
*   **Input Validation:**  The server-side validation mechanisms within PocketBase and how they handle malicious input.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** How PocketBase handles user authentication and authorization, and how these mechanisms interact with collection rules.
*   **Error Handling:** How PocketBase handles errors related to API requests and whether error messages leak sensitive information.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General web application vulnerabilities unrelated to PocketBase's API (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection *outside* of the PocketBase API context).  These are important but are separate threat vectors.
*   Infrastructure-level security (e.g., server hardening, network security).
*   Third-party plugins or extensions to PocketBase, unless they directly impact the core API's security.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methods:

*   **Code Review:**  Examining the PocketBase source code (available on GitHub) to understand the internal workings of collection rule enforcement, API request handling, and input validation.  This is crucial for identifying potential weaknesses.
*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Crafting malicious API requests to attempt to bypass collection rules and gain unauthorized access.  This will involve:
    *   **Parameter Tampering:** Modifying URL parameters, query parameters, and request body parameters.
    *   **Header Manipulation:**  Altering HTTP headers, such as `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, and custom headers.
    *   **Method Manipulation:**  Using unexpected HTTP methods (e.g., PUT instead of GET).
    *   **Data Type Manipulation:**  Sending unexpected data types (e.g., strings instead of numbers).
    *   **Boundary Condition Testing:**  Testing with very large, very small, or empty values.
    *   **Injection Attempts:**  Attempting to inject special characters or code snippets.
*   **Automated Security Scanning:**  Utilizing tools to automatically scan the API for common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  This will supplement manual testing.
*   **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-evaluating the existing threat model in light of the findings from code review and penetration testing.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Consulting the official PocketBase documentation to ensure best practices are followed and to identify any known security considerations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat: Privilege Escalation via API Manipulation

### 4.1. Attack Vectors

Several attack vectors can be used to attempt privilege escalation via API manipulation in PocketBase:

*   **Bypassing Collection Rules:**
    *   **Rule Logic Flaws:**  If collection rules are not comprehensively defined, an attacker might find loopholes.  For example, a rule might check for a specific user ID but not validate other parameters, allowing access to another user's data if those parameters are manipulated.
    *   **Type Juggling:**  Exploiting weaknesses in how PocketBase handles different data types.  For instance, if a rule expects a number but receives a string that can be coerced into a number, it might lead to unexpected behavior.
    *   **Missing Rules:**  If a collection rule is missing for a specific operation (e.g., update), an attacker might be able to perform that operation without authorization.
    *   **Rule Order Issues:** If the order of rules is incorrect, a less restrictive rule might be evaluated before a more restrictive one, granting unintended access.
    *   **Regular Expression Weaknesses:** If regular expressions are used in collection rules, poorly crafted regexes can be vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) or bypasses.

*   **Manipulating Request Parameters:**
    *   **ID Enumeration:**  Changing IDs in the URL or request body to access data belonging to other users or resources.
    *   **Field Manipulation:**  Adding, removing, or modifying fields in the request body to alter data in unintended ways.
    *   **Filter Bypass:**  Manipulating filter parameters to retrieve data that should be filtered out.
    *   **Pagination Manipulation:**  Altering pagination parameters (e.g., `perPage`, `page`) to retrieve more data than allowed or to access data outside the intended range.

*   **Header Manipulation:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:**  Removing or modifying the `Authorization` header to attempt to access protected resources without authentication.
    *   **Spoofing User Roles:**  If PocketBase uses custom headers to determine user roles, an attacker might try to manipulate these headers to gain elevated privileges.

*   **Method Manipulation:**
    *   **Using GET for Write Operations:**  Attempting to perform write operations (e.g., create, update, delete) using GET requests, which might bypass some security checks.
    *   **Using PUT/PATCH Incorrectly:**  Exploiting differences in how PocketBase handles PUT and PATCH requests to achieve unintended data modifications.

* **Exploiting PocketBase internals:**
    *   **Direct access to internal functions:** If attacker can somehow call internal functions, they can bypass collection rules.
    *   **Exploiting Go vulnerabilities:** If there is vulnerability in Go language or used libraries, attacker can use it.

### 4.2. Mitigation Strategy Effectiveness and Recommendations

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigations and provide additional recommendations:

*   **Thoroughly test all collection rules:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  This is the *most critical* mitigation.  Well-tested rules are the foundation of PocketBase's security model.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Unit Tests:**  Create comprehensive unit tests for each collection rule, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.  These tests should be automated and run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzz testing techniques to generate a large number of random or semi-random inputs to test the robustness of collection rules.
        *   **Negative Testing:**  Focus on testing *invalid* inputs and scenarios to ensure the rules correctly deny unauthorized access.
        *   **Test with Different User Roles:**  Test each rule with different user roles (including unauthenticated users) to ensure proper authorization.
        *   **Regular Expression Auditing:** If using regular expressions, carefully review them for potential vulnerabilities and use a regex testing tool.

*   **Implement server-side validation of *all* input data:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Essential.  Client-side validation is easily bypassed.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Data Type Validation:**  Strictly enforce data types for all input parameters.  Use PocketBase's built-in validation features.
        *   **Length Validation:**  Enforce minimum and maximum lengths for string and numeric inputs.
        *   **Format Validation:**  Use regular expressions or other validation methods to ensure data conforms to expected formats (e.g., email addresses, dates).
        *   **Range Validation:**  For numeric inputs, enforce valid ranges.
        *   **Whitelist Validation:**  Whenever possible, use whitelists to define the allowed values for a parameter, rather than blacklists.
        *   **Sanitization:**  Sanitize input data to remove or encode potentially harmful characters.  However, *validation should always be the primary defense*.
        *   **Use PocketBase's Validation API:** Leverage PocketBase's built-in validation capabilities to simplify and standardize validation logic.

*   **Regularly review and audit the API endpoints and their access restrictions:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Important for identifying new vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Automated Scanning:**  Use automated security scanning tools to regularly scan the API for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Manual Code Review:**  Periodically review the code that implements the API endpoints and collection rules.
        *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing by security professionals to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by automated tools or code reviews.
        *   **Documentation:**  Maintain up-to-date documentation of the API endpoints and their access restrictions.

*   **Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Can provide an additional layer of defense by blocking common attack patterns.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Configure WAF Rules:**  Configure the WAF with rules specifically designed to protect against API attacks, such as parameter tampering and injection attacks.
        *   **Regularly Update WAF Rules:**  Keep the WAF rules up-to-date to protect against new threats.
        *   **Monitor WAF Logs:**  Regularly monitor the WAF logs to identify and respond to potential attacks.  A WAF is not a "set and forget" solution.

### 4.3. Additional Recommendations

*   **Least Privilege Principle:**  Ensure that users and services have only the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.  Avoid granting overly broad permissions.
*   **Error Handling:**  Implement proper error handling that does not reveal sensitive information to attackers.  Avoid returning detailed error messages to the client.  Log errors securely for debugging purposes.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from brute-forcing API requests or performing denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Input Validation at Multiple Layers:** While server-side validation is paramount, consider adding validation at multiple layers (e.g., client-side, API gateway) for defense-in-depth. Client-side validation can improve the user experience by providing immediate feedback, even though it's not a security control on its own.
*   **Security Headers:**  Use appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`) to mitigate other web application vulnerabilities.
*   **Stay Updated:**  Regularly update PocketBase to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activity. PocketBase provides logging capabilities; ensure these are configured and monitored.
*   **Security Training:** Provide security training to developers to raise awareness of common API security vulnerabilities and best practices.
