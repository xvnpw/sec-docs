Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Collection Schema/Rule Manipulation" threat for a PocketBase application.

## Deep Analysis: Collection Schema/Rule Manipulation in PocketBase

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**  To thoroughly understand the "Collection Schema/Rule Manipulation" threat, identify potential attack vectors, assess the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and propose additional security measures to minimize the risk.

**Scope:**

*   **PocketBase Core:**  We'll examine the internal mechanisms of PocketBase related to collection and rule management, focusing on how these are stored, accessed, and modified.
*   **API Endpoints:**  We'll analyze the API endpoints used for schema and rule manipulation, looking for potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:**  We'll assess how PocketBase's authentication and authorization mechanisms protect against unauthorized schema/rule changes.
*   **Data Storage:**  We'll consider how the schema and rules are stored (e.g., in the SQLite database) and the implications for security.
*   **Admin Interface:** We'll analyze how the admin interface handles schema and rule changes, looking for potential vulnerabilities.
* **Hooks and Events:** We will analyze how hooks and events can be used to prevent or detect schema/rule manipulation.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Code Review:**  We'll examine relevant sections of the PocketBase source code (Go) to understand the implementation details.  This includes looking at the `core`, `models`, and `daos` packages, particularly files related to collection and record management.
2.  **API Endpoint Analysis:**  We'll use tools like `curl`, Postman, or a browser's developer tools to interact with the PocketBase API, testing different scenarios for schema/rule manipulation.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We'll search for known vulnerabilities or exploits related to PocketBase schema/rule manipulation (though PocketBase is relatively new, so this may be limited).
4.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  We'll use the information gathered to refine the initial threat model, adding more specific details about attack vectors and potential impacts.
5.  **Mitigation Evaluation:**  We'll assess the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations and suggest improvements or additions.
6.  **Documentation:**  We'll document our findings, including potential vulnerabilities, attack scenarios, and recommended security measures.

### 2. Threat Analysis

**2.1 Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Admin Account:**  This is the most direct attack vector.  If an attacker gains access to an administrator account (through phishing, password cracking, session hijacking, etc.), they can directly modify collection schemas and rules via the admin UI or API.
*   **API Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:**  If the API endpoints responsible for schema/rule modification don't properly verify the user's permissions, an attacker might be able to make changes even without full admin access.  This could involve exploiting flaws in the role-based access control (RBAC) implementation.
    *   **Injection Attacks:**  If user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used to construct database queries or modify schema definitions, an attacker might be able to inject malicious code (e.g., SQL injection, although PocketBase uses an ORM, making this less likely, but still possible in custom queries or rule definitions).
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Admin UI:** If the admin UI is vulnerable to XSS, an attacker could inject JavaScript code that, when executed by an administrator, makes unauthorized API calls to modify the schema or rules.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** If the admin UI lacks CSRF protection, an attacker could trick an authenticated administrator into making unintended schema/rule changes by clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised website.
*   **Exploiting PocketBase Hooks/Events:** If custom hooks or event handlers are poorly written, they might introduce vulnerabilities that allow for unauthorized schema/rule manipulation. For example, a hook that modifies the schema based on user input without proper validation could be exploited.
*   **Direct Database Access:** If an attacker gains direct access to the underlying SQLite database file (e.g., through a server compromise or misconfigured file permissions), they could potentially modify the schema directly, bypassing PocketBase's security mechanisms.
* **Vulnerabilities in PocketBase dependencies:** If any of the dependencies used by PocketBase have vulnerabilities, they could be exploited to gain access to the system and modify the schema or rules.

**2.2 Impact Breakdown:**

*   **Data Breach:**  An attacker could modify access rules to allow unauthorized access to sensitive data.  They could also change the schema to expose previously hidden fields.
*   **Data Modification:**  An attacker could alter data types, constraints, or validation rules, leading to data corruption or the insertion of malicious data.
*   **Data Loss:**  An attacker could delete collections or fields, resulting in permanent data loss.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker could make the database unusable by:
    *   Creating excessively large or complex collections.
    *   Adding invalid constraints or rules that cause errors.
    *   Deleting essential collections.
    *   Changing the schema in a way that breaks application logic.
*   **Application Instability:**  Schema changes could cause the application to crash or behave unpredictably, especially if the changes are incompatible with the application code.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  A successful attack could damage the reputation of the application and the organization responsible for it.

**2.3 Affected Component Details:**

*   **Collection Management Logic (Internal to PocketBase):** This includes the code responsible for:
    *   Creating, updating, and deleting collections.
    *   Defining and enforcing data types, constraints, and validation rules.
    *   Managing access rules (read, create, update, delete permissions).
    *   Handling API requests related to schema/rule management.
*   **Database Schema:**  The structure of the SQLite database, including the tables, columns, data types, and constraints that define the collections.  This is stored within the `pb_data` directory (by default).

### 3. Mitigation Strategies Evaluation and Enhancements

Let's evaluate the provided mitigations and propose enhancements:

*   **"All mitigations for 'Admin Account Compromise' apply here."**  This is crucial and includes:
    *   **Strong Passwords & Password Policies:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all admin accounts.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA for all admin accounts.  PocketBase supports this.
    *   **Regular Password Rotation:**  Require administrators to change their passwords periodically.
    *   **Session Management:**  Use short session timeouts and secure session cookies (HTTPOnly, Secure flags).
    *   **Account Lockout:**  Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that admin accounts only have the necessary permissions.  Avoid granting unnecessary privileges.  PocketBase's role-based access control can be used for this.
    *   **Monitor Admin Activity:** Log all actions performed by administrators, including login attempts, schema changes, and rule modifications.  PocketBase provides logging capabilities.

*   **"Regularly review and audit collection schemas and rules for any unexpected changes."**  This is essential for detecting unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Enhancement:**  Implement automated schema/rule monitoring.  This could involve:
        *   Creating a script that periodically exports the schema and rules (using `pocketbase export`) and compares them to a known-good baseline.  Any differences should trigger an alert.
        *   Using a file integrity monitoring (FIM) tool to monitor the `pb_data` directory for changes.
        *   Leveraging PocketBase's event hooks (e.g., `OnCollectionBeforeUpdateRequest`, `OnCollectionAfterUpdateRequest`) to log or prevent specific schema changes.

*   **"Implement a change management process for any modifications to the database schema or rules."**  This is good practice for any database.
    *   **Enhancement:**  Formalize the process with:
        *   A documented procedure for requesting, approving, and implementing schema/rule changes.
        *   A testing environment (staging) where changes can be tested before being deployed to production.
        *   Rollback procedures in case of errors.

*   **"Consider using version control (e.g., Git) for your PocketBase schema and rules by exporting them as JSON."**  This is highly recommended.
    *   **Enhancement:**  Automate the export and commit process.  Create a script that runs periodically (e.g., via a cron job) to export the schema and rules, commit them to a Git repository, and push the changes to a remote repository.

**Additional Mitigations:**

*   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user-supplied input, especially in custom hooks or API endpoints that interact with the schema or rules.  This helps prevent injection attacks.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on API endpoints related to schema/rule modification to prevent brute-force attacks or denial-of-service attempts.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Use a WAF to protect against common web attacks, such as XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the PocketBase application and its infrastructure.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by other security measures.
*   **Keep PocketBase Updated:**  Regularly update PocketBase to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
*   **Secure Server Configuration:**  Ensure that the server hosting PocketBase is properly secured, with appropriate firewall rules, access controls, and security updates.
*   **Database Encryption:** Consider encrypting the SQLite database file at rest to protect against unauthorized access if the server is compromised.
* **Restrict Access to `pb_data`:** Ensure that the `pb_data` directory has the most restrictive permissions possible, allowing access only to the user running the PocketBase process.
* **Use of Prepared Statements:** Although PocketBase uses an ORM, if you are writing any custom SQL queries, ensure you are using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
* **Audit Trail for Hooks:** If using custom hooks, ensure they have robust logging to track any changes they make, and audit these logs regularly.

### 4. Conclusion

The "Collection Schema/Rule Manipulation" threat is a serious one for PocketBase applications.  By combining strong authentication and authorization, rigorous change management, automated monitoring, and proactive security measures, the risk can be significantly reduced.  Regular security audits and penetration testing are essential to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.  The key is to adopt a defense-in-depth approach, layering multiple security controls to protect against this threat.
