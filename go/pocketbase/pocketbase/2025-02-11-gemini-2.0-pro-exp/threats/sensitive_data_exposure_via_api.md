Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Sensitive Data Exposure via API" threat for a PocketBase application.

## Deep Analysis: Sensitive Data Exposure via API (PocketBase)

### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Sensitive Data Exposure via API" threat within the context of a PocketBase application.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and practical exploitation scenarios.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations beyond the initial mitigation strategies to significantly reduce the risk of this threat.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following aspects of a PocketBase application:

*   **Collection Rules:**  The core of PocketBase's access control mechanism.  We'll examine how misconfigurations, logical flaws, and bypass techniques can lead to data exposure.
*   **API Endpoint Definitions:**  How PocketBase's internal routing and handling of API requests can be exploited if not properly secured.  This includes both default and custom routes.
*   **Data Modeling:** How the structure of collections and the types of data stored can influence the impact of a successful exploit.
*   **User Authentication and Authorization:** How the interaction between user roles, authentication mechanisms, and collection rules affects data exposure risks.
* **PocketBase version:** We will consider the latest stable version of PocketBase, but also acknowledge that vulnerabilities may exist in older versions. We will check the changelog and known CVEs.

This analysis *excludes* external factors like server misconfigurations (e.g., exposed ports, weak server passwords), network-level attacks (e.g., MITM), and client-side vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS in the frontend consuming the API).  These are important, but outside the scope of this specific threat analysis.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine hypothetical (and, if available, real-world) PocketBase collection rule configurations and API route definitions to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This includes looking for common patterns of misconfiguration.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):** We will simulate attacker actions by crafting API requests to a test PocketBase instance.  This will involve attempting to bypass collection rules, access unauthorized data, and exploit any identified vulnerabilities.
*   **Threat Modeling (STRIDE/DREAD):**  We will use the STRIDE threat model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to systematically identify potential attack vectors.  We'll also use DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability) to assess the risk.
*   **Vulnerability Research:** We will consult the PocketBase documentation, GitHub issues, and security advisories to identify any known vulnerabilities or common attack patterns related to data exposure.
*   **Best Practices Review:** We will compare the identified vulnerabilities and attack vectors against established security best practices for API design and access control.

### 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat

#### 4.1. Attack Vectors and Exploitation Scenarios

Let's break down specific ways an attacker might exploit this threat:

*   **Overly Permissive `@collection.read` Rules:**

    *   **Scenario 1:  `@collection.read = true` (Public Read Access):**  This is the most obvious vulnerability.  If a collection containing sensitive data (e.g., user profiles, financial records) has a `read` rule set to `true`, *anyone*, even unauthenticated users, can access all records in that collection.
    *   **Scenario 2:  Insufficient Field-Level Restrictions:**  Even with authentication, a rule like `@collection.read = "@request.auth.id != ''"` allows any authenticated user to read *all fields* of all records.  If a collection contains fields like `passwordHash`, `internalNotes`, or `adminOnlyData`, these are exposed.
    *   **Scenario 3:  Logical Errors in Rule Conditions:**  Complex rules with multiple conditions (e.g., `@collection.read = "@request.auth.role = 'admin' || (@request.auth.id = ownerId && status = 'draft')`) are prone to errors.  An attacker might find a combination of parameters that satisfies the rule unintentionally, granting access.
    *   **Scenario 4:  Misuse of `@request.query`:** An attacker could manipulate query parameters (e.g., filters, sorts) to bypass intended restrictions. For example, if a rule restricts access based on a `status` field, the attacker might try to override that filter using the API.
    * **Scenario 5:  Ignoring `@request.data` in `create` and `update` rules:** While primarily focused on `read`, failing to validate `@request.data` during `create` or `update` can lead to indirect data exposure.  An attacker might inject malicious data that is later exposed through a vulnerable `read` rule.

*   **Exploiting Default API Behavior:**

    *   **Scenario 6:  Listing All Records:**  By default, PocketBase allows listing all records in a collection if no specific record ID is provided.  If the `read` rule is too permissive, this allows bulk data exfiltration.
    *   **Scenario 7:  Field Exposure via API Response:**  Even if a field is not directly accessible via a `read` rule, it might be inadvertently included in the API response for other operations (e.g., `create`, `update`).  An attacker could create a record, observe the response, and discover sensitive fields.
    *   **Scenario 8:  Error Message Leakage:**  PocketBase error messages, if not carefully handled, might reveal information about the database structure, collection rules, or even data values.  An attacker could intentionally trigger errors to gain insights.

*   **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization:**

    *   **Scenario 9:  Token Manipulation:**  If the application uses JWTs or other tokens for authentication, an attacker might attempt to forge, modify, or steal tokens to impersonate other users and gain access to their data. This is more of an authentication issue, but directly impacts data exposure.
    *   **Scenario 10:  Session Fixation/Hijacking:**  If session management is weak, an attacker might be able to hijack a legitimate user's session and access their data through the API.

#### 4.2.  Specific Vulnerabilities (Hypothetical Examples)

Let's illustrate with some concrete (hypothetical) examples of vulnerable collection rules:

**Vulnerable Rule 1 (Publicly Readable User Profiles):**

```javascript
pb.collection('users').read = true;
```

**Impact:**  Anyone can access all user data, including potentially sensitive fields like email addresses, phone numbers, or even passwords (if stored insecurely).

**Vulnerable Rule 2 (Leaky Internal Notes):**

```javascript
pb.collection('projects').read = "@request.auth.id != ''";
```

**Impact:**  Any authenticated user can read all project data, including an `internalNotes` field intended only for administrators.

**Vulnerable Rule 3 (Logic Flaw in Access Control):**

```javascript
pb.collection('documents').read = "@request.auth.role = 'editor' || document.authorId = @request.auth.id";
```
Let's assume there is also field `isPublic`.
**Impact:** The intention is to allow editors to read all documents and authors to read their own.  However, if `document.authorId` is not properly validated or can be manipulated during creation, an attacker could set it to their own ID and gain access to documents they shouldn't see. Or attacker can create document without `authorId` and bypass this rule.

**Vulnerable Rule 4 (Query Parameter Manipulation):**

```javascript
pb.collection('reports').read = "@request.auth.id != '' && report.status = 'published'";
```

**Impact:**  The intention is to only allow access to published reports.  However, an attacker might try to override the `status` filter using a query parameter: `/api/collections/reports/records?filter=status='draft'`.  If PocketBase doesn't properly sanitize or prioritize the rule's condition over the query parameter, this could expose draft reports.

#### 4.3.  Risk Assessment (DREAD)

Let's apply the DREAD model to assess the risk:

*   **Damage Potential (High):**  Exposure of sensitive data can lead to significant financial, reputational, and legal damage.
*   **Reproducibility (High):**  Once a vulnerability is identified, it can be consistently exploited until it is fixed.
*   **Exploitability (Medium to High):**  Depending on the specific vulnerability, exploitation might require some technical skill (e.g., crafting API requests), but many vulnerabilities are relatively easy to exploit.
*   **Affected Users (High):**  A successful exploit could affect all users whose data is stored in the vulnerable collection.
*   **Discoverability (Medium to High):**  Overly permissive rules are relatively easy to discover through basic API testing.  More subtle logic flaws might require more effort to find.

**Overall Risk: High**

#### 4.4.  Advanced Mitigation Strategies

Beyond the initial mitigation strategies, we need to implement more robust defenses:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege (Strict Enforcement):**
    *   **Field-Level Access Control:**  Explicitly define which fields are readable, writable, and creatable for each user role and context.  Use the `@collection` and `@request` objects extensively to achieve this.  *Never* assume that a field is safe to expose just because it's not directly used in the frontend.
    *   **Context-Aware Rules:**  Consider the context of the request (e.g., creating, updating, deleting) when defining rules.  A field that is safe to read might not be safe to update.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Implement a process for regularly reviewing and auditing collection rules.  This should involve both automated tools and manual inspection.

*   **Data Minimization:**
    *   **Don't Store Unnecessary Data:**  Avoid storing sensitive data that is not absolutely required for the application's functionality.
    *   **Data Masking/Tokenization:**  For sensitive data that must be stored, consider using techniques like masking (e.g., displaying only the last four digits of a credit card number) or tokenization (replacing sensitive data with a non-sensitive equivalent).

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strict Validation:**  Validate all data received from the client (via `@request.data`) against a strict schema.  Reject any data that does not conform to the expected format.
    *   **Sanitization:**  Sanitize data to remove any potentially harmful characters or code.  This is particularly important for data that might be displayed in the frontend (to prevent XSS) or used in database queries (to prevent SQL injection).

*   **API Design Best Practices:**
    *   **Explicit Endpoints:**  Design API endpoints with clear and specific purposes.  Avoid generic endpoints that expose large amounts of data.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from brute-forcing API requests or performing denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Auditing and Logging:**  Log all API requests, including successful and failed attempts.  This can help detect and investigate potential attacks.
    * **Use of expand:** Use `expand` option in API calls to get related data, instead of making multiple requests. This can help to reduce the number of requests and improve performance, but also can help to reduce attack surface.

*   **Security Testing:**
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Regularly conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by automated tools or manual review.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzz testing to send random or unexpected data to the API and identify potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

* **PocketBase Specific:**
    * **Hooks:** Use PocketBase hooks (e.g., `OnRecordBeforeCreateRequest`, `OnRecordBeforeUpdateRequest`) to implement custom validation and security logic. This allows for more fine-grained control than collection rules alone.
    * **Admin UI Restrictions:** Carefully control access to the PocketBase Admin UI.  Only authorized administrators should have access.
    * **Stay Updated:** Regularly update PocketBase to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.
    * **Review PocketBase Documentation:** Thoroughly understand the PocketBase documentation, especially the sections on collection rules, API requests, and security.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Sensitive Data Exposure via API" threat in PocketBase is a serious concern due to the framework's reliance on collection rules for access control.  Overly permissive rules, logical flaws, and failure to properly validate input can all lead to data breaches.  By implementing a combination of strict access control, data minimization, robust input validation, and regular security testing, the risk of this threat can be significantly reduced.  The key is to adopt a "defense-in-depth" approach, layering multiple security controls to protect sensitive data. Continuous monitoring and proactive security reviews are crucial for maintaining a secure PocketBase application.
