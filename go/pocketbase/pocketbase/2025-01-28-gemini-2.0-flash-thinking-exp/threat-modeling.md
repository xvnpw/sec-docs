# Threat Model Analysis for pocketbase/pocketbase

## Threat: [Exploitation of PocketBase Code Vulnerability](./threats/exploitation_of_pocketbase_code_vulnerability.md)

Description: An attacker exploits a critical vulnerability within the PocketBase application code itself. This could be a bug in core logic, API handling, or authentication processes. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting PocketBase, bypass authentication, or directly access and manipulate data without authorization. Exploitation methods could include crafting malicious API requests or leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
Impact: **Critical**. Complete compromise of the PocketBase server. This includes full data breach, unauthorized data manipulation, server takeover, denial of service, and potential for further lateral movement within the network.
Affected PocketBase Component: Core PocketBase application, potentially any module depending on the vulnerability location.
Risk Severity: **Critical**.
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Immediately update PocketBase: Apply security updates and patches as soon as they are released by the PocketBase developers.
    *   Monitor PocketBase security advisories: Stay informed about known vulnerabilities by subscribing to PocketBase security announcements and release notes.
    *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) (advanced):  Consider using a WAF to detect and block common exploit attempts targeting known vulnerabilities, providing an additional layer of defense.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configuration leading to Admin UI Compromise](./threats/insecure_default_configuration_leading_to_admin_ui_compromise.md)

Description: An attacker exploits insecure default settings in PocketBase, specifically targeting the Admin UI. If default admin credentials are not changed or if access to the Admin UI is not properly restricted, attackers can gain unauthorized administrative access. This allows them to fully control the PocketBase instance, including data manipulation, user management, and potentially server configuration depending on deployment.
Impact: **Critical**. Full administrative compromise of the PocketBase application. Attackers can access and modify all data, create or delete users, change application settings, and potentially gain further access to the underlying server.
Affected PocketBase Component: Admin UI, Configuration settings, Authentication module.
Risk Severity: **Critical**.
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Immediately change default admin credentials: Set strong, unique passwords for all admin accounts upon initial setup.
    *   Restrict Admin UI access: Limit access to the Admin UI by IP address or implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) and only allow access from trusted networks or users.
    *   Disable Admin UI in production (if feasible): If the Admin UI is not actively required in production, consider disabling it entirely to eliminate this attack vector.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Record Rules resulting in Mass Data Breach](./threats/misconfigured_record_rules_resulting_in_mass_data_breach.md)

Description:  An attacker exploits overly permissive or flawed record rules in PocketBase. If record rules are not carefully designed and tested, they can inadvertently grant unauthorized access to large amounts of data. Attackers can leverage these misconfigurations to bypass intended access controls and retrieve or modify sensitive data belonging to other users or the entire application dataset.
Impact: **High**. Potential for mass data breach and unauthorized data manipulation. The extent of the impact depends on the sensitivity of the data exposed and the scope of the rule misconfiguration.
Affected PocketBase Component: Record Rules engine, Data API, Authorization module.
Risk Severity: **High**.
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Rigorous design and testing of record rules: Implement record rules based on the principle of least privilege and thoroughly test them with various user roles and scenarios.
    *   Granular and specific rules: Avoid overly broad rules and use specific conditions and filters to precisely control data access.
    *   Automated testing of record rules: Implement unit and integration tests to automatically verify the intended behavior of record rules and prevent regressions.
    *   Regular security audits of record rules: Periodically review and audit record rules to ensure they remain effective and aligned with security requirements as the application evolves.

## Threat: [Data Breach via Insecure Database Access](./threats/data_breach_via_insecure_database_access.md)

Description: An attacker gains direct, unauthorized access to the underlying database used by PocketBase. This is especially critical if using the default SQLite database and file permissions are not properly secured. Attackers could potentially read the database file directly from the file system if permissions are too open, or exploit vulnerabilities in database server configurations if using external databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
Impact: **Critical**. Complete data breach. Attackers gain access to all data stored within the PocketBase database, including user credentials, application data, and potentially sensitive configuration information.
Affected PocketBase Component: Database access layer, Database storage (SQLite file or external database server).
Risk Severity: **Critical**.
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Restrict file system permissions for SQLite database: Ensure the SQLite database file is only readable and writable by the PocketBase process user and not accessible to other users or processes on the server.
    *   Secure external database server access: If using PostgreSQL or MySQL, implement strong authentication, network access controls (firewall rules), and use secure connection protocols (TLS/SSL).
    *   Regular database backups and secure storage: Implement regular database backups and store backups in a secure, off-site location to mitigate data loss and aid in recovery after a breach.
    *   Consider database encryption at rest: For highly sensitive data, consider implementing database encryption at rest to protect data even if the database file is compromised.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Go Dependencies leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_go_dependencies_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

Description: A critical vulnerability is discovered in a third-party Go dependency used by PocketBase. If this vulnerability allows for remote code execution, attackers could exploit it to execute arbitrary code on the server running PocketBase. This could lead to complete server takeover, data breaches, and denial of service.
Impact: **Critical**. Remote code execution on the PocketBase server, leading to potential server takeover, data breaches, and denial of service.
Affected PocketBase Component: Third-party Go dependencies, indirectly affecting the entire PocketBase application.
Risk Severity: **Critical**.
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Immediately update PocketBase: Updating PocketBase is crucial as it will typically include updates to vulnerable dependencies. Apply updates as soon as they are released.
    *   Monitor PocketBase release notes and security advisories: Stay informed about dependency updates and security patches included in PocketBase releases.
    *   Consider dependency scanning (advanced): For highly sensitive deployments, explore using dependency scanning tools to proactively identify known vulnerabilities in PocketBase's dependencies, although this is primarily the responsibility of PocketBase developers.
