# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, PocketBase, aims to provide a streamlined, all-in-one backend solution for developers. The primary business priority is to offer a simple and efficient way to build applications by abstracting away the complexities of setting up and managing backend infrastructure. The goal is to empower developers to rapidly prototype and deploy applications with features like real-time database, authentication, file storage, and an admin dashboard, all within a single, self-hosted executable.

The most important business risks associated with this project are:

- Data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive application data and user information.
- Service unavailability due to security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, impacting application uptime and user experience.
- Data integrity issues arising from software bugs or malicious attacks, leading to data corruption or loss.
- Reputational damage and loss of user trust in case of security incidents, especially if sensitive data is compromised.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: HTTPS enforcement for communication between clients and the PocketBase server. (Implemented by default when using TLS certificates).
- security control: User authentication to access the admin dashboard and potentially application APIs. (Implemented within PocketBase using username/password and OAuth2).
- security control: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions within the admin dashboard and application data. (Implemented within PocketBase for admin and record access).
- security control: Input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). (Likely implemented within the PocketBase codebase, needs further investigation).
- security control: Protection against common web attacks like CSRF. (Likely implemented within the PocketBase framework, needs further investigation).

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Risks associated with self-hosting, where users are responsible for securing their own server infrastructure and network.
- accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the Go programming language ecosystem and its dependencies.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by PocketBase.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Implement automated vulnerability scanning of the PocketBase codebase and its dependencies during development and CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits to identify and address potential security weaknesses.
- security control: Enforce secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle, including code reviews and security training for developers.
- security control: Implement dependency management and security updates for all third-party libraries used by PocketBase.
- security control: Consider implementing rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.
- security control: Recommend or provide options for users to integrate a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for enhanced protection, especially in production deployments.

Security requirements:

- Authentication:
    - security requirement: Secure authentication mechanisms for admin users and application users.
    - security requirement: Support for strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin users.
    - security requirement: Secure session management to prevent session hijacking.
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: Fine-grained authorization controls to manage access to data and functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
    - security requirement: Principle of least privilege should be applied to all users and roles.
    - security requirement: Secure API authorization to protect application endpoints from unauthorized access.
- Input Validation:
    - security requirement: Comprehensive input validation on all user-provided data to prevent injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, command injection, etc.).
    - security requirement: Output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    - security requirement: Protection against file upload vulnerabilities, including validation of file types and sizes.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: Encryption of sensitive data at rest, such as user credentials and application data. (Needs confirmation if implemented and details of encryption methods).
    - security requirement: Secure handling of cryptographic keys and secrets.
    - security requirement: Use of strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    - security requirement: Secure communication channels using TLS/SSL for all network traffic.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:

- Data storage and management: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of application data stored in PocketBase.
- User authentication and authorization: Protecting user accounts and ensuring only authorized users can access specific functionalities and data.
- API access: Securing the API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Admin dashboard access: Protecting the admin dashboard to prevent unauthorized configuration changes and data manipulation.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

- User credentials (passwords, API keys, OAuth tokens): Highly sensitive, requiring strong encryption and access control.
- Application data (records in the database): Sensitivity depends on the application using PocketBase. Could range from low sensitivity (public data) to high sensitivity (personal identifiable information, financial data, health records).
- Files stored in file storage: Sensitivity depends on the type of files being stored. Could include sensitive documents, images, or other confidential information.
- Configuration data: Potentially sensitive, as it might contain database connection strings, API keys, or other secrets.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What specific encryption methods are used for data at rest, if any?
- What level of input validation is implemented across different parts of the application (API, admin UI)?
- Are there any regular security audits or penetration testing performed on PocketBase?
- What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by the community or identified internally?
- Is there support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin users?
- Are there options for integrating with external authentication providers beyond username/password and OAuth2?
- What are the recommendations for securing a production deployment of PocketBase, beyond basic HTTPS?

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: It is assumed that users of PocketBase prioritize ease of use and rapid development, but still require a reasonable level of security for their applications and data.
- SECURITY POSTURE: It is assumed that basic security controls like HTTPS, authentication, and authorization are implemented in PocketBase. However, the depth and robustness of these controls need further investigation. It is also assumed that users are responsible for securing their own deployment environments.
- DESIGN: It is assumed that PocketBase uses SQLite as the default database and local filesystem for file storage. The architecture is assumed to be monolithic, with all components packaged within a single executable. The build process is assumed to be automated using CI/CD practices.
