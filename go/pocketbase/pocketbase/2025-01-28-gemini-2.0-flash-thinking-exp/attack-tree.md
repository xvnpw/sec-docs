## Attack Tree Path: [1. Default Credentials (PB-AUTH-01 & PB-ADMIN-01) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__default_credentials__pb-auth-01_&_pb-admin-01___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** An attacker attempts to log in using the default administrator credentials provided by PocketBase during initial setup.
- **Why High Risk:** This is a trivially easy attack to execute with minimal effort and skill. If default credentials are not changed, it grants immediate and complete administrative access to the application, leading to full compromise. The impact is extremely high (full confidentiality, integrity, and availability compromise) and the likelihood is medium as default credentials are a well-known vulnerability, but often overlooked.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. API Abuse/Rate Limiting Issues - Resource Exhaustion (PB-API-02-01 & PB-DOS-01) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH - DoS]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__api_abuserate_limiting_issues_-_resource_exhaustion__pb-api-02-01_&_pb-dos-01___critical_node__hi_dc29980e.md)

- **Attack Vector:** An attacker floods the application's API endpoints with a large number of requests, or crafts requests that are computationally expensive for the server to process.
- **Why High Risk:**  This attack targets the availability of the application. If rate limiting and resource management are not properly implemented, an attacker can easily overwhelm the server, leading to service disruption or complete denial of service for legitimate users. The likelihood is medium-high as APIs are common targets for abuse, and the impact is medium-high (service unavailability).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Admin UI (PB-ADMIN-02-01) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__in_admin_ui__pb-admin-02-01___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into data fields within the PocketBase Admin UI that are later stored and rendered to other admin users without proper sanitization.
- **Why High Risk:** XSS in the Admin UI is particularly dangerous because it targets administrators who have high privileges. Successful stored XSS can lead to admin session hijacking, account takeover, and the ability to perform administrative actions on behalf of the compromised admin, potentially leading to full system compromise. The impact is high and the likelihood is medium as Admin UIs often handle complex inputs and might be vulnerable if input sanitization is not rigorous.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. File Upload Vulnerabilities (PB-SERVER-03-02) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__file_upload_vulnerabilities__pb-server-03-02___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** An attacker uploads malicious files to the server through file upload functionalities provided by the application. This could involve uploading executable files, files that exploit vulnerabilities in file processing libraries, or files that overwrite critical system files.
- **Why High Risk:** File upload vulnerabilities can have severe consequences, including Remote Code Execution (RCE) if executable files are uploaded and executed on the server. It can also lead to data breaches if attackers upload files to gain access to sensitive data or overwrite legitimate files with malicious content. The impact is medium-high (potentially RCE, data breach) and the likelihood is medium as file uploads are common features and often misconfigured.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Direct Access to SQLite Database File (PB-DATA-01) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__direct_access_to_sqlite_database_file__pb-data-01___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains direct access to the SQLite database file, either by guessing its location if it's publicly accessible via the web server, or through other vulnerabilities like directory traversal.
- **Why High Risk:** If the SQLite database file is directly accessible, an attacker can download it and gain offline access to all application data, including user credentials, sensitive information, and application logic stored in the database. This leads to a complete data breach and potentially full compromise. The impact is high (full data breach) and the likelihood is low-medium depending on deployment practices, but the consequence is severe if it occurs.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exposed Admin UI (PB-CONFIG-02) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH - Admin UI]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__exposed_admin_ui__pb-config-02___critical_node__high-risk_path_-_admin_ui_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** The PocketBase Admin UI is accessible from the public internet without proper access restrictions.
- **Why High Risk:** Exposing the Admin UI to the public internet significantly increases the attack surface of the application. It makes all Admin UI related vulnerabilities (like default credentials, XSS, CSRF, authentication bypass) much easier to exploit as attackers can directly access and target the administrative interface. While not a vulnerability itself, it amplifies the risk of other Admin UI vulnerabilities. The impact is medium-high (increased attack surface, easier exploitation of admin functionalities) and the likelihood is medium as it's a common deployment mistake.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Resource Exhaustion (PB-DOS-01) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH - Availability]: (Covered under API Abuse/Rate Limiting Issues - Resource Exhaustion PB-API-02-01)](./attack_tree_paths/7__resource_exhaustion__pb-dos-01___critical_node__high-risk_path_-_availability___covered_under_api_75285f6a.md)

This is essentially the same attack vector as PB-API-02-01, but viewed from a broader Denial of Service perspective. It highlights the risk of resource exhaustion leading to service unavailability.
