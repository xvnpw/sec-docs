# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pocketbase/pocketbase

## Mitigation Strategy: [Change Default Admin Password](./mitigation_strategies/change_default_admin_password.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Log in to the PocketBase Admin UI:** Access the `/_/` path of your PocketBase application in a web browser.
2.  **Use default credentials:** Log in with the default username `admin@example.com` and password `password`.
3.  **Navigate to Admin Users:** In the Admin UI sidebar, click on "Admins".
4.  **Edit the default admin user:** Locate the `admin@example.com` user and click the "Edit" button (pencil icon).
5.  **Change the password:** In the edit form, enter a strong, unique password in the "Password" and "Password Confirm" fields.
6.  **Save changes:** Click the "Save" button to update the admin user's password.
7.  **(Optional) Delete default user:** After creating a new admin user with a unique username, you can optionally delete the `admin@example.com` user by clicking the "Delete" button (trash icon) next to it in the Admin Users list. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Default Credential Exploitation (High Severity):** Attackers can use known default credentials to gain unauthorized access to the admin UI and potentially the entire application and data.

**Impact:**
*   **Default Credential Exploitation:**  Significantly reduces the risk. Changing the password eliminates the vulnerability associated with the well-known default credentials. Deleting the user further reduces the attack surface.

**Currently Implemented:** No, PocketBase starts with default credentials. This is a necessary step for initial setup but requires immediate user action.

**Missing Implementation:**  Always missing on initial PocketBase setup and needs to be the first security action taken within PocketBase.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Admin UI in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_admin_ui_in_production.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Set Environment Variable:** In your production environment's PocketBase configuration (e.g., `.env` file, system environment variables, container environment variables), set the environment variable `PB_ADMIN_UI=false`.
2.  **Restart PocketBase:** Restart the PocketBase application for the environment variable change to take effect.
3.  **Verify:** Attempt to access the `/_/` path in your production environment. It should now return a 404 Not Found error or similar, indicating the Admin UI is disabled.
4.  **Administer via API/CLI:** Perform administrative tasks in production using the PocketBase API or the command-line interface (`./pocketbase admin`).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Admin UI Access (High Severity):** Completely eliminates the risk of unauthorized access to the Admin UI via web browser in production.
*   **Admin UI Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk associated with potential vulnerabilities in the Admin UI code itself, as it is no longer exposed in production.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Admin UI Access:**  Completely eliminates the risk.
*   **Admin UI Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk by removing the attack surface.

**Currently Implemented:** No, by default the Admin UI is enabled.

**Missing Implementation:**  Often missing in initial deployments, especially if developers are used to always having a web UI. Should be implemented for production environments within PocketBase configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Choose Secure Database System](./mitigation_strategies/choose_secure_database_system.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Evaluate Database Needs:** Assess your application's security, scalability, and performance requirements.
2.  **Consider PostgreSQL or MySQL:** For production environments, strongly consider using PostgreSQL or MySQL instead of the default SQLite. These systems offer more robust security features, user management, and scalability.
3.  **Configure PocketBase for Alternative Database:** When initializing PocketBase, configure it to use PostgreSQL or MySQL by providing the necessary connection details (DSN) via environment variables or command-line flags. Refer to PocketBase documentation for specific configuration instructions for your chosen database.
4.  **Secure Database Server:** Independently secure your chosen database server (PostgreSQL or MySQL) by setting strong passwords, configuring access controls, and keeping the database server software updated.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQLite Database Limitations (Medium Severity):**  Mitigates potential security limitations associated with SQLite in multi-user or high-security environments compared to more robust database systems.
*   **Scalability Issues (Medium Severity):** Addresses potential scalability limitations of SQLite for applications with high traffic or large datasets.

**Impact:**
*   **SQLite Database Limitations:**  Reduces the risk by leveraging the enhanced security features of PostgreSQL or MySQL.
*   **Scalability Issues:** Improves scalability and performance for production workloads.

**Currently Implemented:** No, PocketBase defaults to SQLite. Choosing and configuring an alternative database is a user action.

**Missing Implementation:** Often missing in quick setups or development phases using the default SQLite. Production environments should strongly consider implementing this within PocketBase setup.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement API Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/implement_api_access_control.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Collection Permissions:** In the PocketBase Admin UI, navigate to "Collections" and edit each collection.
2.  **Configure Collection-Level Permissions:**  Set the "List", "View", "Create", "Update", and "Delete" permissions for each collection. Control whether anonymous users, authenticated users, or specific admin roles have access to these actions at the collection level.
3.  **Implement Record Rules:** For finer-grained control, define "Record Rules" for each collection. Record rules are expressions that determine access based on record data, user authentication status, and other context. Use these rules to enforce complex authorization logic (e.g., "only the record creator can update", "users in group 'admins' can delete").
4.  **Test API Access:** Thoroughly test your API endpoints using different user roles and authentication states to ensure that access control is enforced as intended. Use tools like `curl` or Postman to simulate API requests.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data via the API.
*   **Data Manipulation (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from creating, updating, or deleting data via the API.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of privilege escalation by ensuring that users only have access to the data and actions they are authorized for.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Significantly reduces the risk by enforcing granular access control.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Significantly reduces the risk by controlling data modification actions.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Reduces the risk by limiting user privileges to the minimum necessary.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. PocketBase provides the features (collection permissions and record rules), but developers must actively configure and implement them for each collection.

**Missing Implementation:** Often missing in initial application development or when developers rely on default permissive settings. Requires careful configuration within PocketBase Admin UI or collection schema.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure File Storage Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/secure_file_storage_access_control.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Utilize Record Rules for File Fields:** When defining collections with file upload fields, use Record Rules to control access to these files.
2.  **Implement File Access Logic in Record Rules:**  Within Record Rules, you can check user authentication, roles, or record properties to determine if a user is authorized to download or access a file associated with a record. For example, you can restrict file access to only authenticated users or users who are related to the record in some way.
3.  **Configure File Type and Size Limits:** In the collection settings for file fields, define allowed file types and maximum file sizes. This helps prevent malicious file uploads and resource exhaustion.
4.  **Consider External Storage Adapters:** For enhanced security and scalability, consider using external storage adapters (like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage) instead of the default local file storage. PocketBase supports these adapters, which can provide more robust access control and security features offered by cloud providers.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized File Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from downloading or accessing uploaded files.
*   **Malicious File Uploads (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of users uploading malicious files by enforcing file type and size restrictions.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents resource exhaustion by limiting file sizes and potentially offloading storage to external services.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized File Access:** Significantly reduces the risk by enforcing access control on file downloads.
*   **Malicious File Uploads:** Partially reduces the risk by limiting file types and sizes, but doesn't eliminate all malware risks. Virus scanning might be needed for comprehensive protection (external to PocketBase).
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Partially mitigates by limiting file sizes and potentially offloading storage.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. PocketBase provides record rules and file field settings, but developers need to configure them to enforce access control and limits.

**Missing Implementation:** Often missing if developers rely on default file storage and don't implement specific record rules for file access control. Requires configuration within PocketBase collection settings and record rules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep PocketBase Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_pocketbase_updated.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Monitor PocketBase Releases:** Regularly check the official PocketBase GitHub repository, release notes, and community channels for new version announcements.
2.  **Follow Update Instructions:** When a new version is released, carefully review the release notes for any security fixes, breaking changes, and update instructions.
3.  **Apply Updates Promptly:**  Update your PocketBase application to the latest version as soon as reasonably possible, especially when security vulnerabilities are addressed in new releases.
4.  **Test After Updates:** After updating, thoroughly test your application to ensure that the update process didn't introduce any regressions or break existing functionality.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting known security vulnerabilities that are patched in newer PocketBase versions.
*   **Software Bugs (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of encountering software bugs and stability issues that are often fixed in updates.

**Impact:**
*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk by patching known security flaws.
*   **Software Bugs:** Reduces the risk of application instability and unexpected behavior.

**Currently Implemented:** No, PocketBase does not auto-update. Updating is a manual process that users must perform.

**Missing Implementation:**  Always requires ongoing user action to monitor for updates and apply them. Regular updates are crucial for maintaining security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Custom Go Code Extensions](./mitigation_strategies/secure_custom_go_code_extensions.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Follow Secure Coding Practices:** When developing custom Go code for PocketBase hooks or migrations, adhere to secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities. This includes input validation, output sanitization, proper error handling, and avoiding common security pitfalls like SQL injection or command injection in custom code.
2.  **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of all custom Go code extensions before deploying them to production. Have another developer or security expert review the code for potential vulnerabilities.
3.  **Dependency Management for Custom Code:** If your custom Go code uses external dependencies, manage them carefully. Use dependency management tools (like Go modules) and keep dependencies updated to patch vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
4.  **Minimize Custom Code Complexity:** Keep custom Go code extensions as simple and focused as possible. Minimize the amount of custom code to reduce the potential attack surface and complexity of security reviews.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Code (High Severity):** Prevents introducing security vulnerabilities through custom Go code extensions, such as injection flaws, insecure data handling, or logic errors.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities in Custom Code (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by custom Go code.

**Impact:**
*   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Code:** Significantly reduces the risk by promoting secure development practices and code review.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities in Custom Code:** Reduces the risk by encouraging dependency management and updates.

**Currently Implemented:** No, PocketBase doesn't enforce secure coding practices for custom extensions. Security relies on the developers of the custom code.

**Missing Implementation:**  Requires developers to actively adopt secure coding practices and code review processes when creating PocketBase extensions. This is a crucial aspect of security for applications that extend PocketBase with custom Go code.
