# Attack Surface Analysis for pocketbase/pocketbase

## Attack Surface: [Default Admin Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_admin_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** PocketBase might use default or easily guessable admin credentials during development, which if not changed in production, can be exploited to gain full administrative access.
*   **PocketBase Contribution:** PocketBase's initial setup process, especially in development mode, may not enforce strong password creation for the default admin account, leading to predictable credentials.
*   **Example:** An attacker attempts to log in to the PocketBase Admin UI using common default credentials like "admin@example.com" and "password" and succeeds, gaining full control.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the PocketBase application, including all data, settings, and functionalities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Force a strong password change for the default admin user** during the first access to the Admin UI in a production environment.
    *   **Clearly document the importance of changing default credentials** in PocketBase setup guides and documentation.
    *   **Consider removing or disabling the default admin user** after initial setup and creating a new administrator account with a unique username and strong password.

## Attack Surface: [JWT Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/jwt_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in PocketBase's JWT implementation or configuration that could allow for JWT forgery or manipulation, leading to user impersonation or unauthorized access.
*   **PocketBase Contribution:** PocketBase uses JWT for authentication. Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in PocketBase's JWT handling directly impact application security.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability in PocketBase's JWT verification process or finds a way to obtain the JWT secret key. They can then forge valid JWT tokens to impersonate any user, including administrators.
*   **Impact:** User impersonation, unauthorized access to API endpoints and data, privilege escalation, potentially full application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep PocketBase updated** to ensure you have the latest security patches related to JWT handling and dependencies.
    *   **Ensure PocketBase generates and uses a strong, randomly generated secret key for JWT signing.** This key should be securely stored and managed by PocketBase.
    *   **Regularly review PocketBase's JWT configuration** (if configurable) and ensure it aligns with security best practices.
    *   **Monitor PocketBase security advisories** for any reported JWT-related vulnerabilities and apply patches promptly.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Security Misconfigurations](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_security_misconfigurations.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured API endpoint permissions within PocketBase's Admin UI or data rules, leading to unintended public exposure of sensitive data or administrative functionalities through the PocketBase API.
*   **PocketBase Contribution:** PocketBase's permission system, managed through the Admin UI and data rules, directly controls API access. Misconfigurations here are a direct PocketBase issue.
*   **Example:** A developer mistakenly sets the "List" permission for a sensitive data collection to "Public" in the PocketBase Admin UI. This allows any unauthenticated user to retrieve all records from that collection via the PocketBase API.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential data manipulation if write or update permissions are also misconfigured.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Carefully review and configure collection permissions** in the PocketBase Admin UI, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Thoroughly test API endpoint permissions** after configuration changes to ensure they behave as intended.
    *   **Regularly audit PocketBase collection permissions** to detect and correct any misconfigurations over time.
    *   **Utilize PocketBase's permission rules effectively** to define granular and context-aware access control based on user roles and other criteria.

## Attack Surface: [Admin UI Access Control Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/admin_ui_access_control_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities within PocketBase's Admin UI code itself that could allow attackers to bypass authentication or authorization and gain unauthorized administrative access.
*   **PocketBase Contribution:** The security of the Admin UI is directly managed by PocketBase. Vulnerabilities in this UI are a direct attack surface of PocketBase.
*   **Example:** A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the PocketBase Admin UI allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that, when executed in an administrator's browser, can hijack their session or perform administrative actions on their behalf.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the PocketBase application, full administrative control, data breach, service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep PocketBase updated** to benefit from security patches and bug fixes for the Admin UI.
    *   **Restrict network access to the Admin UI** to trusted networks or IP addresses using firewall rules or reverse proxy configurations.
    *   **Regularly monitor PocketBase security advisories** for any reported Admin UI vulnerabilities and apply updates promptly.
    *   **Educate administrators about common web security threats** and best practices to prevent exploitation of client-side vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated File Access (Potentially High)](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_file_access__potentially_high_.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in PocketBase's file storage permissions, allowing unauthenticated users to directly access uploaded files that should be protected.
*   **PocketBase Contribution:** PocketBase manages file storage and access control for uploaded files. Misconfigurations in PocketBase's file permission settings are a direct issue.
*   **Example:** A developer configures a file collection in PocketBase but fails to restrict read access. This allows anyone with the direct file URL to download sensitive documents or media files without authentication.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, information disclosure, exposure of sensitive files to unauthorized parties. The severity depends on the sensitivity of the stored files.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if sensitive files are stored)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Carefully configure file collection permissions** in the PocketBase Admin UI to restrict read access to authenticated and authorized users only.
    *   **Avoid storing highly sensitive data in publicly accessible file storage** if possible. Consider alternative storage solutions for extremely sensitive information.
    *   **Regularly review file collection permissions** to ensure they are correctly configured and aligned with security requirements.
    *   **Implement additional access control checks in custom API endpoints** if you are serving files through custom routes, even if PocketBase permissions are set.
