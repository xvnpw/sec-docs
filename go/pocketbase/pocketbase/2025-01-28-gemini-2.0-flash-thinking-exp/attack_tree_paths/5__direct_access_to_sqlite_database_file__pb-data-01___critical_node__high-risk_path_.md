### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Direct Access to SQLite Database File (PB-DATA-01)

#### 4.1. Attack Vector Breakdown

The primary attack vector for "Direct Access to SQLite Database File (PB-DATA-01)" revolves around gaining unauthorized access to the SQLite database file, which by default in PocketBase is named `pb_data` and located in the application's data directory.  This access can be achieved through several means:

*   **Direct Web Access (Publicly Accessible Data Directory):**
    *   **Guessing the Location:** If the web server serving the PocketBase application is misconfigured and the `pb_data` directory (or its parent directory) is publicly accessible, an attacker might attempt to guess the location of the `pb_data` file.  Common locations or patterns might be tried, especially if default configurations are used. For example, if the PocketBase application is served from `/app`, an attacker might try accessing `/app/pb_data` or `/app/pb_data/data.db`.
    *   **Directory Listing Enabled:** In severely misconfigured web servers, directory listing might be enabled for the application's root directory or the `pb_data` directory itself. This would directly expose the `pb_data` file and allow easy download.

*   **Directory Traversal Vulnerability:**
    *   If the application or the web server has a directory traversal vulnerability, an attacker could exploit this to navigate the file system and access files outside of the intended web root.  While less likely in a default PocketBase setup itself, vulnerabilities in reverse proxies or other components in the deployment stack could be exploited. An attacker might use paths like `../../pb_data/data.db` to traverse up directories and access the database file.

*   **Exploiting other Application Vulnerabilities (Less Direct, but Possible):**
    *   While the attack path focuses on *direct* access, other vulnerabilities in the PocketBase application (or plugins/extensions if used) could potentially be chained to gain file system access and then retrieve the database file. This is a more complex scenario but should be considered in a broader security assessment.

#### 4.2. Why High Risk: Detailed Impact Assessment

The "High Risk" designation for this attack path is justified due to the catastrophic consequences of successful database file access:

*   **Complete Data Breach:** The SQLite database file contains *all* application data. This includes:
    *   **User Credentials:**  Usernames, hashed passwords (if proper hashing is used, but even hashed passwords can be targeted offline with brute-force or dictionary attacks), email addresses, and potentially other user profile information.
    *   **Sensitive Application Data:**  All data stored in PocketBase collections, which could include personal information, financial data, confidential business information, intellectual property, and any other sensitive data managed by the application.
    *   **Application Logic and Configuration:**  While not directly executable code, the database schema, collection definitions, and potentially some application logic might be stored within the database, providing insights into the application's inner workings and potential further vulnerabilities.
    *   **API Keys and Secrets (Potentially):** Depending on how the application is designed, API keys or other secrets might inadvertently be stored within the database.

*   **Offline Access and Persistent Compromise:** Once the attacker downloads the database file, they have *offline* access to all the data. This means:
    *   **Unlimited Time for Analysis:** The attacker can analyze the data at their leisure, without being detected by real-time monitoring systems.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Passwords:** Offline access allows for computationally intensive brute-force or dictionary attacks on hashed passwords without rate limiting or detection from the live application.
    *   **Data Exfiltration and Sale:** The attacker can exfiltrate the data and potentially sell it on the dark web or use it for malicious purposes like identity theft, fraud, or extortion.
    *   **Backdoor Insertion (Less Direct, but Possible):**  While modifying the database directly and re-uploading it to a running PocketBase instance is complex and risky for the attacker, in some scenarios, they might attempt to manipulate data to create backdoors or escalate privileges if they understand the application logic well enough.

*   **Reputational Damage and Legal/Regulatory Consequences:** A data breach of this magnitude can severely damage the organization's reputation, erode customer trust, and lead to significant legal and regulatory penalties, especially if personal data is compromised and regulations like GDPR or CCPA are applicable.

#### 4.3. Likelihood Assessment

The likelihood of this attack path being successfully exploited is rated as "low-medium" and depends heavily on deployment practices:

*   **Factors Increasing Likelihood:**
    *   **Default Configurations:** Using default web server configurations without hardening, especially if the web server root directly exposes the application's data directory.
    *   **Lack of Security Awareness:** Developers or administrators unaware of the risks of exposing the `pb_data` directory.
    *   **Simple or Predictable Application Paths:** Deploying the application in easily guessable locations (e.g., `/pocketbase`, `/app`).
    *   **Outdated Web Server Software:** Running outdated web server software with known directory traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Complex Deployment Environments:**  More complex deployments with multiple layers (reverse proxies, load balancers) can introduce misconfigurations if not properly secured.

*   **Factors Decreasing Likelihood:**
    *   **Secure Web Server Configuration:** Properly configured web servers that restrict access to the application's data directory and disable directory listing.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Web server processes running with minimal necessary permissions, limiting the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Proactive security assessments that identify and remediate misconfigurations.
    *   **Security-Conscious Deployment Practices:** Following security best practices during deployment, including separating data directories from the web root.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of "Direct Access to SQLite Database File (PB-DATA-01)", the following strategies should be implemented:

1.  **Secure Web Server Configuration (Crucial):**
    *   **Document Root Configuration:** Ensure the web server's document root is configured to point *only* to the public-facing directory of the PocketBase application (if there is one, otherwise, the directory containing the `index.php` if using PHP, or the executable if using the standalone binary). **Crucially, the `pb_data` directory should be located *outside* of the web server's document root.**
    *   **Disable Directory Listing:**  Explicitly disable directory listing for the entire web server and especially for the application's root directory.
    *   **Restrict Access to `pb_data` Directory:**  Use web server configuration (e.g., `.htaccess` for Apache, `nginx.conf` for Nginx) or operating system file permissions to strictly deny all web access to the `pb_data` directory and its contents.  Ideally, the web server user should not even have read access to this directory, if possible, and PocketBase should be configured to run with appropriate permissions to access it.

2.  **Relocate `pb_data` Directory (Recommended):**
    *   Move the `pb_data` directory to a location *outside* of the web server's accessible file system. This is the most effective mitigation as it physically separates the sensitive data from the web-accessible area.  PocketBase allows customizing the data directory path via the `--dir` flag or `PB_DATA_DIR` environment variable. Choose a secure location like `/var/pocketbase_data` or similar, ensuring proper permissions are set for the PocketBase process to access it.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Operating System Level):**
    *   Run the web server and the PocketBase application processes with the minimum necessary user privileges. This limits the potential impact if a vulnerability is exploited.

4.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the deployment environment. Specifically, test for directory traversal and direct file access vulnerabilities.

5.  **Keep Software Up-to-Date:**
    *   Regularly update the web server software, operating system, and PocketBase application to patch known vulnerabilities.

6.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Optional, but Enhances Security):**
    *   Consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the PocketBase application. A WAF can help detect and block directory traversal attempts and other malicious requests.

#### 4.5. Detection Methods

Detecting attempts to access the SQLite database file is crucial for timely incident response.  The following methods can be employed:

1.  **Web Server Access Logs Monitoring:**
    *   **Log Analysis:**  Actively monitor web server access logs for suspicious patterns, such as:
        *   Requests for files within the `pb_data` directory (or its default location if not relocated).
        *   Requests containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `../../`).
        *   Unusual HTTP status codes (e.g., 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found) associated with requests to sensitive paths.
    *   **Automated Alerting:**  Set up automated alerts based on log analysis to notify security teams of suspicious activity in real-time. Tools like `fail2ban`, log management systems (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk), or security information and event management (SIEM) systems can be used.

2.  **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**
    *   Implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) on the `pb_data` directory and the `data.db` file. FIM tools can detect unauthorized modifications or access to these files.  Any access or modification attempt should trigger an alert.

3.  **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
    *   Network-based or host-based Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) can be configured to detect and potentially block malicious network traffic, including attempts to access sensitive files or exploit directory traversal vulnerabilities.

4.  **Honeypot Files (Advanced):**
    *   Consider placing honeypot files with deceptive names within the web root or in locations that might be targeted by attackers. Access to these honeypot files can serve as an early warning sign of malicious activity.

#### 4.6. Real-World Examples (General Context)

While specific public examples of PocketBase SQLite database file breaches due to direct access might be less documented, the underlying vulnerability of exposing sensitive data files via web servers is a well-known and common issue.

*   **General Web Server Misconfigurations:**  Numerous historical data breaches have occurred due to misconfigured web servers exposing sensitive files, configuration files, or database backups.
*   **Directory Traversal Exploits:** Directory traversal vulnerabilities are a classic web security issue, and exploits targeting these vulnerabilities have been used in many attacks to access sensitive files.
*   **Similar Database File Exposure:**  Applications using file-based databases (like SQLite, but also others) have been vulnerable to data breaches when these database files were inadvertently made publicly accessible due to misconfigurations.

While PocketBase itself is relatively new, the principles of securing web applications and protecting sensitive data files are well-established.  This attack path highlights the importance of applying these principles to PocketBase deployments.

#### 4.7. Conclusion

The "Direct Access to SQLite Database File (PB-DATA-01)" attack path represents a critical security risk for PocketBase applications.  Successful exploitation can lead to a complete data breach, with severe consequences for data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Mitigation is paramount.**  By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly focusing on secure web server configuration and relocating the `pb_data` directory outside the web root, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood of this attack.  Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are also essential to maintain a strong security posture.

This deep analysis provides actionable insights and recommendations to proactively address this high-risk attack path and enhance the overall security of PocketBase applications. It is crucial that the development team prioritizes these mitigations and integrates them into their deployment and maintenance processes.
