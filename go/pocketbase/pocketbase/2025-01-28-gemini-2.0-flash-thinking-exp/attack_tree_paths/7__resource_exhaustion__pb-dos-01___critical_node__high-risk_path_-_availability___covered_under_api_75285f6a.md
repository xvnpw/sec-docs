### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Resource Exhaustion (PB-DOS-01)

#### 4.1. Attack Path Description

The "Resource Exhaustion (PB-DOS-01)" attack path represents a Denial of Service (DoS) attack where an attacker aims to make the PocketBase application unavailable to legitimate users by consuming excessive server resources. This attack path leverages the principle that every application and server has finite resources (CPU, memory, network, etc.). By overwhelming these resources, the attacker can degrade performance, cause application crashes, or completely halt service availability.

As highlighted, this path is closely related to **PB-API-02-01 (Resource Exhaustion)**, indicating that API abuse is a primary vector for achieving resource exhaustion in PocketBase.  This means attackers are likely to target PocketBase's API endpoints to initiate resource-intensive operations.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors and Techniques

An attacker can employ various techniques to exhaust resources in a PocketBase application. These can be broadly categorized as:

* **High Volume Request Flooding:**
    * **Description:**  Sending a massive number of requests to PocketBase API endpoints in a short period. This can overwhelm the server's capacity to process requests, leading to CPU and memory exhaustion, network bandwidth saturation, and database connection limits being reached.
    * **PocketBase Relevance:** PocketBase, by default, exposes API endpoints for data management, authentication, and potentially custom functions.  Unprotected or poorly rate-limited endpoints are prime targets.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Login Flooding:** Repeatedly sending login requests (even with invalid credentials) to exhaust authentication processing resources.
        * **Data Retrieval Flooding:**  Requesting large datasets or repeatedly querying endpoints that trigger complex database operations.
        * **File Upload Flooding:**  Initiating numerous file uploads (even small ones) to consume network bandwidth and disk I/O.

* **Resource-Intensive Requests:**
    * **Description:** Crafting specific API requests that are inherently resource-intensive to process on the server-side.
    * **PocketBase Relevance:**  PocketBase's API might allow for operations that can be computationally expensive or memory-intensive if not properly controlled.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Complex Database Queries:**  Exploiting API endpoints that allow for filtering, sorting, or aggregation of large datasets, leading to slow and resource-heavy database queries.
        * **Large File Uploads/Downloads:**  Uploading or downloading extremely large files can consume significant network bandwidth, disk I/O, and memory.
        * **Recursive or Infinite Loops (in Custom Functions - if implemented):** If PocketBase is extended with custom functions, poorly written code could contain loops that consume resources indefinitely.

* **Slowloris/Slow Read Attacks (Connection Exhaustion):**
    * **Description:**  Establishing and maintaining many slow, persistent connections to the web server, consuming server resources (especially connection limits) without generating much traffic.
    * **PocketBase Relevance:**  While PocketBase itself might not be directly vulnerable to classic Slowloris, similar principles can apply.  Attackers might initiate many API requests but send data very slowly or read responses very slowly, tying up server resources and preventing legitimate connections.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Slow POST Requests:**  Sending HTTP POST requests with headers but sending the request body (data) at an extremely slow rate.
        * **Slow Read of Responses:**  Initiating API requests and then reading the response data at a very slow pace, keeping connections open for extended periods.

#### 4.3. Affected Components and Resources

A successful Resource Exhaustion (PB-DOS-01) attack can impact various components and resources within the PocketBase application and its environment:

* **PocketBase Application Server:**
    * **CPU:**  High CPU utilization due to processing numerous requests or resource-intensive operations.
    * **Memory (RAM):**  Increased memory consumption due to request processing, data caching, and connection handling.
    * **Network Interface:**  Saturation of network bandwidth due to high traffic volume.
    * **Process Limits:**  Reaching the maximum number of processes or threads the server can handle.

* **Underlying Operating System:**
    * **File Descriptors:**  Exhaustion of file descriptors due to numerous open connections.
    * **System Resources:**  Overall system instability due to resource contention.

* **Database (if configured):**
    * **Database Connections:**  Exhaustion of available database connections, preventing legitimate application requests from accessing the database.
    * **Database Server Load:**  Increased load on the database server due to complex or numerous queries, potentially leading to database slowdown or failure.

* **Network Infrastructure:**
    * **Firewall/Load Balancer:**  Potential overload of network devices if they are not properly configured to handle DoS attacks.

#### 4.4. Potential Impact

The impact of a successful Resource Exhaustion (PB-DOS-01) attack can be severe:

* **Service Unavailability:** The primary impact is the inability of legitimate users to access the PocketBase application and its functionalities. This can lead to business disruption, loss of productivity, and negative user experience.
* **Performance Degradation:** Even if the application doesn't become completely unavailable, users may experience significant performance slowdowns, slow response times, and timeouts, making the application unusable in practice.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Prolonged service outages can damage the reputation of the organization relying on the PocketBase application.
* **Financial Losses:**  For businesses dependent on the application, downtime can translate to direct financial losses due to lost transactions, missed opportunities, and recovery costs.
* **Resource Overconsumption Costs:**  In cloud environments, excessive resource consumption due to an attack can lead to unexpected and increased infrastructure costs.

#### 4.5. Vulnerabilities Exploited

The "Resource Exhaustion (PB-DOS-01)" attack path exploits vulnerabilities related to:

* **Lack of or Inadequate Rate Limiting:**  The most critical vulnerability is the absence or insufficient implementation of rate limiting mechanisms at various levels:
    * **API Endpoint Level:**  No limits on the number of requests per endpoint per time window.
    * **IP Address Level:**  No limits on requests originating from a specific IP address.
    * **User Level:**  No limits on requests from a specific authenticated user.
* **Inefficient Resource Management in PocketBase:**  Potential inefficiencies in PocketBase's code or underlying libraries in handling resource-intensive operations (e.g., database queries, file processing) could amplify the impact of malicious requests.
* **Default Configurations:**  Insecure default configurations of PocketBase or the underlying server environment (e.g., overly generous resource limits, lack of security hardening) can make it easier to exploit resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.
* **Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Insufficient input validation could allow attackers to craft requests that trigger resource-intensive operations or bypass intended limitations.

#### 4.6. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations

To mitigate the risk of "Resource Exhaustion (PB-DOS-01)" attacks, the following strategies are recommended:

1. **Implement Robust Rate Limiting:**
    * **API Endpoint Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limits on critical API endpoints, especially those related to authentication, data modification, and resource-intensive operations. Consider using middleware or libraries specifically designed for rate limiting in Go (PocketBase's language).
    * **IP-Based Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of requests from a single IP address within a given time frame. This can help mitigate distributed attacks.
    * **User-Based Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limits per authenticated user to prevent abuse from compromised accounts.
    * **Adaptive Rate Limiting:**  Consider implementing adaptive rate limiting that dynamically adjusts limits based on traffic patterns and server load.

2. **Optimize Resource Management:**
    * **Efficient Database Queries:**  Ensure database queries are optimized for performance. Use indexes, avoid unnecessary joins, and profile queries to identify bottlenecks.
    * **Asynchronous Processing:**  Utilize asynchronous processing for resource-intensive tasks (e.g., file uploads, background jobs) to prevent blocking the main request processing thread.
    * **Connection Pooling:**  Implement database connection pooling to efficiently manage database connections and prevent connection exhaustion.
    * **Memory Management:**  Review PocketBase configuration and code (if custom extensions are used) to ensure efficient memory usage and prevent memory leaks.

3. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user inputs to API endpoints to prevent injection of malicious data that could trigger resource-intensive operations.
    * **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize user inputs to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure data integrity.

4. **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * **Real-time Monitoring:**  Implement monitoring of server resources (CPU, memory, network, database connections) to detect anomalies and potential DoS attacks in real-time.
    * **Alerting System:**  Set up alerts to notify administrators when resource utilization exceeds predefined thresholds, allowing for timely intervention.

5. **Load Balancing and Scalability:**
    * **Load Balancer:**  Distribute traffic across multiple PocketBase server instances using a load balancer to improve resilience and handle traffic surges.
    * **Horizontal Scaling:**  Design the PocketBase deployment to be horizontally scalable, allowing for easy addition of server instances to handle increased load.

6. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * **Deploy a WAF:**  Consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the PocketBase application to filter malicious traffic, including DoS attack attempts. WAFs can often provide built-in DoS protection features.

7. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the PocketBase application and its configuration to identify potential vulnerabilities, including those related to resource exhaustion.
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Perform penetration testing, specifically simulating DoS attacks, to validate the effectiveness of implemented mitigation strategies and identify weaknesses.

8. **Educate Developers:**
    * **Security Awareness Training:**  Train developers on secure coding practices, including how to prevent resource exhaustion vulnerabilities and implement proper rate limiting.
