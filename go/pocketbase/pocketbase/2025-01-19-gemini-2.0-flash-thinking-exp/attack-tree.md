## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses.md)

* **Bypass Authentication [CRITICAL]:**
    * Exploit Authentication Vulnerability [CRITICAL]:
        * Exploit Known PocketBase Authentication Bug (if any) [CRITICAL]: Leveraging publicly known security flaws in PocketBase's authentication logic.
    * Use Default/Weak Credentials [CRITICAL]:
        * Access Admin UI with Default Credentials [CRITICAL]: Logging into the administrative interface using default or easily guessable credentials.
    * Exploit API Vulnerabilities Bypassing Authorization Checks [CRITICAL]:
        * Access or Modify Data Through Unprotected API Endpoints [CRITICAL]: Directly accessing or manipulating data through API endpoints that lack proper authentication or authorization controls.
        * Exploit GraphQL Vulnerabilities (if enabled and used) [CRITICAL]: Exploiting flaws in the GraphQL implementation to bypass authorization and access sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Database Access Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_database_access_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Gain Direct Database Access [CRITICAL]:**
    * Exploit Misconfigured Database Credentials [CRITICAL]:
        * Access Underlying SQLite Database with Exposed Credentials [CRITICAL]: Obtaining and using database credentials that are inadvertently exposed or insecurely stored to directly access the SQLite database.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Admin UI Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_admin_ui_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Gain Unauthorized Access to Admin UI [CRITICAL]:**
    * Exploit Authentication Weaknesses (covered above) [CRITICAL]: Utilizing any of the authentication bypass methods to gain access to the administrative interface.
    * **Abuse Admin Privileges [CRITICAL]:**
        * Modify Application Configuration [CRITICAL]:
            * Disable Security Features [CRITICAL]: Altering configuration settings to disable security measures.
            * Expose Sensitive Information [CRITICAL]: Modifying configuration to reveal sensitive data.
        * Create/Modify Users and Permissions [CRITICAL]:
            * Grant Elevated Privileges to Attacker Account [CRITICAL]: Creating new administrative accounts or elevating the privileges of existing attacker-controlled accounts.
        * Access and Modify Sensitive Data Directly [CRITICAL]: Using the administrative interface to directly view or alter sensitive data stored within PocketBase.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Extensibility Features (Hooks, Migrations)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_extensibility_features__hooks__migrations_.md)

* **Exploit Insecurely Implemented Hooks [CRITICAL]:**
    * Inject Malicious Code into Hook Logic [CRITICAL]:
        * Achieve Remote Code Execution [CRITICAL]: Injecting and executing arbitrary code on the server through vulnerable hook implementations.
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Hook Dependencies [CRITICAL]: Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by custom hooks.
* **Exploit Insecure Database Migrations [CRITICAL]:**
    * Inject Malicious SQL into Migration Scripts [CRITICAL]:
        * Modify Database Structure to Introduce Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]: Injecting malicious SQL commands into database migration scripts to alter the database structure in a way that introduces security flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_misconfigurations.md)

* **Exploit Exposed Admin Interface [CRITICAL]:**
    * Access Admin UI Without Proper Network Restrictions [CRITICAL]: Accessing the administrative interface because it is exposed to the public internet without proper network access controls.
