# Threat Model Analysis for pocketbase/pocketbase

## Threat: [Insecure Default Admin Password](./threats/insecure_default_admin_password.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the PocketBase admin UI by exploiting the use of default or easily guessable credentials that were not changed after installation. This allows them to fully control the PocketBase instance.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the PocketBase instance, allowing the attacker to read, modify, and delete all data, create new administrative users, and potentially gain control of the underlying server.

**Affected Component:** Admin UI, Authentication module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Force a strong password change during the initial setup of PocketBase.
* Clearly document the importance of changing the default admin password.
* Consider implementing account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Record Rules Leading to Data Breach](./threats/misconfigured_record_rules_leading_to_data_breach.md)

**Description:** An attacker bypasses intended access controls by exploiting overly permissive or incorrectly configured record rules within PocketBase. This allows them to access or manipulate data they should not be authorized to interact with through the API.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to privacy violations, financial loss, or reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Collections module, Record Rules engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly test all record rules with different user roles and scenarios.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when defining rules.
* Regularly audit and review record rule configurations.
* Utilize the rule testing features provided by PocketBase.

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Uploads Leading to Malware Hosting or Resource Exhaustion](./threats/unrestricted_file_uploads_leading_to_malware_hosting_or_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads malicious files or excessively large files to the PocketBase storage due to a lack of proper restrictions enforced by PocketBase's file handling. This can lead to hosting of harmful content or denial of service through storage exhaustion.

**Impact:** Hosting of malicious content, potential compromise of client machines if downloaded, denial of service due to storage exhaustion, increased storage costs.

**Affected Component:** File Storage module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict file type whitelisting within the application logic interacting with PocketBase.
* Set reasonable file size limits within the application logic interacting with PocketBase.
* Consider using virus scanning on uploaded files within the application logic.
* Implement proper access controls on the file storage directory at the server level.

## Threat: [Exploiting Realtime Subscription Vulnerabilities for Information Disclosure](./threats/exploiting_realtime_subscription_vulnerabilities_for_information_disclosure.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages vulnerabilities within PocketBase's realtime subscription mechanism to gain unauthorized access to data updates. This could involve exploiting flaws in how PocketBase authorizes or filters realtime events.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to real-time data updates, potentially revealing sensitive information as it changes.

**Affected Component:** Realtime API module, Subscription handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that authorization rules are consistently and correctly applied to realtime subscriptions within PocketBase's implementation.
* Carefully validate subscription requests and parameters within PocketBase's code.
* Monitor for unusual subscription patterns.
* Keep PocketBase updated to benefit from security patches in the realtime implementation.

## Threat: [Admin API Key Exposure Leading to Full System Control](./threats/admin_api_key_exposure_leading_to_full_system_control.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the PocketBase admin API key, which grants unrestricted access to the backend. This could happen through accidental exposure in code, insecure storage, or other vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the PocketBase instance, including data manipulation, user management, and server configuration changes.

**Affected Component:** Admin API, Authentication module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Treat the admin API key as highly sensitive and store it securely (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management).
* Avoid committing the admin API key to version control.
* Regularly rotate the admin API key.
* Restrict access to the admin API to trusted environments or IP addresses if possible.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in PocketBase Core or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_pocketbase_core_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Undiscovered security vulnerabilities exist within the PocketBase codebase itself or in its dependencies. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise applications using PocketBase.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution, leading to full system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Various components depending on the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep PocketBase updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor for security advisories related to PocketBase and its dependencies.
* Consider using tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
