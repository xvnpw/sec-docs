### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Extensibility Features (Hooks, Migrations)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Extensibility Features (Hooks, Migrations)**

This path highlights the inherent risks associated with allowing developers to extend the core functionality of PocketBase through custom hooks and database migrations. While these features offer flexibility and customization, they also introduce potential security vulnerabilities if not implemented carefully.

#### **Exploit Insecurely Implemented Hooks [CRITICAL]:**

PocketBase allows developers to register custom functions (hooks) that are executed in response to specific events within the application lifecycle (e.g., before record creation, after user authentication). If these hooks are not implemented securely, they can become a significant attack vector.

* **Inject Malicious Code into Hook Logic [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Achieve Remote Code Execution [CRITICAL]:** Injecting and executing arbitrary code on the server through vulnerable hook implementations.

        * **Description:** This is a severe vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious code into the logic of a custom hook. This could happen if the hook processes user-supplied data without proper sanitization or validation, allowing for code injection vulnerabilities (e.g., through template engines, `eval()`-like functions, or insecurely handling external commands).
        * **Technical Details:**
            * **Vulnerable Input Handling:**  A hook might directly use user input (e.g., from a request body or query parameter) in a way that allows for code execution. For example, if a hook uses a template engine to render dynamic content and doesn't sanitize user input, an attacker could inject template directives that execute arbitrary code.
            * **Insecure Deserialization:** If hooks involve deserializing data from external sources without proper validation, an attacker could craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code.
            * **Command Injection:** If a hook executes external commands based on user input without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious commands.
        * **Impact:**  Successful remote code execution grants the attacker complete control over the server. They can:
            * Access sensitive data, including database credentials and user information.
            * Modify or delete data.
            * Install malware or backdoors.
            * Disrupt application availability.
        * **Likelihood:**  High, especially if developers are not aware of the risks associated with insecure input handling and code execution within hooks.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-supplied data before using it within hook logic. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database.
            * **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of functions like `eval()` or similar constructs that execute arbitrary code. If necessary, carefully sandbox or isolate such executions.
            * **Secure Deserialization Practices:**  Avoid deserializing untrusted data. If necessary, use secure deserialization libraries and implement strict validation of the deserialized objects.
            * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the user account under which the PocketBase application runs has only the necessary permissions.
            * **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular reviews of hook implementations to identify potential vulnerabilities.

    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Hook Dependencies [CRITICAL]:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by custom hooks.

        * **Description:** Custom hooks often rely on external libraries or packages to perform specific tasks. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them through the hook implementation.
        * **Technical Details:**
            * **Outdated Dependencies:**  Using outdated versions of libraries with known vulnerabilities.
            * **Transitive Dependencies:**  Vulnerabilities in dependencies of the libraries directly used by the hook.
            * **Publicly Known Exploits:**  Attackers can leverage publicly available exploits for vulnerable libraries.
        * **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from remote code execution to denial of service or data breaches.
        * **Likelihood:**  Moderate to High, depending on the diligence of the development team in managing dependencies.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Dependency Management:**  Use a dependency management tool (e.g., `npm`, `yarn` for JavaScript hooks, `go mod` for Go hooks) to track and manage dependencies.
            * **Regular Dependency Updates:**  Keep all dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
            * **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Utilize vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
            * **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Implement SCA tools to gain visibility into the software bill of materials and identify potential risks associated with third-party components.

#### **Exploit Insecure Database Migrations [CRITICAL]:**

PocketBase uses database migrations to manage changes to the database schema over time. These migration scripts are typically written in SQL. If these scripts are crafted without proper security considerations, they can be exploited to introduce vulnerabilities.

* **Inject Malicious SQL into Migration Scripts [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Modify Database Structure to Introduce Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:** Injecting malicious SQL commands into database migration scripts to alter the database structure in a way that introduces security flaws.

        * **Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the migration scripts or influences their creation could inject malicious SQL commands. These commands could alter the database schema in ways that create security vulnerabilities.
        * **Technical Details:**
            * **Adding Backdoor Accounts:** Injecting SQL to create new administrative accounts with known credentials.
            * **Modifying Permissions:** Altering table or column permissions to grant unauthorized access to sensitive data.
            * **Introducing Vulnerable Columns:** Adding columns with insecure data types or constraints that can be exploited.
            * **Disabling Security Features:**  Modifying database settings or constraints that enforce security policies.
        * **Impact:**  Successful modification of the database structure can lead to:
            * **Data Breaches:**  Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data.
            * **Data Manipulation:**  Modifying or deleting critical data.
            * **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining higher levels of access within the application.
            * **Application Instability:**  Introducing schema changes that break application functionality.
        * **Likelihood:**  Moderate, as it requires some level of access to the development or deployment process. However, if the migration process is not properly secured, the risk increases.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Secure Migration Script Management:**  Store migration scripts in a secure location with restricted access. Use version control to track changes and audit modifications.
            * **Code Review for Migration Scripts:**  Thoroughly review all migration scripts for potential security vulnerabilities before execution.
            * **Principle of Least Privilege for Migration Execution:**  Ensure that the database user executing migrations has only the necessary privileges to perform schema changes and not broader data access or manipulation rights.
            * **Automated Testing of Migrations:**  Implement automated tests to verify the intended changes of migration scripts and detect any unexpected or malicious modifications.
            * **Immutable Infrastructure for Migrations:**  Consider using immutable infrastructure principles where migration scripts are part of a controlled deployment process, reducing the opportunity for unauthorized modification.
            * **Separation of Duties:**  Separate the roles of developers who write migration scripts from those who deploy them.

### 5. Recommendations for the Development Team
