## 4. Component Details

This section provides a more granular description of each key component within the PocketBase architecture, including specific technologies often employed.

### 4.1. HTTP Router

*   **Responsibility:**  Receives all incoming HTTP requests and intelligently routes them to the appropriate handlers based on the defined URL paths and HTTP methods. Also responsible for serving static assets for the Admin UI.
*   **Technology:**  Typically implemented using Go's built-in `net/http` package, often leveraging the `ServeMux` for basic routing. More complex applications might utilize third-party routers like Gorilla Mux for enhanced features like route variables and middleware support.
*   **Security Relevance:**  A critical entry point for all external interactions. Proper configuration is essential to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints. Vulnerabilities here can expose the entire application.

### 4.2. API Handlers

*   **Responsibility:**  Contain the core business logic for the application. They process incoming requests, interact with the database and other components, and generate appropriate responses.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database records for defined collections.
    *   Handling user registration, login, and password management.
    *   Execution of custom API endpoints defined by the application developer.
    *   Integration with the Realtime Engine to publish data changes for real-time updates.
    *   Handling file uploads and downloads, interacting with the File Storage component.
*   **Security Relevance:**  A significant attack surface. Vulnerable to injection attacks (SQL, command), business logic flaws leading to data manipulation or privilege escalation, and insecure handling of sensitive data.

### 4.3. Authentication & Authorization

*   **Responsibility:**  Verifies the identity of users attempting to access the system (authentication) and determines if they have the necessary permissions to perform the requested actions (authorization).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   User registration and login mechanisms, potentially supporting various authentication providers (e.g., email/password, OAuth2).
    *   Session management, often using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) or secure HTTP cookies to maintain user sessions.
    *   Implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or potentially Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to manage user permissions and access to specific resources.
    *   Secure password hashing and storage using robust algorithms like Argon2id.
    *   Generation and management of API tokens for programmatic access.
*   **Security Relevance:**  A foundational security component. Weaknesses here can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and impersonation.

### 4.4. Realtime Engine

*   **Responsibility:**  Facilitates the near instantaneous propagation of data changes to connected clients, providing a real-time experience.
*   **Technology:**  Typically built using Go channels for efficient internal communication and WebSockets for establishing persistent, bidirectional communication channels with clients.
