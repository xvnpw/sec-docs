# Attack Surface Analysis for pocketbase/pocketbase

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured PocketBase Admin UI](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_pocketbase_admin_ui.md)

*   **Description:** The administrative interface of PocketBase, accessible via the `/admin` route, provides full control over the backend, including data, users, and settings.
*   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase provides this built-in admin UI for easy management. If not properly secured, it becomes a direct entry point for attackers.
*   **Example:** An attacker guesses or brute-forces the default admin credentials or exploits a vulnerability in the admin UI itself to gain access.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the PocketBase instance, leading to data breaches, manipulation, and potential service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Change the default admin email and password to strong, unique credentials immediately.
    *   Restrict access to the `/admin` route by IP address or implement an additional authentication layer (e.g., using a reverse proxy).
    *   Regularly update PocketBase to patch any security vulnerabilities in the admin UI.
    *   Disable the admin UI in production environments if direct access is not required and management is done through other means.

## Attack Surface: [Loosely Configured Record Rules](./attack_surfaces/loosely_configured_record_rules.md)

*   **Description:** PocketBase's record rules define access control for data. Weak or overly permissive rules can allow unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of records.
*   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase's rule-based system is powerful but requires careful configuration. Incorrectly defined rules directly expose data.
*   **Example:** A rule allows any authenticated user to delete any record in a sensitive collection, leading to data loss.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized data deletion, and potential privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Design and implement record rules with the principle of least privilege.
    *   Thoroughly test record rules to ensure they behave as intended and don't have unintended consequences.
    *   Regularly review and audit record rules as application requirements evolve.
    *   Utilize the available rule functions and variables to create granular and context-aware access control.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Upload Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

*   **Description:** PocketBase allows file uploads. Improper handling can lead to vulnerabilities like path traversal, arbitrary file upload, and serving malicious content.
*   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase provides the functionality for file storage and retrieval. The security of this feature depends on how it's used and configured.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious script disguised as an image, and due to lack of sanitization within PocketBase's handling, the server executes the script when accessed.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, cross-site scripting (XSS), information disclosure, and potential server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate file types and sizes on the server-side (using PocketBase's features or custom logic).
    *   Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root (configuration outside of PocketBase, but relevant to its file handling).
    *   Serve uploaded files through a separate domain or use the `Content-Disposition: attachment` header to force downloads.

## Attack Surface: [Publicly Accessible API Endpoints without Proper Authentication/Authorization](./attack_surfaces/publicly_accessible_api_endpoints_without_proper_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   **Description:** PocketBase exposes RESTful API endpoints for data access and manipulation. If these endpoints are not properly secured using PocketBase's authentication and authorization mechanisms, they can be exploited.
*   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase's API structure is inherently part of its functionality. Developers need to implement appropriate security measures using PocketBase's features.
*   **Example:** An API endpoint for retrieving user profiles is accessible without authentication, as no record rules or authentication middleware is applied in PocketBase, allowing anyone to view sensitive user data.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, and potential abuse of application functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce authentication and authorization for all API endpoints that handle sensitive data or actions using PocketBase's record rules or authentication middleware.
    *   Utilize PocketBase's authentication mechanisms (e.g., token-based authentication).
    *   Implement rate limiting (often done outside of PocketBase, but important for API security).

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration or Data Directory](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_or_data_directory.md)

*   **Description:** If the `.pb_data` directory (containing the SQLite database) or configuration files are publicly accessible, sensitive information can be exposed.
*   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase stores its data and configuration in specific directories. Misconfiguration of the hosting environment can expose these.
*   **Example:** Web server misconfiguration allows direct access to the `.pb_data` directory, enabling an attacker to download the entire database managed by PocketBase.
*   **Impact:** Full data breach, access to API keys, and other sensitive configuration details.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the `.pb_data` directory and configuration files are not within the web server's document root and are not publicly accessible.
    *   Configure web server rules to block direct access to these sensitive directories and files.
    *   Use appropriate file system permissions to restrict access to the PocketBase data and configuration.
