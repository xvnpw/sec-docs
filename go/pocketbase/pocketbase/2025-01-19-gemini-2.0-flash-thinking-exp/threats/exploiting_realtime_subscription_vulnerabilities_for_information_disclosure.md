### 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat: Exploiting Realtime Subscription Vulnerabilities for Information Disclosure

This threat centers around the potential for an attacker to bypass intended authorization controls within PocketBase's realtime subscription mechanism, allowing them to receive data updates they are not authorized to access. Let's break down the potential vulnerabilities and attack scenarios:

**4.1 Understanding PocketBase's Realtime Subscription Mechanism:**

PocketBase utilizes a websocket-based realtime API. Clients can subscribe to changes in specific collections or even individual records. When data within a subscribed scope is created, updated, or deleted, PocketBase broadcasts these changes to all authorized subscribers. The key to security lies in how PocketBase determines which clients are "authorized" to receive these updates.

**4.2 Potential Vulnerabilities:**

Based on the threat description and our understanding of realtime systems, several potential vulnerabilities could be exploited:

* **Insufficient Authorization Checks:**
    * **Subscription Request Level:**  PocketBase might not adequately validate the initial subscription request. An attacker could potentially craft a subscription request that bypasses intended authorization rules, allowing them to subscribe to data they shouldn't have access to. This could involve manipulating parameters or exploiting logic flaws in the subscription request processing.
    * **Event Broadcasting Level:** Even if the initial subscription is seemingly authorized, PocketBase might not consistently re-evaluate authorization rules before broadcasting each individual event. This could lead to a scenario where a user gains access to data updates they shouldn't receive based on changes in permissions or data visibility.
* **Flaws in Data Filtering Logic:**
    * **Inadequate Filtering on the Server-Side:** PocketBase might rely too heavily on client-side filtering or have vulnerabilities in its server-side filtering logic. An attacker could potentially subscribe to a broader scope of data than intended and then filter it on their end, potentially revealing information that should have been restricted server-side.
    * **Exploiting Collection/Record-Level Permissions:** If the application relies heavily on collection or record-level permissions, vulnerabilities in how these permissions are enforced during realtime event broadcasting could be exploited. For example, a user might subscribe to a collection and receive updates for records they wouldn't be able to access through a standard API request.
* **Race Conditions in Authorization and Subscription Handling:**  A race condition could occur if a user's permissions are changed while they have an active subscription. If the authorization check isn't atomic or properly synchronized with the event broadcasting, the user might receive updates they are no longer authorized for.
* **Information Leakage through Metadata:**  Realtime events might inadvertently include metadata or related information that reveals sensitive details, even if the core data payload is protected. This could include timestamps, user IDs, or other contextual information.
* **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries:** If PocketBase relies on third-party libraries for its realtime implementation, vulnerabilities in those libraries could be indirectly exploitable.

**4.3 Attack Scenarios:**

Here are some potential attack scenarios illustrating how these vulnerabilities could be exploited:

* **Scenario 1: Bypassing Collection-Level Authorization:** An attacker crafts a subscription request targeting a sensitive collection, manipulating parameters to bypass the intended authorization checks. They then receive realtime updates for all records in that collection, including those they shouldn't have access to.
* **Scenario 2: Exploiting Record-Level Permission Flaws:** An attacker subscribes to a collection where access to individual records is controlled by specific permissions. They identify a vulnerability where the realtime event broadcasting doesn't properly enforce these record-level permissions, allowing them to receive updates for records they are not authorized to view via standard API calls.
* **Scenario 3: Manipulating Subscription Parameters for Broad Access:** An attacker discovers a way to manipulate subscription parameters (e.g., using wildcard characters or exploiting logical flaws) to subscribe to a broader scope of data than intended. This allows them to passively monitor changes across multiple collections or records, potentially revealing sensitive information.
* **Scenario 4: Exploiting Race Conditions During Permission Changes:** A user with temporary access to sensitive data establishes a realtime subscription. Before their access is revoked, a change occurs in the subscribed data. Due to a race condition, the realtime event is broadcast to the user even after their permissions have been removed.

**4.4 Impact Analysis:**

The successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could have significant consequences:

* **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive data, intended only for authorized users, could be exposed to malicious actors. This could include personal information, financial data, business secrets, or any other confidential information managed by the application.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A data breach resulting from this vulnerability could severely damage the application's reputation and erode user trust.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the nature of the exposed data, the breach could lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) resulting in fines and legal repercussions.
* **Business Disruption:**  The exposure of critical business data could disrupt operations, impact decision-making, and lead to financial losses.

**4.5 Recommendations and Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**

To mitigate the risk of this threat, the following recommendations should be implemented:

* ** 강화된 서버 측 권한 부여 검사 (Strengthened Server-Side Authorization Checks):**
    * **Subscription Request Validation:** Implement robust server-side validation of all subscription requests. This should include verifying user identity, checking permissions against the target collection and any specified filters, and ensuring the request parameters are valid and within expected boundaries.
    * **Per-Event Authorization:**  Ensure that authorization rules are consistently re-evaluated *before* broadcasting each individual realtime event. This prevents users from receiving updates they are no longer authorized for due to permission changes or data visibility updates.
* **정확한 데이터 필터링 구현 (Implement Precise Data Filtering):**
    * **Server-Side Filtering as Primary Defense:**  Prioritize server-side filtering to ensure that only authorized data is broadcasted. Avoid relying solely on client-side filtering.
    * **Granular Filtering Options:**  Leverage PocketBase's filtering capabilities to allow for fine-grained control over the data included in realtime events. This might involve filtering based on specific fields, user roles, or other relevant criteria.
* **경쟁 조건 방지 (Prevent Race Conditions):**
    * **Atomic Operations for Authorization and Event Broadcasting:** Ensure that authorization checks and event broadcasting are performed as atomic operations or are properly synchronized to prevent race conditions when permissions are changed.
    * **Immediate Subscription Revocation on Permission Changes:** When a user's permissions are revoked, immediately terminate their active realtime subscriptions to prevent them from receiving further updates.
* **메타데이터 노출 최소화 (Minimize Metadata Exposure):**
    * **Carefully Review Realtime Event Payloads:**  Thoroughly review the structure and content of realtime event payloads to ensure they do not inadvertently expose sensitive metadata or related information.
    * **Configure Minimal Necessary Data:**  Configure PocketBase to only include the necessary data in realtime events, avoiding the transmission of extraneous information.
* **입력 유효성 검사 및 삭제 (Input Validation and Sanitization):**
    * **Validate Subscription Parameters:**  Strictly validate all parameters provided in subscription requests to prevent injection attacks or manipulation that could bypass authorization.
    * **Sanitize Data Before Broadcasting:**  While primarily a concern for preventing other types of attacks, sanitizing data before broadcasting can help prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive information through unexpected data formats.
* **속도 제한 및 모니터링 (Rate Limiting and Monitoring):**
    * **Implement Rate Limiting for Subscription Requests:**  Limit the number of subscription requests a user can make within a given timeframe to prevent abuse and potential denial-of-service attempts.
    * **Monitor for Unusual Subscription Patterns:**  Implement monitoring to detect unusual subscription patterns or attempts to subscribe to sensitive data without proper authorization. Alerting mechanisms should be in place to notify administrators of suspicious activity.
* **PocketBase 업데이트 유지 (Keep PocketBase Updated):**
    * **Regularly Update PocketBase:**  Stay up-to-date with the latest versions of PocketBase to benefit from security patches and bug fixes in the realtime implementation.
