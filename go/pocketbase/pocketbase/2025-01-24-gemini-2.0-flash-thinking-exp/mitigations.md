# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pocketbase/pocketbase

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies via PocketBase Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies_via_pocketbase_configuration.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong Password Policies via PocketBase Configuration
**Description:**
1.  Consult the PocketBase documentation to identify available configuration options for password policies. This might involve setting environment variables or modifying a configuration file.
2.  Configure PocketBase to enforce a minimum password length (e.g., 12 characters).
3.  Enable complexity requirements, such as requiring a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, if supported by PocketBase.
4.  Consider implementing password expiration policies within PocketBase if available, forcing users to change passwords periodically.
5.  Test password creation and reset processes to ensure the configured policies are correctly enforced.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Brute-Force Password Attacks (High Severity):** Makes it significantly harder for attackers to guess passwords through brute-force attempts by increasing password complexity.
*   **Credential Stuffing Attacks (Medium Severity):** Reduces the effectiveness of credential stuffing attacks that rely on reusing weak or compromised passwords.
*   **Dictionary Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prevents the use of common dictionary words as passwords.
**Impact:**
*   **Brute-Force Password Attacks:** High reduction in risk.
*   **Credential Stuffing Attacks:** Medium reduction in risk.
*   **Dictionary Attacks:** Medium reduction in risk.
**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Client-side password strength validation is in place in the registration form, but server-side enforcement via PocketBase configuration is not fully utilized.
**Missing Implementation:** Need to research PocketBase documentation for specific password policy configuration options and implement them. This might involve setting environment variables or using PocketBase's admin UI if such settings are exposed there.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using PocketBase's Built-in Feature](./mitigation_strategies/implement_multi-factor_authentication__mfa__using_pocketbase's_built-in_feature.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using PocketBase's Built-in Feature
**Description:**
1.  Enable the built-in email-based MFA feature within PocketBase's admin settings or configuration.
2.  Configure the email settings for PocketBase to ensure MFA emails are sent reliably (SMTP configuration).
3.  Encourage or enforce MFA for all user accounts, especially administrative accounts, through communication and potentially by making it mandatory for certain roles in PocketBase's admin UI.
4.  Provide clear instructions to users on how to enable and use MFA within their PocketBase account settings.
5.  Test the MFA workflow thoroughly to ensure it functions correctly and provides a smooth user experience.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Account Takeover via Password Compromise (High Severity):** Significantly reduces the risk of account takeover even if a password is compromised, as the attacker would also need access to the second factor (email in this case).
*   **Phishing Attacks (Medium Severity):** Adds an extra layer of protection against phishing attacks, as attackers would need to compromise both the password and the second factor.
**Impact:**
*   **Account Takeover via Password Compromise:** High reduction in risk.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Medium reduction in risk.
**Currently Implemented:** Yes, email-based MFA is enabled in PocketBase and encouraged for all users. Admin users are required to use MFA.
**Missing Implementation:** No integration with other MFA providers currently. Consider exploring if PocketBase's extensibility allows for custom MFA provider integrations if needed in the future.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limit API Requests using PocketBase Features or Hooks](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limit_api_requests_using_pocketbase_features_or_hooks.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limit API Requests using PocketBase Features or Hooks
**Description:**
1.  Check PocketBase documentation for any built-in rate limiting features for API endpoints. If available, configure these settings according to desired rate limits (e.g., requests per minute, per hour).
2.  If built-in rate limiting is insufficient or not available for specific endpoints, implement rate limiting using PocketBase hooks.
3.  In a PocketBase hook (e.g., `onBeforeServeRequest`), track request counts based on IP address or user authentication.
4.  If the request count exceeds a defined threshold within a time window, return an error response (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests) and prevent further processing of the request.
5.  Configure appropriate rate limits for different API endpoints based on their sensitivity and expected usage patterns.
6.  Log rate limiting events for monitoring and security analysis.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Brute-Force Password Attacks (High Severity):** Makes brute-force attacks against authentication endpoints slower and less effective.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity):** Can help mitigate some forms of DoS attacks that target API endpoints by limiting the request rate.
*   **API Abuse (Medium Severity):** Prevents excessive or abusive usage of API endpoints that could lead to performance degradation or resource exhaustion.
**Impact:**
*   **Brute-Force Password Attacks:** Medium to High reduction in risk (depending on rate limit configuration).
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Low to Medium reduction in risk (depending on the sophistication of the DoS attack and rate limits).
*   **API Abuse:** Medium reduction in risk.
**Currently Implemented:** No built-in rate limiting is actively configured within PocketBase itself. Rate limiting is currently handled by external middleware (e.g., Nginx or Node.js reverse proxy).
**Missing Implementation:** Explore PocketBase documentation for built-in rate limiting capabilities. If not available or insufficient, implement rate limiting logic within PocketBase hooks for more granular control and to avoid reliance on external components for this security feature.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization using PocketBase Schema and Hooks](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_using_pocketbase_schema_and_hooks.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization using PocketBase Schema and Hooks
**Description:**
1.  Define strict and comprehensive schemas for all PocketBase collections. Utilize schema validation rules provided by PocketBase (e.g., required fields, data types, regular expression patterns, minimum/maximum lengths/values).
2.  Leverage PocketBase's schema validation to automatically reject invalid data during API requests.
3.  Implement custom validation logic in PocketBase hooks (e.g., `onRecordBeforeCreate`, `onRecordBeforeUpdate`) for more complex validation rules that cannot be expressed through schema definitions alone.
4.  Sanitize user inputs within PocketBase hooks before storing them in the database. Use appropriate sanitization functions based on the data type and context (e.g., HTML escaping for text fields intended for web display).
5.  Ensure validation and sanitization are applied consistently across all API endpoints and data modification operations within PocketBase.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code through user inputs by validating and sanitizing data before database interaction.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of storing and displaying malicious scripts injected through user inputs by sanitizing output data.
*   **NoSQL Injection (Medium Severity):** Prevents injection attacks if using a NoSQL database with PocketBase in the future.
*   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from executing arbitrary commands on the server through user inputs (less likely in PocketBase context but good practice).
*   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Ensures data conforms to expected formats and prevents data corruption by enforcing schema validation.
**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** High reduction in risk.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Medium reduction in risk.
*   **NoSQL Injection:** Medium reduction in risk.
*   **Command Injection:** Low reduction in risk (context dependent).
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** High reduction in risk.
**Currently Implemented:** Yes, PocketBase schema validation is used for all collections. Basic sanitization is applied in some PocketBase hooks for specific fields.
**Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive input sanitization is not consistently applied across all API endpoints and hooks. Need to implement a more systematic approach to input sanitization within PocketBase hooks and potentially utilize a dedicated sanitization library within hooks if needed for complex sanitization tasks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update PocketBase Instance](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_pocketbase_instance.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update PocketBase Instance
**Description:**
1.  Monitor PocketBase's official release channels (GitHub releases, website, etc.) for new version announcements, especially security updates and patch releases.
2.  Subscribe to security mailing lists or notification services related to PocketBase (if available) to receive timely security advisories.
3.  Establish a scheduled process for regularly checking for PocketBase updates (e.g., monthly or after each release announcement).
4.  Before applying updates to the production environment, thoroughly test them in a staging or development environment to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions.
5.  Follow PocketBase's recommended update procedures and backup data before performing updates.
6.  Document the update process and maintain a log of applied updates and versions.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Patches known security vulnerabilities in PocketBase and its dependencies, preventing attackers from exploiting them.
*   **Zero-Day Attacks (Medium Severity):** While not directly preventing zero-day attacks, staying updated reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities before patches are available.
**Impact:**
*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High reduction in risk.
*   **Zero-Day Attacks:** Low to Medium reduction in risk (reduces exposure window).
**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We monitor PocketBase GitHub releases, but the update process is manual and not consistently scheduled.
**Missing Implementation:** Need to establish a more proactive and scheduled process for checking and applying PocketBase updates. Consider setting up automated notifications for new releases and security advisories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Review of Custom PocketBase Hooks and Actions](./mitigation_strategies/security_review_of_custom_pocketbase_hooks_and_actions.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Security Review of Custom PocketBase Hooks and Actions
**Description:**
1.  Implement a mandatory code review process for all custom PocketBase hooks and actions before they are deployed to production.
2.  Incorporate security considerations as a primary focus during code reviews. Reviewers should specifically look for potential vulnerabilities in custom code, such as input validation issues, insecure data handling, and authorization bypasses.
3.  Provide security training to developers specifically focused on secure coding practices within the context of PocketBase hooks and actions. Emphasize common vulnerabilities and how to avoid them in PocketBase's environment.
4.  Utilize static analysis tools (if available for the scripting language used in PocketBase hooks - likely JavaScript) to automatically scan custom hook code for potential security flaws.
5.  Periodically conduct penetration testing or security audits specifically targeting custom PocketBase hooks and actions to identify potential vulnerabilities in a live environment.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Vulnerabilities Introduced by Custom Code (High Severity):** Prevents developers from unintentionally introducing new security vulnerabilities through custom hooks and actions, which could bypass PocketBase's built-in security mechanisms.
*   **Logic Flaws in Custom Code (Medium Severity):** Identifies and corrects logic flaws in custom code that could be exploited for malicious purposes, leading to unintended data access or manipulation.
**Impact:**
*   **Vulnerabilities Introduced by Custom Code:** High reduction in risk.
*   **Logic Flaws in Custom Code:** Medium reduction in risk.
**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Code reviews are performed for most code changes, but security is not always a primary and consistently enforced focus in these reviews, especially for PocketBase hooks.
**Missing Implementation:** Formalize a security-focused code review process specifically for PocketBase hooks and actions. Develop security training materials for developers on secure PocketBase hook development. Explore and integrate static analysis tools into the development workflow for automated security checks of hook code.
