Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving PocketBase:

### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving PocketBase

*   **Threat:** Default Admin Credentials Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to log in using well-known default credentials (e.g., 'admin/password') that might be present after initial PocketBase setup if the administrator hasn't changed them. Upon successful login, the attacker gains full administrative privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Full administrative access to the PocketBase backend is compromised. The attacker can create, read, update, and delete any data, manage users and collections, modify settings, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server if plugin functionality is enabled and vulnerable.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Authentication Module, Admin API
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Weak Password Policy Leading to Brute-Force Attacks
    *   **Description:**  An attacker attempts to guess user passwords through repeated login attempts. If PocketBase's default password policy is weak (e.g., no minimum length, no complexity requirements), or if rate limiting within PocketBase is insufficient, this attack becomes more feasible.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially leading to data breaches, account takeover, and misuse of application features.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module, User Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Bypassing Record Rules due to Logic Errors
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts API requests that exploit vulnerabilities or logical flaws in the defined PocketBase record rules. This could allow them to bypass intended access controls and perform unauthorized actions on data (e.g., reading sensitive data, modifying records they shouldn't).
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of application integrity.
    *   **Affected Component:** Record Rules Engine, API Endpoints (Collections)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Session Hijacking due to Insecure Session Management
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or guesses a valid user session ID generated and managed by PocketBase. This could happen through network sniffing (if HTTPS is not enforced), or other means targeting PocketBase's session handling. With a valid session ID, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and application features, and the ability to perform actions on behalf of the compromised user.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module, Session Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Direct Database Access Vulnerabilities (if enabled/misconfigured within PocketBase)
    *   **Description:** If direct database access is enabled or misconfigured within PocketBase (e.g., exposed database port due to PocketBase configuration, weak database credentials managed by PocketBase), an attacker could bypass PocketBase's access controls and directly interact with the underlying SQLite database.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application's data, including the ability to read, modify, or delete any information. Potential for denial of service by corrupting the database.
    *   **Affected Component:** Database Interface, potentially the entire PocketBase instance if compromised.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Unrestricted File Upload Leading to Malicious File Execution
    *   **Description:** If PocketBase's file upload functionality is enabled without proper restrictions, an attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., server-side scripts, malware) to the PocketBase storage. If these files are then accessible and executable by the server or other users through PocketBase's file serving mechanisms, it could lead to severe consequences.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, compromise of other users' systems, defacement of the application, and potential data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** File Upload Functionality, Storage Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal in File Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths in requests handled by PocketBase to access files outside of the intended storage directory managed by PocketBase. This could allow them to read sensitive configuration files, application code, or other restricted resources on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potential for further exploitation based on the accessed files, and compromise of server security.
    *   **Affected Component:** File Serving Functionality, Storage Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Admin Interface
    *   **Description:** The PocketBase admin interface is accessible from the public internet without proper protection. This makes it a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing targeting the admin login, and exploitation of any vulnerabilities within the PocketBase admin interface code.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the entire PocketBase backend, allowing attackers to manage data, users, and settings.
    *   **Affected Component:** Admin Interface
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins
    *   **Description:** If the application uses PocketBase plugins, these plugins could contain malicious code or vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise the application or the server through the PocketBase plugin system.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, and other security issues depending on the plugin's functionality and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugins System, individual Plugin implementations
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or other secrets used by PocketBase is stored in PocketBase's configuration files (e.g., `.env`) and is exposed due to misconfiguration or insecure storage practices related to PocketBase's deployment.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to critical resources, potential for data breaches, and compromise of other connected systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration Loading, Environment Variable Handling
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
