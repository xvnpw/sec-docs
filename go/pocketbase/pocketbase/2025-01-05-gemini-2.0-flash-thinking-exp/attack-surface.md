# Attack Surface Analysis for pocketbase/pocketbase

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers circumventing the login process to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or the admin panel.
*   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase's built-in authentication mechanisms (email/password, OAuth2) and session management are the direct targets. Vulnerabilities in these implementations can lead to bypasses.
*   **Example:** A flaw in PocketBase's JWT verification allows an attacker to forge a valid token, granting them access without proper credentials.
*   **Impact:** Full access to user data, ability to perform actions as other users, potential compromise of the entire application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep PocketBase updated to the latest version to patch known authentication vulnerabilities.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for user accounts.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication where possible.
    *   Regularly review and audit PocketBase's authentication configuration.
    *   Avoid modifying PocketBase's core authentication logic unless absolutely necessary and with thorough security review.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary File Upload](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers uploading malicious files (e.g., scripts, executables) to the server through PocketBase's file storage functionality.
*   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase provides the API and storage mechanism for file uploads. Insecure configuration or lack of validation allows unrestricted uploads.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If the web server is not properly configured, this script could be executed, potentially leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, defacement of the application, serving malware to users, data exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate file types and extensions on the server-side using PocketBase's file upload settings or custom logic.
    *   Implement file size limits within PocketBase's configuration.
    *   Store uploaded files in a separate, non-executable directory (this might require server-level configuration in addition to PocketBase settings).
    *   Configure the web server to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directory.
    *   Consider using a dedicated object storage service instead of relying solely on PocketBase's built-in storage for sensitive uploads.

## Attack Surface: [Admin UI Exploits (XSS, CSRF, Authentication Bypass)](./attack_surfaces/admin_ui_exploits__xss__csrf__authentication_bypass_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within PocketBase's administrative interface to gain control over the application and its data.
*   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase provides the admin UI. Vulnerabilities within this UI directly expose the application's core management functions.
*   **Example:**
    *   **XSS:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a field in the admin UI, which is then executed in the browser of another administrator.
    *   **CSRF:** An attacker tricks an authenticated administrator into performing an unintended action, such as creating a new admin user.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** A vulnerability allows direct access to admin pages without proper login.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the PocketBase instance, including data manipulation, user management, and potentially server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep PocketBase updated to patch known admin UI vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS (this might require custom server configuration alongside PocketBase).
    *   Ensure CSRF protection mechanisms are enabled and functioning correctly within PocketBase.
    *   Restrict access to the admin UI to trusted networks or IP addresses (this is a server-level configuration).
    *   Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts.
    *   Regularly review admin user roles and permissions within PocketBase.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Hooks (if used)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_hooks__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced by developers implementing custom logic through PocketBase's hook system.
*   **How PocketBase Contributes:** PocketBase provides the framework for creating hooks. Insecurely written hook code directly impacts the application's security.
*   **Example:** A developer writes a `record.beforeCreate` hook that directly executes user-provided data as a database query without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection within PocketBase's context.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including data breaches, remote code execution (if the hook interacts with external systems), and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the hook's functionality and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices when writing custom hooks.
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs within hooks.
    *   Avoid direct execution of user-provided data in database queries or system commands within the hook logic.
    *   Implement proper authorization checks within hooks to prevent unauthorized actions.
    *   Conduct security code reviews of all custom hooks.
