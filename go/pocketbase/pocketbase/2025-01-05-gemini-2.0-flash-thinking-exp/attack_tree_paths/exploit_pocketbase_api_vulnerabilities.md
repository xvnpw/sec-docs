## Deep Analysis of PocketBase API Vulnerabilities Attack Tree Path

This analysis delves into the provided attack tree path, focusing on the potential vulnerabilities within a PocketBase application and offering insights for the development team to strengthen their security posture.

**OVERARCHING GOAL:** Exploit PocketBase API Vulnerabilities

This overarching goal highlights the attacker's focus on leveraging weaknesses in the application's API to achieve malicious objectives. The subsequent branches detail specific attack vectors within this broader goal.

**BRANCH 1: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (AND - CRITICAL NODE)**

This branch represents a **critical** security risk due to the potential for complete database compromise. SQL injection allows attackers to directly interact with the underlying database, bypassing application logic and security controls.

*   **Step 1: Identify API endpoints that interact with the database**

    *   **Analysis:** This is the reconnaissance phase. Attackers will analyze the PocketBase application's API documentation (if available), observe network traffic, and perform fuzzing to identify endpoints that likely interact with the database. This includes endpoints for:
        *   Creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in collections (CRUD operations).
        *   Filtering, sorting, and searching records.
        *   Potentially custom API routes defined by the developer.
    *   **PocketBase Specifics:**  Attackers will focus on endpoints that accept user-supplied input as parameters, especially those used in `pb.collection('your_collection').getFirstListItem(...)`, `pb.collection('your_collection').getFullList(...)`, `pb.collection('your_collection').update(...)`, `pb.collection('your_collection').delete(...)` and similar database interaction methods.
    *   **Attacker Techniques:**
        *   **Manual Inspection:** Reviewing API documentation, client-side code (if accessible), and error messages.
        *   **Traffic Analysis:** Using tools like Burp Suite or Wireshark to intercept and analyze API requests and responses.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Sending a large number of requests with various payloads to identify unexpected behavior or errors.
        *   **Code Review (if accessible):** Examining the server-side code to identify database interaction points.

*   **Step 2: Inject malicious SQL queries through input parameters to manipulate data or gain unauthorized access**

    *   **Analysis:** Once potential injection points are identified, attackers will craft malicious SQL queries and inject them through vulnerable input parameters. This can lead to various outcomes:
        *   **Data Breach:** Extracting sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, and business secrets.
        *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data, potentially disrupting application functionality or causing financial loss.
        *   **Authentication Bypass:** Circumventing login mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the application.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (in some cases):**  While less common with SQLite (the default database for PocketBase), certain configurations or extensions could potentially allow for this.
    *   **PocketBase Specifics:**  Since PocketBase uses SQLite by default, attackers will focus on SQLite-specific syntax. Common injection techniques include:
        *   **Union-based injection:** Combining the original query with a malicious query using `UNION`.
        *   **Boolean-based blind injection:** Inferring information based on the truthiness of injected conditions.
        *   **Time-based blind injection:** Observing delays caused by injected SQL functions like `SLEEP()`.
        *   **Error-based injection:** Triggering database errors to leak information.
    *   **Example Payloads (Illustrative):**
        *   **Filtering:**  `?filter=(username='admin'--)`  (commenting out the rest of the original query)
        *   **Union:** `?filter=(id=1) UNION SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master --` (attempting to retrieve database schema)
        *   **Update:**  Sending a crafted PUT/PATCH request to an update endpoint with a payload like `{"email": "attacker@example.com' WHERE id=1 --"}` (potentially changing another user's email).
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application's data and potentially the server itself. Loss of trust, legal repercussions, and significant financial damage.

**BRANCH 2: Exploit Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (AND - HIGH-RISK PATH)**

This branch represents a **high-risk** vulnerability that can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of data belonging to other users.

*   **Step 1: Identify API endpoints that access resources based on IDs**

    *   **Analysis:** Attackers look for API endpoints that use predictable or sequential IDs to access resources. Common patterns include:
        *   `GET /api/collections/posts/records/123` (accessing a specific post by its ID)
        *   `PUT /api/collections/users/records/456` (updating a specific user's information)
        *   `DELETE /api/collections/comments/records/789` (deleting a specific comment)
    *   **PocketBase Specifics:**  PocketBase's API heavily relies on record IDs for accessing and manipulating data within collections. Attackers will target endpoints following the `/api/collections/{collection_name}/records/{record_id}` pattern.
    *   **Attacker Techniques:**
        *   **Manual Enumeration:** Incrementing or decrementing IDs in API requests to see if they can access other users' resources.
        *   **Brute-forcing:**  Trying a range of IDs.
        *   **Information Leakage:**  Observing IDs in URLs or other parts of the application.
        *   **Social Engineering:**  Potentially obtaining valid IDs from other users.

*   **Step 2: Manipulate resource IDs to access or modify resources belonging to other users**

    *   **Analysis:** Once vulnerable endpoints are identified, attackers will change the resource ID in the API request to target resources belonging to other users.
    *   **PocketBase Specifics:**  By changing the `{record_id}` in the API request, an attacker can attempt to:
        *   **View sensitive information:** Access records that should not be accessible to them.
        *   **Modify data:** Update records belonging to other users, potentially changing their passwords, personal information, or other critical data.
        *   **Delete data:** Delete records belonging to other users, causing data loss or disruption.
    *   **Example Scenarios:**
        *   An attacker changes the `record_id` in a `GET /api/collections/users/records/{user_id}` request to view another user's profile.
        *   An attacker changes the `record_id` in a `PUT /api/collections/posts/records/{post_id}` request to edit a post they don't own.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, and potential account takeover. Damage to user trust and application reputation.

**BRANCH 3: Exploit Insecure File Upload Functionality (AND - HIGH-RISK PATH - CRITICAL NODE)**

This branch represents a **critical** security risk, especially when combined with the potential for remote code execution.

*   **Step 1: Identify file upload endpoints**

    *   **Analysis:** Attackers will look for API endpoints that allow users to upload files. This might be for profile pictures, document attachments, or other purposes.
    *   **PocketBase Specifics:**  PocketBase allows file uploads to collection records. Attackers will target endpoints that handle file uploads, often associated with `multipart/form-data` requests. They might look for endpoints related to creating or updating records with file fields.
    *   **Attacker Techniques:**
        *   **API Documentation Review:** Checking for endpoints explicitly designed for file uploads.
        *   **Traffic Analysis:** Identifying requests with `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Sending requests with various file types and sizes to different endpoints.
        *   **Observing Application Functionality:**  Identifying features that involve uploading files.

*   **Step 2: Upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) to gain remote code execution**

    *   **Analysis:** The core of this attack is to upload a file that, when accessed by the server, will execute arbitrary code. A common example is a web shell, which is a script (e.g., PHP, Python, etc.) that allows the attacker to send commands to the server.
    *   **PocketBase Specifics:** The success of this attack depends on several factors:
        *   **File Storage Location:** Where are uploaded files stored? If they are stored within the web server's document root and are directly accessible, the attack is more likely to succeed.
        *   **Server-Side Execution:** Can the web server execute the uploaded file? This depends on the server configuration and the file type. While PocketBase itself doesn't directly execute arbitrary code from uploads, if the uploaded file is accessible via the web server (e.g., if PocketBase is served behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache), the web server might attempt to execute it if it's a supported type (like PHP if PHP is installed).
        *   **Filename Handling:** Are filenames sanitized? Can an attacker control the filename to include executable extensions (e.g., `.php`, `.jsp`, `.py`)?
        *   **Content-Type Handling:** Is the `Content-Type` of the uploaded file properly validated? Attackers might try to upload a malicious script with a disguised `Content-Type`.
    *   **Example Scenario:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell named `evil.php` to a file upload endpoint. If this file is stored within the web server's accessible directory, the attacker can then access `https://your-pocketbase-app.com/uploads/evil.php` and execute commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to:
        *   Execute arbitrary commands.
        *   Install malware.
        *   Steal sensitive data.
        *   Pivot to other systems on the network.
        *   Disrupt application availability.

**General Mitigation Strategies for the Entire Attack Tree Path:**

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs on the server-side to prevent SQL injection and other injection attacks. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.
*   **Authorization and Access Control:** Implement robust authorization mechanisms to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to. Avoid relying on predictable IDs for resource access. Use UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers.
*   **Secure File Upload Handling:**
    *   Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root.
    *   Generate unique and unpredictable filenames.
    *   Scan uploaded files for malware.
    *   Restrict allowed file types.
    *   Properly configure the web server to prevent execution of uploaded files.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.
*   **Keep PocketBase and Dependencies Updated:**  Ensure PocketBase and its dependencies are updated to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and applications.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to filter out malicious traffic and protect against common web attacks.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement CSP to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can sometimes be a precursor to other attacks.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on API endpoints.

**Conclusion:**

This attack tree path highlights critical vulnerabilities that can significantly impact the security of a PocketBase application. By understanding these attack vectors and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of successful exploitation and build a more secure application. The "CRITICAL NODE" designations for SQL Injection and Insecure File Upload emphasize the immediate need to prioritize addressing these specific vulnerabilities due to their potential for widespread and severe damage. The "HIGH-RISK PATH" designation for IDOR indicates a serious concern that needs to be addressed to protect user data and privacy.
