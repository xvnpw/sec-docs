## Deep Analysis: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in PocketBase Application

This analysis delves into the "Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities" path within the attack tree for a PocketBase application. We will break down each step, explore potential attack vectors specific to PocketBase, and discuss mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Context: PocketBase and SQL Injection**

PocketBase is a Go-based backend framework that utilizes a SQLite database. While SQLite is generally considered robust, vulnerabilities can arise when user-provided input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This creates opportunities for SQL injection attacks.

**ATTACK TREE PATH ANALYSIS:**

**Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**

*   **Step 1: Identify API endpoints that interact with the database**

    *   **Goal:** The attacker's initial goal is to map the application's API and pinpoint endpoints that directly interact with the underlying SQLite database. These endpoints are potential entry points for injecting malicious SQL.

    *   **PocketBase Specific Considerations:**
        *   **Collection CRUD Operations:** PocketBase heavily relies on collections for data management. Endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records within these collections are prime targets. Examples include:
            *   `POST /api/collections/{collection}/records` (Create)
            *   `GET /api/collections/{collection}/records` (List/Filter)
            *   `GET /api/collections/{collection}/records/{id}` (Retrieve)
            *   `PATCH /api/collections/{collection}/records/{id}` (Update)
            *   `DELETE /api/collections/{collection}/records/{id}` (Delete)
        *   **Authentication Endpoints:**  Endpoints related to user authentication (e.g., login, registration) might involve database queries to verify credentials.
            *   `POST /api/collections/users/auth-with-password`
            *   `POST /api/collections/users/auth-with-oauth2`
        *   **Filtering and Searching:**  Endpoints that allow users to filter or search data within collections are particularly vulnerable if user-supplied filter criteria are not properly handled. The `filter` query parameter in list endpoints is a key area to investigate.
        *   **Custom API Rules and Hooks:** If the application utilizes custom API rules or record hooks, these could potentially execute SQL queries based on user input, creating injection points.
        *   **Realtime Subscriptions:** While less direct, vulnerabilities in how realtime subscriptions filter data could potentially be exploited if they involve dynamic SQL generation based on client requests.

    *   **Attacker Techniques:**
        *   **API Documentation Review:** If available, the attacker will study the API documentation to understand available endpoints and their parameters.
        *   **Traffic Interception (Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP):**  Intercepting and analyzing network traffic between the client and the PocketBase backend to identify API calls and their parameters.
        *   **Code Analysis (if accessible):** If the application's frontend or parts of the backend code are accessible, the attacker will analyze them to understand how API calls are constructed and which parameters are used.
        *   **Fuzzing:**  Sending various requests with different parameter values to identify endpoints that interact with the database and potentially trigger errors or unexpected behavior.

*   **Step 2: Inject malicious SQL queries through input parameters to manipulate data or gain unauthorized access**

    *   **Goal:** Once vulnerable endpoints are identified, the attacker attempts to inject malicious SQL code within the input parameters of these requests. The goal is to manipulate the database, bypass security measures, or extract sensitive information.

    *   **PocketBase Specific Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Filtering Parameters (GET /api/collections/{collection}/records):**
            *   **Classic SQL Injection:** Injecting SQL keywords and operators into the `filter` parameter. For example:
                *   `filter=username='admin'--` (commenting out the rest of the query)
                *   `filter=1=1` (always true condition to retrieve all records)
                *   `filter=username='test' OR 1=1` (bypassing authentication checks)
                *   `filter=username='test' UNION SELECT password FROM users WHERE id=1` (attempting to extract password)
            *   **Blind SQL Injection:** If direct error messages are suppressed, the attacker might use techniques like time-based or boolean-based blind SQL injection to infer information about the database structure and data. For example, injecting conditions that cause delays or different responses based on the truthiness of a SQL statement.
        *   **Data Input Fields (POST/PATCH /api/collections/{collection}/records):**
            *   Injecting malicious SQL within fields intended for data input. While PocketBase likely sanitizes input to some extent, vulnerabilities can arise if specific fields are not properly handled.
            *   Example: In a `PATCH` request to update a user's profile, injecting `'; DROP TABLE users; --` into a text field could potentially lead to data loss if not properly escaped.
        *   **Authentication Parameters (POST /api/collections/users/auth-with-password):**
            *   Attempting to bypass authentication by injecting SQL into the username or password fields. While likely well-protected, vulnerabilities in custom authentication logic could exist.
            *   Example: `username=' or '1'='1` and any password.
        *   **Sorting and Ordering Parameters (GET /api/collections/{collection}/records):**
            *   While less common, vulnerabilities could exist if the `sort` parameter is not properly sanitized and allows for arbitrary SQL injection.

    *   **Potential Impacts of Successful SQL Injection:**
        *   **Data Breach:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, personal information, and business data.
        *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
        *   **Authentication Bypass:** Gaining unauthorized access to user accounts or administrative privileges.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Injecting queries that consume excessive resources, causing the application to become slow or unresponsive.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (Less likely with SQLite):** While less common with SQLite compared to other database systems, in specific and unlikely scenarios involving enabled SQLite extensions, remote code execution might be possible.

**Mitigation Strategies for PocketBase Applications:**

To effectively defend against SQL injection vulnerabilities in PocketBase applications, the following strategies are crucial:

*   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the **most effective** defense. Instead of directly embedding user input into SQL queries, use placeholders that are later filled with the user-provided values. This prevents the database from interpreting the input as executable SQL code. PocketBase's Go SDK and underlying database drivers should be used to implement parameterized queries.
    *   **Example (Conceptual Go code):**
        ```go
        // Vulnerable:
        // query := fmt.Sprintf("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '%s'", username)
        // db.Query(query)

        // Secure:
        query := "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
        db.Query(query, username)
        ```
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate all user input on the server-side before using it in database queries. This includes:
    *   **Type checking:** Ensure the input matches the expected data type.
    *   **Length limitations:** Restrict the length of input fields.
    *   **Whitelisting:** Define allowed characters or patterns for input fields.
    *   **Escaping:** Escape special characters that could be used in SQL injection attacks. However, relying solely on escaping is less secure than parameterized queries.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the database user used by the PocketBase application only the necessary permissions. Avoid using a database user with full administrative privileges.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep PocketBase and its dependencies (including the Go runtime and SQLite library) up to date. Security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer versions.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to filter out malicious requests, including those that contain potential SQL injection attempts.
*   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration tests to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application's code and infrastructure.
*   **Error Handling:** Avoid displaying detailed database error messages to the user, as these can provide valuable information to attackers. Log errors securely for debugging purposes.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly preventing SQL injection, CSP can help mitigate the impact of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can sometimes be combined with SQL injection techniques.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Educate developers on secure coding practices and the risks of SQL injection.

**Conclusion:**

Exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in a PocketBase application is a serious threat that can lead to significant consequences. By understanding the potential attack vectors specific to PocketBase's architecture and API, and by implementing robust mitigation strategies like parameterized queries and input validation, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of successful SQL injection attacks. Continuous vigilance, regular security assessments, and adherence to secure coding practices are essential for maintaining the security of PocketBase applications.
