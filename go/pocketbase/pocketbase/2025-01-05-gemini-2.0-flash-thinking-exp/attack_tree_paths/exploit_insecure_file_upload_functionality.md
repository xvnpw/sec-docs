---

**Detailed Analysis of Each Step:**

**Step 1: Identify file upload endpoints**

*   **Attacker's Goal:** Discover any accessible routes or functionalities within the PocketBase application that allow file uploads.

*   **Attacker's Tactics:**
    * **Manual Exploration:**  Navigating the application's user interface, looking for buttons, forms, or features that suggest file uploads (e.g., profile picture updates, document uploads, media uploads).
    * **Web Developer Tools:** Inspecting network requests in the browser's developer tools while interacting with the application to identify API endpoints used for file uploads.
    * **Directory Brute-forcing/Fuzzing:** Using tools to guess common file upload endpoint paths (e.g., `/upload`, `/api/upload`, `/admin/upload`).
    * **API Documentation Review:** If available, scrutinizing the application's API documentation for any file upload related endpoints and their expected parameters.
    * **Code Review (if accessible):**  If the attacker has access to the application's codebase (e.g., open-source or leaked code), they can directly identify the relevant routes and handlers.
    * **Error Message Analysis:** Triggering errors within the application related to file uploads to potentially reveal endpoint information.
    * **Social Engineering:**  Attempting to glean information about file upload functionalities from developers or users.

*   **Potential Vulnerabilities in PocketBase Context:**
    * **Unprotected Admin Panel Endpoints:** If the PocketBase admin panel or specific collection management endpoints are not properly secured (e.g., missing authentication or authorization checks), attackers could potentially upload files through these interfaces.
    * **Publicly Accessible API Endpoints:**  If API endpoints designed for file uploads lack proper authentication or authorization, anyone could potentially access and utilize them.
    * **Misconfigured Collection Permissions:**  PocketBase's collection rules might be misconfigured, allowing unauthenticated or unauthorized users to create records with file fields.
    * **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  Without rate limiting on file upload endpoints, attackers could potentially bombard the server with requests, aiding in the discovery process or even leading to denial-of-service.

*   **Mitigation Strategies for Development Team:**
    * **Secure Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all file upload endpoints, ensuring only authorized users can access them. Utilize PocketBase's built-in authentication features and define granular collection rules.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions for file uploads. Avoid overly permissive access controls.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While this step focuses on *identifying* endpoints, it's crucial to remember that all data received by these endpoints must be validated and sanitized in the next step.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in endpoint security.
    * **Proper API Documentation:** If providing API documentation, ensure it clearly outlines authentication requirements and security considerations for file upload endpoints.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on file upload endpoints to prevent brute-force attempts and resource exhaustion.
    * **Secure Admin Panel Access:**  Ensure strong credentials and multi-factor authentication are enabled for the PocketBase admin panel. Restrict access to authorized personnel only.

**Step 2: Upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) to gain remote code execution**

*   **Attacker's Goal:** Execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the PocketBase application by uploading a malicious file that can be accessed and interpreted by the server.

*   **Attacker's Tactics:**
    * **Web Shell Upload:** Uploading scripts (e.g., PHP, Python, Perl) disguised as legitimate files (e.g., images, documents) that contain code allowing remote command execution.
    * **Filename Manipulation:**  Using filenames with double extensions (e.g., `malicious.php.jpg`) or other techniques to bypass basic file type checks.
    * **MIME Type Spoofing:**  Manipulating the `Content-Type` header in the HTTP request to trick the server into believing the uploaded file is of a safe type.
    * **Content Obfuscation:**  Obfuscating the malicious code within the uploaded file to evade simple signature-based detection.
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in File Processing Libraries:**  If the application uses external libraries for image processing or other file manipulations, attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in those libraries through crafted malicious files.
    * **Overwriting Existing Files (if allowed):**  In some cases, attackers might attempt to overwrite existing legitimate files with malicious content.

*   **Potential Vulnerabilities in PocketBase Context:**
    * **Lack of File Type Validation:**  If the application doesn't properly validate the content and type of uploaded files, malicious scripts can be uploaded. Relying solely on file extensions is insufficient.
    * **Insufficient Content Security Policy (CSP):**  A weak or missing CSP can allow the execution of malicious scripts if they are served from the same origin as the application.
    * **Insecure File Storage:**  If uploaded files are stored in a publicly accessible directory without proper access controls, attackers can directly access and execute them.
    * **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  If the application doesn't sanitize filenames, attackers could potentially inject malicious characters that could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities or other issues.
    * **Executable Permissions on Upload Directory:**  If the directory where uploaded files are stored has execute permissions, the web server might execute uploaded scripts.
    * **Vulnerabilities in PocketBase's File Handling:** While PocketBase aims for security, potential vulnerabilities in its file handling logic could be exploited. Keeping PocketBase updated is crucial.

*   **Mitigation Strategies for Development Team:**
    * **Robust File Type Validation:** Implement server-side validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just file extensions. Utilize libraries that can accurately identify file types.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to prevent the execution of untrusted scripts.
    * **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files outside of the web server's document root and ensure they are not directly accessible via HTTP. Use unique, unpredictable filenames to further obscure them.
    * **Input Sanitization for Filenames:** Sanitize filenames to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
    * **Disable Execution Permissions:** Ensure that the directory where uploaded files are stored does not have execute permissions for the web server user.
    * **Regular Updates:** Keep PocketBase and all its dependencies updated to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
    * **Antivirus/Malware Scanning:**  Integrate antivirus or malware scanning of uploaded files before they are stored.
    * **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Consider using sandboxing techniques to isolate the file upload process and limit the potential impact of malicious files.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Specifically target file upload functionality during security assessments.
