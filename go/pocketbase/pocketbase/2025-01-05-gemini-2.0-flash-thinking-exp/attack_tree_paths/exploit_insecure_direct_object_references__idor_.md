## Deep Analysis: Exploit Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in a PocketBase Application

As a cybersecurity expert working with the development team, let's delve into the attack tree path "Exploit Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)" within the context of a PocketBase application. This analysis will break down each step, highlight potential vulnerabilities within PocketBase, and provide actionable insights for mitigation.

**Understanding Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**

IDOR is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application exposes an internal implementation object, such as a file or database record, through a direct reference (often a numeric ID) in a URL or API parameter without proper authorization checks. Attackers can manipulate these references to access or modify resources belonging to other users, leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and privilege escalation.

**Analyzing the Attack Tree Path:**

**ATTACK TREE PATH: Exploit Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**

*   **Step 1: Identify API endpoints that access resources based on IDs**
*   **Step 2: Manipulate resource IDs to access or modify resources belonging to other users**

Let's break down each step in the context of a PocketBase application:

**Step 1: Identify API endpoints that access resources based on IDs**

PocketBase, being a backend as an executable, primarily exposes its functionality through a REST API. Identifying potential IDOR vulnerabilities starts with understanding which API endpoints utilize resource IDs. Here are common areas within a PocketBase application where this might occur:

*   **Record Management Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /api/collections/{collection}/records/{id}`: Retrieving a specific record from a collection. The `{id}` parameter is a prime target for IDOR.
    *   `PATCH /api/collections/{collection}/records/{id}`: Updating a specific record. Manipulating the `{id}` could allow modification of other users' records.
    *   `DELETE /api/collections/{collection}/records/{id}`: Deleting a specific record. Similar to `PATCH`, this could lead to unauthorized deletion.
*   **User Management Endpoints (if exposed beyond the admin panel):**
    *   `GET /api/collections/users/records/{id}`: Retrieving user profile information.
    *   `PATCH /api/collections/users/records/{id}`: Updating user profile information.
*   **File Management (within Record Data):**
    *   While not directly exposed as separate endpoints with IDs, file names or references within record data could be vulnerable if not properly handled server-side. If file access is based on a predictable path derived from a user or record ID, it could be considered a form of IDOR.
*   **Relation Fields:**
    *   If records in one collection reference records in another collection using IDs, manipulating these IDs during creation or updates could lead to unauthorized linking or access.

**How an attacker might identify these endpoints:**

*   **API Documentation Review:**  If the development team has provided API documentation, attackers will scrutinize it for endpoints using resource IDs.
*   **Traffic Analysis:**  Using tools like Burp Suite or Wireshark, attackers can intercept and analyze the application's network traffic to identify API calls and the parameters being passed, including resource IDs.
*   **Code Review (if accessible):**  If the application's frontend or backend code is accessible, attackers can directly examine the codebase to find API calls and how resource IDs are handled.
*   **Fuzzing:**  Attackers can use automated tools to send various requests to the API, including those with manipulated IDs, to observe the application's responses and identify potential vulnerabilities.

**Step 2: Manipulate resource IDs to access or modify resources belonging to other users**

Once potential endpoints are identified, the attacker's goal is to manipulate the resource IDs to gain unauthorized access. This involves understanding how IDs are generated and attempting to access resources they shouldn't be able to.

**Common ID Manipulation Techniques:**

*   **Sequential/Predictable IDs:** If IDs are generated sequentially (e.g., incrementing integers), attackers can easily predict the IDs of other users' resources by simply incrementing or decrementing the ID they currently have access to.
*   **Brute-Force:** If the ID space is relatively small or predictable, attackers might attempt to brute-force different ID values to find valid resources.
*   **Information Leakage:**  Sometimes, applications might inadvertently leak information about resource IDs through error messages or other responses.
*   **Guessing:** In some cases, attackers might make educated guesses about ID formats or patterns.

**Impact of Successful IDOR in a PocketBase Application:**

*   **Data Breach:** Accessing and viewing sensitive data belonging to other users, such as personal information, private messages, or confidential files.
*   **Data Modification:**  Modifying or deleting data belonging to other users, leading to data corruption, loss of functionality, or reputational damage.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In scenarios where user roles or permissions are tied to specific records, manipulating IDs could potentially allow an attacker to gain access to administrative functions or resources they shouldn't have.
*   **Account Takeover:** In extreme cases, manipulating user IDs could allow an attacker to modify another user's credentials or profile information, leading to account takeover.

**Potential Vulnerabilities within PocketBase that could exacerbate IDOR:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:**  The most critical vulnerability. If the backend doesn't properly verify if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access or modify the resource identified by the provided ID, IDOR becomes exploitable.
*   **Reliance on Client-Side Filtering:**  If the application relies solely on the frontend to filter data based on user IDs, an attacker can bypass these checks by directly manipulating the API requests.
*   **Lack of Proper Input Validation:**  While not directly causing IDOR, inadequate input validation on the ID parameter could lead to unexpected behavior or make exploitation easier.
*   **Default Permissions:**  If PocketBase collections are created with overly permissive default read/write permissions, it increases the potential impact of IDOR vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation Strategies for IDOR in PocketBase Applications:**

*   **Implement Robust Authorization Checks:**  **This is paramount.**  Every API endpoint that accesses resources based on IDs must verify that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action on that specific resource. PocketBase's [Record Rules](https://pocketbase.io/docs/record-rules/) feature is crucial for implementing fine-grained access control.
*   **Avoid Exposing Direct Object References:**  Consider using indirect references or UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) instead of sequential integer IDs. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to predict or guess valid resource identifiers.
*   **Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  For more complex scenarios, use ACLs to define granular permissions for individual resources or groups of resources.
*   **Use Parameterized Queries:**  When interacting with the database, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, which could potentially be chained with IDOR attacks.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent brute-force attempts on resource IDs.
*   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential IDOR vulnerabilities.
*   **Educate Developers:** Ensure the development team understands the risks associated with IDOR and how to implement secure coding practices to prevent it.
*   **Leverage PocketBase's Security Features:** Utilize PocketBase's built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms effectively. Configure record rules appropriately to restrict access based on user roles and relationships.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a direct mitigation for IDOR, properly validating and sanitizing input, including resource IDs, can prevent other types of attacks and improve overall security.

**Specific Considerations for PocketBase:**

*   **Record Rules are Key:**  Thoroughly define and test record rules for each collection to control who can read, create, update, and delete records. Focus on rules that restrict access based on the authenticated user's ID or role.
*   **Admin vs. Public API:**  Be mindful of the permissions granted to the public API versus the admin API. Ensure sensitive operations are only accessible through the admin API with proper authentication.
*   **File Handling:**  When dealing with file uploads, ensure that file access is not solely based on predictable file names or paths derived from user or record IDs. Implement secure file storage and access mechanisms.

**Example Attack Scenario:**

Imagine a PocketBase application with a "Posts" collection where each post has an auto-incrementing `id`. A logged-in user, Alice, creates a post with `id: 123`.

1. **Identification:** An attacker, Bob, intercepts Alice's request to view her post: `GET /api/collections/posts/records/123`.
2. **Manipulation:** Bob guesses that other posts might have sequential IDs. He changes the `id` in the request to `124` and sends: `GET /api/collections/posts/records/124`.
3. **Exploitation (if vulnerable):** If the backend doesn't properly verify if Bob has permission to view post `124`, he might be able to access a post belonging to another user, even if he shouldn't.

**Tools for Identifying IDOR Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Burp Suite:** A popular web security testing tool that allows intercepting and manipulating HTTP requests.
*   **OWASP ZAP:** Another free and open-source web security scanner.
*   **Manual Testing:** Carefully reviewing API endpoints and attempting to access resources with manipulated IDs.

**Conclusion:**

Exploiting Insecure Direct Object References is a significant risk in web applications, including those built with PocketBase. By understanding how this attack works and implementing robust mitigation strategies, particularly through the effective use of PocketBase's record rules and proper authorization checks, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful IDOR attacks and protect sensitive user data. A proactive and security-conscious approach is crucial throughout the development lifecycle to prevent and address these vulnerabilities.
