### **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Default Admin Credentials**

This attack path targets a fundamental security lapse: failing to change default administrative credentials.

**Step 1: Attempt to access the admin panel (e.g., `/admin`)**

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to access the administrative interface of the PocketBase application. The standard path for this is `/admin`.
*   **Technical Details:** This involves sending an HTTP GET request to the `/admin` endpoint. If the application is running and the admin interface is enabled (default), it will likely present a login form.
*   **Impact:**  Low on its own. Accessing the login form doesn't grant access. However, it confirms the existence of the admin panel and sets the stage for the next step.
*   **Likelihood:** High. The `/admin` path is well-known and easily discoverable. Automated scanners and malicious actors commonly probe for this.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rename the Admin Panel Path:** While not a foolproof solution, changing the default `/admin` path to a less predictable one (e.g., `/secure-admin-panel-xyz`) adds a layer of obscurity. This should be considered a defense-in-depth measure, not the primary solution.
    *   **Implement Strong Authentication on the Admin Panel:**  Ensure that even if the path is known, strong authentication mechanisms (beyond just username/password) are in place. This includes measures to prevent brute-force attacks (rate limiting, account lockout).
    *   **Disable the Admin Panel in Production (If Feasible):** If administrative tasks can be performed through other means (e.g., CLI, API with strong authentication), consider disabling the web-based admin panel in production environments to eliminate this attack vector entirely.
*   **Detection Strategies:**
    *   **Monitor Access Logs:**  Track requests to the `/admin` path (or the renamed path). A large number of requests from a single IP address could indicate a reconnaissance or brute-force attempt.
    *   **Implement Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Configure IDS/IPS to alert on or block access attempts to the administrative interface from unauthorized sources.

**Step 2: Try default credentials (if not changed)**

*   **Description:**  Once the login form is presented, the attacker attempts to log in using the default PocketBase administrator credentials.
*   **Technical Details:**  The attacker will typically try common default username/password combinations. While PocketBase doesn't have a hardcoded default in the traditional sense, users often fail to set a strong password during the initial setup or use easily guessable credentials like "admin/admin", "root/password", etc.
*   **Impact:** **CRITICAL**. Successful login with default credentials grants full administrative control over the PocketBase instance and all its data. This allows the attacker to:
    *   Access, modify, or delete any data stored in PocketBase.
    *   Create, modify, or delete users and collections.
    *   Change application settings and configurations.
    *   Potentially pivot to other systems if the PocketBase instance has network access.
*   **Likelihood:**  High, especially for newly deployed or poorly managed instances. Many users neglect to change default credentials immediately.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Force Password Change on First Login:**  The most effective mitigation is to *force* the administrator to change the default password immediately upon the first login. PocketBase provides mechanisms to achieve this.
    *   **Strong Password Policy:** Enforce a strong password policy requiring a minimum length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and prevent the use of common passwords.
    *   **Clear Documentation and Prompts:**  Provide clear and prominent instructions during the setup process emphasizing the importance of changing the default password.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodically review user accounts and password strength to identify and address potential weaknesses.
*   **Detection Strategies:**
    *   **Monitor Login Attempts:**  Log all login attempts to the admin panel, including timestamps, usernames, and source IP addresses. Failed login attempts with common default usernames should raise immediate suspicion.
    *   **Alert on Successful Login with Default Credentials:** If possible, detect and alert on successful logins using known default credentials (even if the user changed it to something weak). This requires maintaining a list of common default passwords.
    *   **Implement Account Lockout:**  After a certain number of failed login attempts, lock the administrator account to prevent brute-force attacks.

### **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Insecure Password Reset Mechanism**

This attack path targets vulnerabilities in the password reset functionality, a common feature in web applications.

**Step 1: Trigger the password reset process for a target account**

*   **Description:** The attacker initiates the password reset process for a specific user account they wish to compromise.
*   **Technical Details:** This typically involves navigating to a "Forgot Password" or similar page and providing the target user's email address or username. The application then sends a password reset link or token to the associated email address.
*   **Impact:** Low on its own. Triggering the reset process doesn't grant access but indicates the existence of the account and initiates the vulnerable process. Excessive reset requests could potentially cause denial-of-service or spam the user.
*   **Likelihood:** High. Password reset functionalities are standard and easily accessible.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the password reset endpoint to prevent attackers from repeatedly triggering the process for multiple accounts or the same account.
    *   **CAPTCHA/Challenge-Response:** Implement CAPTCHA or other challenge-response mechanisms to prevent automated bots from triggering password resets.
*   **Detection Strategies:**
    *   **Monitor Password Reset Requests:** Track the number of password reset requests originating from the same IP address or targeting the same user account within a short timeframe. Unusual patterns should trigger alerts.
    *   **Alert on Multiple Reset Requests for the Same Account:**  Notify the user if multiple password reset requests are initiated for their account within a short period.

**Step 2: Intercept or manipulate the reset token/link to gain unauthorized access**

*   **Description:**  The attacker attempts to gain control of the password reset token or link before the legitimate user can use it, or tries to manipulate it to gain access without the legitimate user's involvement.
*   **Technical Details:** This step involves exploiting weaknesses in how the password reset mechanism is implemented. Common vulnerabilities include:
    *   **Insecure Token Generation:**  The reset token is predictable or easily guessable (e.g., sequential numbers, timestamps without sufficient entropy).
    *   **Token Leakage:** The token is transmitted insecurely (e.g., over unencrypted HTTP).
    *   **Token Replay:** The token can be used multiple times.
    *   **Lack of Token Expiration:** The token remains valid for an excessively long period, increasing the window of opportunity for interception.
    *   **Account Enumeration:** The password reset process reveals whether an account exists based on the response (e.g., different messages for valid vs. invalid email).
    *   **Token Manipulation:** The token can be modified (e.g., changing a user ID within the token) to gain access to a different account.
    *   **Lack of Proper Validation:** The application doesn't properly validate the token before allowing a password reset.
*   **Impact:** **HIGH**. Successful exploitation grants the attacker unauthorized access to the target user's account, allowing them to:
    *   Access sensitive data associated with the account.
    *   Perform actions as the compromised user.
    *   Potentially escalate privileges if the compromised account has elevated permissions.
*   **Likelihood:**  Varies depending on the security of the password reset implementation. Poorly designed systems are highly vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Generate Cryptographically Secure Random Tokens:**  Use strong, unpredictable random number generators to create reset tokens. Ensure sufficient entropy.
    *   **Transmit Tokens Securely (HTTPS):**  Always transmit password reset links and tokens over HTTPS to prevent interception through man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Implement Token Expiration:**  Set a short expiration time for password reset tokens (e.g., 15-30 minutes).
    *   **One-Time Use Tokens:**  Ensure that each reset token can only be used once.
    *   **Secure Token Storage (If Applicable):** If tokens are stored server-side, encrypt them securely.
    *   **Proper Token Validation:**  Thoroughly validate the token upon use, checking its authenticity, expiration, and one-time use status.
    *   **Avoid Account Enumeration:**  Provide consistent responses regardless of whether the email address exists in the system (e.g., "If an account with that email exists, a reset link has been sent").
    *   **Consider Alternative Verification Methods:**  Explore alternative password reset methods like security questions, phone number verification, or out-of-band authentication for added security.
*   **Detection Strategies:**
    *   **Monitor Token Usage:** Track the usage of password reset tokens. Alert on multiple attempts to use the same token or attempts to use expired tokens.
    *   **Detect Suspicious Password Changes:**  Monitor for password changes initiated through the reset mechanism that deviate from normal user behavior (e.g., password changed immediately after a reset request).
    *   **Log Token Generation and Usage:**  Maintain detailed logs of when reset tokens are generated, sent, and used (or fail to be used).
