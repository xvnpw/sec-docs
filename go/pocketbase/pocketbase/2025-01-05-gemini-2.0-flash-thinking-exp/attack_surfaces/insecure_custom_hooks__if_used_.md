## Deep Dive Analysis: Insecure Custom Hooks in PocketBase

This analysis delves into the attack surface presented by "Insecure Custom Hooks" within a PocketBase application. We will explore the mechanics, potential vulnerabilities, impacts, and mitigation strategies in detail.

**Understanding the Attack Surface: Insecure Custom Hooks**

The ability to define custom logic through hooks is a powerful feature of PocketBase, allowing developers to extend its functionality and tailor it to specific application needs. However, this flexibility introduces a significant attack surface if not handled securely. Essentially, the security of these custom hooks rests entirely on the developer's shoulders.

**How PocketBase Facilitates this Attack Surface:**

PocketBase provides the infrastructure for executing these hooks at various points in the application lifecycle (e.g., before/after record creation, update, deletion, authentication). It defines the events that trigger the hooks and provides access to relevant data (e.g., record data, user information). While PocketBase itself aims to be secure, it cannot enforce the security of the arbitrary code developers inject into these hooks.

**Expanding on the Example: SQL Injection in `record.beforeCreate`**

Let's dissect the provided SQL injection example in more detail:

* **Scenario:** A `record.beforeCreate` hook is designed to perform some pre-processing on user-submitted data before a new record is inserted into the database.
* **Vulnerable Code:** The hook directly incorporates user-provided data into a raw SQL query without sanitization:

```javascript
// Example of vulnerable hook code (DO NOT USE)
router.before('records.create', 'your_collection', async (e) => {
  const userInput = e.data.someField;
  const db = e.app.dao();
  const query = `SELECT * FROM sensitive_data WHERE name = '${userInput}'`;
  const result = await db.db.all(query);
  // ... further processing based on 'result'
});
```

* **Exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious payload for `e.data.someField`, such as: `' OR 1=1 --`. This would result in the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sensitive_data WHERE name = '' OR 1=1 --'
```

This query bypasses the intended filtering and returns all rows from the `sensitive_data` table.

* **PocketBase's Role:** PocketBase executes this hook with the permissions of the application. It provides the database connection (`e.app.dao()`) and the mechanism to execute the query (`db.db.all()`). It is the developer's responsibility to ensure the `userInput` is safe before using it in the query.

**Deeper Dive into Potential Vulnerabilities Beyond SQL Injection:**

The attack surface of insecure custom hooks extends far beyond just SQL injection. Here are other potential vulnerabilities:

* **Command Injection:** If the hook interacts with the underlying operating system (e.g., using `child_process` in Node.js environments), unsanitized user input could lead to arbitrary command execution on the server.
* **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:** Hooks might implement custom authentication or authorization logic. Flaws in this logic could allow attackers to bypass security checks and perform actions they shouldn't.
* **Path Traversal:** If the hook handles file operations based on user input, vulnerabilities could allow attackers to access or modify files outside the intended directory.
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** If the hook makes external HTTP requests based on user input, attackers could manipulate these requests to interact with internal services or external websites in unintended ways.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A poorly written hook could be computationally expensive or make excessive external requests, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
* **Logic Flaws and Business Logic Vulnerabilities:**  Even without direct code injection, flawed logic in hooks can lead to unintended consequences and business logic vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. For example, incorrect calculations, improper state management, or race conditions.
* **Information Disclosure:** Hooks might inadvertently expose sensitive information through logging, error messages, or by returning it in API responses.
* **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** If the custom hook code relies on external libraries, vulnerabilities in those dependencies can be exploited.

**Impact Analysis (Granular Breakdown):**

The impact of insecure custom hooks can be devastating, affecting various aspects of the application and its users:

* **Data Breaches:**
    * **Direct Database Access:** SQL injection can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data stored in PocketBase.
    * **External Data Sources:** If hooks interact with external databases or APIs, vulnerabilities can compromise data in those systems.
    * **Exfiltration:** Attackers can use hooks to extract sensitive data and exfiltrate it from the system.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
    * **Command Injection:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the PocketBase application, potentially gaining full control.
    * **Code Injection in External Systems:** If hooks interact with other systems, vulnerabilities could lead to code execution in those environments.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    * **Resource Exhaustion:** Maliciously crafted requests can trigger resource-intensive operations in hooks, overloading the server.
    * **Infinite Loops or Recursion:**  Poorly written hook logic can lead to infinite loops or recursive calls, crashing the application.
    * **External Service Overload:** Hooks making excessive requests to external services can lead to those services becoming unavailable.
* **Account Takeover:**
    * **Authentication Bypass:** Flaws in custom authentication logic can allow attackers to log in as other users.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain elevated privileges within the application.
* **Data Integrity Compromise:**
    * **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or corrupt data through insecure hooks, leading to inaccurate information and business disruptions.
    * **Unauthorized Data Creation or Deletion:**  Exploiting authorization flaws can allow attackers to create or delete records they shouldn't have access to.
* **Reputation Damage:** A security breach resulting from insecure custom hooks can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization behind it.
* **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Data breaches can lead to legal repercussions and fines, especially if sensitive personal information is compromised.

**Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Actionable):**

Building upon the initial list, here's a more comprehensive set of mitigation strategies:

* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all user inputs received within hooks. Use allow-lists rather than deny-lists whenever possible. Escape special characters relevant to the context (e.g., SQL, HTML, shell commands).
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure hooks only have the necessary permissions to perform their intended tasks. Avoid granting overly broad access.
    * **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to prevent sensitive information from being leaked in error messages.
    * **Secure Random Number Generation:** Use cryptographically secure random number generators for any security-sensitive operations (e.g., generating tokens, salts).
    * **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Never hardcode sensitive information like API keys or database credentials directly in hook code. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system.
* **Thorough Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Context-Specific Sanitization:** Apply sanitization techniques appropriate to the context where the data will be used (e.g., `escape-html` for HTML output, parameterized queries for database interactions).
    * **Regular Expression Validation:** Use regular expressions to enforce specific input formats and prevent unexpected characters.
    * **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that input data matches the expected data type.
* **Avoid Direct Execution of User-Provided Data:**
    * **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  For database interactions, always use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection. This separates the SQL structure from the user-provided data.
    * **Avoid Dynamic Command Execution:**  Minimize or eliminate the need to execute system commands based on user input. If absolutely necessary, use secure alternatives and carefully sanitize inputs.
* **Implement Proper Authorization Checks:**
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to control access to resources and actions within the hooks.
    * **Policy Enforcement:** Define and enforce clear authorization policies within the hook logic.
    * **Contextual Authorization:**  Consider the context of the request (e.g., user roles, resource ownership) when making authorization decisions.
* **Conduct Security Code Reviews:**
    * **Peer Reviews:** Have other developers review the hook code for potential security vulnerabilities.
    * **Security-Focused Reviews:**  Specifically focus on identifying security weaknesses during code reviews.
    * **Automated Security Analysis Tools (SAST):** Utilize static application security testing (SAST) tools to automatically scan hook code for common vulnerabilities.
* **Input Validation Libraries:** Leverage well-vetted input validation libraries to simplify and improve the robustness of input validation.
* **Output Encoding:** Encode data before displaying it to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if hooks interact with the user interface.
* **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting on hook execution to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging of hook execution, including inputs, outputs, and any errors. Monitor these logs for suspicious activity.
* **Dependency Management:**
    * **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update any external libraries used in the hooks to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
* **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL):** Integrate security considerations throughout the development lifecycle of custom hooks, from design to deployment.
* **Security Training for Developers:** Ensure developers are trained on secure coding practices and common web application vulnerabilities.

**Detection and Prevention During Development:**

* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically scan hook code for potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
* **Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST):**  While more challenging for hooks, consider how DAST principles can be applied during testing to simulate attacks and identify runtime vulnerabilities.
* **Unit and Integration Testing:** Write thorough unit and integration tests for custom hooks, including tests that specifically target potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., testing with malicious inputs).
* **Code Reviews with Security Focus:** Emphasize security considerations during code reviews. Use checklists or guidelines to ensure common security pitfalls are addressed.

**Post-Deployment Monitoring and Response:**

* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate PocketBase logs with a SIEM system to detect and respond to security incidents related to custom hooks.
* **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):**  While not directly applicable to hook code, IDPS can help detect broader attacks that might involve exploiting vulnerabilities in hooks.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in deployed custom hooks.
* **Incident Response Plan:** Have a well-defined incident response plan to handle security breaches related to custom hooks.

**PocketBase's Role and Responsibilities:**

It's crucial to understand the boundary of PocketBase's responsibility. PocketBase provides the framework for hooks and aims to be secure in its core functionality. However, it cannot be responsible for the security of the custom logic developers implement within those hooks.

**Developer Responsibilities:**

The security of custom hooks is primarily the responsibility of the developers who write and maintain them. This includes:

* **Understanding Security Risks:** Being aware of common web application vulnerabilities and how they can manifest in the context of PocketBase hooks.
* **Implementing Secure Coding Practices:**  Following the mitigation strategies outlined above.
* **Thorough Testing:**  Ensuring hooks are thoroughly tested for both functionality and security.
* **Staying Updated:** Keeping up-to-date with security best practices and potential vulnerabilities in libraries used within hooks.

**Conclusion:**

Insecure custom hooks represent a significant attack surface in PocketBase applications. While PocketBase provides the framework, the security of these hooks relies heavily on the developer's diligence and adherence to secure coding practices. A proactive approach, encompassing secure development practices, thorough testing, and ongoing monitoring, is essential to mitigate the risks associated with this attack surface and ensure the overall security of the application. Ignoring this aspect can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, remote code execution, and significant reputational damage.
