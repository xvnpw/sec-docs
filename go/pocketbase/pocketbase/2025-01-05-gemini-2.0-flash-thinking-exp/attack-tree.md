```
*   **OR** ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit PocketBase Authentication/Authorization Flaws
    *   **AND** **CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Default Admin Credentials
        *   **Step 1:** Attempt to access the admin panel (e.g., `/admin`)
        *   **Step 2:** Try default credentials (if not changed)
    *   **AND** ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Insecure Password Reset Mechanism
        *   **Step 1:** Trigger the password reset process for a target account
        *   **Step 2:** Intercept or manipulate the reset token/link to gain unauthorized access
*   **OR** ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit PocketBase API Vulnerabilities
    *   **AND** **CRITICAL NODE** Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
        *   **Step 1:** Identify API endpoints that interact with the database
        *   **Step 2:** Inject malicious SQL queries through input parameters to manipulate data or gain unauthorized access
    *   **AND** ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
        *   **Step 1:** Identify API endpoints that access resources based on IDs
        *   **Step 2:** Manipulate resource IDs to access or modify resources belonging to other users
    *   **AND** ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** **CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Insecure File Upload Functionality
        *   **Step 1:** Identify file upload endpoints
        *   **Step 2:** Upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) to gain remote code execution
*   **OR** ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Custom Logic or Extensions (Hooks/Rules) in PocketBase
    *   **AND** **CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Insecurely Implemented Hooks
        *   **Step 1:** Analyze the custom hooks implemented in the application
        *   **Step 2:** Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the hook logic (e.g., command injection, insecure API calls)
