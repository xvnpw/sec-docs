# Threat Model Analysis for pocketbase/pocketbase

## Threat: [Weak Default Admin Credentials](./threats/weak_default_admin_credentials.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in to the administrative panel using default or easily guessable credentials if the administrator hasn't changed them. This could be done through manual attempts or automated brute-force tools targeting PocketBase's built-in authentication.
- **Impact:** Full compromise of the PocketBase instance, allowing the attacker to access, modify, or delete all data, create new administrative users, and potentially disrupt the application's functionality.
- **Affected Component:** Admin Panel Authentication Module (PocketBase)
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Force a strong password change during the initial setup of PocketBase.
    - Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts within PocketBase.
    - Recommend or enforce strong password complexity requirements for PocketBase admin users.

## Threat: [Bypass of Collection Rules](./threats/bypass_of_collection_rules.md)

- **Description:** A vulnerability in PocketBase's collection rule enforcement logic could allow attackers to bypass these rules and access or manipulate data they shouldn't have access to. This could involve crafting specific API requests that exploit weaknesses in PocketBase's rule evaluation process.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Attackers could view private information, alter records, or disrupt the application's data integrity managed by PocketBase.
- **Affected Component:** Permissions and Rules Engine (PocketBase)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Thoroughly test collection rules within PocketBase to ensure they function as intended.
    - Keep PocketBase updated to benefit from security patches.
    - Follow the principle of least privilege when defining collection rules within PocketBase.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Role Exploits](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_role_exploits.md)

- **Description:** A flaw in PocketBase's role-based access control system could allow a user with limited privileges to gain access to resources or perform actions intended for users with higher privileges. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how PocketBase assigns or checks roles.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or administrative functions within PocketBase. A regular user could potentially gain admin-level access and compromise the entire instance.
- **Affected Component:** User and Role Management Module (PocketBase)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully design and test role-based permissions within PocketBase.
    - Keep PocketBase updated to patch any identified privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
    - Regularly audit user roles and permissions within PocketBase.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of File Uploads](./threats/insecure_handling_of_file_uploads.md)

- **Description:** If PocketBase doesn't properly validate or sanitize uploaded files, an attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, viruses) to the server via PocketBase's file upload functionality. These files could then be executed, potentially leading to remote code execution or other security breaches.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, malware distribution through PocketBase's file storage.
- **Affected Component:** File Upload Handling Module (PocketBase)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict file type validation based on content, not just extension, within PocketBase's file upload settings or custom hooks.
    - Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities within PocketBase.
    - Store uploaded files in a non-executable directory or use a separate storage service configured with PocketBase.
    - Consider using custom hooks to implement virus scanning on files uploaded through PocketBase.
