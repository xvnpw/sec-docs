## Deep Dive Analysis: Insecure Handling of File Uploads in PocketBase Application

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Insecure Handling of File Uploads" threat within the context of a PocketBase application. We will dissect the threat, elaborate on its potential impact, and provide detailed, actionable mitigation strategies for the development team.

**1. Threat Breakdown:**

* **Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability lies in the potential for PocketBase to accept and store files without sufficient scrutiny. This lack of validation and sanitization creates an opportunity for attackers to upload malicious content.
* **Attack Vector:** Attackers can leverage PocketBase's built-in file upload functionality, likely accessible through the admin panel, API endpoints, or potentially even through public forms if file uploads are enabled there.
* **Malicious Payload:** The uploaded files can contain various forms of malicious code:
    * **Web Shells:** Scripts (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js) that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server remotely.
    * **Executable Files:**  Potentially harmful programs (e.g., `.exe`, `.bat`, `.sh`) that could be executed if the server environment allows.
    * **HTML/JavaScript with Malicious Scripts:** Files that, when accessed by other users or the application itself, could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, session hijacking, or other client-side exploits.
    * **Infected Documents:**  Files like PDFs or Office documents containing embedded macros or exploits that could compromise users' machines.
    * **Large Files (DoS):** While not directly code execution, uploading excessively large files can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) by consuming storage space or resources.
* **Triggering the Malice:**  The uploaded malicious files become dangerous when they are executed or interpreted by the server or accessed by users. This can happen through:
    * **Direct Access:** If the uploaded files are stored in a publicly accessible directory and the attacker knows the file path, they can directly access and execute the web shell or other malicious code.
    * **Inclusion in Web Pages:** If the application dynamically includes or links to uploaded files (e.g., displaying user avatars, attachments), malicious HTML or JavaScript can be executed in users' browsers.
    * **Server-Side Processing:** If the application processes uploaded files (e.g., image resizing, document conversion) without proper sanitization, vulnerabilities in the processing libraries could be exploited.
    * **Cron Jobs or Scheduled Tasks:** If the server has scheduled tasks that process files in the upload directory, malicious executables could be triggered.

**2. Deeper Dive into Impact:**

The "High" risk severity is justified by the potentially catastrophic consequences:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most severe impact. A successful web shell upload grants the attacker complete control over the server. They can:
    * **Access sensitive data:** Read database credentials, application secrets, user data, etc.
    * **Modify data:** Alter database records, deface the application, manipulate user accounts.
    * **Install malware:** Deploy additional malicious software, including ransomware or botnet agents.
    * **Pivot to other systems:** Use the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other internal networks or systems.
* **Server Compromise:** Even without achieving direct RCE, attackers can compromise the server by:
    * **Resource Exhaustion:** Uploading large files can fill up disk space, leading to application crashes and denial of service.
    * **Data Corruption:**  Malicious scripts could potentially corrupt application data or configuration files.
    * **Backdoor Installation:**  Attackers can establish persistent access by creating new user accounts or modifying system configurations.
* **Malware Distribution:**  If the PocketBase application is used to serve files to other users or systems, it can become a vector for distributing malware. Users downloading seemingly legitimate files could be infected. This can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Uploaded HTML or JavaScript files can be used to inject malicious scripts into the application, targeting other users. This can lead to:
    * **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to impersonate legitimate users.
    * **Credential Theft:**  Tricking users into entering their credentials on a fake login form.
    * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:**  Redirecting users to phishing websites or sites hosting malware.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack exploiting insecure file uploads can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization responsible for it. This can lead to loss of user trust, financial losses, and legal repercussions.
* **Data Breaches and Compliance Violations:**  Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data through compromised file uploads can lead to data breaches, potentially violating privacy regulations like GDPR or CCPA, resulting in significant fines and legal consequences.

**3. Detailed Analysis of Affected Component (File Upload Handling Module in PocketBase):**

To effectively mitigate this threat, we need to understand how PocketBase handles file uploads:

* **Admin Panel Uploads:** The PocketBase admin panel likely provides a straightforward way to upload files associated with records in collections. This interface needs robust validation.
* **API Endpoints:**  PocketBase's API likely exposes endpoints for file uploads, either directly or as part of creating or updating records. These endpoints are crucial attack vectors and require stringent security measures.
* **Storage Mechanism:**  Understanding where PocketBase stores uploaded files is critical. Are they stored within the application directory, a dedicated storage location, or a cloud storage service? The storage location impacts the potential for execution and access.
* **File Naming Conventions:** How does PocketBase name uploaded files? Does it preserve the original name, generate a unique name, or sanitize the name?  Insecure naming can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.
* **Content-Type Handling:** How does PocketBase determine the type of uploaded file? Relying solely on the file extension is insecure. Proper content-based detection (e.g., MIME type sniffing) is essential.
* **Access Control:**  Who can upload files? Who can access uploaded files?  Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are crucial to prevent unauthorized uploads and access.
* **Custom Hooks:** PocketBase allows for custom hooks to be executed during various lifecycle events, including file uploads. This provides an opportunity to implement custom validation and security checks.

**4. Elaborated Mitigation Strategies and Implementation Details:**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point. Let's expand on them with specific implementation details relevant to PocketBase:

* **Implement Strict File Type Validation Based on Content:**
    * **PocketBase Configuration:** Explore PocketBase's configuration options for file upload restrictions. Can you specify allowed MIME types or file extensions? While extension-based filtering is weak, it can be a first layer of defense.
    * **Custom Hooks:** Leverage PocketBase's custom hooks (e.g., `OnRecordBeforeCreateRequest`, `OnRecordBeforeUpdateRequest`) to implement robust content-based validation.
        * **MIME Type Sniffing:** Use libraries or built-in functions to analyze the file's content and determine its actual MIME type, regardless of the extension.
        * **Magic Number Analysis:** Check the file's header (magic numbers) to verify its type. This is a more reliable method than MIME type sniffing.
        * **Deny by Default:**  Create a whitelist of allowed file types and reject any file that doesn't match.
        * **Example (Conceptual Hook):**
          ```javascript
          // Assuming a JavaScript hook in PocketBase
          router.before('*/create', async (c) => {
            if (c.collection === 'your_collection_with_uploads') {
              const files = c.request().files;
              for (const field in files) {
                const file = files[field];
                if (file) {
                  const allowedMimeTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf']; // Example
                  // Implement MIME type sniffing or magic number check here
                  const actualMimeType = await sniffMimeType(file.buffer);
                  if (!allowedMimeTypes.includes(actualMimeType)) {
                    throw new Error('Invalid file type.');
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          });
          ```
* **Sanitize File Names to Prevent Path Traversal:**
    * **PocketBase Configuration:** Check if PocketBase offers any built-in options for file name sanitization.
    * **Custom Hooks:** Implement sanitization logic within custom hooks before saving the file.
        * **Remove or Replace Dangerous Characters:** Remove characters like `../`, `./`, backticks, semicolons, etc., that could be used for path traversal.
        * **Use a Consistent Naming Convention:**  Consider renaming uploaded files with a unique, generated identifier (e.g., UUID) and storing the original name separately if needed.
        * **Example (Conceptual Hook):**
          ```javascript
          router.before('*/create', async (c) => {
            if (c.collection === 'your_collection_with_uploads') {
              const files = c.request().files;
              for (const field in files) {
                const file = files[field];
                if (file) {
                  const sanitizedFilename = file.name.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]/g, '_'); // Example sanitization
                  file.name = sanitizedFilename;
                }
              }
            }
          });
          ```
* **Store Uploaded Files in a Non-Executable Directory or Use a Separate Storage Service:**
    * **Non-Executable Directory:** Configure PocketBase to store uploaded files in a directory that is not served directly by the web server and does not allow script execution. This prevents attackers from directly executing uploaded web shells.
    * **Separate Storage Service:** Integrate PocketBase with a dedicated storage service like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. These services offer robust security features and can be configured to prevent script execution. PocketBase likely has configurations or extensions to support this.
* **Consider Using Custom Hooks to Implement Virus Scanning:**
    * **Integration with Anti-Virus Software:** Explore integrating PocketBase with an anti-virus scanning engine (e.g., ClamAV) using custom hooks.
    * **Scanning on Upload:**  Implement a hook that intercepts file uploads, sends the file to the anti-virus scanner, and only allows the upload if the scan is clean.
    * **Example (Conceptual Hook - requires integration with a scanning library/service):**
      ```javascript
      router.before('*/create', async (c) => {
        if (c.collection === 'your_collection_with_uploads') {
          const files = c.request().files;
          for (const field in files) {
            const file = files[field];
            if (file) {
              const scanResult = await scanFileForViruses(file.buffer);
              if (!scanResult.isClean) {
                throw new Error('Uploaded file contains malware.');
              }
            }
          }
        }
      });
      ```

**5. Additional Security Best Practices:**

Beyond the provided mitigations, consider these crucial security measures:

* **Input Validation Beyond File Uploads:** Implement robust input validation for all user inputs to prevent other types of attacks.
* **Secure File Serving:** If the application needs to serve uploaded files, ensure it's done securely:
    * **Content-Disposition Header:** Use the `Content-Disposition: attachment` header to force browsers to download files instead of rendering them directly, mitigating some XSS risks.
    * **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized users can access specific files.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities, including insecure file upload handling.
* **Keep PocketBase Up-to-Date:** Ensure you are using the latest version of PocketBase to benefit from security patches and improvements.
