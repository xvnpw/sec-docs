## Deep Analysis: Bypass of Collection Rules in PocketBase Application

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Bypass of Collection Rules" threat within a PocketBase application, as identified in the threat model. We will explore the potential attack vectors, underlying causes, impact in detail, and expand on the provided mitigation strategies.

**1. Understanding the Threat in Detail:**

The core of this threat lies in the potential for attackers to circumvent the access control mechanisms enforced by PocketBase's collection rules. These rules are designed to govern who can read, create, update, and delete records within specific collections. A successful bypass would grant unauthorized access and manipulation capabilities, undermining the application's security and data integrity.

**Key Aspects to Consider:**

* **Rule Complexity:** PocketBase allows for complex rule definitions using a JavaScript-like syntax. The more intricate the rules, the higher the chance of subtle logical flaws that can be exploited.
* **Rule Evaluation Logic:** The way PocketBase evaluates these rules is crucial. Vulnerabilities could arise from incorrect parsing, flawed execution order, or mishandling of specific conditions within the rule engine.
* **API Endpoint Vulnerabilities:**  Attackers might target specific API endpoints (e.g., record creation, update, list) with carefully crafted requests that exploit weaknesses in how PocketBase applies the rules to those requests.
* **Authentication and Authorization Context:** The context in which rules are evaluated (e.g., authenticated user, request headers, query parameters) is critical. Attackers might try to manipulate this context to bypass rules.

**2. Deep Dive into Potential Attack Vectors:**

Let's explore specific ways an attacker might attempt to bypass collection rules:

* **Logical Flaws in Rule Definition:**
    * **Incorrect Operator Usage:**  Using `AND` instead of `OR`, or vice versa, leading to unintended access.
    * **Type Coercion Issues:** Exploiting how PocketBase handles different data types in rule comparisons. For example, comparing a string to a number unexpectedly.
    * **Missing Edge Cases:** Rules that don't account for specific scenarios or data values, allowing attackers to slip through.
    * **Overly Permissive Defaults:**  Rules that start with broad access and attempt to restrict it later, potentially leaving loopholes.
* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in PocketBase's Rule Engine:**
    * **Injection Attacks (Rule Injection):** While less likely due to the server-side nature of rule evaluation, if there's a way to influence the rule evaluation process through user input (e.g., in a custom filter), injection vulnerabilities could arise.
    * **Race Conditions:**  In scenarios involving asynchronous operations or concurrent requests, attackers might exploit timing vulnerabilities to bypass rule checks.
    * **Bypassing Authentication Checks:** If the rule relies on the assumption of a properly authenticated user, vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism itself could lead to rule bypass.
    * **Parameter Tampering:** Modifying request parameters (e.g., filters, sort orders) in a way that circumvents the intended rule logic. For example, providing a filter that always evaluates to true, regardless of the underlying data.
    * **GraphQL Query Manipulation (if applicable):** If the application uses PocketBase's GraphQL API, attackers could craft queries that exploit weaknesses in how rules are applied to GraphQL resolvers.
* **Exploiting Weaknesses in Related Features:**
    * **File Upload Rules:** If file upload rules are linked to collection rules, vulnerabilities in file handling could indirectly lead to rule bypass.
    * **Real-time Subscriptions:**  Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in how real-time updates are filtered based on collection rules.

**3. Potential Root Causes within PocketBase:**

Understanding the potential vulnerabilities within PocketBase itself is crucial:

* **Bugs in the Rule Evaluation Algorithm:**  Logic errors in the code responsible for interpreting and executing collection rules.
* **Inconsistent Rule Application Across API Endpoints:**  Rules might be applied differently or inconsistently depending on the specific API endpoint being accessed.
* **Insufficient Input Validation:**  PocketBase might not adequately validate the data being evaluated against the rules, leading to unexpected behavior.
* **Lack of Proper Sandboxing or Isolation:** If the rule evaluation environment isn't properly isolated, malicious code could potentially interfere with the process.
* **Performance Optimizations with Security Trade-offs:**  Optimizations in the rule engine might inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities.
* **Complexity of the Rule Language:** The flexibility of the rule language can be a double-edged sword, making it harder to reason about the security implications of complex rules.

**4. Real-World Scenarios and Impact:**

Let's illustrate the potential impact with concrete examples:

* **E-commerce Platform:**
    * **Scenario:** Attackers bypass rules restricting access to order details, allowing them to view other users' orders, addresses, and payment information.
    * **Impact:** Privacy breach, financial loss for customers, reputational damage.
* **Social Media Application:**
    * **Scenario:** Attackers bypass rules preventing unauthorized deletion of posts or comments, allowing them to censor content or disrupt discussions.
    * **Impact:** Loss of user-generated content, manipulation of public discourse, reputational damage.
* **Internal Tool for Sensitive Data:**
    * **Scenario:** Attackers bypass rules restricting access to employee salary information, allowing unauthorized viewing and potential misuse.
    * **Impact:** Privacy violation, legal repercussions, internal distrust.
* **Content Management System (CMS):**
    * **Scenario:** Attackers bypass rules preventing unauthorized modification of articles or pages, allowing them to deface the website or spread misinformation.
    * **Impact:** Reputational damage, loss of trust, potential legal issues.

**5. Detailed Mitigation Strategies:**

Expanding on the initial suggestions, here are more specific mitigation strategies:

* **Thorough Testing of Collection Rules:**
    * **Unit Tests:** Write specific tests for each collection rule, covering various input scenarios, edge cases, and expected outcomes.
