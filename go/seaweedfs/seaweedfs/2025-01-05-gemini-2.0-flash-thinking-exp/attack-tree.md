## Attack Tree Path: [***CRITICAL NODE*** Exploit SeaweedFS Master Server Vulnerabilities ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_seaweedfs_master_server_vulnerabilities_high-risk_path.md)

*   The Master Server is the central control point for the SeaweedFS cluster. Exploiting vulnerabilities here grants significant control and can lead to widespread compromise.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit API Vulnerabilities**
        *   SeaweedFS exposes APIs for management and control. Unpatched vulnerabilities in these APIs can allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions, such as manipulating volume assignments, accessing metadata, or even shutting down the cluster. This path is high-risk due to the potential for significant impact and the possibility of finding exploitable vulnerabilities in exposed APIs.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Cause Denial of Service (DoS) on Master Server**
        *   Making the Master Server unavailable disrupts the entire SeaweedFS cluster, preventing the application from accessing its data. This can be achieved by overwhelming the server with requests or exploiting resource exhaustion vulnerabilities. This path is high-risk due to the relatively lower effort required for a basic DoS attack and the significant impact of disrupting the entire storage system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities_high-risk_path.md)

*   The Master Server is the central control point for the SeaweedFS cluster. Exploiting vulnerabilities here grants significant control and can lead to widespread compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) on Master Server ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos__on_master_server_high-risk_path.md)

*   The Master Server is the central control point for the SeaweedFS cluster. Exploiting vulnerabilities here grants significant control and can lead to widespread compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SeaweedFS Volume Server Vulnerabilities ***HIGH-RISK PATH (Direct Access)***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_seaweedfs_volume_server_vulnerabilities_high-risk_path__direct_access_.md)

*   This path focuses on attacks directly targeting the Volume Servers, where the actual file data is stored.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities**
        *   Volume Servers process uploaded files. Vulnerabilities in how they handle data (e.g., during resizing, conversion, or serving) can be exploited by uploading malicious files. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other severe consequences. This path is high-risk due to the potential for significant impact and the commonality of data handling vulnerabilities in software.
    *   **Critical Node: Directly Access Volume Server Data (High-Risk Path)**
        *   If Volume Servers are exposed without proper network segmentation or access controls, attackers can bypass the intended security model and directly access the raw data files. This allows for direct data manipulation, deletion, or exfiltration. This node is critical as it represents a direct bypass of security measures, and this path is high-risk due to the critical impact of unauthorized data access.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Cause Denial of Service (DoS) on Volume Server**
        *   Overwhelming a Volume Server with read/write requests or exploiting resource exhaustion vulnerabilities can make the data it holds unavailable. This can disrupt the application's functionality and is relatively easy to achieve. This path is high-risk due to the ease of execution and the direct impact on data availability.

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application interacts with SeaweedFS as a client.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Abuse Application Logic with Malicious Data**
        *   Attackers can upload files specifically crafted to exploit vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in the application's processing logic.

This path is high-risk due to the potential for significant impact depending on the application's vulnerabilities and the likelihood of successful exploitation.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure Handling of File URLs**
        *   If the application directly exposes or uses predictable SeaweedFS file URLs without proper authorization checks, attackers can manipulate or guess URLs to access files they shouldn't have access to. This path is high-risk due to the ease of exploitation if the application lacks proper security measures.
