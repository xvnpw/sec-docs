# Attack Surface Analysis for seaweedfs/seaweedfs

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Master Server Ports](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_master_server_ports.md)

*   **Description:** The Master server exposes ports (default 9333 for HTTP, 19333 for raft) that, if publicly accessible without proper authentication and authorization, allow unauthorized interaction with the cluster's control plane.
    *   **How SeaweedFS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SeaweedFS's architecture relies on the Master server for managing metadata and cluster topology. These ports are fundamental to its operation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could access the Master server's HTTP API and retrieve information about volume locations, cluster status, or even attempt to trigger administrative actions if the API is not secured.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality (metadata exposure), potential loss of integrity (unauthorized cluster manipulation), and loss of availability (denial-of-service).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to Master server ports to only authorized hosts.
        *   Configure authentication and authorization for Master server API endpoints (if available in the SeaweedFS version used).
        *   Run Master servers on private networks not directly exposed to the internet.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Volume Server Ports](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_volume_server_ports.md)

*   **Description:** Volume servers expose ports (default 8080 for HTTP) that, if publicly accessible without proper authorization, allow direct interaction with the data storage layer.
    *   **How SeaweedFS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Volume servers are responsible for storing the actual file data. Their accessibility dictates data security.
    *   **Example:** An attacker who knows or can guess a file ID could directly access and download the corresponding file from a publicly accessible Volume server without going through the application or Filer.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality (unauthorized data access), potential loss of integrity (unauthorized data modification or deletion if PUT/DELETE APIs are exposed and unsecured).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to Volume server ports.
        *   Avoid exposing Volume servers directly to the internet.
        *   Rely on the Filer or application-level access control to manage access to files, rather than direct Volume server access.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Filer Ports (If Used)](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_filer_ports__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** The Filer exposes ports (default 8888 for HTTP) that, if publicly accessible without proper authentication and authorization, allow unauthorized access to the file system abstraction provided by the Filer.
    *   **How SeaweedFS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The Filer provides a POSIX-like interface to SeaweedFS, making it a convenient entry point for file management. Its security is crucial for applications using this interface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could browse the file system structure, download sensitive files, or potentially upload malicious files if the Filer's API is not properly secured.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, loss of integrity, potential for introducing malicious content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Filer's API.
        *   Use HTTPS (TLS) to encrypt communication with the Filer.
        *   Implement access control lists (ACLs) or similar mechanisms to restrict access to specific files and directories.
        *   Regularly review and update Filer configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Authentication/Authorization on SeaweedFS APIs](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_authenticationauthorization_on_seaweedfs_apis.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to properly configure and enforce authentication and authorization on the Master, Volume, or Filer API endpoints allows unauthorized users to perform actions.
    *   **How SeaweedFS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SeaweedFS provides various APIs for managing the cluster and accessing data. The security of these APIs is paramount.
    *   **Example:** Without authentication, anyone could potentially call the Master server's API to list volumes or the Volume server's API to attempt file uploads.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, loss of integrity, loss of availability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and configure authentication mechanisms provided by SeaweedFS (e.g., HTTP Basic Auth, JWT).
        *   Implement authorization checks to ensure users only have access to the resources they are permitted to access.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access.

## Attack Surface: [Default or Weak Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_or_weak_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default or easily guessable credentials for any authentication mechanisms in SeaweedFS components.
    *   **How SeaweedFS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SeaweedFS might have default credentials for initial setup or certain features.
    *   **Example:** Failing to change default passwords for HTTP Basic Auth on the Filer could grant unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, loss of integrity, loss of availability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change all default credentials for any authentication mechanisms used in SeaweedFS.
        *   Enforce strong password policies.
