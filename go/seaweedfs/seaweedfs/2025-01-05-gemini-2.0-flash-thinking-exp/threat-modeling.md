# Threat Model Analysis for seaweedfs/seaweedfs

## Threat: [Master Server Data Tampering](./threats/master_server_data_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Master Server's data store (e.g., through exploiting a vulnerability in the storage mechanism or by compromising the underlying system). The attacker might modify volume assignments, causing data to be written to incorrect locations or becoming inaccessible. They could also manipulate cluster metadata, leading to cluster instability or data loss.
*   **Impact:** Data loss or corruption, application malfunction due to incorrect data routing, potential complete cluster failure.
*   **Affected Component:** Master Server (Data Storage, potentially internal database or file system).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong access controls on the Master Server's data store, use encryption for the data store at rest, regularly back up the Master Server data, monitor for unauthorized access attempts, keep the Master Server software and underlying OS patched.

## Threat: [Master Server Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/master_server_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Master Server with excessive requests (e.g., volume lookups, file location requests), overwhelming its resources and making it unresponsive. This prevents clients from interacting with the SeaweedFS cluster.
*   **Impact:** Inability to store or retrieve data, application downtime, potential data loss if write operations are interrupted.
*   **Affected Component:** Master Server (Request Handling, API endpoints).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints, use a robust infrastructure with sufficient resources for the Master Server, implement monitoring and alerting for high request loads, consider using a load balancer in front of multiple Master Servers (if supported and configured for high availability).

## Threat: [Master Server Information Disclosure](./threats/master_server_information_disclosure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Master Server, potentially through exploiting vulnerabilities in its API or by compromising the underlying system. This allows them to access sensitive information about the cluster topology, volume assignments, and potentially even metadata about stored files.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information about the application's data storage, potential for further attacks based on the disclosed information.
*   **Affected Component:** Master Server (API endpoints, Data Storage).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Master Server API, restrict network access to the Master Server, regularly review and patch security vulnerabilities, encrypt sensitive metadata at rest.

## Threat: [Volume Server Data Tampering](./threats/volume_server_data_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Volume Server, either directly or by exploiting vulnerabilities in its data handling processes. They can then directly modify or delete stored file data without going through the proper SeaweedFS API.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, potential legal and compliance issues due to data integrity compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Volume Server (Data Storage, File Handling).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong access controls on Volume Servers, use disk encryption for data at rest, regularly monitor file system integrity, restrict network access to Volume Servers, ensure proper authentication and authorization for internal communication within the SeaweedFS cluster.

## Threat: [Volume Server Information Disclosure](./threats/volume_server_information_disclosure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Volume Server, potentially through exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. This allows them to directly access and read the raw file data stored on the volume.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, potential privacy violations, legal and compliance issues.
*   **Affected Component:** Volume Server (Data Storage, File Handling).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong access controls on Volume Servers, use encryption for data at rest, restrict network access to Volume Servers, ensure proper authentication and authorization for internal communication within the SeaweedFS cluster.

## Threat: [Filer Data Tampering (If Filer is used)](./threats/filer_data_tampering__if_filer_is_used_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Filer's file handling logic or gains unauthorized access to the Filer's underlying data store. They can then modify file content or metadata, potentially corrupting data or altering its intended state.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data integrity issues, application malfunction if relying on the integrity of the filer's data.
*   **Affected Component:** Filer (File Handling Logic, Data Storage).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong access controls on the Filer and its data store, regularly update the Filer software, sanitize user inputs when handling file operations, use file integrity monitoring tools.

## Threat: [Filer Information Disclosure (If Filer is used)](./threats/filer_information_disclosure__if_filer_is_used_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Filer's access control mechanisms or gains unauthorized access. This allows them to bypass intended permissions and read file content or metadata that they should not have access to.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential privacy violations, unauthorized access to confidential information.
*   **Affected Component:** Filer (Access Control Mechanisms, API endpoints).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust access control lists (ACLs) on the Filer, regularly review and audit access permissions, ensure proper authentication and authorization for accessing the Filer API, encrypt sensitive data at rest within the Filer's storage.

## Threat: [Exploiting Lack of Authentication/Authorization on Specific APIs](./threats/exploiting_lack_of_authenticationauthorization_on_specific_apis.md)

*   **Description:** Certain SeaweedFS API endpoints might have insufficient or missing authentication and authorization checks. An attacker could directly access these endpoints without proper credentials and perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential for DoS attacks depending on the vulnerable API endpoint.
*   **Affected Component:** Specific SeaweedFS API Endpoints (Master, Volume, or Filer).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure all SeaweedFS API endpoints require proper authentication and authorization, regularly review and audit API access controls, restrict network access to sensitive API endpoints.
