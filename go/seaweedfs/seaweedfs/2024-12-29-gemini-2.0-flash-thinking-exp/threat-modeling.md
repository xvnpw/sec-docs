*   **Threat:** Master Server Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access and control over the Master Server. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in the Master Server software, using stolen credentials specific to SeaweedFS, or social engineering targeting SeaweedFS administrators. The attacker might then manipulate metadata, allocate volumes maliciously, or disrupt the service.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete loss of control over the SeaweedFS cluster. Data loss or corruption due to metadata manipulation. Denial of service by shutting down the master server or overloading it. Unauthorized access to stored data by manipulating volume assignments within SeaweedFS.
    *   **Affected Component:** Master Server - Core functionality, metadata storage, volume allocation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Master Server (e.g., TLS client certificates specific to SeaweedFS).
        *   Regularly update the Master Server software to patch known SeaweedFS vulnerabilities.
        *   Harden the operating system and network environment where the Master Server is running.
        *   Implement network segmentation to isolate the Master Server.
        *   Monitor Master Server logs for suspicious activity related to SeaweedFS actions.
        *   Implement access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to administrative functions within SeaweedFS.

*   **Threat:** Volume Server Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access and control over a Volume Server. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in the Volume Server software, using stolen credentials specific to SeaweedFS, or gaining physical access to the server. The attacker might then directly access, modify, or delete stored files managed by SeaweedFS.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach through unauthorized access to files stored within SeaweedFS. Data loss or corruption by deleting or modifying files managed by SeaweedFS. Using the compromised server for malicious activities (e.g., hosting malware within SeaweedFS volumes).
    *   **Affected Component:** Volume Server - Data storage, file access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing Volume Servers within SeaweedFS.
        *   Regularly update the Volume Server software to patch known SeaweedFS vulnerabilities.
        *   Harden the operating system and network environment where Volume Servers are running.
        *   Implement network segmentation to isolate Volume Servers.
        *   Encrypt data at rest on Volume Servers using SeaweedFS's encryption features.
        *   Monitor Volume Server logs for suspicious activity related to SeaweedFS file operations.
        *   Restrict physical access to Volume Server hardware.

*   **Threat:** Filer Compromise (If Used)
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access and control over the Filer instance. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in the Filer software, its API (e.g., WebDAV, S3 provided by the Filer), or using stolen credentials specific to the Filer. The attacker might then manipulate the file system structure managed by the Filer, access files, or inject malicious content into files managed by the Filer.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to files and directories managed by the Filer. Manipulation of file metadata (permissions, ownership) within the Filer. Potential for code execution if vulnerabilities in the Filer's file handling are exploited.
    *   **Affected Component:** Filer - File system interface, API endpoints (WebDAV, S3).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Filer and its APIs.
        *   Regularly update the Filer software to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Harden the operating system and network environment where the Filer is running.
        *   Implement robust access control lists (ACLs) on the Filer to restrict file access.
        *   Sanitize user inputs when creating or modifying files and directories through the Filer.
        *   Monitor Filer logs for suspicious activity.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Volume Data Directly
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the underlying storage where Volume Servers store data, bypassing SeaweedFS access controls. This could be due to misconfigured storage permissions *outside* of SeaweedFS's control, but the impact is on SeaweedFS data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach through direct access to files stored within SeaweedFS. Potential for data modification or deletion affecting SeaweedFS managed data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Volume Server - Underlying data storage (impact on SeaweedFS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the underlying storage infrastructure with appropriate access controls and permissions.
        *   Encrypt data at rest on the underlying storage (as an additional layer of defense).
        *   Restrict physical access to storage devices.
        *   Regularly audit storage configurations.

*   **Threat:** Metadata Injection Attacks
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Master Server's metadata handling to inject malicious data into the metadata store. This could involve crafting specific API requests to the Master Server or exploiting parsing vulnerabilities within the Master Server.
    *   **Impact:**  Corruption of file metadata, potentially leading to data inaccessibility or misdirection of file requests within SeaweedFS. In some cases, could potentially be used to execute code on other SeaweedFS components if not properly handled by SeaweedFS.
    *   **Affected Component:** Master Server - Metadata handling, API endpoints.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the Master Server's API endpoints.
        *   Regularly update the Master Server software to patch known vulnerabilities related to metadata handling.
        *   Implement strict output encoding when retrieving metadata from SeaweedFS.

*   **Threat:** API Abuse (Master Server or Volume Server)
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the Master Server or Volume Server API endpoints to perform unauthorized actions. This could involve bypassing SeaweedFS authentication mechanisms, exploiting authorization flaws within SeaweedFS's API, or sending malformed requests to SeaweedFS endpoints.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized retrieval of cluster information managed by SeaweedFS, manipulation of volume assignments within SeaweedFS, or direct access to files bypassing intended SeaweedFS access controls. Potential for denial of service by overloading SeaweedFS API endpoints.
    *   **Affected Component:** Master Server - API endpoints, Volume Server - API endpoints.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all SeaweedFS API endpoints.
        *   Rate-limit requests to SeaweedFS API endpoints to prevent abuse and denial of service.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input to SeaweedFS API endpoints.
        *   Regularly audit and secure SeaweedFS API endpoints.
