# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for seaweedfs/seaweedfs

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure SeaweedFS Authentication (Basic) and Filer Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/configure_seaweedfs_authentication__basic__and_filer_access_control.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Enable Master Authentication:** Start the master server with the `-master.authenticate=true` flag. This enables basic authentication using a shared secret.
2.  **Set a Strong Secret:** Use the `-master.secret=<your_strong_secret>` flag to set a strong, randomly generated secret.  *This secret should be treated as a sensitive credential.*
3.  **Filer Configuration (if using Filer):**
    *   **`filer.toml` Configuration:**  Configure the `filer.toml` file to restrict access to specific directories or files based on the authenticated user (if using the built-in authentication) or, ideally, based on information passed from an authentication proxy (e.g., via HTTP headers). This involves defining access control rules within the `filer.toml`.
    *   **Limit Direct Volume Access:** Ensure clients *only* interact with the Filer and *never* directly with the Volume servers. Configure the Filer to handle all requests and proxy them appropriately after authentication and authorization.
4.  **Regular Secret Rotation:**  Periodically change the `-master.secret` value.  This requires restarting the master server and updating any clients or configurations that use the secret.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Medium):** Provides a *basic* level of protection against unauthorized access.  *Note: This is not a strong security measure on its own and should be combined with other strategies.*
*   **Data Breach (Severity: Medium):** Offers limited protection against data breaches, as the shared secret can be compromised.
*   **Data Modification (Severity: Medium):**  Limits unauthorized modifications, but again, the shared secret is a weak point.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from Critical to Medium (basic authentication is better than nothing, but easily bypassed).
*   **Data Breach:** Risk reduced from Critical to Medium.
*   **Data Modification:** Risk reduced from Critical to Medium.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Describe where this is implemented (e.g., "Master authentication is enabled with `-master.authenticate=true` and a secret set.  The `filer.toml` has basic access control rules based on directory paths."). If not implemented, state "Not Implemented."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Describe where this is *not* implemented (e.g., "Currently, the `filer.toml` does not enforce any access control rules.  All authenticated users have full access.  We need to define granular permissions."). If fully implemented, state "Fully Implemented."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict `weed shell` Access (within SeaweedFS limitations)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict__weed_shell__access__within_seaweedfs_limitations_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Authentication:** Ensure that SeaweedFS master authentication (`-master.authenticate=true`) is enabled. This provides a *minimal* barrier, as `weed shell` will require the shared secret.
2. **Avoid Interactive Use on Production:** For routine operations, create scripts that perform specific tasks rather than using the interactive shell directly on production systems. This reduces the risk of accidental or malicious commands.
3. **Audit Commands (if possible):** If possible, log all commands executed via `weed shell`. This can be achieved through shell history logging and potentially by wrapping the `weed` binary with a script that logs arguments. *Note: This is not a feature of SeaweedFS itself, but a best practice related to its usage.*

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Administrative Actions (Severity: Medium):** The shared secret provides a *very weak* barrier to unauthorized use of `weed shell`.
*   **Accidental Data Loss/Corruption (Severity: High):** Scripting reduces the risk of errors in interactive sessions.
*   **Insider Threat (Severity: High):** Limited mitigation; primarily relies on external controls and auditing.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Administrative Actions:** Risk reduced from Critical to Medium (very limited impact due to the weak authentication).
*   **Accidental Data Loss/Corruption:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (scripting helps).
*   **Insider Threat:** Minimal direct impact; relies on external controls.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Describe where this is implemented (e.g., "Master authentication is enabled.  We have scripts for common administrative tasks."). If not implemented, state "Not Implemented."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Describe where this is *not* implemented (e.g., "We still use `weed shell` interactively for some tasks.  We need to create scripts for these."). If fully implemented, state "Fully Implemented."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Replication and Erasure Coding (Data Redundancy)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_replication_and_erasure_coding__data_redundancy_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Replication:** Configure data replication using the `-collection.replication` flag when creating collections.  Common replication settings include:
    *   `000`: No replication (not recommended for production).
    *   `001`: One replica (data is stored on two volume servers).
    *   `010`: One replica on a different rack.
    *   `100`: One replica on a different data center.
    *   `200`: Two replicas on different data centers.
2.  **Erasure Coding (EC):** For higher data durability and storage efficiency, configure erasure coding using the `-collection.dataCenter` and `-collection.rack` flags, along with appropriate EC settings (e.g., `10,4` for 10 data shards and 4 parity shards). This is configured when creating a collection.
3. **Data Center and Rack Awareness:** If using replication or erasure coding that spans racks or data centers, ensure that SeaweedFS is configured with the correct data center and rack information for each volume server.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Loss due to Hardware Failure (Severity: High):** Replication and erasure coding protect against data loss if a volume server or disk fails.
*   **Data Loss due to Data Center Outage (Severity: High):** Replication across data centers protects against data loss if an entire data center becomes unavailable.
*   **Data Corruption (Severity: Medium):** Erasure coding can detect and correct data corruption.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Loss due to Hardware Failure:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with sufficient replication or EC).
*   **Data Loss due to Data Center Outage:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with appropriate cross-data center replication).
*   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (with EC).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Describe where this is implemented (e.g., "All collections are created with `001` replication. Erasure coding is not currently used."). If not implemented, state "Not Implemented."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Describe where this is *not* implemented (e.g., "We need to implement erasure coding for our most critical data to improve storage efficiency and durability. We also need to configure data center and rack awareness."). If fully implemented, state "Fully Implemented."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Volume Server Limits](./mitigation_strategies/configure_volume_server_limits.md)

**Description:**
1. **`-volumeSizeLimitMB`:** Use this flag when starting volume servers to set the maximum size (in MB) of each volume. This prevents a single volume from consuming all available disk space.
2. **`-max`:** Use this flag to limit the maximum number of volumes that can be created on a volume server.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Prevents a single volume or a large number of volumes from consuming all available disk space on a volume server, which could lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact:**
* **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
* Describe where this is implemented (e.g., "All volume servers are started with `-volumeSizeLimitMB=10240` and `-max=10`."). If not implemented, state "Not Implemented."

**Missing Implementation:**
* Describe where this is *not* implemented (e.g., "Currently, volume servers are not configured with size or volume limits. This needs to be implemented to prevent resource exhaustion."). If fully implemented, state "Fully Implemented."
