## Attack Tree Path: [1. Data Exfiltration](./attack_tree_paths/1__data_exfiltration.md)

*   **1.1. Unauthorized Volume Access [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **1.1.1. Weak/Default Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers exploit weak or default credentials, or the absence of authentication, to gain unauthorized access to the Filer or Volume Servers.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **1.1.1.1. Exploit misconfigured Filer authentication:**
                *   Likelihood: High (if defaults are used) / Medium (if some security is in place)
                *   Impact: High (full data access)
                *   Effort: Very Low
                *   Skill Level: Beginner
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (if logs are monitored) / Hard (if no logging)
                *   *Details:* The attacker tries common default usernames and passwords, or attempts to access the Filer API without any credentials if authentication is disabled.
            *   **1.1.1.3. Exploit misconfigured ACLs:**
                *   Likelihood: Medium
                *   Impact: High
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Intermediate
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (with proper auditing)
                *   *Details:* The attacker leverages overly permissive Access Control Lists (ACLs) or directory permissions to access files and directories they should not be able to.

    *   **1.1.2. Volume Server Compromise [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers gain direct access to a Volume Server, bypassing the Filer and potentially gaining access to all data stored on that server.  This is a critical node because it bypasses Filer-level security.
        *   *Details:* (Refer to full attack tree for specific vulnerability exploitation details - omitted here for brevity, but includes exploiting vulnerabilities, leveraging exposed ports, and exploiting weak credentials).

    *   **1.1.3. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Volume/Filer Communication [HIGH RISK] (if TLS is not used)**
        *   **Description:** Attackers intercept communication between the Filer and Volume Servers, potentially reading or modifying data in transit.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **1.1.3.1. Intercept and read unencrypted traffic:**
                *   Likelihood: High (if TLS is not used) / Very Low (if TLS is enforced)
                *   Impact: High
                *   Effort: Medium (requires network access)
                *   Skill Level: Intermediate
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (with network monitoring)
                *   *Details:* The attacker uses network sniffing tools to capture unencrypted data exchanged between the Filer and Volume Servers.

    *   **1.3. Snapshot/Backup Exploitation**
        *   **1.3.1. Gain access to unencrypted or weakly encrypted backups [HIGH RISK]**
            *   Likelihood: Medium (depends on backup security)
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low (if backups are accessible)
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (if backup access is monitored)
            *   *Details:* The attacker gains access to backup files, which may be stored insecurely (e.g., on an accessible network share, with weak or no encryption).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Destruction/Corruption](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_destructioncorruption.md)

*   **2.1. Unauthorized Volume Modification [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  Similar to data exfiltration, this involves gaining unauthorized access to modify or delete data.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**  These are essentially the same as the Data Exfiltration vectors 1.1.1, 1.1.2, and 1.1.3, but with the intent to delete or corrupt data instead of stealing it.  The likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty are the same.
        *   **2.1.1. Weak/Default Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **2.1.1.1 Exploit misconfigured Filer authentication**
            *   **2.1.1.3 Exploit misconfigured ACLs**
        *   **2.1.2. Volume Server Compromise [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **2.1.3. Man-in-the-Middle Attack [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **2.1.3.1 Intercept and modify/drop traffic**

## Attack Tree Path: [4. System Compromise (RCE) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__system_compromise__rce___critical_node_.md)

*   **4.1. Volume Server RCE [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers achieve remote code execution on a Volume Server, gaining full control over that server and potentially the entire system. This is a critical node due to the severity of the impact.
    *   *Details:* (Refer to full attack tree for specific vulnerability exploitation details - omitted here for brevity, but includes exploiting buffer overflows, library vulnerabilities, and insecure deserialization).  The likelihood is generally low (requiring significant skill and effort), but the impact is very high.
