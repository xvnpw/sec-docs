# Attack Surface Analysis for seaweedfs/seaweedfs

## Attack Surface: [1. Unauthenticated Access (Master/Volume)](./attack_surfaces/1__unauthenticated_access__mastervolume_.md)

**Description:** SeaweedFS allows both master and volume servers to be configured *without* authentication, making them completely open to any network-accessible entity. This is a core configuration option within SeaweedFS.

**SeaweedFS Contribution:** SeaweedFS *provides the option* to disable authentication (`-master.authenticate=false`, `-volume.authenticate=false`). This is the *direct* cause of the vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker directly queries the unauthenticated master server to discover volume locations. They then directly access an unauthenticated volume server to download or delete files.

**Impact:** Complete data compromise (read, write, delete) of the entire file system, or significant portions of it.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication:** *Always* enable authentication on all SeaweedFS components (`-master.authenticate=true`, `-volume.authenticate=true`). This is a *mandatory* configuration change.
    *   **Use Strong Secrets:** Use strong, randomly generated, and unique secrets for authentication on each component.
    *   **Regularly Rotate Secrets:** Implement a process for regularly rotating authentication secrets.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate SeaweedFS components on a private network, accessible only to authorized clients and other SeaweedFS components.

## Attack Surface: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) against Master Server](./attack_surfaces/2__denial_of_service__dos__against_master_server.md)

**Description:** The master server, by design in many SeaweedFS deployments, is a single point of failure.  SeaweedFS's architecture makes it inherently susceptible to DoS if not properly protected.

**SeaweedFS Contribution:** SeaweedFS's master server design, often operating as a single instance, is the *direct* contributor to this vulnerability.  The use of gRPC, while efficient, can be abused without proper controls.

**Example:** An attacker floods the master server with file lookup requests, making it unresponsive and preventing all file system operations.

**Impact:** Complete unavailability of the entire file system.  All read/write operations fail.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting *specifically* for the master server's gRPC endpoints. This can be done at the network level or within SeaweedFS (if supported).
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure strict resource limits (CPU, memory, file descriptors) on the master server process to prevent exhaustion.
    *   **Master Server Replication:** Deploy multiple master servers in a high-availability configuration using SeaweedFS's Raft consensus support. This is a *critical* mitigation for production deployments.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring to detect and alert on high request rates or resource utilization on the master server.
    *   **Request Validation:** Implement strict validation of all incoming requests to the master server to reject malformed or suspicious requests.

## Attack Surface: [3. Data Corruption/Deletion on Volume Servers (Without Authentication)](./attack_surfaces/3__data_corruptiondeletion_on_volume_servers__without_authentication_.md)

**Description:** SeaweedFS allows volume servers to be run without authentication, enabling direct, unauthorized write and delete access to stored data.

**SeaweedFS Contribution:** The ability to disable authentication on volume servers (`-volume.authenticate=false`) is a *direct* configuration option within SeaweedFS that creates this vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker, knowing a volume server's address and without needing authentication, sends a DELETE request for a specific file ID, permanently deleting the file.

**Impact:** Data loss or corruption on specific volume servers, potentially affecting a significant portion of the stored data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication:** *Always* enable authentication on volume servers (`-volume.authenticate=true`). This is non-negotiable for secure operation.
    *   **Strong Secrets:** Use strong, unique secrets for each volume server, distinct from the master server's secrets.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate volume servers on a private network, accessible only to the master server and authorized clients (via the master).
    *   **Regular Backups:** Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy to mitigate the impact of data loss, even with authentication in place.

## Attack Surface: [4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Unencrypted Communication)](./attack_surfaces/4__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__unencrypted_communication_.md)

**Description:** SeaweedFS components communicate over the network. If this communication is unencrypted, it's vulnerable to interception and modification.

**SeaweedFS Contribution:** While SeaweedFS *can* use TLS, it doesn't *enforce* it by default. The lack of mandatory encryption is the direct contributor.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts communication between a client and a volume server, capturing file data or injecting malicious data during transfer.

**Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality violation) and potential data corruption (integrity violation).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **TLS/SSL Encryption:** *Mandatory* use of TLS/SSL encryption for *all* communication between SeaweedFS components (master, volume, filer) and clients.
    *   **Strong Ciphers:** Configure TLS/SSL to use strong, modern ciphers and protocols. Disable weak or outdated ciphers.
    *   **Certificate Validation:** Ensure that all clients (including internal SeaweedFS components) properly validate the certificates presented by other components. Do not disable certificate verification.
