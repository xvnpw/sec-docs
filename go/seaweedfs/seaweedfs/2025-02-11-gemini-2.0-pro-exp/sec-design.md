# Project Design Document: SeaweedFS

## BUSINESS POSTURE

SeaweedFS is a distributed file system, aiming to provide fast, scalable, and reliable storage. Based on the GitHub repository, the following business priorities and goals can be inferred:

Priorities:

*   Performance: The project emphasizes speed and low latency for accessing files.
*   Scalability: It's designed to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally.
*   Simplicity: The system aims for ease of use and deployment.
*   Cost-Effectiveness: By using commodity hardware and efficient storage mechanisms, it aims to reduce storage costs.
*   Availability: The system should provide continuous access to data, even in the face of failures.

Goals:

*   Provide a fast and scalable distributed file system.
*   Offer a simple and easy-to-use storage solution.
*   Support various use cases, including object storage, file storage, and potentially cloud storage.
*   Maintain data integrity and availability.

Business Risks:

*   Data Loss: Failure of storage nodes or volumes could lead to permanent data loss.
*   Data Corruption: Bugs in the software or hardware failures could lead to data corruption.
*   Unauthorized Access: Insufficient access controls could allow unauthorized users to access or modify data.
*   Downtime: System outages could disrupt services that rely on SeaweedFS.
*   Performance Degradation: Under heavy load or due to network issues, the system's performance could degrade, impacting applications.
*   Security Breaches: Vulnerabilities in the software could be exploited by attackers to gain access to data or disrupt the system.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: Supports access key and secret key authentication for S3 API. (Described in documentation and code).
*   security control: Authorization: Limited authorization capabilities, primarily based on access keys. Fine-grained access control at the object level is not a primary focus. (Described in documentation and code).
*   security control: Data Replication: Data is replicated across multiple storage nodes to ensure availability and prevent data loss. (Described in documentation and code).
*   security control: Encryption at Rest: Supports encryption at rest using customer-provided keys (SSE-C) with the S3 API. (Described in documentation).
*   security control: HTTPS Support: Supports HTTPS for secure communication. (Described in documentation).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Limited Authorization Granularity: The system's authorization model is relatively coarse-grained, potentially leading to over-provisioning of access.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on External Authentication for Some Features: Some features, like FUSE mount, may rely on the underlying operating system's authentication mechanisms.
*   accepted risk: Potential for Misconfiguration: Incorrect configuration of replication or security settings could lead to data loss or security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Limited Auditing: Built-in auditing capabilities are limited.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Introduce RBAC to provide more granular control over access to data and operations.
*   security control: Enhance Auditing: Implement comprehensive auditing to track all access and modifications to data and configuration.
*   security control: Integrate with Centralized Identity Provider: Allow integration with external identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, OIDC) for centralized user management and authentication.
*   security control: Implement Network Segmentation: Use network segmentation to isolate different components of SeaweedFS and limit the impact of potential security breaches.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Implement mechanisms to prevent sensitive data from being stored or transmitted insecurely.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support strong authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Integrate with existing enterprise identity providers.
    *   Provide secure key management for API access.
*   Authorization:
    *   Implement fine-grained access control based on roles and permissions.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege.
    *   Support access control lists (ACLs) for individual objects.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all input from clients and external systems to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Sanitize file names and metadata to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong encryption algorithms for data at rest and in transit.
    *   Implement secure key management practices.
    *   Regularly update cryptographic libraries to address known vulnerabilities.

### BUILD

The SeaweedFS build process involves compiling the Go source code and creating binaries or Docker images.

1.  **Source Code Checkout:** Developers check out the source code from the GitHub repository.
2.  **Dependency Management:** Go modules are used to manage dependencies. `go mod download` fetches the required dependencies.
3.  **Compilation:** The Go compiler (`go build`) is used to compile the source code into executables for different components (master, volume, filer, etc.).
4.  **Testing:** Unit tests and integration tests are run using the Go testing framework (`go test`).
5.  **Docker Image Creation (Optional):** Dockerfiles are used to create Docker images for each component. This involves copying the compiled binaries into a base image (e.g., Alpine Linux) and setting the entry point.
6.  **Image Publishing (Optional):** Docker images are pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Quay.io).
7.  **Release Artifacts:** Release artifacts (binaries, Docker images, and potentially configuration files) are created and made available for download.

SeaweedFS uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

```mermaid

    DockerBuild --> DockerImage("Docker Image")
    DockerImage --> ContainerRegistry("Container Registry\n(e.g., Docker Hub)")
    Binaries --> ReleaseArtifacts("Release Artifacts")
    DockerImage --> ReleaseArtifacts

```

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Dependency Scanning: Use tools like `go mod verify` and vulnerability scanners to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   security control: Static Analysis: Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., `go vet`, `staticcheck`) into the build process to identify potential code quality and security issues.
*   security control: Code Signing: Sign binaries and Docker images to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
*   security control: Build Automation: Use GitHub Actions to automate the build process, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   security control: Least Privilege: Build agents should run with minimal privileges.
*   security control: Reproducible Builds: Aim for reproducible builds to ensure that the same source code always produces the same binary output.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Data Storage and Retrieval: The primary business process is the reliable storage and retrieval of data. Any disruption to this process can have significant consequences.
    *   High Availability: Maintaining continuous access to data is critical for applications relying on SeaweedFS.
    *   Scalability: The ability to scale the system to meet growing storage demands is essential.

*   Data Sensitivity:
    *   The sensitivity of the data stored in SeaweedFS depends on the specific use case. It can range from non-sensitive public data to highly confidential information.
    *   Examples:
        *   Low Sensitivity: Publicly available images or videos.
        *   Medium Sensitivity: User-uploaded content that is not publicly accessible but is not highly confidential.
        *   High Sensitivity: Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, or other confidential business data.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   What specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) must SeaweedFS adhere to, if any?
    *   What are the expected data retention policies?
    *   What are the specific performance requirements (latency, throughput)?
    *   What is the expected growth rate of data storage?
    *   Are there any existing security tools or infrastructure that SeaweedFS should integrate with?
    *   What level of support is required for different client types (S3, FUSE, WebDAV, HDFS)?
    *   What are the disaster recovery requirements?
    *   What is the budget for security controls and tools?

*   Assumptions:
    *   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a fast, scalable, and reliable distributed file system. Cost-effectiveness is a significant consideration.
