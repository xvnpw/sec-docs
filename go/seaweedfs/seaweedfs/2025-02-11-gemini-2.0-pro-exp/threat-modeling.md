# Threat Model Analysis for seaweedfs/seaweedfs

## Threat: [Master Server Takeover via Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/master_server_takeover_via_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Threat:** Master Server Takeover via Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., a buffer overflow, insecure deserialization, or command injection) in the Master server's API handling (e.g., `github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/weed/server/master_server.go`, specifically request handling functions) to execute arbitrary code on the Master server. The attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable endpoint.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the SeaweedFS cluster.  The attacker can access, modify, or delete all metadata, redirect clients to malicious volume servers, and potentially pivot to other systems on the network.  Full data loss, data breach, and system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Master Server (specifically, API request handling logic, potentially in `master_server.go` and related files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all input received by the Master server's API, especially data used in system calls or data processing.  Use a whitelist approach where possible.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning and Patching:** Regularly scan the Master server code and its dependencies for vulnerabilities using static analysis tools (SAST) and dynamic analysis tools (DAST).  Apply security patches promptly.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF in front of the Master server to filter malicious requests and protect against common web attacks.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Master server process with the lowest possible privileges.  Avoid running as root.
        *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews, focusing on security-sensitive areas like input handling and external command execution.
        *   **Memory Safe Languages/Techniques:** If possible, use memory-safe languages or techniques (e.g., Rust, Go's built-in memory safety features) to prevent buffer overflows and other memory-related vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Master Server Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_master_server_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Master Server Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of legitimate-looking requests to the Master server (e.g., requests to assign new volumes, lookup file locations) at a high rate, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network connections). This could target functions like `Assign` in `github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/weed/master/volume_growth.go`.
    *   **Impact:** The Master server becomes unresponsive, preventing new file uploads, lookups, and other operations.  This effectively shuts down the SeaweedFS cluster.
    *   **Affected Component:** Master Server (resource management, request handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limiting on the Master server's API, limiting the number of requests per client IP address or API key within a given time window.
        *   **Resource Quotas:** Configure resource quotas (CPU, memory, connections) for the Master server process to prevent it from consuming all available resources.
        *   **Connection Limits:** Limit the number of concurrent connections the Master server can handle.
        *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute the load across multiple Master servers using a load balancer.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor resource usage on the Master server and set up alerts for high CPU, memory, or connection usage.

## Threat: [Data Breach via Direct Volume Server Access](./threats/data_breach_via_direct_volume_server_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Breach via Direct Volume Server Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker bypasses the Master server and directly accesses a Volume server (e.g., by exploiting a misconfigured firewall, guessing the Volume server's IP address and port, or exploiting a vulnerability in the Volume server's API - `github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/weed/server/volume_server.go`). The attacker can then download raw data files.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to a subset of the stored data.  The attacker can read the contents of files stored on that specific Volume server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Volume Server (direct data access, potentially bypassing authentication).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Network Segmentation and Firewall Rules:** Strictly control network access to Volume servers.  Only the Master server and authorized clients (with proper authentication) should be able to communicate with them.  Use a firewall to block all other traffic.
        *   **Data Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt the data stored on Volume servers using SeaweedFS's built-in encryption features.  This mitigates the impact of unauthorized direct access, as the attacker would only obtain encrypted data.
        *   **Authentication for Volume Server Access:** Even for direct access (which should be minimized), require authentication.  SeaweedFS supports this.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit network configurations and firewall rules regularly.

## Threat: [Metadata Manipulation via Weak Master Server Authentication](./threats/metadata_manipulation_via_weak_master_server_authentication.md)

*   **Threat:** Metadata Manipulation via Weak Master Server Authentication
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Master server's API using weak or default credentials, or by exploiting a vulnerability in the authentication mechanism (e.g., a broken session management vulnerability). The attacker can then modify file metadata (e.g., change file locations, delete file entries). This could involve manipulating data structures in `github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/weed/topology/topology.go`.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, or redirection of clients to incorrect Volume servers.  The attacker could make files inaccessible or point them to malicious data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Master Server (authentication, metadata management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all Master server access.  Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
        *   **Secure Session Management:** Implement secure session management for the Master server's API, using strong session tokens and proper expiration policies.
        *   **Regular Password Rotation:** Require regular password changes for all Master server accounts.
        *   **Audit Logging:** Log all authentication attempts and metadata changes, including the user or process that made the change.

## Threat: [Data Corruption via Compromised Volume Server](./threats/data_corruption_via_compromised_volume_server.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Corruption via Compromised Volume Server
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains full control of a Volume server (e.g., through an OS vulnerability or weak SSH credentials) and modifies or deletes data files directly on the disk. This bypasses SeaweedFS's internal consistency checks.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss or data corruption for files stored on the compromised Volume server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Volume Server (data storage, operating system).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Operating System Hardening:** Harden the operating system of the Volume server, applying security patches promptly and disabling unnecessary services.
        *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS to monitor for suspicious activity on the Volume server.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Use FIM tools to detect unauthorized changes to files on the Volume server.
        *   **Data Replication and Erasure Coding:** Use SeaweedFS's replication or erasure coding features to ensure that data is stored redundantly across multiple Volume servers.  This allows for recovery from data corruption on a single server.
        *   **Regular Backups:** Implement regular backups of the entire SeaweedFS system.

## Threat: [Filer Impersonation (if Filer is used)](./threats/filer_impersonation__if_filer_is_used_.md)

*   **Threat:** Filer Impersonation (if Filer is used)
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a Filer server or sets up a rogue Filer server that mimics a legitimate one.  The attacker can then intercept client requests, modify data in transit, or redirect clients to malicious Volume servers. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in `github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/weed/filer/filer.go`.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, or denial of service.  The attacker can control the client's view of the file system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Filer Server (authentication, request handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for all access to the Filer server.
        *   **TLS/SSL Encryption:** Use TLS/SSL to encrypt all communication between clients and the Filer server.  This prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
        *   **Client-Side Verification:** If possible, implement client-side verification of the Filer server's identity (e.g., using certificates).
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Filer server on a separate network segment.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Communication (Lack of TLS)](./threats/unencrypted_communication__lack_of_tls_.md)

* **Threat:** Unencrypted Communication (Lack of TLS)
    * **Description:** Communication between SeaweedFS components (master, volume, filer) occurs over unencrypted HTTP. An attacker on the same network can use packet sniffing tools (e.g., Wireshark) to intercept traffic.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, including file contents, metadata, and potentially credentials (if not handled separately and securely). Man-in-the-middle attacks are possible.
    * **Affected Component:** All SeaweedFS components (master, volume, filer - network communication).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable TLS/SSL:** Configure TLS/SSL encryption for all SeaweedFS components. Generate and use valid certificates. Use the `-tls.cert` and `-tls.key` flags for the master and volume servers.
        *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Configure clients to connect to SeaweedFS using HTTPS.
        *   **Certificate Pinning (Optional):** For enhanced security, consider certificate pinning on the client side to prevent connections to servers with unexpected certificates.
