# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for seaweedfs/seaweedfs

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) or Bucket Policies](./mitigation_strategies/implement_access_control_lists__acls__or_bucket_policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify different user roles and access levels required for your application's data stored in SeaweedFS buckets.
    2.  For each SeaweedFS bucket, determine the appropriate access permissions for each role (e.g., read-only, read-write, list, delete).
    3.  Utilize SeaweedFS's ACL features (via `weed filer.acl` command or API) or bucket policies (if using S3 gateway) to define these permissions.
    4.  Apply the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions to each role.
    5.  Regularly review and update ACLs/bucket policies as user roles and application requirements evolve. Document these policies clearly.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity): Prevents unauthorized users or malicious actors from accessing sensitive data stored in SeaweedFS.
    *   Data Breaches (High Severity): Reduces the risk of data breaches by limiting access to authorized personnel only.
    *   Data Modification or Deletion by Unauthorized Users (Medium Severity): Prevents accidental or malicious modification or deletion of data by users without proper permissions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Data Breaches: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Data Modification or Deletion by Unauthorized Users: Moderately reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Basic ACLs are implemented on the 'user-uploads' bucket to prevent public listing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Granular role-based ACLs are not fully implemented across all buckets (e.g., 'application-logs', 'system-backups', 'private-user-data').  Bucket policies via S3 gateway are not yet explored for more centralized management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Encryption at Rest](./mitigation_strategies/enable_encryption_at_rest.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure SeaweedFS volume servers to use encryption at rest. This is typically done during volume server startup by specifying encryption key parameters.
    2.  Choose a strong encryption algorithm (SeaweedFS supports AES-256-GCM).
    3.  Securely manage the encryption keys. Ideally, use a dedicated Key Management System (KMS) or a secure vault to store and manage keys. Avoid storing keys directly within SeaweedFS configuration files or in the application code.
    4.  Ensure proper key rotation procedures are in place for long-term security.
    5.  Verify encryption is enabled by checking volume server logs and testing data access.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Physical Storage Compromise (High Severity): Protects data confidentiality if physical storage media (hard drives, SSDs) containing SeaweedFS volumes are stolen or improperly disposed of.
    *   Data Leakage from Internal Threats (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of data leakage if internal users with physical access to servers attempt to access data directly from storage media bypassing access controls.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Physical Storage Compromise: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Data Leakage from Internal Threats: Moderately reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Encryption at rest is enabled on the 'user-uploads' volume server using AES-256-GCM with a locally managed key file.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Encryption at rest is not enabled for all volume servers (e.g., those storing application logs and backups). Key management is currently basic; integration with a dedicated KMS is missing. Key rotation procedures are not yet defined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Encryption in Transit (HTTPS)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_encryption_in_transit__https_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure both SeaweedFS master and volume servers to use HTTPS for all communication.
    2.  Obtain valid TLS/SSL certificates for your SeaweedFS domain or IP addresses. Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or generate self-signed certificates for testing (not recommended for production).
    3.  Configure SeaweedFS to use these certificates. This typically involves setting certificate paths and key paths in the SeaweedFS configuration files or command-line arguments.
    4.  Ensure your application always communicates with SeaweedFS using HTTPS URLs.
    5.  Enforce HTTPS redirection if users attempt to access SeaweedFS via HTTP.
    6.  Regularly renew TLS/SSL certificates before they expire.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity): Prevents attackers from intercepting and eavesdropping on communication between your application and SeaweedFS, protecting sensitive data in transit.
    *   Data Interception (High Severity):  Reduces the risk of sensitive data being intercepted during transmission over the network.
    *   Credential Sniffing (Medium Severity): Protects authentication credentials (if any are transmitted) from being sniffed during communication.

    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Data Interception: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Credential Sniffing: Moderately reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** HTTPS is enforced for communication between the application and the SeaweedFS master server using Let's Encrypt certificates.

    2.  Document the current ACLs and bucket policies for each bucket.
    3.  Review these policies against current application requirements and user roles.
    4.  Identify any overly permissive permissions or deviations from the principle of least privilege.
    5.  Update ACLs and bucket policies to rectify any identified issues.
    6.  Maintain an audit log of changes made to ACLs and bucket policies, including who made the changes and when.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Authentication and Authorization for API Access](./mitigation_strategies/implement_authentication_and_authorization_for_api_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Choose an authentication method for accessing SeaweedFS APIs (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT). SeaweedFS supports API keys and can be integrated with external authentication systems.
    2.  Implement authentication checks in your application before making requests to SeaweedFS APIs.
    3.  Configure SeaweedFS to enforce authentication. This might involve setting up API key validation or integrating with an external authentication service.
    4.  Implement authorization checks to ensure authenticated users or services only have access to the resources they are permitted to access. This can be combined with ACLs/bucket policies.
    5.  Securely manage API keys or credentials used for authentication.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized API Access (High Severity): Prevents unauthorized access to SeaweedFS APIs, protecting data and system integrity.
    *   Data Manipulation by Unauthorized Users (High Severity): Prevents unauthorized users from manipulating data stored in SeaweedFS via APIs.

    3.  Define appropriate rate limits based on expected legitimate traffic and system capacity.
    4.  Monitor API request rates and adjust rate limits as needed.
    5.  Implement mechanisms to handle rate-limited requests gracefully (e.g., return appropriate HTTP status codes, provide informative error messages to users).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**

    2.  Identify API endpoints that are not required for your application's functionality or are considered sensitive (e.g., administrative endpoints, debugging endpoints).
    3.  Disable or restrict access to unnecessary or sensitive API endpoints. This can be done through SeaweedFS configuration or by using a reverse proxy to filter requests.
    4.  For necessary API endpoints, ensure they are properly secured with authentication, authorization, and rate limiting (as described in other mitigation strategies).
    5.  Consider network segmentation to further restrict access to internal API endpoints, limiting access to only trusted networks or services.
