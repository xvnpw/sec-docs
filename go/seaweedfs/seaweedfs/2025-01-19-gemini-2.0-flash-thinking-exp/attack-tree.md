## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via SeaweedFS Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_seaweedfs_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means the application's confidentiality, integrity, or availability is significantly impacted due to weaknesses in its SeaweedFS integration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to SeaweedFS Data (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_seaweedfs_data__critical_node_.md)

* Achieving this allows the attacker to bypass intended access controls and view sensitive data stored within SeaweedFS. This is a foundational step for many other attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Master Server Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_master_server_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* The Master Server is the control plane of SeaweedFS. Compromising it grants significant control over the entire storage system, including metadata manipulation, access control changes, and potentially impacting availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Master Server Authentication/Authorization (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_master_server_authenticationauthorization__high_risk_path_.md)

* This path focuses on bypassing the security measures protecting access to the Master Server. Success grants the attacker administrative privileges.
    * **Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed) (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to the Master Server using well-known default usernames and passwords that are often not changed during initial setup.
        * **Impact:** Full administrative control over the Master Server.
        * **Mitigation:** Enforce strong, unique password policies and require password changes during initial setup.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly Access Volume Server Data (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/directly_access_volume_server_data__high_risk_path_.md)

* This path involves bypassing the Master Server and Filer (if used) to directly interact with the Volume Servers where the actual file data is stored.
    * **Exploit Lack of Authentication/Authorization on Volume Server API (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the Volume Server API that allow unauthorized access without proper authentication or authorization checks.
        * **Impact:** Direct access to read, modify, or delete files stored on the Volume Server.
        * **Mitigation:** Implement and enforce strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Volume Server API. Restrict network access to Volume Servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Misconfiguration/Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_misconfigurationvulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

* This path focuses on weaknesses in how the application itself interacts with SeaweedFS.
    * **Exploit Insecure Handling of SeaweedFS API Keys/Secrets (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Retrieve API Keys/Secrets from Application Code or Configuration (HIGH RISK PATH):**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers find and extract SeaweedFS API keys or secrets that are inadvertently stored in the application's codebase, configuration files, or environment variables.
            * **Impact:** Full access to SeaweedFS resources, allowing the attacker to perform any action the application is authorized to do.
            * **Mitigation:** Store API keys and secrets securely using environment variables, secrets management tools, or secure vaults. Avoid hardcoding them in the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate SeaweedFS Data (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_seaweedfs_data__critical_node_.md)

* This critical node represents the attacker's ability to alter or remove data stored within SeaweedFS, potentially causing application malfunction, data loss, or serving malicious content.
    * **Delete Data (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        * **Trigger Mass Deletion via API Abuse or Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH):**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit API vulnerabilities or abuse legitimate API functions to delete a large number of files or directories within SeaweedFS.
            * **Impact:** Significant data loss, potentially rendering the application unusable.
            * **Mitigation:** Implement robust access controls for deletion operations, require confirmation for mass deletions, and implement data backup and recovery strategies.
    * **Inject Malicious Data (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        * **Upload Malware or Exploit Payloads disguised as legitimate files (HIGH RISK PATH):**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., malware, scripts) disguised as legitimate content, which can then be served by the application or exploited by other users.
            * **Impact:** Compromise of the application server, client-side attacks on users, or data breaches.
            * **Mitigation:** Implement thorough content scanning and validation on all uploaded files. Isolate uploaded files and restrict their execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Application Availability via SeaweedFS (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_application_availability_via_seaweedfs__critical_node_.md)

* This critical node focuses on attacks that prevent users from accessing the application or its data due to issues with the SeaweedFS infrastructure.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) against Master Server (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers overwhelm the Master Server with a flood of requests or exploit vulnerabilities that cause it to crash or become unresponsive.
        * **Impact:** Application unavailability as the Master Server is crucial for metadata management and volume lookup.
        * **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting on API requests, use firewalls and intrusion prevention systems, and ensure the Master Server has sufficient resources to handle expected load. Keep the Master Server software up-to-date with security patches.
