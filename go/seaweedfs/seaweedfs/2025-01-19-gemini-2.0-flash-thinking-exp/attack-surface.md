# Attack Surface Analysis for seaweedfs/seaweedfs

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Master Server API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_master_server_api_endpoints.md)

**Description:** The Master Server exposes API endpoints for cluster management (e.g., adding/removing nodes, managing volumes). If these are not properly secured, unauthorized access is possible.

**How SeaweedFS Contributes:** SeaweedFS's architecture relies on the Master Server for central coordination, making its API a critical control point. Default configurations might not enforce strong authentication.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the Master Server API without authentication and removes all volume servers, leading to complete data loss.

**Impact:** Complete cluster compromise, data loss, service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable and enforce authentication (e.g., using `-auth.jwt.secret` or other authentication mechanisms).
* Restrict access to Master Server API endpoints to authorized IP addresses or networks using firewalls.
* Regularly review and update access control configurations.
* Consider using TLS/HTTPS for all communication with the Master Server.

## Attack Surface: [Volume Server Direct Access (If Exposed)](./attack_surfaces/volume_server_direct_access__if_exposed_.md)

**Description:** If Volume Servers are directly accessible from untrusted networks, attackers can bypass the intended access controls.

**How SeaweedFS Contributes:**  While typically accessed through the Master Server, misconfigurations or specific network setups might expose Volume Servers directly.

**Example:** An attacker directly connects to a Volume Server and exploits a vulnerability in its storage handling to read or write arbitrary data.

**Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, denial of service on individual volume servers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Volume Servers are only accessible from the Master Server and authorized clients (if direct access is intended).
* Use network segmentation and firewalls to restrict access to Volume Server ports.
* Keep Volume Server software updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Filer Insecure Permissions and Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/filer_insecure_permissions_and_path_traversal.md)

**Description:** If using the Filer, misconfigured file system permissions or vulnerabilities in path handling can allow unauthorized access to files.

**How SeaweedFS Contributes:** The Filer provides a file system abstraction on top of SeaweedFS. Incorrectly configured permissions within the Filer directly translate to access control issues.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a path traversal vulnerability in the Filer API to access files outside of their intended directory.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized modification or deletion of files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully configure file and directory permissions within the Filer.
* Regularly audit Filer permissions.
* Ensure the Filer software is updated to patch path traversal vulnerabilities.
* Implement robust input validation on any Filer API interactions.

## Attack Surface: [S3 Gateway Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/s3_gateway_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** If using the S3 Gateway, weak or missing authentication and authorization mechanisms can allow unauthorized access to buckets and objects.

**How SeaweedFS Contributes:** The S3 Gateway translates S3 API calls to SeaweedFS operations. Vulnerabilities in this translation or the gateway's own security can lead to bypasses.

**Example:** An attacker bypasses S3 authentication and gains access to sensitive data stored in a SeaweedFS bucket via the S3 Gateway.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data modification or deletion.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable and properly configure authentication for the S3 Gateway (e.g., using AWS Signature Version 4).
* Implement and enforce bucket policies to control access to objects.
* Regularly review and audit S3 Gateway access configurations.
* Use HTTPS for all communication with the S3 Gateway.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Encryption in Transit and at Rest](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_encryption_in_transit_and_at_rest.md)

**Description:** If communication between SeaweedFS components or data at rest is not encrypted, attackers can intercept or access sensitive information.

**How SeaweedFS Contributes:** SeaweedFS handles potentially sensitive data. Lack of encryption makes it vulnerable during transmission and storage.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between a client and a Volume Server and reads the unencrypted file data being transferred.

**Impact:** Data breach, loss of confidentiality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable TLS/HTTPS for all communication between SeaweedFS components (Master, Volume, Filer, S3 Gateway) and clients.
* Configure encryption at rest for the storage volumes used by SeaweedFS.

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

**Description:** Using default credentials for any SeaweedFS components allows easy unauthorized access.

**How SeaweedFS Contributes:** Like many systems, SeaweedFS might have default credentials that need to be changed upon deployment.

**Example:** An attacker uses default credentials to access the Master Server's administrative interface.

**Impact:** Complete cluster compromise, data loss, service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if defaults exist and are not changed)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Immediately change any default credentials for all SeaweedFS components upon deployment.
* Enforce strong password policies.
