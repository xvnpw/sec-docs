*   Consider using checksums or other integrity checks for metadata.
*   Regularly audit metadata changes.

## Threat: [Master Server Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/master_server_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the Master Server with a large number of requests, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable for legitimate operations. This could be achieved through various methods, such as sending a high volume of API calls or exploiting resource exhaustion vulnerabilities within the Master Server.

**Impact:** Inability to upload, download, or manage files within the SeaweedFS cluster, leading to application downtime.

**Affected Component:** Master Server (specifically its API endpoints and resource management).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting on API requests to the Master Server.
*   Ensure sufficient resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) are allocated to the Master Server.
*   Consider using a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple Master Servers (if applicable).
*   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

## Threat: [Volume Server Compromise](./threats/volume_server_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Volume Server, potentially by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Volume Server software. Once inside, they can directly access, modify, or delete stored file data. They might also inject malicious content.

**Impact:** Data breach, data loss, data modification, and potential introduction of malicious content.

**Affected Component:** Volume Server (specifically the data storage and retrieval mechanisms).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing Volume Servers.
*   Regularly patch and update the Volume Server software.
*   Harden the operating system and network environment hosting the Volume Servers.
*   Encrypt data at rest on the Volume Servers.
*   Monitor Volume Server logs for suspicious activity.
*   Restrict network access to Volume Servers to only authorized hosts.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Direct Access to Volume Servers](./threats/unauthorized_direct_access_to_volume_servers.md)

**Description:** An attacker bypasses the Master Server and directly interacts with a Volume Server, potentially if direct access is enabled and not properly secured within SeaweedFS. This could allow them to read or modify files without going through the intended access control mechanisms.

**Impact:** Circumvention of access controls, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

**Affected Component:** Volume Server (specifically its direct access API or storage mechanisms if directly exposed).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Disable or strictly control direct access to Volume Servers.
*   Enforce authentication and authorization even for direct Volume Server access (if absolutely necessary).
*   Rely on the Master Server for access control and routing.

## Threat: [Data Corruption on Volume Servers](./threats/data_corruption_on_volume_servers.md)

**Description:** An attacker, through a compromised Volume Server or by exploiting write vulnerabilities within SeaweedFS, directly modifies the raw data stored on the Volume Server, leading to file corruption.

**Impact:** Loss of data integrity, rendering files unusable.

**Affected Component:** Volume Server (specifically the data storage mechanisms).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement data replication across multiple Volume Servers.
*   Utilize checksums or other integrity checks for stored data.
*   Regularly perform backups and test restoration procedures.
*   Restrict write access to Volume Servers to authorized processes.

## Threat: [Filer Compromise (If Used)](./threats/filer_compromise__if_used_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Filer process, potentially by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Filer software. This allows them to manipulate the file system structure and metadata managed by the Filer, potentially bypassing access controls and accessing files.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to files, data modification, and potential disruption of file system operations.

**Affected Component:** Filer (specifically its core logic and API endpoints).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Filer.
*   Regularly patch and update the Filer software.
*   Harden the operating system and network environment hosting the Filer.
*   Monitor Filer logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in Filer (If Used)](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_in_filer__if_used_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Filer's path handling to access files or directories outside of their intended scope. This is often achieved by manipulating file paths using characters like "..".

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories.

**Affected Component:** Filer (specifically its file path processing logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for file paths.
*   Avoid constructing file paths based on untrusted user input.
*   Enforce strict access controls based on the intended file system structure.

## Threat: [Access Control Issues in Filer (If Used)](./threats/access_control_issues_in_filer__if_used_.md)

**Description:** Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the Filer's access control mechanisms allow unauthorized users to access or modify files managed by the Filer.
