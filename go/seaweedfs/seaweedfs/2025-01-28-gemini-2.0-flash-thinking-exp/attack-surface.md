# Attack Surface Analysis for seaweedfs/seaweedfs

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Master Server API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_master_server_api_access.md)

*   **Description:**  Exposure of the Master Server API without proper authentication allows unauthorized users to manage the SeaweedFS cluster.
*   **SeaweedFS Contribution:** SeaweedFS Master Server exposes an HTTP API for cluster management. If not configured with authentication, it's directly accessible.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses the Master Server API endpoint `/cluster/status` without authentication and retrieves sensitive cluster topology information, including volume server locations and capacity. They then use this information to target volume servers directly.
*   **Impact:** Cluster compromise, data integrity issues, denial of service, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable Authentication: Configure authentication for the Master Server API using `-master.admin.api.key` or integrate with an authentication provider.
    *   Network Segmentation: Restrict access to the Master Server API to only authorized networks or IP addresses using firewalls.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Volume Server API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_volume_server_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of the Volume Server API without proper authentication allows unauthorized users to directly access and manipulate stored data.
*   **SeaweedFS Contribution:** SeaweedFS Volume Servers expose an HTTP API for data read and write operations. If not configured with authentication, data is directly accessible.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses a Volume Server's API endpoint `/1/download/public/fileId` without authentication and downloads a sensitive file. Alternatively, they could use `/1/delete/fileId` to delete data.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data loss, data corruption, unauthorized data modification.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable Authentication: Configure authentication for Volume Server APIs using `-volume.public.api.key` or integrate with an authentication provider.
    *   Network Segmentation: Restrict access to Volume Server APIs to only authorized networks or applications.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in Volume Server Data Retrieval](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_volume_server_data_retrieval.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerability allowing attackers to access files outside of their intended scope by manipulating file paths in data retrieval requests.
*   **SeaweedFS Contribution:**  Volume Servers handle file path parameters in API requests. If not properly validated, path traversal vulnerabilities can occur.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a request to a Volume Server API endpoint like `/1/download/public/../../../../etc/passwd` attempting to access system files on the Volume Server.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data breaches, potential server compromise if system files are accessible.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Input Validation: Implement strict input validation and sanitization on file paths received by Volume Servers. Ensure paths are normalized and restricted to the intended data directory.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege (File System): Run Volume Server processes with minimal file system permissions, limiting access to only necessary data directories.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) against Master Server](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__against_master_server.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks aimed at making the Master Server unavailable, disrupting the entire SeaweedFS cluster.
*   **SeaweedFS Contribution:** Master Server is a central component and a single point of failure if not properly protected against DoS.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods the Master Server with a large number of API requests, exhausting its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and making it unresponsive to legitimate requests.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, data unavailability, application downtime.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on Master Server API endpoints to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given time frame.
    *   Resource Limits: Configure appropriate resource limits (CPU, memory) for the Master Server process to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   Load Balancing and High Availability: Deploy Master Servers in a high-availability configuration with load balancing to distribute traffic and provide redundancy.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Component Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-component_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Unencrypted or unauthenticated communication between SeaweedFS components (Master, Volume, Filer) allowing for interception or manipulation of data and commands.
*   **SeaweedFS Contribution:** SeaweedFS components communicate over the network. If encryption and authentication are not enabled for inter-component communication, it's vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts communication between a Master Server and a Volume Server and modifies commands related to data replication, leading to data corruption or inconsistency.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, cluster compromise, data integrity issues, man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS/HTTPS: Configure SeaweedFS to use TLS/HTTPS for all inter-component communication.
    *   Mutual Authentication: Implement mutual authentication between components to ensure only authorized components can communicate with each other.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Vulnerabilities (Default Credentials, Public Exposure)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_vulnerabilities__default_credentials__public_exposure_.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations of SeaweedFS components leading to security weaknesses.
*   **SeaweedFS Contribution:** SeaweedFS, like any software, requires secure configuration. Default settings or improper deployment can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Using default API keys or passwords for Master or Volume Servers. Exposing management ports of Master or Volume Servers directly to the public internet without access control.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, cluster compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Configuration Practices: Follow SeaweedFS security best practices for configuration.
    *   Change Default Credentials:  Immediately change any default API keys or passwords.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege (Network Access): Restrict network access to management ports and APIs to only authorized administrators and applications.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Vulnerabilities in SeaweedFS Client Libraries](./attack_surfaces/client-side_vulnerabilities_in_seaweedfs_client_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in SeaweedFS client libraries used by applications, potentially leading to application compromise.
*   **SeaweedFS Contribution:**  SeaweedFS provides client libraries for various languages. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited by attackers targeting applications using them.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in a SeaweedFS Go client library is exploited when processing a malicious response from a Volume Server, leading to application crash or potential remote code execution within the application.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, potential remote code execution in the application context, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (depending on the vulnerability and application context)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Official and Up-to-Date Libraries: Use official SeaweedFS client libraries from trusted sources and keep them updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Input Validation (Application Side): Implement input validation in your application when interacting with SeaweedFS client libraries to prevent unexpected data from being processed.
