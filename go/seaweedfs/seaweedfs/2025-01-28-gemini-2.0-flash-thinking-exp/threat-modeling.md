# Threat Model Analysis for seaweedfs/seaweedfs

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Stored Files](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_stored_files.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to files stored in SeaweedFS. This could be achieved by exploiting weak SeaweedFS access controls, bypassing authentication mechanisms, or compromising credentials used to access SeaweedFS.  An attacker might read, download, or modify sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data exposure, potential data integrity issues if files are modified.
*   **Affected Component:** Volume Servers, Filer, Master (for access control policies)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms within SeaweedFS (e.g., secret keys, JWT if available, application-level authorization).
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication to prevent credential sniffing.
    *   Regularly review and audit access permissions within SeaweedFS.
    *   Apply principle of least privilege when granting access to SeaweedFS resources.
    *   Consider using encryption at rest for sensitive data stored in SeaweedFS volumes.

    *   Implement versioning or backups of SeaweedFS data to allow for rollback in case of tampering.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks aimed at making SeaweedFS unavailable to legitimate users. An attacker could flood SeaweedFS components (Master, Volume Servers, Filer) with requests, exhausting resources and causing service disruption. This directly targets the availability of the SeaweedFS service.
*   **Impact:** Availability disruption of SeaweedFS, service outage, inability for applications to access data stored in SeaweedFS.
*   **Affected Component:** Master Server, Volume Servers, Filer
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and traffic filtering at the network level (firewall, load balancer) to protect SeaweedFS components.
    *   Monitor resource utilization of SeaweedFS components and set up alerts for anomalies.
    *   Harden SeaweedFS components against known DoS vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) if the Filer component of SeaweedFS is exposed to the internet.
    *   Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms for SeaweedFS components to improve resilience against DoS.

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Use of default or weak passwords for SeaweedFS administrative interfaces or access keys. An attacker could exploit default credentials or easily guess weak passwords to gain unauthorized administrative access to SeaweedFS components. This is a direct vulnerability in securing access to SeaweedFS management.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise of SeaweedFS, data breach, data manipulation within SeaweedFS, service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Master Server (UI), Filer (UI), potentially access keys if used with weak secrets.
