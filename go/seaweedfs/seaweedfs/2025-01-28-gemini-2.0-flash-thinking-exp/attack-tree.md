## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit SeaweedFS Component Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_seaweedfs_component_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** This high-risk path targets inherent vulnerabilities within the SeaweedFS components themselves. Success here can lead to broad compromise of the SeaweedFS infrastructure and the application relying on it.

    * **1.1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Master Server [CRITICAL NODE]**
        * **Description:** The Master Server is the central control point. Exploiting it grants significant control over the SeaweedFS cluster.
            * **1.1.1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Unauthenticated Master Server Access [CRITICAL NODE]**
                * **Attack Vector:**  If the Master Server is misconfigured or default settings are insecure, it might be accessible without authentication.
                * **Likelihood:** Medium (If default config is insecure or misconfigured)
                * **Impact:** Critical (Full control over SeaweedFS cluster, data access, DoS)
                * **Effort:** Low (Simple network scan and API interaction)
                * **Skill Level:** Low (Basic networking and API knowledge)
                * **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Network monitoring, access logs)
                * **Actionable Insight:** Ensure Master Server Access Control is Enabled and Properly Configured (e.g., using `-peers` or authentication). Regularly Audit Master Server Configuration for Open Access.

    * **1.2. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Volume Server [CRITICAL NODE]**
        * **Description:** Volume Servers store the actual data. Exploiting them allows direct access to stored files.
            * **1.2.1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Unauthenticated Volume Server Access [CRITICAL NODE]**
                * **Attack Vector:** Similar to the Master Server, Volume Servers might be misconfigured to allow unauthenticated access, especially if directly exposed.
                * **Likelihood:** Medium (If default config or misconfiguration exposes Volume Servers)
                * **Impact:** Critical (Direct data access, data manipulation, data deletion)
                * **Effort:** Low (Simple network scan and API interaction)
                * **Skill Level:** Low (Basic networking and API knowledge)
                * **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Network monitoring, access logs)
                * **Actionable Insight:** Ensure Volume Servers are Properly Secured and Not Directly Accessible from the Public Internet. Use Firewall Rules to Restrict Access to Volume Servers to Only Authorized Components (Master, Filer, Application Servers if necessary).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Application Misconfiguration/Insecure Usage of SeaweedFS [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_application_misconfigurationinsecure_usage_of_seaweedfs__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** This high-risk path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application is configured and how it interacts with SeaweedFS. Misconfigurations can negate the inherent security of SeaweedFS.

    * **2.1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Expose SeaweedFS Components Directly to the Internet [CRITICAL NODE]**
        * **Attack Vector:**  If Master, Volume, or Filer servers are directly exposed to the public internet, they become easily accessible targets for attackers to exploit any underlying vulnerabilities.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration, especially in quick setups)
        * **Impact:** Critical (Exposes all SeaweedFS vulnerabilities directly to the internet)
        * **Effort:** Low (No exploitation needed, just network access)
        * **Skill Level:** Low (Basic networking knowledge)
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (External network scan)
        * **Actionable Insight:** Ensure Master, Volume, and Filer servers are behind a firewall and not directly accessible from the public internet unless absolutely necessary and properly secured. Use Network Segmentation to Isolate SeaweedFS infrastructure.

    * **2.2. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure API Key/Secret Management (If Application Uses API Keys) [CRITICAL NODE]**
        * **Description:** If the application uses API keys to authenticate with SeaweedFS, insecure management of these keys can lead to unauthorized access.
            * **2.2.1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Hardcoded API Keys in Application Code [CRITICAL NODE]**
                * **Attack Vector:** Developers might mistakenly hardcode API keys directly into the application's source code, making them easily discoverable by attackers through code review or reverse engineering.
                * **Likelihood:** Medium (Common developer mistake, especially in early stages)
                * **Impact:** Critical (Full access to SeaweedFS resources, data breach)
                * **Effort:** Low (Code review or source code access)
                * **Skill Level:** Low (Basic code reading skills)
                * **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Static code analysis, code review)
                * **Actionable Insight:** Never Hardcode API Keys. Use Environment Variables or Secure Secret Management Solutions. Regularly Scan Codebase for Hardcoded Secrets.
