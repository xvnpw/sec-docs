# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Priority 1: High Performance and Scalability. SeaweedFS is designed for fast read and write operations and to scale to handle large amounts of data and high request rates. This is critical for applications requiring low latency and high throughput storage.
  - Priority 2: Data Durability and Availability. Ensuring data is reliably stored and accessible is paramount. Data loss or prolonged downtime can have significant business impact.
  - Priority 3: Cost Efficiency. Optimizing storage utilization and operational costs is important for managing infrastructure expenses, especially at scale.
  - Priority 4: Ease of Use and Integration.  Simple APIs and compatibility with existing systems (like S3) are important for developer adoption and reducing integration effort.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Risk 1: Data Loss or Corruption. Failure of storage nodes, software bugs, or malicious attacks could lead to data loss or corruption, impacting data integrity and business operations.
  - Risk 2: Performance Degradation.  System overload, network issues, or inefficient configurations could lead to performance degradation, impacting application responsiveness and user experience.
  - Risk 3: Unauthorized Access to Data.  Lack of proper access controls or vulnerabilities in authentication and authorization mechanisms could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations.
  - Risk 4: Service Downtime.  Failures in critical components, operational errors, or security incidents could cause service downtime, impacting business continuity and availability of applications relying on SeaweedFS.
  - Risk 5: Vendor Lock-in.  Heavy reliance on a specific storage solution could create vendor lock-in, limiting flexibility and potentially increasing costs in the long term.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Access Control Lists (ACLs) for buckets and objects. Implemented within SeaweedFS Filer and S3 API.
  - security control: HTTPS support for API endpoints. Configurable during SeaweedFS setup.
  - security control: Basic Authentication for API access. Configurable during SeaweedFS setup.
  - security control: Data replication across volume servers for fault tolerance. Implemented within SeaweedFS volume server logic.
  - security control: Erasure coding for data redundancy and storage efficiency. Implemented within SeaweedFS volume server logic.
  - security control: Input validation on API requests. Implemented within SeaweedFS API handlers.
  - security control: Logging of API requests and system events. Configurable within SeaweedFS master and volume servers.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on basic authentication might be insufficient for highly sensitive environments.
  - accepted risk: Lack of built-in encryption at rest. Users are responsible for implementing encryption if required.
  - accepted risk: Limited built-in audit logging capabilities. More comprehensive audit logging might be needed for compliance requirements.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. Requires ongoing monitoring and patching of dependencies.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for finer-grained access management.
  - security control: Integrate with external authentication providers (e.g., OAuth 2.0, LDAP) for stronger authentication.
  - security control: Implement encryption at rest for data confidentiality.
  - security control: Enhance audit logging to capture more security-relevant events and integrate with security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
  - security control: Implement regular security vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
  - security control: Establish a secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) incorporating security reviews and testing at each stage.
  - security control: Implement automated security checks in the CI/CD pipeline (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning).

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Securely authenticate users and applications accessing SeaweedFS APIs.
    - Requirement: Support for strong authentication mechanisms beyond basic authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    - Requirement: Option to integrate with existing identity providers.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement granular authorization controls to manage access to buckets and objects based on user roles or application permissions.
    - Requirement: Enforce the principle of least privilege.
    - Requirement: Support for ACLs and potentially RBAC.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all inputs from API requests to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, path traversal).
    - Requirement: Sanitize inputs before processing and storing data.
    - Requirement: Implement input validation on both client-side and server-side.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use HTTPS for all API communication to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement: Consider encryption at rest for sensitive data stored in SeaweedFS.
    - Requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys used for encryption.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Process 1: Data Storage and Retrieval. This is the core function of SeaweedFS. Disruption or compromise directly impacts applications relying on it.
  - Process 2: Metadata Management. Managing metadata is crucial for data organization and access. Corruption or loss of metadata can lead to data inaccessibility.
  - Process 3: API Access.  Applications and users rely on APIs to interact with SeaweedFS. Security and availability of APIs are essential.
  - Process 4: Data Replication and Durability. Ensuring data is replicated and durable is critical for preventing data loss and maintaining business continuity.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Data Type: Blobs, Objects, Files, Data Lake data.
  - Sensitivity: Sensitivity varies greatly depending on the use case. Could range from publicly available images to highly confidential business data, financial records, or personal information.
  - Data at Rest: Potentially sensitive data stored on volume servers.
  - Data in Transit: API requests and data transfer between clients and SeaweedFS components.
  - Data in Backups: Backups may contain all types of data stored in SeaweedFS and should be treated with appropriate sensitivity.

  - Assumption: Deployment will likely be in a cloud environment (AWS, GCP, Azure) using container orchestration (Kubernetes) for scalability and manageability.
  - Assumption: Filer component is used to provide file system and S3 API access, in addition to direct volume server access.
  - Question: What are the specific backup and disaster recovery requirements for SeaweedFS data?
  - Assumption: Backup strategy will involve regular backups to a separate storage location (e.g., S3) and procedures for data restoration in case of failures.
