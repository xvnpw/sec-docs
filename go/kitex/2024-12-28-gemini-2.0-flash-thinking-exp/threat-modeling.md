## High and Critical Kitex Threats

| Threat | Description (What the attacker might do and how) | Impact | Affected Kitex Component(s) | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **IDL Manipulation Leading to Deserialization Vulnerabilities** | An attacker modifies the Interface Definition Language (IDL) to introduce data structures that, when processed by the server via Kitex's generated code, trigger deserialization vulnerabilities. This could lead to remote code execution or denial of service. | Remote code execution on the server, denial of service by crashing the server application. | **IDL (File, Repository):** The source of truth for service contracts. **Code Generation (Tooling):** The Kitex tooling that generates code from the IDL. **Server (Serialization/Deserialization):** The libraries and logic within the Kitex generated server code used to process incoming data. | Critical | **Secure IDL Storage and Versioning:** Store IDLs securely and implement version control to prevent unauthorized modifications. **Code Review of Generated Code:** Review the code generated by Kitex for potential deserialization vulnerabilities. **Input Validation within Handlers:** Implement strict input validation within the server-side handlers based on the expected data types defined in the IDL, even after deserialization. **Use Secure Serialization Libraries (underlying):** While Kitex uses underlying libraries, ensure awareness and best practices for those libraries are followed. |
| **Malicious Payload Exploitation via Deserialization (Kitex Specific)** | An attacker crafts malicious payloads that, when deserialized by the server using Kitex's default or configured serialization mechanisms, exploit vulnerabilities within Kitex's deserialization handling or the generated code. This can lead to remote code execution or other malicious actions. | Remote code execution on the server, data breaches, or other arbitrary code execution. | **Server (Serialization/Deserialization):** The specific serialization mechanisms used by Kitex (e.g., Thrift's binary protocol if default). **Application Logic (Handlers):** The code generated by Kitex that processes the deserialized data. | Critical | **Input Validation within Handlers:** Implement strict input validation based on the expected data types and formats defined in the IDL within the server-side handlers. **Secure Deserialization Practices:** Be aware of potential deserialization vulnerabilities in the underlying serialization library used by Kitex. **Regularly Update Kitex:** Keep Kitex updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches related to deserialization. **Consider Custom Serialization/Deserialization:** If necessary, explore options for customizing serialization/deserialization within Kitex to enforce stricter security. |
| **Middleware Bypass** | An attacker finds a way to bypass authentication or authorization middleware implemented using Kitex's middleware features, gaining unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities. This could be due to flaws in the middleware implementation or misconfiguration of the Kitex middleware chain. | Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities, potential for data manipulation or service disruption. | **Server (Middleware):** The authentication and authorization interceptors implemented using Kitex's middleware API. **Application Logic (Handlers):** The code that should be protected by the Kitex middleware. | High | **Thoroughly Test Middleware Logic:** Ensure middleware is correctly implemented and applied to all relevant service methods using Kitex's middleware registration mechanisms. **Secure Middleware Configuration:** Properly configure the Kitex middleware chain to ensure all necessary middleware is applied in the correct order. **Regular Security Audits:** Review middleware configurations and implementations for potential bypass vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on how Kitex middleware is applied. |
| **Registry Poisoning (Impacting Kitex Clients)** | An attacker compromises the service registry used by Kitex clients and injects malicious service endpoints or modifies existing ones. When Kitex clients resolve service addresses, they might connect to these rogue servers. | Clients connecting to malicious servers, potential for data breaches as clients send data to the attacker, data corruption if the malicious server provides incorrect data, and man-in-the-middle attacks. | **Registry (Integration with Kitex Resolver):** How Kitex clients resolve service addresses from the registry. **Client (Resolver):** The Kitex client's service discovery mechanism. | High | **Secure Registry Access:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing and modifying the service registry. **Data Integrity Checks in Resolver:** If possible, implement mechanisms within the Kitex client's resolver to verify the integrity of the data retrieved from the registry. **Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Server Authentication:** Even if the registry is compromised, mTLS can prevent clients from connecting to unauthenticated servers. |
| **Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion via Kitex Specific Features)** | An attacker leverages specific features of Kitex, such as sending excessively large requests or exploiting inefficiencies in Kitex's request handling, to overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and make it unavailable to legitimate clients. | Service unavailability, impacting business operations and user experience. | **Server (Transport, Request Handling Logic):** How Kitex handles incoming requests and manages resources. **Load Balancing (if applicable):** The load balancer might be overwhelmed or misconfigured in relation to Kitex's request patterns. | High | **Rate Limiting (Kitex Middleware):** Implement rate limiting using Kitex's middleware capabilities to control the number of requests from specific clients or sources. **Request Size Limits (Kitex Configuration):** Configure Kitex to enforce limits on the size of incoming requests. **Timeouts and Deadlines:** Configure appropriate timeouts and deadlines for Kitex requests to prevent indefinite resource consumption. **Resource Limits (e.g., CPU, Memory) for Kitex Processes:** Configure appropriate resource limits for the server processes running Kitex services. |
