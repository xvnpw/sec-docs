## High and Critical Gorilla Mux Threats

This table lists high and critical security threats that directly involve the `gorilla/mux` library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected Mux Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Route Overlap Exploitation** | An attacker crafts a request that intentionally matches multiple defined routes due to ambiguous patterns. This can lead to the execution of an unintended handler, potentially bypassing security checks or accessing sensitive functionality. | Unauthorized access, data manipulation, execution of unintended code paths, denial of service (if different handlers have varying performance). | `mux.Router`, `mux.Route` (matching logic) | High | Implement thorough testing of route definitions, including edge cases and potential overlaps. Utilize `mux`'s route ordering and precedence features (`UseEncodedPath()`, `StrictSlash()`). Employ linters or static analysis tools to detect potential route overlaps. Document route definitions clearly. |
| **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Route Patterns** | An attacker crafts malicious URLs containing patterns that cause the regular expression engine used by `mux` for route matching to consume excessive CPU time, leading to a denial of service. | Application unavailability, resource exhaustion, potential server crash. | `mux.Route.Path()`, `mux.Route.PathPrefix()`, `mux.Route.MatcherFunc()` (if using regex) | High | Avoid overly complex regular expressions in route patterns. Thoroughly test regular expressions for performance against various inputs, including potentially malicious ones. Consider using simpler, non-regex-based route matching where possible. Implement timeouts for request processing. |
| **Path Traversal via Path Variables** | An attacker manipulates path variables extracted by `mux` (e.g., `/files/{filepath}`) by including characters like `..` to access files or resources outside the intended directory structure on the server. | Exposure of sensitive files, potential code execution if accessed files are executable. | `mux.Vars()` (path variable extraction) | Critical | Never directly use path variables to construct file paths without validation and sanitization. Implement strict input validation on path variables to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious characters. Utilize secure file access methods that restrict access to specific directories. |
| **Middleware Bypass due to Incorrect Ordering/Configuration** | An attacker crafts a request that, due to incorrect middleware ordering or configuration, bypasses security-related middleware (e.g., authentication, authorization) and reaches the handler directly. | Unauthorized access, security policy violations, data breaches. | `mux.Router.Use()`, `mux.Route.Handler()` (middleware application) | Critical | Carefully define the order of middleware execution to ensure security middleware is applied before any handler logic. Thoroughly test middleware configurations to verify they are applied as intended for all relevant routes. Utilize `mux`'s features for applying middleware to specific routes or subrouters. |
| **Abuse of Custom Matchers** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in custom matchers defined using `mux.Route.MatcherFunc()`. This could lead to unintended route matching or security bypasses. | Unauthorized access, potential execution of unintended functionality. | `mux.Route.MatcherFunc()` | High | Thoroughly test custom matchers with various inputs, including potentially malicious ones. Ensure custom matchers are implemented securely and do not introduce new vulnerabilities. Carefully consider the security implications before implementing custom matchers. |
