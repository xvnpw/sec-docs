Okay, I will update the vulnerability list according to your instructions.

Based on your initial assessment that no high-rank vulnerabilities were identified in the easyjson library itself that meet the specified criteria, and considering the instructions to exclude certain types of vulnerabilities and only include high-rank ones exploitable by an external attacker on a publicly available instance, the updated list remains **"None"**.

Here is the updated vulnerability list in markdown format, reflecting the absence of qualifying vulnerabilities and keeping the original explanation:

## Vulnerability List for easyjson Project

Based on the provided project files, no high-rank vulnerabilities were identified in the easyjson library itself that meet the following criteria:

*   Triggerable by an external attacker on a publicly available instance.
*   Not caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using the easyjson library.
*   Not only missing documentation for mitigation.
*   Not denial of service vulnerabilities.
*   Valid and not already mitigated.
*   Vulnerability rank at least: high.

The code appears to be focused on performance and correctness of JSON marshaling and unmarshaling, with a reasonable level of security considerations for its intended use case as a code generation tool.

It's important to note that this analysis is based on the provided files and may not be exhaustive. Further analysis, especially of the code generation logic and the generated code itself, might reveal potential vulnerabilities. However, within the scope of these files and the specified criteria, no high-rank vulnerabilities were found.

- **None**
