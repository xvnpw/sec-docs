## Vulnerability List for easyjson Project

Based on the provided project files, the following vulnerability has been identified in the `easyjson` project that can be triggered by an external attacker:

### 1. Information Leak via LexerError Data Field

*   **Description:**
    *   The `LexerError` type in `jlexer/error.go` is used to report JSON parsing errors.
    *   This error type includes a `Data` field, which stores the portion of the input JSON data that caused the parsing error.
    *   The `Error()` method of `LexerError` formats an error message that includes the content of the `Data` field.
    *   If an application using `easyjson` encounters a parsing error and logs or exposes this error message, the `Data` field, which might contain sensitive information from the input JSON, will be leaked.
    *   An attacker can craft a malicious JSON payload with embedded sensitive data and introduce syntax errors to trigger a `LexerError`. If the application logs or returns the error, the attacker can potentially extract the sensitive data.

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1.  An attacker sends a crafted JSON payload to an application that uses `easyjson` for parsing.
    2.  The crafted JSON payload includes sensitive information (e.g., API keys, personal data) within its structure.
    3.  The attacker intentionally introduces a syntax error into the JSON payload (e.g., invalid character, extra comma).
    4.  `easyjson`'s parsing logic encounters the syntax error and generates a `LexerError`.
    5.  The `LexerError` object is propagated back to the application's error handling.
    6.  The application logs or returns the `LexerError` message, which includes the `Data` field containing the problematic part of the JSON input, potentially revealing the sensitive data embedded in the attacker's payload.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive information embedded within user-provided JSON input.
    *   The leaked information can vary depending on the application's context and the data being processed. It could include API keys, authentication tokens, personal identifiable information (PII), or other confidential data.
    *   The severity of the impact depends on the sensitivity of the leaked data and the context of the application.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The current implementation of `LexerError` directly includes the potentially sensitive `Data` field in the error message.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Modify the `LexerError` type and its `Error()` method to prevent direct exposure of the raw `Data` field in error messages.
    *   Implement sanitization or truncation of the `Data` field before including it in the error message. For example, truncate the `Data` field to a fixed length or replace sensitive parts with placeholders.
    *   Alternatively, the error message could be made more generic, indicating a parsing error at a specific offset without revealing the problematic data itself.
    *   Consider logging only the error `Reason` and `Offset` for security-sensitive applications, omitting the `Data` field from logs.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The application uses `easyjson` to parse JSON data from external or untrusted sources.
    *   The application's error handling mechanism logs or exposes `LexerError` messages, potentially in application logs, error responses, or debugging outputs.
    *   The input JSON data processed by the application might contain sensitive information.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    *   File: `/code/jlexer/error.go`
    ```go
    package jlexer

    import "fmt"

    // LexerError implements the error interface and represents all possible errors that can be
    // generated during parsing the JSON data.
    type LexerError struct {
        Reason string
        Offset int
        Data   string // Data field is included in the error message
    }

    func (l *LexerError) Error() string {
        return fmt.Sprintf("parse error: %s near offset %d of '%s'", l.Reason, l.Offset, l.Data) // Data field is directly used in error message
    }
    ```
    *   The `LexerError` struct in `jlexer/error.go` defines the error structure for JSON parsing errors.
    *   The `Data string` field within `LexerError` is designed to hold the problematic JSON data segment that caused the parsing failure.
    *   The `Error()` method of `LexerError` constructs an error message using `fmt.Sprintf`, directly embedding the `l.Data` string into the formatted output.
    *   This direct inclusion of `l.Data` in the error message means that if a parsing error occurs, the raw, potentially sensitive, input data segment will be part of the error string.
    *   Any logging or error reporting mechanism that uses the `LexerError.Error()` method will inadvertently expose this `Data` field, leading to potential information leakage.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup:** Create a Go application that uses `easyjson` to unmarshal JSON into a simple struct. Configure the application to log error messages to a file or console.
    2.  **Craft Malicious Payload:** Create a JSON file named `malicious.json` with the following content. This JSON is intentionally malformed and contains a sensitive string "sensitiveAPIKey: mySecret":
        ```json
        {
          "field1": "value1",
          "sensitiveData": "sensitiveAPIKey: mySecret",
          "field2": "value2",,  // Intentional syntax error: extra comma
        }
        ```
    3.  **Run Application with Malicious Payload:** Execute the Go application and feed it the `malicious.json` file as input. The application should attempt to unmarshal this JSON.
    4.  **Check Error Logs:** Inspect the error logs generated by the application.
    5.  **Verify Information Leak:** Confirm that the error log message contains the content of the `Data` field from `LexerError`, which should include parts of the `malicious.json` content, specifically revealing the "sensitiveAPIKey: mySecret" string or a portion of it along with the syntax error.

    **Expected Error Log Example (may vary slightly depending on the exact error and logging format):**
    ```
    parse error: expected '}', but got ',' near offset XXX of '{
      "field1": "value1",
      "sensitiveData": "sensitiveAPIKey: mySecret",
      "field2": "value2",,'
    ```
    In this example, the error message clearly includes a segment of the input data, potentially leaking the sensitive string "sensitiveAPIKey: mySecret".
