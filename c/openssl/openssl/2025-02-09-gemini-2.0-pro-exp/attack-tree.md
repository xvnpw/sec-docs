## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Buffer Overflow in Parsing (ASN.1, X.509, etc.):**
    *   **Description:** OpenSSL processes complex data structures like ASN.1 (used in X.509 certificates). Vulnerabilities in the parsing logic can lead to buffer overflows. An attacker crafts malicious input (e.g., a certificate) to trigger the overflow, overwriting memory and executing arbitrary code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (with up-to-date OpenSSL) to Medium (with older versions or poor input validation).
    *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE, complete system compromise).
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High.
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.

*   **1.2 Exploit Memory Leaks (e.g., Heartbleed) [Critical Node]:**
    *   **Description:** Memory leaks allow attackers to read portions of server memory, potentially exposing private keys, session keys, or other confidential data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (with up-to-date OpenSSL and good key management).
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (key compromise, traffic decryption).
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (for known vulnerabilities).
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (for known vulnerabilities), Expert (for new discoveries).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Decrypt Intercepted TLS Traffic](./attack_tree_paths/2__decrypt_intercepted_tls_traffic.md)

*   **2.1 Exploit Weak Ciphers (e.g., RC4) [Critical Node]:**
    *   **Description:** Using weak or deprecated cipher suites allows attackers to decrypt intercepted traffic using known weaknesses.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (if weak ciphers are enabled).
    *   **Impact:** High (traffic decryption).
    *   **Effort:** Low.
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy.

*   **2.2 Exploit Protocol Flaws:**
    *   **2.2.1 Downgrade to Weak Protocol:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers force the connection to use an older, vulnerable TLS/SSL version (e.g., SSLv3, TLS 1.0).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium.
        *   **Impact:** High (allows exploitation of older protocol vulnerabilities).
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

    *   **2.2.2 Exploit Specific Version Flaws:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities specific to a particular TLS/SSL version, even if it's not inherently deprecated.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (with up-to-date OpenSSL).
        *   **Impact:** High (traffic decryption or other attacks).
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High.
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.
*  **2.3 Exploit Side Channels:**
    *   **2.3.1 Leaked Server Private Key [Critical Node]:**
        *   **Description:** If the server's private key is compromised (through *any* means, including side-channel attacks, memory leaks, or other vulnerabilities), the attacker can decrypt all past and future traffic.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (with good key management and physical security).
        *   **Impact:** Very High (complete traffic decryption).
        *   **Effort:** High to Very High (for side-channel attacks), lower for other compromise methods.
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert (for side-channel attacks).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (for side-channel attacks).

* **2.4 Exploit Timing Attacks (e.g., Lucky Thirteen):**
    * **Description:** Timing attacks exploit subtle differences in processing time to leak information about the secret key or plaintext.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium.
    * **Impact:** Medium to High.
    * **Effort:** Medium to High.
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard.
