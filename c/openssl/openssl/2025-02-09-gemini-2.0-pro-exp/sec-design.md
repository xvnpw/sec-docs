```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer: Developers write and modify the OpenSSL source code.
2.  Source Code: The source code is hosted on GitHub, providing version control and collaboration features.
3.  Build System: OpenSSL uses a combination of Makefiles, CMake, and Perl scripts for its build system. This allows for configuration and compilation on various platforms.
4.  Compiler: A compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) translates the source code into object files.
5.  Static Analysis: Static analysis tools are used to scan the source code for potential vulnerabilities and coding errors. Findings are reported back to the developers.
6.  Fuzzing: Fuzzing tools are used to test the library with a wide range of inputs, including malformed or unexpected data.  Vulnerabilities discovered during fuzzing are reported to the developers.
7.  Object Files: The compiler generates object files from the source code.
8.  Linker: The linker combines the object files to create the final libraries (libcrypto and libssl).
9.  Libraries: The compiled libraries (libcrypto.so, libssl.so, etc.) are the output of the build process.
10. Test Suite: OpenSSL includes a comprehensive test suite to verify the correctness and functionality of the library.
11. Test Results: The results of the test suite are checked. Failures are reported back to the developers for investigation and fixing.

Security Controls in Build Process:
