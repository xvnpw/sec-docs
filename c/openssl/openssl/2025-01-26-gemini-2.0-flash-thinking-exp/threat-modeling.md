# Threat Model Analysis for openssl/openssl

## Threat: [Exploiting Known OpenSSL Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_known_openssl_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: An attacker scans for and exploits publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific version of OpenSSL. This can be done by sending crafted network requests or local exploits targeting vulnerable functions *within OpenSSL*. For example, exploiting a buffer overflow in OpenSSL's TLS handshake processing.
Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, allowing full system control; Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing OpenSSL or the application; Information Disclosure by leaking memory contents handled by OpenSSL; Bypassing security controls implemented within OpenSSL.
OpenSSL Component Affected: Various modules depending on the vulnerability, including TLS/SSL implementation (`ssl/`, `crypto/`), ASN.1 parsing (`crypto/asn1/`), X.509 certificate handling (`crypto/x509/`), and cryptographic algorithms (`crypto/`).
Risk Severity: Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability and exploitability).
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Regularly update OpenSSL:  Immediately update OpenSSL to the latest stable version upon security updates release.
    * Vulnerability Scanning:  Use security scanning tools to proactively identify known vulnerabilities in the deployed OpenSSL version.
    * Security Monitoring: Implement intrusion detection systems to detect and respond to exploitation attempts targeting OpenSSL vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Improper Certificate Validation (Due to OpenSSL Misconfiguration or Bug)](./threats/improper_certificate_validation__due_to_openssl_misconfiguration_or_bug_.md)

Description: Due to misconfiguration of OpenSSL's certificate validation options or a bug within OpenSSL's certificate validation code, the application fails to properly validate certificates. An attacker can then present a fraudulent certificate, potentially leading to a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. This threat focuses on issues *within OpenSSL's validation process*, not application-level errors in *using* the validation functions.
Impact: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks; Data interception and manipulation; Impersonation of legitimate services.
OpenSSL Component Affected: X.509 certificate handling (`crypto/x509/`), TLS/SSL implementation (`ssl/`) - specifically the certificate verification logic within OpenSSL.
Risk Severity: High.
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Correctly Configure Certificate Verification: Ensure OpenSSL is configured for full certificate verification, including chain validation, hostname verification, and revocation checks (OCSP or CRL), according to best practices and OpenSSL documentation.
    * Use Trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs): Configure OpenSSL to trust only reputable and trusted Certificate Authorities.
    * Thorough Testing:  Thoroughly test certificate validation implementation to ensure it behaves as expected and correctly rejects invalid certificates.

## Threat: [Insufficient Random Number Generation (RNG) Entropy (Due to OpenSSL or System Issues)](./threats/insufficient_random_number_generation__rng__entropy__due_to_openssl_or_system_issues_.md)

Description: If OpenSSL's random number generator (RNG) is not properly seeded due to issues within OpenSSL itself or the underlying operating system's entropy source, the generated random numbers might be predictable or weak. This directly relates to OpenSSL's ability to generate secure random numbers.
Impact: Predictable cryptographic keys generated by OpenSSL; Session hijacking if session IDs rely on weak RNG; Weakened encryption relying on keys from weak RNG; Compromised authentication.
OpenSSL Component Affected: Random number generation module (`crypto/rand/`).
Risk Severity: High.
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Verify Proper RNG Seeding:  Ensure the operating system provides sufficient entropy and that OpenSSL is correctly configured to utilize it. Monitor for any warnings or errors related to RNG initialization in OpenSSL.
    * Use System Entropy Sources: Rely on the operating system's provided entropy sources (e.g., `/dev/urandom`) which OpenSSL typically defaults to using.
    * Monitor Entropy Availability:  In critical systems, monitor the availability of entropy on the system to ensure OpenSSL has access to sufficient randomness.
