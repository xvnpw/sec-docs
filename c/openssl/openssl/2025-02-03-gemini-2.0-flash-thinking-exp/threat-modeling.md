# Threat Model Analysis for openssl/openssl

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known OpenSSL CVEs](./threats/exploitation_of_known_openssl_cves.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Known OpenSSL CVEs
*   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in OpenSSL. They utilize existing exploit code or develop custom exploits to target specific weaknesses. This can be achieved remotely over the network or locally if the attacker has system access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), granting attackers complete control over the system.
    *   **High:** Information Disclosure, leading to leakage of sensitive data such as private keys or user information. Denial of Service (DoS), causing application unavailability. Bypassing security restrictions, undermining intended security mechanisms.
*   **OpenSSL Component Affected:** Varies greatly depending on the specific CVE. It can affect any part of OpenSSL, including: TLS/SSL protocol implementation, cryptographic algorithms, certificate handling, parsing functions, and core library functionalities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (depending on the specific CVE and its exploitability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Patching:** Apply security patches by upgrading OpenSSL to the latest stable version as soon as CVEs are announced and patches become available. This is the most critical mitigation.

Attackers can exploit these cryptographic weaknesses to compromise confidentiality or integrity. This can be achieved through cryptanalysis, downgrade attacks, or man-in-the-middle techniques.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, enabling interception and decryption of sensitive communication. Decryption of stored data encrypted with weak algorithms. Session hijacking, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users.
*   **OpenSSL Component Affected:** TLS/SSL protocol implementation within OpenSSL, cryptographic algorithm libraries (including ciphers and hash functions) provided by OpenSSL. Configuration mechanisms within OpenSSL that control cipher suite and protocol version selection.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Strong Cipher Suites:** Configure OpenSSL to exclusively use strong and modern cipher suites, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305. Avoid weak or outdated ciphers like RC4, DES, or export-grade ciphers.
    *   **Disable Weak Protocols:**  Disable support for outdated and insecure protocol versions like SSLv3, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1. Enforce TLS 1.2 or, ideally, TLS 1.3 as the minimum acceptable versions.
    *   **Cryptographic Agility in Application Design:** Design applications with cryptographic agility in mind, allowing for easy updates and migration to stronger algorithms and protocols as cryptographic best practices evolve and weaknesses are discovered.

## Threat: [Denial of Service Attacks Exploiting OpenSSL](./threats/denial_of_service_attacks_exploiting_openssl.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service Attacks Targeting OpenSSL
*   **Description:** Attackers exploit resource-intensive operations within OpenSSL or vulnerabilities in OpenSSL's handling of specific inputs to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). This can involve overwhelming the server with TLS handshake requests, sending malformed or excessively complex data that OpenSSL must process (e.g., large certificates), or triggering computationally expensive cryptographic operations, leading to resource exhaustion or application crashes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Application unavailability, service disruption, and resource exhaustion, preventing legitimate users from accessing the application or service.
    *   **Medium:** (While listed as High/Critical threats only, some DoS might be Medium if impact is temporary degradation). Temporary service degradation or reduced performance under attack.
*   **OpenSSL Component Affected:** TLS/SSL protocol implementation within OpenSSL, cryptographic algorithm libraries (especially computationally intensive algorithms), parsing functions (particularly certificate parsing), and potentially core library resource management.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Medium** (High for severe DoS leading to complete unavailability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting and Connection Limits:** Implement rate limiting on incoming connection requests and enforce connection limits to mitigate DoS attacks targeting TLS handshakes and other connection-based attacks.

## Threat: [Vulnerability Exposure due to Dependency on Outdated OpenSSL](./threats/vulnerability_exposure_due_to_dependency_on_outdated_openssl.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerability Exposure from Outdated OpenSSL Dependency
*   **Description:** Applications are deployed and remain running with outdated versions of the OpenSSL library. This makes them inherently vulnerable to all known CVEs and security flaws that have been publicly disclosed and fixed in newer OpenSSL versions since the outdated version was released.  This dependency issue can arise from slow update cycles, reliance on outdated OS-provided packages, or a failure to actively manage and update application dependencies.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical** to **High:** (depending on the specific vulnerabilities present in the outdated version) Exposure to known CVEs, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and other severe security breaches. The severity is directly tied to the criticality of the vulnerabilities present in the outdated OpenSSL version.
*   **OpenSSL Component Affected:** The entire OpenSSL library as a whole is affected, as the vulnerability resides within the outdated version being used.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (depending on the severity of vulnerabilities in the outdated version)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Establish a Robust Patch Management Process:** Implement a comprehensive patch management process to ensure timely and consistent updates of OpenSSL libraries across all environments (development, testing, staging, and production).
    *   **Utilize Dependency Management Tools:** Employ dependency management tools to effectively track and manage OpenSSL dependencies within application projects. These tools can help identify outdated versions and facilitate updates.
    *   **Consider Containerization or Static Linking:** Explore containerization technologies (like Docker) or static linking of OpenSSL to gain greater control over the OpenSSL version used by the application, decoupling it from the host operating system's OpenSSL packages and ensuring version consistency.
    *   **Implement Regular Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan deployed environments and application builds for outdated OpenSSL versions. Automate this scanning process to ensure continuous monitoring.
    *   **Automate OpenSSL Updates with Testing:** Automate the process of updating OpenSSL dependencies where feasible, but always incorporate thorough testing procedures before deploying updates to production environments to prevent unintended regressions or compatibility issues.
