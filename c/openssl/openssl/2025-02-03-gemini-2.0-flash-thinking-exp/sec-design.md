# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes we are trying to protect:

- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - Encryption keys: Highly sensitive. Compromise can lead to complete breakdown of security.
  - Data encrypted by OpenSSL: Sensitivity depends on the data itself, but often includes highly confidential information (personal data, financial data, trade secrets, etc.).
  - Digital certificates and private keys: Highly sensitive. Compromise can lead to impersonation and trust violations.
  - Source code of OpenSSL: Sensitive. Vulnerabilities in source code can be exploited.
