## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using htop - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** To execute arbitrary code within the application's context or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data managed by the application by exploiting vulnerabilities related to its use of `htop`.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

+-- Achieve Attacker's Goal: Compromise Application Using htop
    +-- **Exploit Application's Interaction with htop  *** HIGH RISK PATH *** **
        +-- **Command Injection via htop Execution  **CRITICAL NODE** *** HIGH RISK PATH *** **
            +-- Application Constructs htop Command with User-Controlled Input
                - Insight: If the application constructs the `htop` command line using unsanitized user input (e.g., filtering processes based on user-provided names), an attacker could inject arbitrary commands.
                - Actionable Insight: **Crucial:** Never construct shell commands with unsanitized user input. Use parameterized commands or dedicated libraries for process management. This is a direct vulnerability in the application's code.
                - Likelihood: Medium to High
                - Impact: High
                - Effort: Low
                - Skill Level: Low to Medium
                - Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
        +-- **Information Disclosure via htop Output  **CRITICAL NODE** *** HIGH RISK PATH *** **
            +-- htop Displays Sensitive Information Accessible to Attacker
                - Insight: If the application displays `htop`'s output directly to users without filtering, sensitive information like process arguments containing passwords or API keys might be exposed.
                - Actionable Insight: **Essential:** Never directly display raw `htop` output to users. Filter and sanitize the output to remove sensitive information before presentation.
                - Likelihood: Medium
                - Impact: High
                - Effort: Low
                - Skill Level: Low
                - Detection Difficulty: Low

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Application's Interaction with htop (High-Risk Path):** This path represents vulnerabilities arising from how the application utilizes the `htop` tool. It highlights the risks associated with directly interacting with external commands and displaying their output without proper security measures.

*   **Command Injection via htop Execution (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application dynamically builds the command used to execute `htop`, incorporating user-provided input without proper sanitization.
    *   **How it Works:** An attacker can inject malicious shell commands into the user-controlled input. When the application executes the constructed command, the injected commands are also executed by the system.
    *   **Potential Impact:** This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Why it's Critical:** This is a well-known and easily exploitable vulnerability if not handled correctly. The impact is severe, making it a top priority for mitigation.

*   **Information Disclosure via htop Output (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application displays the raw output of the `htop` command directly to users without filtering or sanitization.
    *   **How it Works:** `htop` displays various process information, including command-line arguments and potentially environment variables. If sensitive information (like passwords, API keys, or internal paths) is present in these fields, it will be visible to the user.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials or data can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to other systems, escalate privileges, or compromise user accounts.
    *   **Why it's Critical:** This vulnerability directly exposes sensitive information, and the effort to exploit it is very low if the application displays raw output. The impact of leaked credentials can be significant.
