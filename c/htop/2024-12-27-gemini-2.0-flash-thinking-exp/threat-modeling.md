## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving htop

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the `htop` utility (https://github.com/hishamhm/htop).

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected htop Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious htop Binary Replacement** | An attacker replaces the legitimate `htop` binary on the server with a malicious executable. The application unknowingly executes this malicious binary. |  **Critical:** Complete system compromise, data theft, installation of backdoors, denial of service. The attacker gains control over the server with the privileges of the application user. | **`htop` Binary** (the executable file itself) | **Critical** | * **Verify htop Binary Integrity:** Implement checksum verification or use package managers with signature verification to ensure the binary hasn't been tampered with. * **Restrict File System Permissions:** Limit write access to the directory containing the `htop` binary to only authorized users/processes. * **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit the system for unauthorized file modifications. * **Use a Trusted Source:** Obtain the `htop` binary from the official repository or a trusted package manager. |
| **htop Output Manipulation (Local)** | An attacker intercepts and modifies the output of the `htop` command *before* the application processes it on the local server. This could involve manipulating shared memory or intercepting inter-process communication. | **High:** The application receives misleading or fabricated system information, potentially leading to incorrect decisions, faulty monitoring, or exploitation of perceived vulnerabilities. For example, an attacker could hide malicious processes. | **`htop` Output** (the text stream generated by `htop`) | **High** | * **Secure Local Communication:** If the application and `htop` communicate via pipes or shared memory, ensure appropriate permissions and security measures are in place. * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust parsing logic that handles unexpected data and doesn't blindly trust the output format. Be aware that `htop` output can change between versions. * **Consider Alternative Monitoring Methods:** If output manipulation is a significant concern, explore alternative, more secure system monitoring APIs or libraries. |
| **Exposure of Sensitive System Information via htop Output** | The application displays or logs the raw output of `htop` to unauthorized users or in insecure locations. | **High:** Attackers can gain insights into the system's configuration, running processes, resource utilization, and potentially sensitive data within process arguments, aiding in further attacks or revealing confidential information. | **`htop` Output** | **High** | * **Restrict Access to htop Output:** Ensure only authorized users can view the information derived from `htop`. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. * **Sanitize and Filter Output:** Only display the necessary information. Avoid exposing raw, unfiltered `htop` output. Filter out potentially sensitive details like process arguments or usernames if not required. * **Secure Logging Practices:** If logging `htop` output, ensure logs are stored securely with appropriate access controls and encryption. * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only collect and display the minimum amount of information needed for the application's functionality. |
