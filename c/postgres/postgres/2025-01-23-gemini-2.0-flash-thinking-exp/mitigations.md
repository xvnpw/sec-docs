# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for postgres/postgres

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Password Policies (PostgreSQL Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_password_policies__postgresql_configuration_.md)

### 1. Strong Password Policies (PostgreSQL Configuration)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strong Password Policies (PostgreSQL Configuration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize PostgreSQL password policy features (if available via extensions):** Explore and implement PostgreSQL extensions or custom scripts that enforce password complexity requirements directly at the database level. This might involve checking password length, character types, and dictionary words during password creation or modification.
    2.  **Configure `password_encryption` setting:** Ensure `password_encryption` in `postgresql.conf` is set to `scram-sha-256` (or a similarly strong algorithm) for more secure password hashing compared to older methods like `md5`.
    3.  **Leverage `ALTER ROLE ... PASSWORD` options:** When creating or modifying roles, use options within the `ALTER ROLE ... PASSWORD` command to enforce password complexity if extensions or custom scripts provide such functionality.
    4.  **Educate Database Administrators:** Train DBAs on PostgreSQL's password management features and the importance of enforcing strong password policies for all database users.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Makes it significantly harder for attackers to guess passwords through brute-force or dictionary attacks against PostgreSQL authentication.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers using compromised credentials from other breaches to access the PostgreSQL database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Significant risk reduction. Strong passwords increase the computational effort required for brute-force attacks against PostgreSQL authentication.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Partial risk reduction. While strong passwords help, it doesn't completely eliminate the risk if credentials are compromised elsewhere and used against PostgreSQL.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Hypothetical Project - Basic password complexity guidelines are communicated to DBAs, but automated enforcement within PostgreSQL is not fully configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Hypothetical Project - Implementing password complexity enforcement directly within PostgreSQL using extensions or custom scripts and fully configuring `password_encryption` to `scram-sha-256` in production.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (PostgreSQL Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac___postgresql_feature_.md)

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (PostgreSQL Feature)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (PostgreSQL Feature)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Database Roles:** Create PostgreSQL roles that correspond to different levels of access needed by applications and users (e.g., `app_readonly`, `app_writer`, `report_user`, `dba_limited`).
    2.  **Grant Specific Privileges to Roles:** Use `GRANT` statements in PostgreSQL to assign granular privileges to each role.  Grant only the minimum necessary privileges (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on specific tables or schemas, `USAGE` on sequences, `EXECUTE` on functions).
    3.  **Assign Users to Roles:** Use `GRANT role_name TO username;` to assign database users to the appropriate roles.
    4.  **Utilize `DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` (Carefully):** Consider using `DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` to set default permissions for roles on objects created in the future, ensuring consistent access control. Use with caution and understand its implications.
    5.  **Regularly Review Role Permissions:** Periodically review the permissions granted to each role using `\du role_name` in `psql` or by querying system tables like `pg_roles` and `pg_class` to ensure they remain appropriate and adhere to the principle of least privilege.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents users from accessing data or performing operations within PostgreSQL beyond their authorized scope as defined by PostgreSQL's permission system.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of users gaining elevated privileges within PostgreSQL and performing administrative actions they are not supposed to within the database system itself.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential damage from malicious or compromised internal users by restricting their access to only necessary PostgreSQL database resources and operations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** High risk reduction. PostgreSQL's RBAC is a core feature for controlling data access within the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Significant risk reduction. PostgreSQL's role system limits the scope of privileges available to each user within the database.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Partial risk reduction. PostgreSQL RBAC mitigates but doesn't eliminate insider threats, as authorized users can still misuse their granted privileges within the database system.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Hypothetical Project - Basic PostgreSQL RBAC is implemented for application users, separating read-only and write access roles within PostgreSQL.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Hypothetical Project - Granular PostgreSQL RBAC for different data sets and operations within write access roles is not fully implemented. Internal administrative PostgreSQL roles and their permissions need further refinement within the database system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable SSL/TLS Encryption for Connections (PostgreSQL Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_ssltls_encryption_for_connections__postgresql_configuration_.md)

### 3. Enable SSL/TLS Encryption for Connections (PostgreSQL Configuration)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable SSL/TLS Encryption for Connections (PostgreSQL Configuration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `ssl = on` in `postgresql.conf`:**  Set `ssl = on` in the `postgresql.conf` file to enable SSL/TLS support in PostgreSQL.
    2.  **Specify Certificate and Key Files:** Configure `ssl_cert_file` and `ssl_key_file` in `postgresql.conf` to point to the paths of your server certificate and private key files. Ensure these files have appropriate permissions (readable by the `postgres` user).
    3.  **Optionally Configure CA Certificate:** If using client certificate authentication or requiring server certificate verification by clients, configure `ssl_ca_file` to point to the CA certificate file.
    4.  **Restart PostgreSQL Server:** Restart the PostgreSQL server for the SSL/TLS configuration changes to take effect.
    5.  **Enforce SSL/TLS (Optional but Recommended):** Consider setting `ssl_prefer_server_ciphers = on` and configuring `ssl_ciphers` to prioritize strong cipher suites. You can also use `pg_hba.conf` to require SSL/TLS for specific connections using `hostssl` or `hostnossl`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and eavesdropping on database traffic to and from PostgreSQL, protecting credentials and data transmitted over the network to the database server.
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Protects sensitive data in transit to and from PostgreSQL from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties monitoring network traffic to the database server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** High risk reduction. PostgreSQL's SSL/TLS encryption makes it extremely difficult for attackers to perform MitM attacks on database connections.
    *   **Eavesdropping:** High risk reduction. PostgreSQL's SSL/TLS encryption renders intercepted data unreadable without the decryption key during transmission to and from the database.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Hypothetical Project - SSL/TLS is enabled on the PostgreSQL server using self-signed certificates for internal network connections to PostgreSQL.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Hypothetical Project - Using certificates from a trusted CA for production PostgreSQL environments, enforcing SSL/TLS connections for all clients connecting to PostgreSQL via `pg_hba.conf`, and potentially configuring stronger cipher suites in PostgreSQL are missing. Client-side certificate verification against the PostgreSQL server certificate is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Database-Level Encryption (pgcrypto Extension)](./mitigation_strategies/database-level_encryption__pgcrypto_extension_.md)

### 4. Database-Level Encryption (pgcrypto Extension)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Database-Level Encryption (pgcrypto Extension)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install and Enable `pgcrypto` Extension:** Ensure the `pgcrypto` extension is installed (usually part of PostgreSQL contrib packages) and enable it in the target database using `CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;`.
    2.  **Choose Encryption Functions:** Select appropriate encryption functions from `pgcrypto` based on security needs. Common choices include:
        *   `pgp_sym_encrypt`/`pgp_sym_decrypt`: For symmetric encryption using passphrase-based keys.
        *   `aes_encrypt`/`aes_decrypt`: For symmetric encryption using AES algorithms with raw keys.
        *   `crypt`/`gen_salt`: For one-way hashing of passwords.
    3.  **Encrypt Sensitive Data in Database:** Modify database schema or application logic to use `pgcrypto` functions to encrypt sensitive data before storing it in PostgreSQL. This might involve using `UPDATE` or `INSERT` statements with encryption functions.
    4.  **Implement Decryption Logic:** Implement application-side or database-side (e.g., views, functions) decryption logic using corresponding `pgcrypto` decryption functions to retrieve and use the encrypted data from PostgreSQL when needed.
    5.  **Secure Key Management (Crucial):**  Establish a secure and robust key management system *outside* of PostgreSQL to store, manage, and rotate encryption keys used by `pgcrypto`.  *Never* hardcode keys in SQL or application code.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach at Rest (High Severity):** Protects sensitive data stored within the PostgreSQL database files if the storage media is compromised (e.g., stolen backups, physical drive theft, unauthorized access to database files).
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Database Files (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users with direct access to PostgreSQL database files on disk from reading sensitive data directly, as it will be encrypted within the database files.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach at Rest:** Significant risk reduction. `pgcrypto` encryption makes data within PostgreSQL database files unreadable even if those files are accessed without proper decryption keys.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Database Files:** Significant risk reduction. `pgcrypto` protects data from unauthorized access at the file system level for PostgreSQL database files.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Hypothetical Project - `pgcrypto` extension is enabled in development and staging PostgreSQL environments.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Hypothetical Project - Encryption of specific sensitive columns in production PostgreSQL database tables using `pgcrypto` is not yet implemented. A secure key management system for `pgcrypto` keys is not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular PostgreSQL Security Audits and Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_postgresql_security_audits_and_updates.md)

### 5. Regular PostgreSQL Security Audits and Updates

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular PostgreSQL Security Audits and Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Audit Schedule:** Define a regular schedule (e.g., quarterly, semi-annually) for dedicated PostgreSQL security audits.
    2.  **Check PostgreSQL Version and Updates:** Regularly check for new PostgreSQL releases and security updates on the official PostgreSQL website and security mailing lists.
    3.  **Review `postgresql.conf` Configuration:** Audit the `postgresql.conf` file for secure settings, including authentication, logging, connection limits, and other security-relevant parameters.
    4.  **Audit `pg_hba.conf` Configuration:** Thoroughly review the `pg_hba.conf` file to ensure access control rules are correctly configured and restrict access to PostgreSQL to only authorized networks and users.
    5.  **Review User and Role Permissions:** Audit PostgreSQL user and role permissions to verify adherence to the principle of least privilege. Use `psql` commands or scripts to list roles and their granted privileges.
    6.  **Examine Installed Extensions:** Review the list of installed PostgreSQL extensions using `\dx` in `psql` and assess the security implications of each extension. Ensure only necessary and trusted extensions are installed.
    7.  **Apply PostgreSQL Security Updates:** When security updates are released for PostgreSQL, plan and apply them promptly to production and non-production PostgreSQL servers following a tested update procedure.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known PostgreSQL Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting publicly known security vulnerabilities in the PostgreSQL software itself.
    *   **PostgreSQL Configuration Errors (Medium Severity):** Helps identify and correct misconfigurations in PostgreSQL settings (`postgresql.conf`, `pg_hba.conf`) that could introduce security weaknesses.
    *   **PostgreSQL Privilege Creep (Low Severity):** Regular audits help detect and rectify unintended privilege escalation within PostgreSQL user and role permissions over time.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known PostgreSQL Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Applying PostgreSQL updates patches known vulnerabilities in the database software.
    *   **PostgreSQL Configuration Errors:** Significant risk reduction. Audits identify and correct misconfigurations in PostgreSQL server settings.
    *   **PostgreSQL Privilege Creep:** Partial risk reduction. Audits help maintain least privilege within the PostgreSQL database over time.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Hypothetical Project - PostgreSQL version is tracked, and updates are applied during maintenance windows, but immediate application of security updates is not always prioritized. Basic configuration reviews are performed occasionally.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Hypothetical Project - Regular, scheduled, and documented PostgreSQL security audits are not formally implemented. Proactive monitoring of PostgreSQL security announcements and a formal process for applying security updates promptly are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Limits (PostgreSQL Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/connection_limits__postgresql_configuration_.md)

### 6. Connection Limits (PostgreSQL Configuration)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Connection Limits (PostgreSQL Configuration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Application Connection Needs:**  Assess the typical and peak number of concurrent connections required by applications connecting to PostgreSQL.
    2.  **Set `max_connections` in `postgresql.conf`:** Configure the `max_connections` parameter in `postgresql.conf` to limit the maximum number of concurrent client connections allowed to the PostgreSQL server. Set this value to a reasonable limit based on application needs and server resources, preventing excessive connection attempts.
    3.  **Consider `superuser_reserved_connections`:**  Review and potentially adjust `superuser_reserved_connections` to reserve connections for superuser accounts, ensuring administrative access even under high connection load.
    4.  **Restart PostgreSQL Server:** Restart the PostgreSQL server for the `max_connections` configuration change to take effect.
    5.  **Monitor Connection Usage:** Monitor PostgreSQL connection usage metrics to ensure the `max_connections` limit is appropriately set and not causing connection exhaustion issues for legitimate application traffic under normal or peak load. Adjust the limit if needed based on monitoring data.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Connection Exhaustion Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the PostgreSQL server by opening a large number of connections, potentially causing denial of service for legitimate applications and users attempting to connect to the database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Connection Exhaustion DoS:** Significant risk reduction. Limiting `max_connections` in PostgreSQL effectively prevents simple connection exhaustion attacks against the database server itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Hypothetical Project - `max_connections` is set to a default value in `postgresql.conf`, but it's not specifically tuned based on application connection requirements or DoS mitigation considerations.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Hypothetical Project - `max_connections` needs to be properly assessed and configured based on application load testing and DoS mitigation planning. Active monitoring of PostgreSQL connection usage to inform `max_connections` tuning is not implemented.
