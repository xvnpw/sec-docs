### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.3: Credential Stuffing (Reused Passwords)

#### 4.1. Attack Description

**Credential Stuffing** is a type of brute-force attack where attackers use lists of usernames and passwords compromised from other data breaches to attempt to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on a different application or service. The underlying assumption is that a significant portion of users reuse the same passwords across multiple online accounts.

**In the context of a PostgreSQL application:**

1. **Data Breach Source:** Attackers obtain large lists of username/password combinations from data breaches at other websites or services (e.g., social media platforms, e-commerce sites, forums). These lists are readily available on the dark web or through underground communities.
2. **Target Identification:** Attackers identify applications that use PostgreSQL for user authentication. This could be any web application, API, or service that relies on PostgreSQL to manage user credentials.
3. **Automated Attack Execution:** Attackers utilize automated tools and scripts to systematically attempt login using the compromised credentials against the target PostgreSQL application's login endpoint. This endpoint could be a web login form, an API endpoint for authentication, or even direct PostgreSQL connection attempts if exposed.
4. **Credential Validation:** The application attempts to authenticate the user with the provided username and password against the PostgreSQL database.
5. **Successful Login (Compromise):** If a user has reused a password that is present in the attacker's list, the authentication will succeed, granting the attacker unauthorized access to the user's account within the PostgreSQL application.
6. **Post-Compromise Actions:** Once inside an account, attackers can perform various malicious actions depending on the application's functionality and the user's privileges. This could include:
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Accessing and stealing sensitive data stored in the PostgreSQL database.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Attempting to gain higher privileges within the application or database.
    * **Account Takeover:** Changing account details, locking out the legitimate user, and using the account for further malicious activities.
    * **Application Abuse:** Using the compromised account to abuse application features, potentially causing denial of service or other disruptions.

#### 4.2. Vulnerability Analysis in PostgreSQL Applications

Several vulnerabilities in a typical PostgreSQL application setup can exacerbate the risk of credential stuffing attacks:

* **Weak Password Policies:**
    * **Lack of Complexity Requirements:** If the application or PostgreSQL itself does not enforce strong password complexity requirements (length, character types), users are more likely to choose weak and easily guessable passwords, increasing the chances of reuse and compromise.
    * **No Password Expiration/Rotation:**  Without mandatory password rotation policies, users may use the same compromised password for extended periods, increasing the window of opportunity for attackers.
* **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  The absence of MFA is a significant vulnerability. Even if a password is compromised and used in a credential stuffing attack, MFA adds an extra layer of security, requiring a second factor (e.g., OTP, biometric) to gain access.
* **Insufficient Rate Limiting on Login Attempts:**  If the application does not implement rate limiting on login attempts, attackers can perform a large number of login attempts in a short period without being blocked, making credential stuffing attacks more efficient.
* **Lack of Account Lockout Mechanisms:**  Without account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts, attackers can continuously try different credentials without fear of being temporarily blocked.
* **Inadequate Logging and Monitoring:**  Insufficient logging of failed login attempts and suspicious activity makes it harder to detect and respond to credential stuffing attacks in progress.
* **Predictable Usernames:** If usernames are easily guessable (e.g., based on email addresses or sequential numbers), attackers can more effectively target credential stuffing attacks.
* **Exposed Login Endpoints:**  Publicly accessible and easily discoverable login endpoints make it easier for attackers to target the application.
* **Client-Side Vulnerabilities:** While less directly related to PostgreSQL, vulnerabilities in the client-side application (e.g., XSS) could potentially be exploited to steal credentials or facilitate credential stuffing attacks.

#### 4.3. Risk Assessment Review

The provided risk assessment for Credential Stuffing (Reused Passwords) is:

* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Critical
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low
* **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

**Justification and Elaboration:**

* **Likelihood: Medium:**  The likelihood is considered medium because while password reuse is a common user behavior, not all users reuse passwords across all services. However, the sheer volume of breached credentials available online makes it highly probable that some users of a PostgreSQL application will have reused compromised passwords.  The ease of obtaining and using these lists further contributes to the medium likelihood.
* **Impact: Critical:** The impact is critical because successful credential stuffing can lead to full account takeover, data breaches, and significant disruption to the application and its users.  Compromised accounts can be used for a wide range of malicious activities, potentially causing severe financial, reputational, and operational damage.
* **Effort: Low:**  The effort required to perform credential stuffing attacks is low. Attackers can leverage readily available tools, scripts, and breached credential lists.  The automation of these attacks makes them scalable and cost-effective for attackers.
* **Skill Level: Low:**  The skill level required is also low.  Basic scripting knowledge and access to readily available resources are sufficient to launch credential stuffing attacks.  No advanced hacking skills or deep technical expertise are typically needed.
* **Detection Difficulty: Hard:**  Detecting credential stuffing attacks can be challenging.  Legitimate users may occasionally mistype their passwords, leading to failed login attempts.  Distinguishing between legitimate failed logins and credential stuffing attempts requires sophisticated monitoring and analysis techniques.  Attackers can also employ techniques to evade detection, such as using proxy servers or distributed botnets.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies for PostgreSQL Applications

To effectively mitigate the risk of credential stuffing attacks against PostgreSQL applications, a multi-layered approach is necessary, encompassing preventative, detective, and responsive measures:

**4.4.1. Preventative Measures:**

* **Enforce Strong Password Policies (Application & PostgreSQL Level):**
    * **Complexity Requirements:** Implement and enforce strong password complexity requirements (minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters) at both the application level (during registration and password changes) and potentially at the PostgreSQL database level using password policies (if supported by the PostgreSQL authentication method).
    * **Password Length Limits:**  Set reasonable maximum password lengths to prevent excessively long passwords that might be cumbersome for users but offer minimal added security.
    * **Password History:**  Prevent password reuse by enforcing password history policies, ensuring users cannot reuse recently used passwords.
    * **Regular Password Audits:** Periodically audit user passwords in the PostgreSQL database to identify weak or compromised passwords. Tools like `pgaudit` or custom scripts can assist with this.
* **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    * **Mandatory MFA:**  Make MFA mandatory for all users, especially for accounts with elevated privileges.
    * **Variety of MFA Methods:** Offer a variety of MFA methods (e.g., TOTP, SMS, email, hardware tokens) to cater to different user preferences and security needs.
    * **MFA for PostgreSQL Connections:**  Consider implementing MFA for direct PostgreSQL connections, especially for remote access or administrative accounts.
* **Implement Robust Rate Limiting:**
    * **Login Attempt Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on login attempts at the application level. Limit the number of failed login attempts from a single IP address or user account within a specific timeframe.
    * **Progressive Backoff:**  Implement progressive backoff mechanisms, increasing the delay after each failed login attempt.
* **Implement Account Lockout Mechanisms:**
    * **Temporary Account Lockout:**  Temporarily lock user accounts after a certain number of consecutive failed login attempts.
    * **Lockout Duration:**  Define a reasonable lockout duration (e.g., 15-30 minutes) before automatically unlocking the account or requiring manual intervention.
    * **User Notification:**  Notify users when their accounts are locked out due to failed login attempts.
* **Password Breach Monitoring and Password Rotation Policies:**
    * **Password Breach Monitoring:**  Integrate with password breach monitoring services (e.g., Have I Been Pwned API) to proactively identify users whose passwords have been compromised in known data breaches.
    * **Forced Password Rotation:**  Implement policies to force password rotation for users identified as having compromised passwords or periodically for all users as a proactive measure.
    * **User Education:**  Educate users about the risks of password reuse and encourage them to use unique, strong passwords and password managers.
* **Secure Password Storage:**
    * **Strong Hashing Algorithms:**  Ensure passwords are securely hashed using strong, salted hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) before storing them in the PostgreSQL database.
    * **Avoid Reversible Encryption:** Never store passwords in plain text or using reversible encryption.
* **Minimize Exposed Login Endpoints:**
    * **Secure Login Pages (HTTPS):**  Ensure all login pages and authentication endpoints are served over HTTPS to protect credentials in transit.
    * **Limit Public Exposure:**  If possible, limit the public exposure of login endpoints, especially for administrative interfaces. Consider using VPNs or IP whitelisting for administrative access.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Vulnerability Assessments:**  Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address potential weaknesses in the application's security posture, including vulnerabilities related to authentication and credential management.

**4.4.2. Detective Measures:**

* **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring:**
    * **Log Failed Login Attempts:**  Log all failed login attempts, including timestamps, usernames, source IP addresses, and user agents.
    * **Monitor for Suspicious Login Patterns:**  Implement monitoring systems to detect suspicious login patterns, such as:
        * High volumes of failed login attempts from a single IP address or for a single username.
        * Login attempts from unusual geographic locations.
        * Login attempts during unusual hours.
        * Rapid succession of login attempts with different usernames.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Consider using a SIEM system to aggregate logs from various sources (application, PostgreSQL, network devices) and correlate events to detect potential credential stuffing attacks.
* **Alerting and Notifications:**
    * **Real-time Alerts:**  Set up real-time alerts for suspicious login activity to enable prompt investigation and response.
    * **Admin Notifications:**  Notify administrators of potential credential stuffing attacks or account compromise attempts.

**4.4.3. Responsive Measures:**

* **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and maintain an incident response plan specifically for credential stuffing attacks, outlining procedures for:
    * **Detection and Confirmation:**  Verifying suspected credential stuffing attacks.
    * **Containment:**  Locking compromised accounts, blocking malicious IP addresses, and isolating affected systems.
    * **Eradication:**  Removing malware or attacker backdoors, if any.
    * **Recovery:**  Restoring systems and data, resetting passwords, and notifying affected users.
    * **Post-Incident Analysis:**  Analyzing the incident to identify root causes and improve security measures.
* **User Communication:**
    * **Notify Affected Users:**  Promptly notify users whose accounts may have been compromised due to credential stuffing and guide them through password reset and security best practices.
    * **General Security Awareness Communication:**  Communicate with all users about the risks of password reuse and best practices for online security.

#### 4.5. Specific Recommendations for PostgreSQL

While credential stuffing is primarily an application-level vulnerability, PostgreSQL configurations can contribute to overall security:

* **PostgreSQL Authentication Methods:**  Choose strong PostgreSQL authentication methods (e.g., `scram-sha-256`) and avoid weaker methods like `md5` or `password`.
* **Connection Limits:**  Configure connection limits in `postgresql.conf` to prevent resource exhaustion from large-scale credential stuffing attempts.
* **Audit Logging:**  Enable PostgreSQL audit logging using extensions like `pgaudit` to track authentication attempts and other security-relevant events at the database level. This can provide valuable forensic information in case of a successful attack.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Implement granular RBAC in PostgreSQL to limit the privileges of compromised accounts, minimizing the potential impact of a successful credential stuffing attack.
* **Network Security:**  Ensure proper network security measures are in place to protect the PostgreSQL server, such as firewalls and network segmentation, limiting access to authorized networks and applications.
