### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain Unauthorized Access to PostgreSQL

**4.1. Attack Vector Breakdown:**

The "Gain Unauthorized Access to PostgreSQL" attack vector can be further broken down into several sub-vectors, each representing a different approach an attacker might take:

* **4.1.1. Credential-Based Attacks:**
    * **Techniques:**
        * **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Attempting to guess usernames and passwords by systematically trying combinations.
        * **Dictionary Attacks:** Using lists of common passwords and usernames to attempt login.
        * **Credential Stuffing:**  Using compromised username/password pairs obtained from data breaches on other services.
        * **Password Spraying:**  Trying a few common passwords against a large number of usernames.
        * **Phishing:**  Tricking users into revealing their credentials through deceptive emails or websites.
        * **Keylogging:**  Installing malware to record keystrokes, including passwords.
        * **Social Engineering:** Manipulating users into divulging their credentials.
    * **PostgreSQL Aspects:**
