# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust, reliable, and feature-rich open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
  - Maintain a high level of data integrity and consistency.
  - Offer strong performance and scalability to handle diverse workloads.
  - Foster a vibrant and active community of users and developers.
  - Ensure long-term sustainability and evolution of the project.
- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
  - Data loss due to system failures, corruption, or malicious attacks.
  - System downtime and service unavailability impacting applications relying on the database.
  - Performance degradation leading to slow application response times and user dissatisfaction.
  - Vulnerabilities in the database software being exploited by attackers.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies or build processes.
  - Legal and regulatory compliance issues related to data privacy and security.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions to the codebase. Implemented as part of the PostgreSQL development workflow on GitHub.
  - security control: Access control to the GitHub repository, managed by project maintainers. Implemented via GitHub permissions.
  - security control: Community involvement in identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities. Described in PostgreSQL security policy and communication channels.
  - security control: Regular updates and patching of the database software to address known vulnerabilities. Documented in release notes and security advisories.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature inherently means vulnerability details become publicly available upon discovery, potentially increasing the window of exploitation before patches are widely applied.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching, which can be subject to volunteer availability and response times.
  - accepted risk: Complexity of a large codebase can make it challenging to identify and eliminate all potential vulnerabilities proactively.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated static application security testing (SAST) tools in the development pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits by independent security experts to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
  - security control: Establish a formal security incident response plan to effectively handle and mitigate security incidents.
  - security control: Consider implementing a bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Enhance supply chain security measures for dependencies and build processes to prevent malicious code injection.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - requirement: Support for strong password policies and enforcement.
    - requirement: Multiple authentication methods including password-based, certificate-based, and external authentication mechanisms (e.g., Kerberos, LDAP, PAM).
    - requirement: Protection against brute-force attacks on authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user privileges and permissions.
    - requirement: Granular permission system to control access to database objects (databases, schemas, tables, functions, etc.).
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege should be enforced in default configurations and user guidance.
  - Input Validation:
    - requirement: Robust input validation mechanisms to prevent SQL injection attacks.
    - requirement: Parameterized queries or prepared statements should be the recommended and default approach for database interactions.
    - requirement: Input validation should be applied to all user-supplied inputs, including data from applications and administrative interfaces.
  - Cryptography:
    - requirement: Support for encryption of data at rest, including database files and backups.
    - requirement: Support for encryption of data in transit using TLS/SSL for client-server communication.
    - requirement: Secure key management practices for encryption keys.
    - requirement: Use of strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
