# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for postgres/postgres

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define database roles *within PostgreSQL* that correspond to different application user roles or functionalities (e.g., using `CREATE ROLE`).
    2.  Grant specific privileges *within PostgreSQL* to each role using `GRANT` statements, limiting access to only the necessary tables, schemas, and operations. For example, grant `SELECT` on specific tables to a `read_only_role`.
    3.  Create PostgreSQL users (using `CREATE USER`) for applications or individual users.
    4.  Assign users to appropriate roles using `GRANT role_name TO user_name;`.  This ensures users inherit the permissions defined by the roles.
    5.  Regularly review and update role definitions and user role assignments *directly within PostgreSQL* using SQL queries to manage roles and permissions. Utilize PostgreSQL's built-in functions and views for role and permission management (e.g., `pg_roles`, `pg_tables`).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access - Severity: High
    *   Privilege Escalation (within database context) - Severity: Medium
    *   Data Modification or Deletion by Unauthorized Users - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access: High Reduction -  PostgreSQL's RBAC effectively restricts access based on defined roles within the database itself.
    *   Privilege Escalation (within database context): Medium Reduction - Limits potential damage from privilege escalation attempts within PostgreSQL by enforcing least privilege from the outset.
    *   Data Modification or Deletion by Unauthorized Users: High Reduction - PostgreSQL's permission system directly prevents unauthorized data manipulation at the database level.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic roles like `read_only` and `read_write` exist in PostgreSQL, but finer-grained roles for specific application features are missing. Implemented in [Specific Component - e.g., database initialization scripts].
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing granular roles in PostgreSQL for [Project Area - e.g., administrative functions], [Project Area - e.g., specific module requiring limited data modification]. Need to define more specific roles *directly in PostgreSQL* and assign application users to them appropriately.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies for Database Users](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies_for_database_users.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure PostgreSQL server settings to enforce password complexity. While PostgreSQL doesn't have built-in password complexity checks, consider using extensions like `passwordcheck` (if necessary and after careful evaluation of its security and maintenance) or rely on strong password generation and management practices.
    2.  Establish and enforce strong password requirements for all PostgreSQL database users, including application users and administrative users. Communicate these requirements to database administrators and developers.
    3.  Utilize PostgreSQL's modern password authentication methods like `scram-sha-256` in `pg_hba.conf` for improved security over older methods like `md5`. Configure `default_password_lifetime` in `postgresql.conf` to enforce password expiration if required.
    4.  Encourage or mandate the use of password management tools for administrative accounts to generate and store strong, unique passwords securely *outside of the application code*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-Force Password Attacks - Severity: Medium
    *   Credential Stuffing - Severity: Medium
    *   Unauthorized Access due to Weak Passwords - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-Force Password Attacks: Medium Reduction - PostgreSQL's authentication methods and strong password policies make brute-force attacks significantly harder against the database itself.
    *   Credential Stuffing: Medium Reduction - Reduces the likelihood of successful credential stuffing attacks against PostgreSQL user accounts.
    *   Unauthorized Access due to Weak Passwords: Medium Reduction - Decreases the risk of unauthorized access to PostgreSQL due to easily guessable or weak passwords.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. PostgreSQL is configured to use `scram-sha-256`. Basic password complexity is encouraged but not strictly enforced *at the PostgreSQL level beyond authentication method*. Implemented in [Specific Component - e.g., `pg_hba.conf` configuration].
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing strict password complexity enforcement *directly within PostgreSQL* (consider extensions if deemed necessary and secure). Need to implement password rotation policies using `default_password_lifetime` in `postgresql.conf` if required by security policy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Connection Methods (TLS/SSL)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_connection_methods__tlsssl_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure the PostgreSQL server to require TLS/SSL connections by setting `ssl = on` in `postgresql.conf`.
    2.  Generate or obtain valid TLS/SSL certificates for the PostgreSQL server. Configure `ssl_cert`, `ssl_key`, and `ssl_ca_file` (if client certificate verification is needed) in `postgresql.conf` to point to the certificate and key files.
    3.  Configure `pg_hba.conf` to enforce TLS/SSL connections for specific users, databases, or hosts using the `hostssl` or `hostnossl` connection types.
    4.  Regularly review and update TLS/SSL certificates *on the PostgreSQL server* to maintain security and prevent certificate expiration.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks - Severity: High
    *   Data Interception in Transit - Severity: High
    *   Credential Sniffing - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: High Reduction - PostgreSQL's TLS/SSL configuration prevents MITM attacks on connections to the database server.
    *   Data Interception in Transit: High Reduction - PostgreSQL's TLS/SSL encryption protects data transmitted to and from the database server.
    *   Credential Sniffing: High Reduction - PostgreSQL's secure connection methods protect database credentials during transmission.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in [Project Environment - e.g., Production environment]. TLS/SSL is enabled in `postgresql.conf` and enforced in `pg_hba.conf` for production PostgreSQL instance.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in [Project Environment - e.g., Staging and Development environments]. TLS/SSL should be enabled and configured *on PostgreSQL servers* in all environments for consistent security practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep PostgreSQL Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep_postgresql_up-to-date.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a process for regularly monitoring PostgreSQL security advisories and release notes from the PostgreSQL project website and mailing lists.
    2.  Schedule regular updates of the PostgreSQL server to the latest stable version, including minor and major version upgrades. *This involves patching the PostgreSQL server software itself.*
    3.  Test updates in a staging environment *that mirrors the production PostgreSQL configuration* before applying them to production to ensure compatibility and minimize disruption.
    4.  Automate the PostgreSQL update process where possible using OS package managers or configuration management tools to ensure timely patching and reduce manual effort *on the PostgreSQL server*.
    5.  Maintain an inventory of PostgreSQL installations and their versions to track update status and identify PostgreSQL servers that need patching.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known PostgreSQL Vulnerabilities - Severity: High (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   Privilege Escalation via PostgreSQL Bugs - Severity: High (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   Denial of Service via PostgreSQL Bugs - Severity: Medium (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known PostgreSQL Vulnerabilities: High Reduction - Updating PostgreSQL patches known vulnerabilities *within the database server software*.
    *   Privilege Escalation via PostgreSQL Bugs: High Reduction - Addresses bugs in PostgreSQL that could be used for privilege escalation *within the database system*.
    *   Denial of Service via PostgreSQL Bugs: Medium Reduction - Fixes bugs in PostgreSQL that could be exploited for DoS attacks *targeting the database server*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. PostgreSQL server is updated periodically, but the process is manual and updates are not always applied promptly after releases. Implemented in [Project Area - e.g., server maintenance procedures].
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing automated PostgreSQL update process and proactive vulnerability monitoring *specifically for PostgreSQL advisories*. Need to implement automated patching for PostgreSQL and establish a system for tracking PostgreSQL versions and security advisories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Permissions of Database User](./mitigation_strategies/limit_permissions_of_database_user.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Create a dedicated PostgreSQL user (using `CREATE USER`) specifically for the application to connect to the database.
    2.  Grant this application user only the *minimum* necessary privileges required for the application to function using `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements. Avoid granting broad permissions like `SUPERUSER` or `CREATE DATABASE` to application users.
    3.  Restrict permissions to specific tables, schemas, columns (using column-level privileges if supported and necessary), and operations (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) that the application actually needs to perform *using PostgreSQL's permission system*.
    4.  If possible, use PostgreSQL views (using `CREATE VIEW`) to further restrict access to specific data subsets instead of granting direct access to base tables. Grant permissions on views instead of base tables.
    5.  Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to the application user *directly within PostgreSQL* using SQL queries and PostgreSQL's system views to ensure they remain minimal and appropriate.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (Impact Amplification) - Severity: High (when combined with SQL Injection vulnerability)
    *   Unauthorized Data Modification or Deletion - Severity: High
    *   Data Breach (Reduced Scope) - Severity: High
    *   Privilege Escalation (Reduced Impact within database) - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection (Impact Amplification): High Reduction - Limiting PostgreSQL user permissions restricts the damage an attacker can do *within the database* even if SQL injection is successful.
    *   Unauthorized Data Modification or Deletion: High Reduction - PostgreSQL's permission system prevents the application user (and potentially an attacker exploiting application vulnerabilities) from modifying or deleting data outside of its granted scope *within the database*.
    *   Data Breach (Reduced Scope): Medium Reduction - Limits the scope of a potential data breach if the application user is compromised, as access is restricted to a subset of data and operations *within PostgreSQL*.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Reduced Impact within database): Medium Reduction - Reduces the potential impact of privilege escalation *within the PostgreSQL database context*, as the application user starts with limited privileges.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Application user has restricted permissions in PostgreSQL, but further granularity could be achieved by limiting column-level access and wider use of views *within PostgreSQL*. Implemented in [Specific Component - e.g., database user and permission setup scripts].
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing column-level permission restrictions in PostgreSQL and wider use of PostgreSQL views to limit data access. Need to refine application user permissions *within PostgreSQL* to be even more restrictive and implement views for data access control where applicable *using PostgreSQL features*.
