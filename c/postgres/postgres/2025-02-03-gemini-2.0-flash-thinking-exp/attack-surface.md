# Attack Surface Analysis for postgres/postgres

## Attack Surface: [Network Exposure of PostgreSQL Port](./attack_surfaces/network_exposure_of_postgresql_port.md)

*   **Description:**  PostgreSQL's default port (5432) is exposed to the network, potentially including untrusted networks or the internet, allowing direct connections to the database server.
    *   **PostgreSQL Contribution:** PostgreSQL, by design, listens on a configurable port to accept client connections. Misconfiguration of `listen_addresses` and lack of network security measures directly expose PostgreSQL.
    *   **Example:** A PostgreSQL server configured to listen on all interfaces (`listen_addresses = '*'`) without a firewall is directly accessible from the internet on port 5432. Attackers can attempt to connect and exploit authentication or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:**
            *   **Strict Firewalling:** Implement robust firewall rules to restrict access to port 5432, allowing connections only from trusted sources (e.g., application servers within a private network).
            *   **`listen_addresses` Configuration:** Configure `listen_addresses` in `postgresql.conf` to listen only on specific, internal network interfaces, avoiding exposure to public networks.
            *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the PostgreSQL server within a secure, segmented network, minimizing its exposure to untrusted networks.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default PostgreSQL Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_postgresql_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default passwords for administrative accounts (like the `postgres` user) or employing weak passwords for any PostgreSQL database user.
    *   **PostgreSQL Contribution:** PostgreSQL creates a default `postgres` superuser during installation. The security of this account and all other database users is directly managed by PostgreSQL's authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Example:** An administrator fails to change the default password for the `postgres` user. Attackers leverage known default credentials or brute-force attempts to gain superuser access to the database.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the database, complete data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, potential takeover of the underlying server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:**
            *   **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Mandate strong, unique passwords for all PostgreSQL users, especially administrative accounts.
            *   **Regular Password Rotation:** Implement and enforce regular password rotation policies for database accounts.
            *   **Secure Credential Management:** Utilize secure credential management practices, avoiding hardcoding passwords in applications and considering secrets management systems.
            *   **Disable/Restrict Default Accounts:** If the default `postgres` user is not essential for application operation, consider disabling or renaming it and creating more restricted administrative accounts.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation within PostgreSQL](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_within_postgresql.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within PostgreSQL itself to gain higher privileges than initially authorized within the database system.
    *   **PostgreSQL Contribution:** PostgreSQL's role-based access control system, potential vulnerabilities in its core code or extensions, and misconfigurations in permissions directly contribute to this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a low-privilege database account. They then exploit a known vulnerability in a PostgreSQL extension or a misconfigured role permission to escalate their privileges to superuser, granting them full database control.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the database, complete data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, potential takeover of the underlying server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:**
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database Roles):**  Carefully design and implement PostgreSQL roles and permissions, granting users only the minimum necessary privileges. Regularly audit and review role assignments.
            *   **Disable Unnecessary Extensions:** Disable or remove any PostgreSQL extensions that are not actively used, especially if they are from untrusted sources or known to have vulnerabilities.
            *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of PostgreSQL configurations, roles, permissions, and installed extensions to identify and remediate potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
            *   **Prompt Patching and Updates:**  Apply security patches and updates for PostgreSQL and its extensions immediately to address known vulnerabilities that could be exploited for privilege escalation.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks against PostgreSQL (PostgreSQL Specific Vectors)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_against_postgresql__postgresql_specific_vectors_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks specifically targeting PostgreSQL's resource management or vulnerabilities to cause service disruption and prevent legitimate users from accessing the database.
    *   **PostgreSQL Contribution:** PostgreSQL's resource limits, query processing logic, and potential vulnerabilities in its code can be exploited for DoS attacks. Misconfigurations can also exacerbate DoS risks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in PostgreSQL's query parser to send specially crafted queries that consume excessive server resources, leading to performance degradation or server crash. Or, they exhaust connection limits by rapidly opening connections.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application downtime, data unavailability, potential financial losses.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:**
            *   **Resource Limits Configuration:** Properly configure PostgreSQL resource limits in `postgresql.conf` (e.g., `max_connections`, `shared_buffers`, `work_mem`) to prevent resource exhaustion.
            *   **Query Optimization and Monitoring:** Optimize SQL queries to prevent slow queries from consuming excessive resources. Implement query monitoring to detect and address performance issues.
            *   **Connection Limiting:** Configure connection limits within PostgreSQL or using external tools to prevent connection floods.
            *   **Regular Security Updates:** Apply security patches to address potential DoS vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL itself.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Connections to PostgreSQL](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_connections_to_postgresql.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between applications and the PostgreSQL server occurs without encryption, making it susceptible to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks on the network.
    *   **PostgreSQL Contribution:** PostgreSQL, by default, does not enforce encryption. The configuration of SSL/TLS encryption is a direct PostgreSQL configuration responsibility.
    *   **Example:** An application connects to PostgreSQL over an unencrypted connection. An attacker on the network intercepts the communication and captures database credentials or sensitive data transmitted in plaintext.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, credential theft, data manipulation, loss of confidentiality and data integrity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:**
            *   **Enable and Enforce SSL/TLS Encryption:** Configure PostgreSQL to enable and enforce SSL/TLS encryption for all client connections by setting `ssl = on` and appropriate `ssl_cert`, `ssl_key`, and `ssl_ca_file` settings in `postgresql.conf`.
            *   **Client-Side SSL/TLS Verification:** Ensure applications are configured to connect to PostgreSQL using SSL/TLS and to verify the server certificate to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
