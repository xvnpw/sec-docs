## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit PostgreSQL Server Vulnerabilities -> Remote Code Execution (RCE):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_postgresql_server_vulnerabilities_-_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the PostgreSQL server software itself to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **High-Risk Path:** This path is high-risk due to the potential for complete system compromise if RCE is achieved.
*   **Critical Node: Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Achieving RCE grants the attacker significant control over the PostgreSQL server and potentially the underlying system.

    *   **Exploit Unpatched Vulnerability (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Targeting known vulnerabilities in the PostgreSQL server that have not been patched.
        *   **High-Risk Path:**  Organizations that are slow to apply security patches are highly susceptible to this path.
        *   **Critical Node: Identify and Exploit Known CVE:** Leveraging publicly known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for which exploits may be readily available.

    *   **Obtain Valid Database Credentials (Critical Node - Stepping Stone):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  While not directly an RCE exploit, obtaining valid credentials is often a necessary step to exploit post-authentication RCE vulnerabilities.
        *   **Critical Node:**  Credentials act as a key to unlock further exploitation possibilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit PostgreSQL Configuration/Deployment:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_postgresql_configurationdeployment.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging insecure configurations or deployments of the PostgreSQL server to gain unauthorized access or control.
*   **High-Risk Path:** Misconfigurations are common and can have severe security implications.

    *   **Weak Authentication (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weak or default passwords to gain unauthorized access.
        *   **High-Risk Path:**  Using weak passwords significantly lowers the barrier for attackers.
        *   **Critical Node: Weak Authentication:**  A fundamental security control failure.
            *   **Critical Node: Default Credentials:**  Using default credentials provided by the software vendor, which are widely known.

    *   **Insecure Access Control (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Gaining unauthorized access due to overly permissive configurations in `pg_hba.conf` or excessive privileges granted to users/roles.
        *   **High-Risk Path:**  Allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

    *   **Outdated PostgreSQL Version (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities present in older, unpatched versions of PostgreSQL.
        *   **High-Risk Path:**  Organizations that fail to update their PostgreSQL instances are vulnerable to known exploits.
        *   **Critical Node: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in the Specific Version:**  Targeting vulnerabilities specific to the deployed PostgreSQL version.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Compromise PostgreSQL Credentials:](./attack_tree_paths/3__compromise_postgresql_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Obtaining valid credentials for the PostgreSQL database, which can then be used for further malicious activities.
*   **High-Risk Path:**  Credential compromise is a critical enabler for many other attacks.
*   **Critical Node: Compromise PostgreSQL Credentials:**  Gaining valid credentials bypasses authentication controls.

    *   **Sniff Network Traffic (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting network traffic to capture credentials being transmitted in plaintext or weakly encrypted forms.
        *   **High-Risk Path:**  A lack of encryption on the database connection exposes credentials.
        *   **Critical Node: Capture Credentials Transmitted Without Encryption (e.g., if SSL/TLS is not enforced):**  Directly obtaining credentials from network traffic.

    *   **Steal Credentials from Application Configuration (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing application configuration files or environment variables where database credentials are stored insecurely.
        *   **High-Risk Path:**  A common vulnerability where sensitive information is stored in easily accessible locations.
        *   **Critical Node: Access Application Configuration Files Containing Database Credentials:**  Directly retrieving credentials from the application's configuration.
