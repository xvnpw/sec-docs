# Attack Surface Analysis for postgres/postgres

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application queries, allowing them to bypass security measures, access unauthorized data, modify data, or even execute operating system commands on the database server.
    *   **How PostgreSQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** PostgreSQL's ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands is the core of this vulnerability. If the application doesn't properly sanitize user inputs before including them in SQL queries, it becomes susceptible.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input in a login form like `' OR '1'='1` which, if not sanitized, could result in a query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '...'`, bypassing authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation within the database, potential compromise of the database server itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection by treating user inputs as data, not executable code.
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in SQL queries.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant database users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Avoid using overly privileged accounts for application connections.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review application code and database interactions for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** Many ORMs provide built-in protection against SQL injection.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass due to `pg_hba.conf` Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass_due_to__pg_hba_conf__misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured `pg_hba.conf` file can allow unauthorized access to the PostgreSQL server without proper authentication.
    *   **How PostgreSQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `pg_hba.conf` is PostgreSQL's central client authentication configuration file. Permissive rules or the use of `trust` authentication without proper network restrictions can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A `pg_hba.conf` entry like `host all all 0.0.0.0/0 trust` would allow any user from any IP address to connect to any database without a password.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, unauthorized data access, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Network Access:**  Limit access to the PostgreSQL port (default 5432) to only trusted networks and hosts using firewall rules.
        *   **Use Strong Authentication Methods:** Avoid `trust` authentication in production environments. Prefer `md5`, `scram-sha-256`, or certificate-based authentication.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege in `pg_hba.conf`:**  Be specific with the databases, users, and IP addresses allowed to connect.
        *   **Regularly Review `pg_hba.conf`:**  Periodically audit the `pg_hba.conf` file to ensure it aligns with security policies.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default PostgreSQL User Passwords](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_postgresql_user_passwords.md)

*   **Description:** Using easily guessable or default passwords for PostgreSQL user accounts, especially the `postgres` superuser, allows attackers to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How PostgreSQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** PostgreSQL relies on user credentials for authentication. Weak credentials are a direct vulnerability within the database system.
    *   **Example:** An attacker successfully brute-forces the password for the `postgres` user, gaining full control over the database server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, unauthorized data access, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement requirements for password length, complexity, and regular rotation.
        *   **Avoid Default Passwords:**  Ensure all default passwords are changed immediately upon installation or setup.
        *   **Consider Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** While not natively supported by PostgreSQL for direct connections, MFA can be implemented at the application level or through connection proxies.
        *   **Regular Password Audits:** Use tools to check for weak or compromised passwords.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Connections to PostgreSQL](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_connections_to_postgresql.md)

*   **Description:** Transmitting data between the application and the PostgreSQL server without encryption (SSL/TLS) exposes sensitive information, including credentials and data, to network eavesdropping.
    *   **How PostgreSQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** PostgreSQL supports SSL/TLS encryption, but it needs to be properly configured and enabled. If left unconfigured, connections are vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the database and captures database credentials or sensitive data being transmitted in plain text.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data and credentials.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable SSL/TLS Encryption:** Configure PostgreSQL to require SSL/TLS connections.
        *   **Enforce SSL/TLS on the Client Side:** Ensure the application is configured to connect to PostgreSQL using SSL/TLS and to verify the server certificate.
        *   **Secure Key Management:** Properly manage and secure the SSL/TLS certificates and keys.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of PostgreSQL Port to the Public Internet](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_postgresql_port_to_the_public_internet.md)

*   **Description:** Making the PostgreSQL port (default 5432) directly accessible from the public internet significantly increases the attack surface, allowing attackers to attempt direct connections and brute-force attacks.
    *   **How PostgreSQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** PostgreSQL listens on a specific network port for incoming connections. Exposing this port unnecessarily opens it to potential attacks.
    *   **Example:** Attackers scan the internet for open PostgreSQL ports and attempt to brute-force user credentials or exploit known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access attempts, potential compromise of the database through brute-force or vulnerability exploitation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Network Access:** Use firewalls to limit access to the PostgreSQL port to only trusted IP addresses or networks.
        *   **Use a VPN or Bastion Host:**  Require connections to the database to go through a secure VPN or bastion host.
        *   **Change the Default Port (Obfuscation):** While not a primary security measure, changing the default port can deter some automated attacks.
