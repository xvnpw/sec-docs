# Threat Model Analysis for postgres/postgres

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Exploiting PostgreSQL Extensions or Functions](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_exploiting_postgresql_extensions_or_functions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with limited database privileges exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in PostgreSQL extensions or built-in functions to gain higher privileges (e.g., becoming a superuser). This could involve using functions with `SECURITY DEFINER` improperly or exploiting bugs in extension code within the PostgreSQL codebase.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the database instance, potentially affecting all databases within the instance, leading to data breaches, modification, deletion, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Extension System, Function Execution Engine, Access Control Mechanisms
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and audit the source code of installed extensions.
        *   Restrict access to extension creation and installation using PostgreSQL's permission system.
        *   Be cautious with `SECURITY DEFINER` functions and thoroughly audit their code.
        *   Keep PostgreSQL and its extensions updated with the latest security patches from the official repository.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass due to `pg_hba.conf` Misconfiguration](./threats/authentication_bypass_due_to__pg_hba_conf__misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits overly permissive or incorrectly configured entries in the `pg_hba.conf` file, a core configuration file of PostgreSQL, to gain unauthorized access to the PostgreSQL server. This directly involves the authentication mechanisms implemented within the PostgreSQL codebase.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication System (`pg_hba.conf` parsing and enforcement logic)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict and specific rules in `pg_hba.conf`, directly configuring PostgreSQL's access control.
        *   Use strong authentication methods supported by PostgreSQL, such as `scram-sha-256` or client certificates.
        *   Regularly review and audit `pg_hba.conf` to ensure the rules are secure and up-to-date with the intended access policies.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Maliciously Crafted Queries](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_maliciously_crafted_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted, resource-intensive queries that exploit inefficiencies or vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL's query planner and executor, leading to excessive CPU, memory, or I/O usage and causing a denial of service. This directly involves the core query processing components of PostgreSQL.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, inability for users to access data or functionality due to the overloaded database server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Query Planner, Query Executor, Resource Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement query timeouts within PostgreSQL to prevent runaway queries.
        *   Monitor database resource usage to detect and investigate unusual spikes indicative of malicious queries.
        *   Implement connection limits in PostgreSQL to restrict the number of concurrent connections.
        *   Optimize database queries and schema to improve performance and reduce the impact of inefficient queries.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in PostgreSQL Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_postgresql_logs.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is inadvertently logged by PostgreSQL due to overly verbose logging configurations within PostgreSQL itself, or due to application errors that include sensitive data in query parameters which are then logged by PostgreSQL. This directly involves the logging mechanisms within the PostgreSQL codebase.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information to individuals with access to the PostgreSQL server's file system or log management systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Logging System
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure PostgreSQL logging levels to avoid logging sensitive data.
        *   Use parameters in application queries to prevent sensitive data from being directly embedded in SQL statements that might be logged.
        *   Restrict access to PostgreSQL log files using operating system permissions.
        *   Consider using secure log management practices, including encryption.

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Unsecured or Misconfigured `COPY` Command](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_unsecured_or_misconfigured__copy__command.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges exploits the `COPY` command, a built-in feature of PostgreSQL, to inject malicious data into database tables or overwrite existing data. This directly involves the functionality of the `COPY` command within the PostgreSQL codebase.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity issues, corruption of critical data, potentially leading to application malfunctions or incorrect business decisions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `COPY` Command Handler
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict the use of the `COPY` command to trusted users and roles within PostgreSQL's permission system.
        *   Thoroughly validate any input used with the `COPY` command, especially file paths and data sources.
        *   Avoid using `COPY` directly with untrusted input; prefer application-level data processing and insertion.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Large Object Manipulation](./threats/denial_of_service_through_large_object_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits PostgreSQL's large object feature, a part of the core PostgreSQL functionality, to create or manipulate extremely large objects, consuming significant storage space or I/O resources, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Database downtime, storage exhaustion, performance degradation affecting the availability of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Large Object Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the size of large objects within PostgreSQL.
        *   Monitor storage usage for large objects to detect and investigate unusual growth.
        *   Restrict access to large object creation and manipulation using PostgreSQL's permission system.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Error Messages](./threats/information_disclosure_through_error_messages.md)

*   **Description:** Detailed PostgreSQL error messages, generated by the PostgreSQL error reporting system, are exposed to end-users or attackers, revealing information about the database schema, data types, or internal workings. This directly involves PostgreSQL's error handling and reporting mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure that can aid attackers in crafting further, more targeted attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Error Reporting System
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure PostgreSQL to avoid displaying overly detailed error messages to clients.
        *   Implement proper error handling within the application to catch and log detailed errors internally while providing generic messages to users.
