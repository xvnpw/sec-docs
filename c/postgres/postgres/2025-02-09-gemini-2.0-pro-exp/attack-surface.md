# Attack Surface Analysis for postgres/postgres

## Attack Surface: [1. Network Exposure and Authentication](./attack_surfaces/1__network_exposure_and_authentication.md)

*   *Description:* Unauthorized access to the PostgreSQL database server over the network due to misconfiguration of PostgreSQL's network settings and authentication mechanisms.
    *   *PostgreSQL Contribution:* PostgreSQL listens on a network port (default 5432) for client connections. The `pg_hba.conf` file controls network authentication, and `listen_addresses` in `postgresql.conf` controls which network interfaces are used.
    *   *Example:* An attacker scans for open port 5432 and finds a PostgreSQL server with `trust` authentication enabled for remote connections in `pg_hba.conf`, or with `listen_addresses = '*'`. 
    *   *Impact:* Complete database compromise, data theft, data modification, denial of service.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Firewall:** Restrict access to port 5432 (or the configured port) to *only* authorized IP addresses/ranges using a firewall. This is a *system-level* mitigation, but it directly protects the PostgreSQL *service*.
        *   **`listen_addresses`:** Configure `postgresql.conf`'s `listen_addresses` to bind *only* to the necessary network interfaces (e.g., `localhost` or a specific private IP). Avoid `'*'`. This is a *PostgreSQL-specific* configuration.
        *   **`pg_hba.conf`:** Enforce strong authentication (e.g., `scram-sha-256`) in `pg_hba.conf`.  *Never* use `trust` for network connections.  Require TLS/SSL encryption (`ssl = on`). This is a *PostgreSQL-specific* configuration.
        *   **Unix Domain Sockets:** If the application and database are on the same host, use Unix domain sockets instead of TCP/IP. This eliminates network exposure *for PostgreSQL*.
        *   **Client Certificates:** Implement client certificate authentication for an additional layer of security. This is configured within PostgreSQL.

## Attack Surface: [2. Overly Permissive Roles and Privileges](./attack_surfaces/2__overly_permissive_roles_and_privileges.md)

*   *Description:* Granting database users more privileges than they need within the PostgreSQL database system, increasing the damage potential of a compromised account.
    *   *PostgreSQL Contribution:* PostgreSQL's role-based access control system allows for fine-grained privilege management, but it's easy to misconfigure *within PostgreSQL*.
    *   *Example:* An application connects to the database using a user with `ALL PRIVILEGES` on all tables, or even worse, a superuser.
    *   *Impact:* Data theft, data modification, denial of service, database destruction, potential privilege escalation *within the database*.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Create dedicated database users with *only* the minimum necessary privileges (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on specific tables/views) *using PostgreSQL's `GRANT` and `CREATE ROLE` commands*.
        *   **Avoid Superuser:** *Never* use the `postgres` superuser account for application connections.
        *   **Granular Privileges:** Use specific privileges (e.g., `SELECT` on a specific column) instead of broad grants like `ALL PRIVILEGES` *within PostgreSQL*.
        *   **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Implement RLS policies *within PostgreSQL* to further restrict data access based on user attributes.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review and audit user roles and privileges *within PostgreSQL*, revoking unnecessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [3. Vulnerable Extensions](./attack_surfaces/3__vulnerable_extensions.md)

*   *Description:* Exploiting security flaws in installed PostgreSQL extensions.
    *   *PostgreSQL Contribution:* PostgreSQL's extensibility allows adding new functionality, but extensions are *part of the PostgreSQL instance* and can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   *Example:* An outdated version of a PostgreSQL extension is installed, containing a known vulnerability.
    *   *Impact:* Varies widely, but can range from data leaks to complete database compromise and code execution *within the PostgreSQL context*.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High** (potentially Critical)
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Trusted Sources:** Only install extensions from trusted sources.
        *   **Keep Updated:** Regularly update *all* installed extensions to the latest versions *within PostgreSQL*.
        *   **Minimize Extensions:** Only install extensions that are absolutely necessary. Remove unused extensions *from the PostgreSQL instance*.
        *   **Security Reviews:** Review extensions before installation.
        *   **Restrict Extension Creation:** Limit the ability to create extensions (`CREATE EXTENSION`) to trusted database administrators *within PostgreSQL*.

## Attack Surface: [4. Unpatched PostgreSQL Versions](./attack_surfaces/4__unpatched_postgresql_versions.md)

*   *Description:* Running an outdated version of PostgreSQL with known security vulnerabilities *in the PostgreSQL software itself*.
    *   *PostgreSQL Contribution:* This is a direct vulnerability of the PostgreSQL database server software.
    *   *Example:* Running PostgreSQL 12.0, which has known vulnerabilities, instead of the latest 12.x release.
    *   *Impact:* Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from denial of service to complete database compromise.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High** (potentially Critical)
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Regular Updates:** Apply minor version updates (e.g., from 14.1 to 14.2) promptly to receive security patches *for PostgreSQL*.
        *   **Monitor Security Announcements:** Subscribe to the PostgreSQL security announcements.
        *   **Major Version Upgrades:** Plan for major version upgrades (e.g., from 12.x to 14.x) to stay on supported versions of *PostgreSQL*.
        *   **Automated Updates (with Caution):** Consider automating minor version updates *for PostgreSQL*, but test first.
