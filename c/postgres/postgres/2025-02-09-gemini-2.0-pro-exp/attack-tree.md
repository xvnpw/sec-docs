## Attack Tree Path: [[[Exploit PostgreSQL Vulnerabilities]]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_postgresql_vulnerabilities__.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical attack vector because attackers can directly compromise the database by leveraging known or unknown (zero-day) vulnerabilities in the PostgreSQL software itself.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **[[CVE Exploitation (Known Bugs)]]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers utilize publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) with available exploits. This is often the easiest and most common method of attack.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if patching is not timely) / Medium (with regular patching)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (depending on the specific CVE)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (many exploits are publicly available)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (script kiddies can use public exploits)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (requires monitoring and intrusion detection)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   *Crucially*: Implement a robust and *rapid* patching process. Monitor PostgreSQL security announcements and apply updates *immediately*.
            *   Maintain a clear record of the PostgreSQL version and patch level.
            *   Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities.
            *   Conduct regular penetration tests.

    *   **[[Auth Bypass (Weak Authentication)]]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers bypass authentication due to weak configurations, vulnerabilities in the authentication process, or brute-force attacks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on password policies and authentication method)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (full database access)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (brute-forcing, exploiting weak configurations)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (failed login attempts can be logged)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Enforce strong, complex passwords.
            *   *Never* use `trust` authentication in production.
            *   Prefer `scram-sha-256` or certificate-based authentication.
            *   Limit failed login attempts.
            *   Consider two-factor authentication (2FA).

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Abuse PostgreSQL Features/Configuration]]](./attack_tree_paths/__abuse_postgresql_featuresconfiguration__.md)

*   **Description:** This critical attack vector involves attackers misusing legitimate PostgreSQL features or exploiting misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access or control.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **[[SQL Injection (Poor Input Validation)]]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through application inputs, bypassing security and executing arbitrary commands. This is a *very* common and *very* dangerous vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if parameterized queries are not used) / Low (with proper defenses)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (full database control, data exfiltration)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (many tools and techniques available)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (requires careful logging and analysis, WAF can help)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   *Always* use parameterized queries or prepared statements. *Never* concatenate user input directly into SQL queries.
            *   Validate and sanitize all user input.
            *   Grant database users only the minimum necessary privileges.
            *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
