# Threat Model Analysis for postgres/postgres

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into application inputs that are not properly sanitized before being used in database queries. This allows them to execute arbitrary SQL commands due to vulnerabilities in the parsing and execution of SQL within PostgreSQL.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can bypass security measures, read, modify, or delete sensitive data, potentially gain control over the database server, or even execute operating system commands if database functions allow it.
    *   **Affected Component:** `src/backend/parser/`, `src/backend/executor/` (SQL parser and executor).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements exclusively (primarily an application-level mitigation, but highlights the risk if not done).**
        *   PostgreSQL developers continuously work on hardening the SQL parser and executor to prevent injection vulnerabilities. Report any potential SQL injection vulnerabilities found in PostgreSQL to the development team.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within the Database](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_the_database.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation within the Database
    *   **Description:** An attacker with limited database privileges exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations *within PostgreSQL's role and privilege management system* to gain higher privileges. This could involve exploiting insecurely defined built-in functions or flaws in the permission checking logic.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can gain access to data or functionalities they are not authorized for, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or complete control over the database.
    *   **Affected Component:** `src/backend/commands/`, `src/backend/catalog/` (Role and privilege management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   PostgreSQL developers continuously review and harden the role and privilege management system. Report any potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities found in PostgreSQL to the development team.
        *   Carefully review and restrict the use of `SECURITY DEFINER` functions (while this is a configuration aspect, vulnerabilities in its implementation are relevant).

## Threat: [`pg_hba.conf` Misconfiguration (leading to Authentication Bypass)](./threats/_pg_hba_conf__misconfiguration__leading_to_authentication_bypass_.md)

*   **Threat:** `pg_hba.conf` Misconfiguration (leading to Authentication Bypass)
    *   **Description:** While the configuration itself is external, a vulnerability in how PostgreSQL *processes* the `pg_hba.conf` file could lead to authentication bypass. For example, a parsing error that causes incorrect authentication rules to be applied.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers from untrusted networks can gain access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `src/backend/libpq/auth.c` (Authentication module), specifically the `pg_hba.conf` parsing logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   PostgreSQL developers ensure robust and secure parsing of the `pg_hba.conf` file. Report any issues with `pg_hba.conf` processing to the development team.
        *   Use strong authentication methods in `pg_hba.conf` (e.g., `md5`, `scram-sha-256`).

## Threat: [Exploiting PostgreSQL Extensions](./threats/exploiting_postgresql_extensions.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting PostgreSQL Extensions
    *   **Description:** Using third-party PostgreSQL extensions that contain security vulnerabilities *within their code* can expose the database server to attacks. This directly involves the extension loading and execution mechanisms of PostgreSQL.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the extension's privileges and vulnerabilities, attackers could gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code on the server, or cause data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Extension loading mechanism (`src/backend/utils/fmgr/dfmgr.c`), the specific extension's code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the extension)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   PostgreSQL developers provide a secure extension loading mechanism and strive to prevent vulnerabilities within the core system from being exploitable by extensions.
        *   Only install necessary and trusted extensions. Keep extensions up-to-date with the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Lack of Security Updates and Patching (Vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL Code)](./threats/lack_of_security_updates_and_patching__vulnerabilities_in_postgresql_code_.md)

*   **Threat:** Lack of Security Updates and Patching (Vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL Code)
    *   **Description:** Failing to apply security updates and patches to the PostgreSQL server leaves known vulnerabilities *within the PostgreSQL codebase* exposed to potential exploitation.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause data breaches, or disrupt services.
    *   **Affected Component:** All components of the PostgreSQL installation containing the unpatched vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   PostgreSQL developers are responsible for identifying, fixing, and releasing security updates for vulnerabilities in the core codebase.
        *   Establish a regular schedule for applying security updates and patches.
