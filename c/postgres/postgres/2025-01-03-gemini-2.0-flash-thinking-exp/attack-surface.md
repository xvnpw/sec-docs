# Attack Surface Analysis for postgres/postgres

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application queries, manipulating the database.

**How PostgreSQL Contributes:** PostgreSQL executes the provided SQL, regardless of its origin, if it's syntactically correct and the user has sufficient privileges. Features like dynamic SQL construction and the ability to execute arbitrary functions within queries increase the potential for exploitation.

**Example:** An attacker provides the input `'; DROP TABLE users; --` in a login form's username field, and the application constructs a vulnerable SQL query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'input' AND password = 'input'`. This could result in the `users` table being dropped.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data modification or deletion, potential for remote code execution (using features like `COPY PROGRAM`), and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Treat user input as data, not executable code. This is the primary defense.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant database users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Avoid using overly permissive roles.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Review code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass / Weak Credentials](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass__weak_credentials.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the database due to weak, default, or compromised credentials, or by exploiting authentication vulnerabilities.

**How PostgreSQL Contributes:** PostgreSQL relies on configured authentication methods (e.g., password, `md5`, `scram-sha-256`, certificate) defined in `pg_hba.conf`. Misconfigurations or weak choices in these settings create vulnerabilities. The existence of powerful superuser accounts like `postgres` is also a factor.

**Example:** Using the default password for the `postgres` user, or a brute-force attack succeeding against a user with a weak password. Incorrectly configured `pg_hba.conf` allowing connections from any host without authentication.

**Impact:** Full access to the database, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Require complex passwords and regular password changes.
*   **Disable or Rename Default Accounts:** Change the password for the `postgres` superuser immediately after installation. Consider renaming it.
*   **Configure `pg_hba.conf` Correctly:** Restrict access based on IP address, hostname, and authentication method. Use strong authentication methods like `scram-sha-256`.
*   **Use Certificate-Based Authentication:**  For enhanced security, use client certificates for authentication.
*   **Limit Superuser Access:**  Minimize the number of users with superuser privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of the PostgreSQL Port (5432)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_the_postgresql_port__5432_.md)

**Description:** The PostgreSQL port is directly accessible from untrusted networks, allowing attackers to attempt connections and exploit vulnerabilities.

**How PostgreSQL Contributes:** PostgreSQL listens on a defined port (default 5432). If this port is open to the internet or internal untrusted networks without proper access controls, it becomes a target.

**Example:** An attacker scans the internet for open port 5432 and attempts to connect to a vulnerable PostgreSQL instance.

**Impact:** Brute-force attacks on credentials, exploitation of known PostgreSQL server vulnerabilities, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Network Firewalls:** Restrict access to port 5432 to only trusted IP addresses or networks.
*   **Use a VPN:**  Require users to connect through a VPN to access the database server.
*   **Disable Remote Access (if appropriate):** If the application and database are on the same server, restrict PostgreSQL to listen only on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1).

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting PostgreSQL Extensions](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_postgresql_extensions.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in installed PostgreSQL extensions are exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.

**How PostgreSQL Contributes:** PostgreSQL's extensibility allows loading of custom code. If these extensions have security flaws, they can be exploited. Extensions that grant access to the filesystem or allow command execution are particularly risky.

**Example:** A vulnerable version of the `pgcrypto` extension is exploited to bypass encryption or execute arbitrary code. An attacker leverages an extension like `dblink` to connect to other databases and exfiltrate data.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Only Install Necessary Extensions:**  Minimize the number of installed extensions.
*   **Keep Extensions Updated:**  Regularly update extensions to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Review Extension Permissions:** Understand the permissions granted by installed extensions.
*   **Restrict Extension Creation:** Control who can create and install new extensions.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Command Execution via `COPY PROGRAM`](./attack_surfaces/server-side_command_execution_via__copy_program_.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit the `COPY PROGRAM` command to execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**How PostgreSQL Contributes:** The `COPY PROGRAM` command allows executing shell commands as part of data import or export. If not carefully controlled, this can be abused.

**Example:** An attacker with sufficient privileges executes `COPY table_name TO PROGRAM 'rm -rf /'` to delete files on the server.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the database server, data loss, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Restrict `COPY PROGRAM` Usage:**  Limit the users and roles that have the privileges to execute `COPY PROGRAM`.
*   **Disable `COPY PROGRAM` (if possible and applicable):** If the functionality is not required, consider disabling it through configuration.
*   **Careful Input Validation (where applicable):** If user input influences the `COPY PROGRAM` command, rigorous validation is crucial.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** Attackers flood the database with requests or exploit vulnerabilities to make it unavailable.

**How PostgreSQL Contributes:** PostgreSQL, like any service, has resource limitations. Maliciously crafted queries, excessive connection attempts, or exploitation of server bugs can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.

**Example:** An attacker sends a large number of expensive queries that consume excessive CPU and memory, making the database unresponsive. Exploiting a bug that causes the PostgreSQL server to crash.

**Impact:** Application downtime, loss of service availability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Connection Limits:** Configure `max_connections` to limit the number of concurrent connections.
*   **Query Optimization:**  Optimize application queries to reduce resource consumption.
*   **Regular Security Patching:** Apply security patches to address known DoS vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL.
