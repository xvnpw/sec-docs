# Attack Surface Analysis for nginx/nginx

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Access Control](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_access_control.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured `allow` and `deny` directives or overly permissive regular expressions in `location` blocks can grant unauthorized access to sensitive resources or administrative interfaces.

**How Nginx Contributes:** Nginx's configuration language and the way it interprets access control directives directly determine who can access specific parts of the application. Misconfigurations here directly expose the attack surface.

**Example:** A configuration allowing access to `/admin` location from any IP address due to a missing or incorrect `deny all;` directive.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, administrative functions, or the ability to manipulate the application's behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly review and audit `allow` and `deny` directives in `nginx.conf`.
