## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Nginx Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nginx_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This is a broad category encompassing attacks that leverage flaws in the Nginx codebase itself. Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: Exploiting bugs like buffer overflows, heap overflows, or use-after-free vulnerabilities in Nginx's memory management.
- High-Risk Path: Trigger Vulnerability (e.g., crafted request) --> Achieve Code Execution on Server.
- Breakdown:
    - Trigger Vulnerability: Sending a specially crafted request that exploits a memory corruption flaw in Nginx. This requires understanding the specific vulnerability and how to trigger it.
    - Achieve Code Execution on Server: Successfully triggering the vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Modules (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_modules__critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: Targeting vulnerabilities in Nginx modules that are not part of the core codebase (e.g., LuaJIT).
- High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerability in Module --> Achieve Code Execution or Information Disclosure.
- Breakdown:
    - Exploit Vulnerability in Module: Identifying and exploiting a known vulnerability in a third-party Nginx module. This often involves sending specific inputs or triggering certain conditions within the module.
    - Achieve Code Execution or Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the Nginx worker process or the disclosure of sensitive information handled by the module.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Nginx Misconfiguration (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nginx_misconfiguration__critical_node_.md)

This category involves exploiting weaknesses introduced by incorrect or insecure configuration of Nginx.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Insecure Directives (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_insecure_directives__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attack Vector: Leveraging misconfigured directives that expose sensitive information or create security loopholes.
- High-Risk Path: Abuse Insecure Directives --> Man-in-the-Middle Attack (weak SSL/TLS).
- Breakdown:
    - Man-in-the-Middle Attack (weak SSL/TLS): If Nginx is configured with weak or outdated SSL/TLS ciphers or protocols, an attacker can intercept and potentially decrypt or manipulate encrypted traffic between clients and the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Access Controls (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_access_controls__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attack Vector: Circumventing intended access restrictions due to flawed configuration of `allow`, `deny`, or `if` directives.
- High-Risk Path: Bypass Access Controls --> Access Restricted Resources or Functionality.
- Breakdown:
    - Access Restricted Resources or Functionality: Successfully bypassing access controls allows attackers to access resources or execute functionalities that should be protected.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_path_traversal_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attack Vector: Exploiting misconfigured `alias` or `root` directives to access files outside the intended webroot.
- High-Risk Path: Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerabilities --> Access Sensitive Files Outside Webroot.
- Breakdown:
    - Access Sensitive Files Outside Webroot: By manipulating file paths in requests (e.g., using "../"), attackers can access and potentially read sensitive configuration files, source code, or other critical data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigured Proxy Settings (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigured_proxy_settings__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attack Vector: Abusing misconfigured `proxy_pass` or related directives to perform unintended actions.
- High-Risk Path: Exploit Misconfigured Proxy Settings --> Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- Breakdown:
    - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): A misconfigured proxy can allow an attacker to make requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the Nginx server. This can be used to access internal services, read sensitive data, or even compromise other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigured Caching:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigured_caching.md)

- Attack Vector: Leveraging flaws in caching configurations to serve malicious content or disrupt service.
- Critical Node: Cache Poisoning.
- Breakdown:
    - Cache Poisoning: By exploiting how Nginx caches content, an attacker can inject malicious content into the cache, which is then served to other users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Nginx Features:](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_nginx_features.md)

This involves turning legitimate Nginx functionalities against the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Large Request Body Handling (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_large_request_body_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attack Vector: Sending excessively large request bodies to exhaust server resources.
- High-Risk Path: Exploit Large Request Body Handling --> Exhaust Server Resources (DoS).
- Breakdown:
    - Exhaust Server Resources (DoS): Sending a very large request body can consume excessive memory or processing power, leading to a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Client Certificate Authentication:](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_client_certificate_authentication.md)

- Attack Vector: Bypassing or subverting client certificate authentication mechanisms.
- Critical Node: Bypass Authentication with Malicious or Stolen Certificates.
- Breakdown:
    - Bypass Authentication with Malicious or Stolen Certificates: If client certificate validation is weak or if an attacker obtains valid client certificates, they can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Interaction with Upstream Servers (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_interaction_with_upstream_servers__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how Nginx interacts with backend servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [HTTP Request Smuggling (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/http_request_smuggling__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attack Vector: Exploiting discrepancies in how Nginx and upstream servers parse HTTP requests to inject malicious requests.
- High-Risk Path: HTTP Request Smuggling --> Inject Malicious Requests to Upstream Server --> Compromise Upstream Application.
- Breakdown:
    - Inject Malicious Requests to Upstream Server: By crafting ambiguous HTTP requests, an attacker can cause Nginx and the upstream server to interpret the request boundaries differently, allowing them to "smuggle" additional requests to the backend.
    - Compromise Upstream Application: Successfully smuggled requests can be used to bypass security checks, inject malicious data, or execute commands on the upstream application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Upstream Exhaustion (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_upstream_exhaustion__high-risk_path_.md)

- Attack Vector: Sending a large number of requests through Nginx to overwhelm the upstream server.
- High-Risk Path: Denial of Service via Upstream Exhaustion --> Overwhelm Upstream Server Resources.
- Breakdown:
    - Overwhelm Upstream Server Resources: By sending a flood of requests, an attacker can exhaust the resources (CPU, memory, connections) of the upstream server, leading to a denial of service for the backend application.
