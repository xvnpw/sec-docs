# Attack Surface Analysis for nginx/nginx

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/configuration_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Flaws in how Nginx parses its configuration files (`nginx.conf`, included files). Maliciously crafted configuration files could exploit these flaws.
**Nginx Contribution:** Nginx is responsible for parsing and interpreting its configuration files. Bugs in the parser can lead to unexpected behavior.
**Example:**  A specially crafted `include` directive in `nginx.conf` could cause a buffer overflow in the configuration parser, leading to denial of service or potentially remote code execution.
**Impact:** Denial of service, configuration bypass, potentially remote code execution.
**Risk Severity:** Critical.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep Nginx updated:** Regularly update Nginx to the latest stable version to patch known parsing vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure configuration file access:** Restrict write access to `nginx.conf` and included files to only trusted administrators.
*   **Configuration file validation:** Use configuration testing tools (`nginx -t`) to check for syntax errors and potential issues before reloading or restarting Nginx.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Access Control (allow/deny)](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_access_control__allowdeny_.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured `allow` and `deny` directives in Nginx configuration, leading to unintended access to restricted resources.
**Nginx Contribution:** Nginx's `allow` and `deny` directives are the primary mechanism for IP-based access control. Misconfiguration directly leads to this attack surface.
**Example:**  A developer intends to restrict access to an admin panel to only internal IPs but accidentally configures `allow 192.168.0.0/24; deny all;` within the `location /admin/` block, while the parent `server` block has `allow all;`. This would still allow public access to `/admin/` because the more specific `location` block overrides the general `server` block, but the `deny all` is never reached after the `allow` rule.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, privilege escalation.
**Risk Severity:** High.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Principle of least privilege:** Only grant access to resources that are absolutely necessary.
*   **Thorough configuration review:** Carefully review `allow` and `deny` rules to ensure they are correctly implemented and achieve the intended access control.
*   **Testing access control:**  Test access control rules from different IP addresses and network locations to verify they are working as expected.
*   **Use more robust authentication:**  Supplement IP-based access control with stronger authentication methods.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Proxying](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_proxying.md)

**Description:** Exploiting Nginx's reverse proxy functionality to make requests to internal or unintended servers, potentially bypassing firewalls or accessing internal resources.
**Nginx Contribution:** Nginx's `proxy_pass` directive and related proxy functionalities are the core components that can be misused for SSRF if not configured carefully.
**Example:** An application uses Nginx to proxy requests to an upstream server based on user-provided input in the URL. If input validation is insufficient, an attacker could craft a URL like `https://example.com/proxy?url=http://internal-server/sensitive-data` which, if passed to `proxy_pass $arg_url;`, would cause Nginx to proxy the request to `http://internal-server/sensitive-data`, potentially exposing internal data.
**Impact:** Access to internal resources, data breaches, potential remote code execution on internal systems (depending on internal server vulnerabilities).
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict input validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize user-provided input used in proxy configurations.
*   **Whitelist allowed upstream hosts:**  Use a whitelist of explicitly allowed upstream hosts and ports for proxying.
*   **Restrict proxy protocols:**  Limit proxying to only necessary protocols (e.g., HTTPS only, avoid HTTP if possible).
*   **Disable or restrict proxying of user-controlled URLs:** Avoid directly proxying URLs derived from user input whenever possible.

## Attack Surface: [Weak SSL/TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/weak_ssltls_configuration.md)

**Description:** Using outdated or weak SSL/TLS protocols and cipher suites, making encrypted communication vulnerable to attacks.
**Nginx Contribution:** Nginx is responsible for handling SSL/TLS termination based on its configuration. Insecure configurations directly weaken the SSL/TLS security.
**Example:**  Nginx configuration still allows SSLv3 or TLS 1.0 protocols, or uses weak cipher suites like RC4. An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in these protocols or cipher suites to decrypt communication or perform man-in-the-middle attacks.
**Impact:** Data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping on sensitive communication.
**Risk Severity:** High.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Disable outdated protocols:**  Explicitly disable SSLv3, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1 in the Nginx configuration using `ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;`.
*   **Use strong cipher suites:**  Configure strong and modern cipher suites using `ssl_ciphers 'HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!RC4:!MD5:!PSK:!aECDH:!EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA:!KRB5-DES-CBC3-SHA';`.
*   **Enable HSTS:**  Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) using `add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload";` to force browsers to always use HTTPS.
*   **Regularly update OpenSSL/BoringSSL:** Keep the underlying SSL/TLS libraries (OpenSSL or BoringSSL) updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
