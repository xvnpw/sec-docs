# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nginx/nginx

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Nginx](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_nginx.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Nginx
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a monitoring process:** Subscribe to security mailing lists for Nginx (e.g., `nginx-announce`) and security advisories from your OS vendor (e.g., Debian Security Advisories, Ubuntu Security Notices, Red Hat Security Advisories).
    2.  **Test updates in a staging environment:** Before applying updates to production, deploy them to a staging environment that mirrors your production setup.
    3.  **Perform regression testing:** After updating Nginx in staging, run thorough regression tests to ensure application functionality remains unaffected and no new issues are introduced.
    4.  **Schedule maintenance window:** Plan a maintenance window for applying updates to the production environment.
    5.  **Apply updates to production:** During the maintenance window, update Nginx on your production servers using your OS package manager (e.g., `apt update && apt upgrade nginx`, `yum update nginx`).
    6.  **Verify update success:** After updating in production, verify the Nginx version and perform basic functionality tests to confirm the update was successful and Nginx is running correctly.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Nginx versions may contain publicly known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation by patching known vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have a process for OS updates, but Nginx specific updates are not always prioritized and tested separately in staging before OS-wide updates.
    *   Location: System administration procedures, documented in the server maintenance guide.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Dedicated Nginx update monitoring and separate staging environment testing for Nginx updates before production deployment. Need to refine the update process to specifically address Nginx updates and integrate into CI/CD pipeline for staging deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Installed Modules](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_installed_modules.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Installed Modules
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify required modules:** Analyze your Nginx configuration and application requirements to determine the essential Nginx modules needed.
    2.  **Compile Nginx from source (recommended) or use minimal packages:**
        *   **Compile from source:** Download the Nginx source code and compile it with the `--with-http_ssl_module`, `--with-http_gzip_static_module`, etc., flags, only including the modules you identified as necessary.
        *   **Minimal packages:** If using pre-built packages, explore if your OS distribution offers "nginx-light" or similar minimal packages that include fewer modules.
    3.  **Verify module list:** After installation, verify the compiled-in modules using `nginx -V`. Ensure only the necessary modules are listed.
    4.  **Regularly review module requirements:** Periodically re-evaluate your application needs and remove any modules that are no longer required.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Unused Modules (Medium Severity):** Even if a module is not actively used in your configuration, vulnerabilities within that module can still be exploited if it's compiled into Nginx.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (Low Severity):** More modules mean a larger codebase and potentially more attack vectors, even if vulnerabilities are not immediately apparent.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Unused Modules (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk by eliminating potential vulnerability points in unused code.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (Low Impact):** Minimally reduces the overall attack surface.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We use pre-built packages from the OS repository, which include a standard set of modules. We haven't compiled Nginx from source to minimize modules.
    *   Location: Server provisioning scripts and package management configurations.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Compiling Nginx from source with a minimal set of modules. Need to investigate the feasibility of switching to source compilation and create build scripts for minimal Nginx installations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to Nginx Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_nginx_configuration_files.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Access to Nginx Configuration Files
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set file permissions:** Ensure Nginx configuration files (e.g., `nginx.conf`, site configurations in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` or `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`) are owned by `root` user and the Nginx user (e.g., `www-data`, `nginx`).
    2.  **Restrict read and write permissions:** Set file permissions to `640` or `600` for configuration files, allowing read access only to `root` and the Nginx user, and write access only to `root`.
    3.  **Verify permissions:** Regularly check file permissions using `ls -l` to ensure they remain correctly configured.
    4.  **Automate permission checks:** Integrate permission checks into automated security audits or configuration management scripts.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes (High Severity):** Attackers gaining access to configuration files could modify them to redirect traffic, inject malicious code, or disable security features.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Configuration files might inadvertently contain sensitive information like internal server names, paths, or API keys (though best practices dictate these should be externalized).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of malicious configuration modifications by limiting access.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of accidental information disclosure through configuration files.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. File permissions are set correctly on configuration files during server provisioning.
    *   Location: Server provisioning scripts (e.g., Ansible playbooks, Chef recipes) and documented in server hardening guidelines.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated periodic checks of file permissions to detect any unauthorized changes. Need to implement automated scripts to verify configuration file permissions as part of regular security scans.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Server Tokens](./mitigation_strategies/disable_server_tokens.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Server Tokens
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Edit `nginx.conf`:** Open the main Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`) or the relevant virtual host configuration file.
    2.  **Add `server_tokens off;` directive:** Within the `http` block or `server` block, add the line `server_tokens off;`.
    3.  **Restart Nginx:** Restart the Nginx service for the changes to take effect (e.g., `systemctl restart nginx`, `service nginx restart`).
    4.  **Verify header removal:** Use a browser's developer tools or `curl -I <your_website>` to inspect the HTTP response headers. Ensure the `Server` header only shows "nginx" and not the version number.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low Severity):** Revealing the Nginx version makes it slightly easier for attackers to identify potential version-specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low Impact):** Minimally reduces information disclosure, adding a small layer of obscurity.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. `server_tokens off;` is included in the default Nginx configuration.
    *   Location: Main `nginx.conf` file, template used for server provisioning.
*   **Missing Implementation:** None. This is already implemented globally.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Request Body Size](./mitigation_strategies/limit_request_body_size.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Request Body Size
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Edit `nginx.conf` or virtual host configuration:** Open the relevant Nginx configuration file.
    2.  **Add `client_max_body_size` directive:** Within the `http`, `server`, or `location` block, add the directive `client_max_body_size <size>;`, replacing `<size>` with an appropriate value (e.g., `10m` for 10 megabytes, `100k` for 100 kilobytes). Choose a size that is sufficient for legitimate requests but limits excessively large uploads.
    3.  **Restart Nginx:** Restart the Nginx service.
    4.  **Test with large requests:** Test by sending requests with body sizes exceeding the configured limit to verify that Nginx returns a `413 Request Entity Too Large` error.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Attackers could send extremely large requests to consume server resources (bandwidth, memory, disk space), potentially leading to service disruption.
    *   **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities (Low Severity):** In rare cases, processing excessively large request bodies could potentially trigger buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Nginx or backend applications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of resource exhaustion from oversized requests.
    *   **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities (Low Impact):** Minimally reduces the risk of buffer overflows related to request body size.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. `client_max_body_size` is set to 10MB globally in the `http` block of `nginx.conf`.
    *   Location: `nginx.conf` file.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Consider adjusting `client_max_body_size` on a per-location basis for specific endpoints that might require different limits (e.g., file upload endpoints vs. API endpoints). Need to review location-specific requirements and refine `client_max_body_size` settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Request Methods](./mitigation_strategies/control_request_methods.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Control Request Methods
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify allowed methods:** Determine the HTTP methods required for each location or endpoint in your application (e.g., `GET` for retrieving data, `POST` for submitting data, `PUT` for updating, `DELETE` for removing).
    2.  **Use `limit_except` directive:** In the relevant `location` blocks in your Nginx configuration, use the `limit_except` directive to specify the allowed methods. For example:
        ```nginx
        location /api/data {
            limit_except GET POST {
                deny all;
            }
            # ... proxy_pass to backend ...
        }
        ```
        This example allows only `GET` and `POST` methods for `/api/data` and denies all other methods.
    3.  **Deny unwanted methods:** Explicitly deny methods like `TRACE` and `TRACK` globally or in specific locations as they are rarely needed and can be used for cross-site tracing attacks.
    4.  **Restart Nginx:** Restart the Nginx service.
    5.  **Test method restrictions:** Test by sending requests with disallowed methods to verify that Nginx returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` error.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Tracing (XST) (Medium Severity):** Disabling `TRACE` and `TRACK` prevents attackers from using these methods for XST attacks to potentially steal cookies or session tokens.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior (Low Severity):** Restricting methods to only those expected by your application can prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities arising from processing unintended methods.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Tracing (XST) (Medium Impact):** Eliminates the risk of XST attacks via `TRACE` and `TRACK`.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior (Low Impact):** Reduces the potential for unexpected application behavior due to unintended methods.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `TRACE` and `TRACK` are generally disabled globally. Method restrictions are not consistently applied on a per-location basis.
    *   Location: Global `nginx.conf` for disabling `TRACE/TRACK`. Location configurations are missing method restrictions.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement `limit_except` directives in `location` blocks to restrict HTTP methods based on endpoint requirements. Need to review application endpoints and define allowed methods for each location in Nginx configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Rate Limiting
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define rate limit zones:** In the `http` block of `nginx.conf`, define rate limit zones using the `limit_req_zone` directive. For example:
        ```nginx
        limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=10r/s;
        ```
        This creates a zone named `mylimit` that tracks requests based on the client IP address (`$binary_remote_addr`) and allows a rate of 10 requests per second, storing state in a 10MB shared memory zone.
    2.  **Apply rate limits to locations:** In the `location` blocks where you want to apply rate limiting, use the `limit_req` directive. For example:
        ```nginx
        location /api/ {
            limit_req zone=mylimit burst=20 nodelay;
            # ... proxy_pass to backend ...
        }
        ```
        This applies the `mylimit` zone to `/api/` location, allowing a burst of 20 requests above the defined rate and using `nodelay` to process requests immediately if within the burst limit.
    3.  **Configure `limit_conn` (optional):** For connection-based rate limiting (limiting concurrent connections from a single IP), use `limit_conn_zone` and `limit_conn` directives similarly.
    4.  **Adjust rate limits:** Fine-tune the rate limits (`rate`, `burst`) based on your application's expected traffic patterns and resource capacity. Monitor traffic and adjust as needed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Rate limiting can slow down or block brute-force attempts against login forms or other authentication endpoints.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Application Layer (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting can mitigate application-layer DDoS attacks by limiting the request rate from individual IPs, preventing resource exhaustion on the backend.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Bots/Crawlers (Low Severity):** Rate limiting can control excessive traffic from bots or web crawlers that might overload the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the effectiveness of brute-force attacks.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Application Layer (Medium Impact):** Provides a good level of protection against application-layer DDoS.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Bots/Crawlers (Low Impact):** Helps manage traffic from bots and crawlers.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic rate limiting is configured globally for login endpoints. More comprehensive rate limiting is missing for other critical API endpoints and resources.
    *   Location: `nginx.conf` for login endpoint rate limiting.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement rate limiting for all critical API endpoints, public-facing resources, and potentially for the entire website at a lower rate. Need to identify critical endpoints and configure appropriate rate limits for each location.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Proper Error Handling](./mitigation_strategies/configure_proper_error_handling.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Proper Error Handling
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Customize error pages:** Create custom error pages (e.g., `404.html`, `500.html`) that are user-friendly and do not reveal sensitive information.
    2.  **Configure `error_page` directive:** In the `http`, `server`, or `location` blocks, use the `error_page` directive to specify custom error pages for different HTTP error codes. For example:
        ```nginx
        error_page 404 /404.html;
        error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /404.html {
            internal; # Prevent direct access to error pages
        }
        location = /50x.html {
            internal; # Prevent direct access to error pages
        }
        ```
    3.  **Use `internal` directive:** Use the `internal` directive in the `location` blocks serving error pages to prevent direct access to these pages from outside, ensuring they are only served in response to errors.
    4.  **Log errors effectively:** Configure error logging using the `error_log` directive to capture detailed error information for debugging and monitoring. Ensure logs are stored securely and reviewed regularly.
    5.  **Avoid verbose error messages:** In custom error pages and logs, avoid displaying overly detailed error messages that could reveal internal paths, configuration details, or debugging information to end-users or attackers.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low Severity):** Default Nginx error pages can reveal server version, internal paths, and other potentially sensitive information.
    *   **User Experience Degradation (Low Severity):** Generic or technical error pages can provide a poor user experience.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low Impact):** Reduces information disclosure by preventing default error pages from being shown.
    *   **User Experience Degradation (Low Impact):** Improves user experience by providing custom, user-friendly error pages.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Custom error pages are configured for 404 and 50x errors, but they might still contain some technical details. Error logging is enabled, but review process is not formalized.
    *   Location: `nginx.conf` and custom error page files in web root.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Refine custom error pages to ensure they are completely free of sensitive information. Formalize error log review process and implement automated alerts for critical errors. Need to review error pages and update them to be more generic and user-friendly. Implement automated log monitoring and alerting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure SSL/TLS Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_ssltls_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure SSL/TLS Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use strong protocols and ciphers:** Configure Nginx to use TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 and disable older, insecure protocols like SSLv3 and TLS 1.0/1.1. Use strong cipher suites that prioritize forward secrecy and avoid weak or deprecated ciphers.
    2.  **Generate strong Diffie-Hellman parameters:** Generate strong Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters for key exchange using `openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 2048` (or 4096 for higher security).
    3.  **Configure SSL directives:** In the `server` block for HTTPS, configure SSL directives like:
        ```nginx
        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
        ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384';
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        ssl_dhparam /path/to/dhparam.pem;
        ssl_session_timeout 1d;
        ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
        ssl_session_tickets off; # Consider enabling if needed, but manage key rotation
        ```
    4.  **Implement HSTS:** Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to force browsers to always connect over HTTPS:
        ```nginx
        add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
        ```
    5.  **Regularly renew certificates:** Set up automated certificate renewal using Let's Encrypt or your certificate provider.
    6.  **Test SSL configuration:** Use online SSL testing tools (e.g., SSL Labs SSL Test) to verify your SSL configuration and identify any weaknesses.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Weak SSL/TLS configurations can allow attackers to intercept and decrypt encrypted traffic, potentially stealing sensitive data.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Successful MITM attacks can lead to data breaches and compromise of user credentials or sensitive information.
    *   **Protocol Downgrade Attacks (Medium Severity):** Using outdated protocols or weak ciphers makes the server vulnerable to protocol downgrade attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of MITM attacks by enforcing strong encryption.
    *   **Data Breach (High Impact):** Protects sensitive data in transit, reducing the risk of data breaches.
    *   **Protocol Downgrade Attacks (Medium Impact):** Mitigates protocol downgrade attacks by disabling weak protocols and ciphers.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. TLS 1.2 is enabled, and a cipher suite is configured, but it might not be the most secure. HSTS is enabled, but preload is not configured. DH parameters might be default and not custom generated.
    *   Location: `server` blocks in virtual host configurations.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Review and update cipher suite to the most secure recommendations. Generate and use strong DH parameters. Configure HSTS preload. Regularly test SSL configuration using SSL Labs and address any identified issues. Need to use Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator to create a more secure configuration and implement it. Generate strong DH parameters and configure HSTS preload.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to Sensitive Locations](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_sensitive_locations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Access to Sensitive Locations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify sensitive locations:** Determine parts of your application or backend services that require restricted access (e.g., admin panels, API endpoints for sensitive data, internal tools).
    2.  **Use `location` blocks for access control:** In Nginx configuration, use `location` blocks to define access control rules for sensitive paths.
    3.  **Implement authentication:** Use Nginx's built-in authentication modules (`auth_basic`, `auth_request`) or integrate with external authentication providers (e.g., OAuth 2.0) to require authentication for access to sensitive locations.
        *   **`auth_basic`:** For simple password-based authentication.
        *   **`auth_request`:** For more complex authentication schemes using an external authentication service.
    4.  **Implement authorization:** After authentication, implement authorization checks in your backend application to ensure that authenticated users have the necessary permissions to access the requested resources.
    5.  **Minimize public exposure:** Avoid exposing sensitive locations directly to the public internet if possible. Consider using VPNs or internal networks for access to highly sensitive resources.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data/Functionality (High Severity):** Without access control, attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data, administrative functions, or internal tools.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Unauthorized access to sensitive data can lead to data breaches and compromise of confidential information.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** If access control is not properly implemented, attackers might be able to escalate their privileges and gain administrative access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data/Functionality (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
    *   **Data Breach (High Impact):** Protects sensitive data by restricting access to authorized users only.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Impact):** Mitigates the risk of privilege escalation by enforcing access control.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic `auth_basic` authentication is used for the admin panel. API endpoints and other sensitive locations are not consistently protected with authentication and authorization at the Nginx level.
    *   Location: Nginx virtual host configuration for admin panel.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement robust authentication and authorization for all sensitive API endpoints and internal resources using `auth_request` or a similar mechanism. Need to identify all sensitive locations and implement appropriate access control mechanisms at the Nginx level.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Directory Listing](./mitigation_strategies/disable_directory_listing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Directory Listing
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Edit `nginx.conf` or virtual host configuration:** Open the relevant Nginx configuration file.
    2.  **Add `autoindex off;` directive:** In the `location` blocks where you want to disable directory listing (typically for locations serving static files), add the directive `autoindex off;`. For example:
        ```nginx
        location /static/ {
            root /var/www/your_app/static/;
            autoindex off; # Disable directory listing
        }
        ```
    3.  **Restart Nginx:** Restart the Nginx service.
    4.  **Test directory listing:** Attempt to access a directory without an index file in your browser or using `curl`. Verify that Nginx returns a `403 Forbidden` error or a custom error page instead of listing directory contents.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** If directory listing is enabled and indexing is not properly restricted in the application, attackers could browse directory contents and potentially discover sensitive files or information.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of information disclosure by preventing directory listing.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. `autoindex off;` is generally configured globally or in default static file serving locations.
    *   Location: `nginx.conf` and virtual host configurations for static file locations.
*   **Missing Implementation:** None. Directory listing is generally disabled. Periodically verify that `autoindex off;` is consistently applied across all relevant locations, especially if new static file locations are added.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Audits of Nginx Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_audits_of_nginx_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Security Audits of Nginx Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule regular audits:** Establish a schedule for periodic security audits of your Nginx configuration files (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
    2.  **Manual code review:** Conduct manual code reviews of Nginx configuration files, following security best practices and checklists. Look for misconfigurations, insecure directives, and areas for improvement.
    3.  **Automated configuration scanning:** Use automated Nginx configuration scanners or linters (if available) to identify potential security issues and misconfigurations.
    4.  **Document audit findings:** Document the findings of each security audit, including identified vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and recommended remediation steps.
    5.  **Implement remediation:** Prioritize and implement the recommended remediation steps to address identified security issues.
    6.  **Track audit history:** Maintain a history of security audits and remediation actions to track progress and ensure continuous improvement.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Security Misconfigurations (Variable Severity):** Over time, configurations can drift or introduce new misconfigurations that can create vulnerabilities. Regular audits help identify and correct these issues.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Variable Severity):** Security audits can help ensure compliance with security policies and industry best practices.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Security Misconfigurations (Variable Impact):** Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities arising from configuration errors and drift.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Variable Impact):** Helps maintain compliance with security standards.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Security audits of Nginx configuration are not performed regularly or formally.
    *   Location: N/A - No formal process exists.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement a formal process for regular security audits of Nginx configuration, including manual reviews, automated scanning, documentation, and remediation tracking. Need to define a schedule for audits, select tools for automated scanning, and create a checklist for manual reviews.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_web_application_firewall__waf_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a WAF solution:** Select a WAF solution that meets your needs and budget. Options include cloud-based WAFs (e.g., AWS WAF, Cloudflare WAF), on-premise WAF appliances, or open-source WAFs (e.g., ModSecurity, NAXSI).
    2.  **Deploy WAF in front of Nginx:** Deploy the WAF in front of your Nginx servers to filter incoming traffic before it reaches Nginx.
    3.  **Configure WAF rules:** Configure WAF rules to protect against common web attacks (OWASP Top 10), such as SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and DDoS attacks. Customize rules based on your application's specific vulnerabilities and traffic patterns.
    4.  **Regularly update WAF rules:** Keep WAF rules updated to protect against new and emerging threats. Subscribe to WAF vendor updates or threat intelligence feeds.
    5.  **Monitor WAF logs:** Regularly monitor WAF logs to detect and respond to security incidents. Analyze logs to identify attack patterns and fine-tune WAF rules.
    6.  **Test WAF effectiveness:** Periodically test the effectiveness of your WAF configuration using penetration testing or vulnerability scanning tools.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **OWASP Top 10 Web Application Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** WAFs can protect against a wide range of common web application vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and others.
    *   **DDoS Attacks (High Severity):** WAFs can mitigate various types of DDoS attacks, including application-layer DDoS, volumetric attacks, and protocol attacks.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Medium Severity):** WAFs can provide virtual patching capabilities to protect against zero-day vulnerabilities before official patches are available.
    *   **Bot Attacks (Medium Severity):** WAFs can identify and block malicious bots, scrapers, and automated attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **OWASP Top 10 Web Application Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Provides a significant layer of protection against common web application attacks.
    *   **DDoS Attacks (High Impact):** Offers robust DDoS mitigation capabilities.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Medium Impact):** Provides a degree of protection against zero-day vulnerabilities.
