# Threat Model Analysis for nginx/nginx

## Threat: [Misconfigured Access Control (allow/deny)](./threats/misconfigured_access_control__allowdeny_.md)

Description: Incorrectly configured `allow` and `deny` directives in Nginx configuration can lead to unintended access to restricted resources or bypass intended access controls. Attackers can exploit these misconfigurations to access protected areas or perform unauthorized actions.
Impact: Unauthorized access, data breach, security bypass.
Affected Nginx Component: `ngx_http_access_module`, Nginx configuration parsing.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
        Thoroughly test and review `allow` and `deny` rules.
        Use specific IP addresses or network ranges instead of broad rules where possible.
        Understand the order of processing for `allow` and `deny` directives (deny before allow).
        Use more robust authentication and authorization mechanisms where appropriate instead of relying solely on IP-based access control.

## Threat: [Nginx Core Vulnerability (e.g., Buffer Overflow)](./threats/nginx_core_vulnerability__e_g___buffer_overflow_.md)

Description: A vulnerability exists in the core Nginx code (e.g., a buffer overflow in request parsing). An attacker can send specially crafted requests to exploit this vulnerability, potentially leading to denial of service, memory corruption, or even remote code execution on the server.
Impact: Denial of service, remote code execution, complete server compromise.
Affected Nginx Component: Nginx core code (C code), request processing functions.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
        Keep Nginx updated to the latest stable version.
        Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor security advisories for Nginx.
        Apply security patches promptly as released by the Nginx team.
        Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block exploit attempts.

## Threat: [Module Vulnerability (e.g., in a third-party module)](./threats/module_vulnerability__e_g___in_a_third-party_module_.md)

Description: A vulnerability exists in a loaded Nginx module, either a core module or a third-party module. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability, similar to core vulnerabilities, potentially leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or remote code execution. Third-party modules may have less rigorous security review and could introduce vulnerabilities.
Impact: Denial of service, information disclosure, remote code execution, server compromise.
Affected Nginx Component: Specific Nginx module (e.g., `ngx_http_image_filter_module`, a third-party module), module's code.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
        Use modules from trusted and reputable sources.
        Keep all modules, including third-party modules, updated to the latest versions.
        Regularly review and audit the modules used in Nginx.
        Be cautious when using third-party modules and assess their security posture before deployment.
        Disable or remove unnecessary modules to reduce the attack surface.

## Threat: [HTTP/2 Protocol Vulnerability](./threats/http2_protocol_vulnerability.md)

Description: A vulnerability exists in Nginx's HTTP/2 implementation. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP/2 requests, potentially causing denial of service, resource exhaustion, or other unexpected behavior. In severe cases, it could lead to further compromise.
Impact: Denial of service, resource exhaustion, service disruption, potential for further compromise depending on the vulnerability.
Affected Nginx Component: `ngx_http_v2_module`, HTTP/2 protocol implementation.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
        Keep Nginx updated to benefit from fixes for known HTTP/2 vulnerabilities.
        Monitor security advisories related to HTTP/2.
        Consider disabling HTTP/2 if not strictly required and security concerns are high, especially if vulnerabilities are actively being exploited.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (CPU/Memory) via Malicious Requests](./threats/resource_exhaustion__cpumemory__via_malicious_requests.md)

Description: Attacker sends a large volume of requests or specially crafted requests that are computationally expensive for Nginx to process (e.g., large request bodies, complex processing). This can exhaust server CPU and memory resources, leading to performance degradation or server crash, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
Impact: Denial of service, service unavailability, performance degradation, server crash.
Affected Nginx Component: Request processing pipeline, various modules depending on the attack vector (e.g., `ngx_http_rewrite_module`, `ngx_http_gzip_module`).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
        Implement rate limiting using `ngx_http_limit_req_module`.
        Configure connection limits using `ngx_http_limit_conn_module`.
        Set appropriate buffer sizes (`client_body_buffer_size`, `client_header_buffer_size`) to limit resource consumption per request.
        Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory) and implement alerting for unusual spikes.
        Optimize Nginx configurations and application code for performance.

## Threat: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./threats/http_request_smuggling.md)

Description: Attacker exploits inconsistencies in how Nginx and backend servers parse HTTP requests. By crafting requests that are interpreted differently by Nginx and the backend, the attacker can "smuggle" requests to the backend, potentially bypassing security controls, accessing unauthorized resources, or causing unexpected behavior in the application, leading to significant security breaches.
Impact: Security bypass, unauthorized access, data manipulation, application compromise.
Affected Nginx Component: Request parsing, proxying functionality (`ngx_http_proxy_module`), interaction with backend servers.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
        Ensure Nginx and backend servers are configured to handle HTTP requests consistently, especially regarding header parsing and request delimiters.
        Use HTTP/2 where possible as it is less susceptible to smuggling attacks due to its binary framing.
        Validate and sanitize HTTP headers at both Nginx and backend levels.
        Use consistent HTTP parsing libraries and configurations across Nginx and backend servers.

## Threat: [Nginx User Privilege Escalation (via vulnerability)](./threats/nginx_user_privilege_escalation__via_vulnerability_.md)

Description: A vulnerability in Nginx or a misconfiguration could potentially allow an attacker to escalate privileges from the Nginx worker process user (typically a low-privileged user) to a higher privileged user or even root. This could grant the attacker full control over the server, leading to complete system compromise.
Impact: Full server compromise, data breach, complete system takeover.
Affected Nginx Component: Nginx core code, potentially modules, operating system security mechanisms.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
        Run Nginx worker processes with the least necessary privileges using a dedicated non-privileged user.
        Implement security hardening measures on the server operating system (e.g., kernel hardening, SELinux/AppArmor).
        Keep Nginx and the operating system updated with the latest security patches.
        Regularly audit Nginx configurations and server security posture.

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning](./threats/cache_poisoning.md)

Description: If Nginx caching is enabled, attackers might be able to poison the cache by manipulating responses from the backend server or exploiting vulnerabilities in the caching mechanism. This can lead to serving malicious content to legitimate users from the Nginx cache, potentially causing widespread user compromise and significant reputational damage.
Impact: Serving malicious content, website defacement, user compromise, reputation damage.
Affected Nginx Component: `ngx_http_proxy_module` (proxy caching), `ngx_http_fastcgi_module` (FastCGI caching), caching mechanisms.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
        Implement proper cache key management and validation to prevent attackers from manipulating cache keys.
        Use secure caching configurations, including appropriate cache control headers and directives.
        Consider using signed URLs or other mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of cached content.
        Regularly audit and monitor caching configurations and behavior.

## Threat: [Compromised Nginx Packages (from repository)](./threats/compromised_nginx_packages__from_repository_.md)

Description: The Nginx packages downloaded from official or third-party repositories could be compromised, containing malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities. If these compromised packages are installed, the server becomes vulnerable from the outset, potentially leading to complete system compromise and long-term undetected access for attackers.
Impact: Full server compromise, malware infection, data breach, complete system takeover.
Affected Nginx Component: Nginx installation packages, package management system, entire Nginx installation.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
        Use official and trusted repositories for Nginx packages.
        Verify package signatures if possible to ensure package integrity and authenticity.
        Implement security scanning on the server to detect any potential malware or anomalies.
        Consider using a vulnerability scanning tool to check installed packages for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Third-Party Modules](./threats/malicious_third-party_modules.md)

Description: Third-party Nginx modules from untrusted or compromised sources could contain malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities. Installing and using these modules introduces significant security risks to the Nginx server and the application, potentially granting attackers persistent access and control.
Impact: Remote code execution, data breach, malware infection, server compromise, application compromise.
Affected Nginx Component: Third-party Nginx modules, module loading mechanism, entire Nginx installation.
