## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Nginx Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_nginx_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific Nginx versions.
    * **Critical Node: Step 3: Exploit Applicable CVE (e.g., Buffer Overflow, Integer Overflow, HTTP Request Smuggling):**
        * **Attack Details:** Attackers identify the Nginx version, research associated CVEs, and utilize or develop exploits to leverage vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, integer overflows, or HTTP request smuggling flaws present in that version.
        * **Potential Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or Denial of Service (DoS).
        * **Mitigation:** Regularly update Nginx to the latest stable version and apply security patches promptly. Use vulnerability scanners to identify known CVEs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Modules](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_modules.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party Nginx modules.
    * **Critical Node: Step 3: Exploit Module Vulnerability:**
        * **Attack Details:** Attackers identify used third-party modules, research vulnerabilities in them, and exploit module-specific flaws.
        * **Potential Impact:** Module-specific vulnerabilities can lead to various impacts, including Remote Code Execution (RCE), information disclosure, or Denial of Service (DoS) depending on the module's functionality and vulnerability.
    * **Critical Node: Step 4: Compromise Application via Module Functionality (e.g., RCE through a vulnerable module):**
        * **Attack Details:** After exploiting a module vulnerability, attackers leverage the module's functionality or the compromised Nginx instance to further compromise the application. This could involve RCE within the application context, data manipulation, or bypassing application security controls.
        * **Potential Impact:** Full application compromise, data breach, unauthorized access and actions within the application.
        * **Mitigation:** Carefully vet third-party modules before use. Keep third-party modules updated. Implement strong module management and dependency tracking. Consider security audits for critical third-party modules.

## Attack Tree Path: [Security Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/security_misconfigurations.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting common security misconfigurations in Nginx.
    * **Sub-Paths:**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH: Weak TLS/SSL Configuration]**
            * **Critical Node: Step 3: Downgrade Attack or Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) to Intercept Traffic:**
                * **Attack Details:** Attackers identify weak TLS/SSL configurations (weak ciphers, protocols). They then perform downgrade attacks or Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks to intercept encrypted traffic between clients and the Nginx server.
                * **Potential Impact:** Data interception, credential theft, session hijacking.
                * **Mitigation:** Enforce strong TLS/SSL configurations. Disable weak ciphers and protocols. Use HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security). Ensure proper certificate management.
        * **Directory Listing Enabled**
            * **Critical Node: Step 3: Discover Sensitive Files, Configuration, or Application Logic:**
                * **Attack Details:** Attackers access directories where directory listing is enabled. They browse the listing to discover sensitive files, configuration files, or application logic that should not be publicly accessible.
                * **Potential Impact:** Information disclosure, configuration leaks, exposure of application logic, which can be used for further attacks.
                * **Mitigation:** Disable directory listing in Nginx configuration. Ensure proper index file configuration or restrict directory access using `autoindex off;` directive.
        * **Default Credentials/Weak Passwords (for services exposed via Nginx)**
            * **Critical Node: Step 3: Gain Access to Service and Potentially Pivot to Application:**
                * **Attack Details:** Attackers identify services exposed through Nginx (e.g., backend application admin panels, monitoring tools). They attempt to use default or common credentials to gain unauthorized access to these services.
                * **Potential Impact:** Access to backend services, potential for pivoting to the application, lateral movement within the infrastructure.
                * **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies for all services. Regularly audit and change default credentials. Implement multi-factor authentication where possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities via Misconfigured `root` or `alias`](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_via_misconfigured__root__or__alias_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities due to misconfiguration of `root` or `alias` directives in Nginx.
    * **Critical Node: Step 3: Access Files Outside Intended Web Root:**
        * **Attack Details:** Attackers craft HTTP requests with path traversal payloads (e.g., `../`) to bypass intended directory restrictions set by `root` or `alias` directives. This allows them to access files and directories outside the intended web root.
        * **Potential Impact:** Access to sensitive files, configuration files, source code, potentially leading to information disclosure or further exploitation.
        * **Mitigation:** Carefully configure `root` and `alias` directives. Sanitize user inputs and validate file paths. Consider implementing chroot or similar isolation if necessary.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Proxying Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_proxying_misconfigurations.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations in Nginx proxying directives (`proxy_pass`, `fastcgi_pass`).
    * **Critical Node: Step 3: Force Nginx to Make Requests to Internal or External Resources on Attacker's Behalf:**
        * **Attack Details:** Attackers manipulate proxy destinations, often through user-controlled input in URLs, to force Nginx to make requests to internal or external resources on their behalf. This can bypass firewalls and access internal systems.
        * **Potential Impact:** Access to internal resources, data exfiltration from internal networks, potential for further exploitation of backend systems, port scanning of internal networks.
        * **Mitigation:** Carefully validate and sanitize inputs used in proxy configurations. Implement allowlists for allowed proxy destinations. Restrict access to internal networks from Nginx if possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion/Denial of Service (DoS) via Nginx](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustiondenial_of_service__dos__via_nginx.md)

**Attack Vector:** Causing Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting Nginx resources.
    * **Sub-Paths:**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH: Slowloris/Slow HTTP Attacks]**
            * **Critical Node: Step 3: Cause Denial of Service:**
                * **Attack Details:** Attackers perform Slowloris or Slow HTTP attacks by sending slow, incomplete HTTP requests to exhaust Nginx's connection limits, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.
                * **Potential Impact:** Denial of Service, service unavailability, disruption of application functionality.
                * **Mitigation:** Configure `limit_conn` and `limit_req` directives in Nginx to limit connections and request rates. Implement timeouts. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or DDoS protection services.
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH: HTTP Request Smuggling]**
            * **Critical Node: Step 3: Bypass Security Controls or Gain Unauthorized Access:** (Note: While primarily a security bypass, smuggling can also lead to DoS in some scenarios by disrupting backend processing).
                * **Attack Details:** HTTP Request Smuggling exploits discrepancies in how Nginx and backend servers parse HTTP requests. Attackers smuggle malicious requests to the backend, potentially bypassing Nginx security controls or causing unexpected backend behavior, which can lead to DoS.
                * **Potential Impact:** Bypass security controls, unauthorized access, data manipulation, and in some cases, Denial of Service.
                * **Mitigation:** Ensure consistent request parsing between Nginx and backend servers. Carefully configure proxy settings and header handling. Regularly audit Nginx and backend configurations for smuggling vulnerabilities.
        * **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Configuration**
            * **Critical Node: Step 3: Cause High CPU Usage and Denial of Service:**
                * **Attack Details:** Attackers identify vulnerable regular expressions in Nginx configuration (e.g., in `location`, `if`, `rewrite` directives). They craft specific input designed to trigger exponential backtracking in these regexes, leading to high CPU usage and Denial of Service.
                * **Potential Impact:** Denial of Service, service unavailability due to CPU exhaustion.
                * **Mitigation:** Carefully review and test regular expressions in Nginx configuration. Avoid complex or nested regexes if possible. Implement input validation and sanitization before regex matching.
