**Description:** Attacker attempts to access restricted parts of the application or server files by exploiting flaws in Nginx `location` block configurations or `access_by_lua*` directives. They might try to bypass intended access restrictions to reach administrative panels, sensitive data directories, or internal application endpoints.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, access to administrative functionalities, potential lateral movement within the application.

**Affected Nginx Component:** Configuration (`location` blocks, `access_by_lua*` directives)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement the principle of least privilege in Nginx configuration.
*   Regularly review and audit access control rules defined in `location` blocks.
*   Utilize configuration validation tools to identify potential misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Insecure TLS Configuration](./threats/insecure_tls_configuration.md)

**Description:** Attacker performs Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks by exploiting weak TLS protocols and ciphers enabled in Nginx. They could downgrade the connection to weaker encryption, intercept communication, or eavesdrop on sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS.

**Impact:** Data interception, eavesdropping on encrypted communication, session hijacking, compromise of confidentiality and integrity.

**Affected Nginx Component:** TLS/SSL configuration (e.g., `ssl_protocols`, `ssl_ciphers`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use strong TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
*   Configure strong and secure cipher suites, prioritizing forward secrecy.
*   Disable insecure protocols like SSLv3 and TLS 1.0/1.1.
*   Enforce HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to prevent protocol downgrade attacks.
*   Regularly update TLS libraries (e.g., OpenSSL) and Nginx.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Misconfiguration](./threats/path_traversal_via_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** Attacker crafts requests to exploit misconfigured `alias` or `root` directives in Nginx, aiming to access files outside the intended web root directory. They might use specially crafted URLs to navigate the file system and retrieve sensitive files, source code, or configuration files.

**Impact:** Access to sensitive server files, source code disclosure, potential remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g., exposed application code).

**Affected Nginx Component:** Configuration (`alias`, `root` directives in `location` blocks)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and thoroughly test `alias` and `root` configurations.
*   Avoid using variables in file paths within `alias` or `root` if possible.
*   Restrict file system permissions to limit access even if path traversal is successful.

## Threat: [Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection](./threats/server-side_includes__ssi__injection.md)

**Description:** Attacker injects malicious code into user-supplied data that is then processed by Nginx's SSI module without proper sanitization. If SSI is enabled and vulnerable, they can execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting SSI directives into input fields or URL parameters.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, website defacement, information disclosure, server compromise.

**Affected Nginx Component:** SSI module (`ngx_http_ssi_module`)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
