  - Provide a reliable and high-performance web server and reverse proxy solution.
  - Enable efficient content delivery and application acceleration.
  - Offer a flexible and extensible platform for various network services.
  - Maintain a strong open-source community and ecosystem.
- Business Risks:

  - Data breaches through compromised web applications or server infrastructure.
  - Reputational damage from security incidents or performance issues.
  - Loss of user trust and adoption due to security concerns.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - publicly available source code allows for community review and vulnerability discovery. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Regular Security Updates - active development and maintenance with regular releases addressing identified vulnerabilities. (Implemented: nginx.org, GitHub Releases)
  - security control: Configuration Flexibility - extensive configuration options to harden security posture, such as access control lists, TLS/SSL settings, and rate limiting. (Implemented: nginx configuration files)
  - security control: Module Ecosystem - availability of security-focused modules for features like web application firewall (WAF) and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS). (Implemented: nginx modules, 3rd party modules)
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Modules - security of external modules is dependent on their developers and may introduce vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration by Users - improper configuration can lead to security weaknesses, such as open ports or insecure TLS settings.
  - accepted risk: Zero-Day Vulnerabilities - like all software, nginx is susceptible to undiscovered vulnerabilities.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Security Scanning - implement automated vulnerability scanning of nginx binaries and configurations in deployment pipelines.
  - security control: Security Configuration Baselines - define and enforce secure configuration baselines for nginx deployments across the organization.
  - security control: Web Application Firewall (WAF) Integration - deploy a WAF in front of nginx to protect against common web application attacks.
  - security control: Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) - implement network-based IDS/IPS to monitor and block malicious traffic targeting nginx.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Implement authentication mechanisms for administrative interfaces, such as the status page or any potential management APIs (if implemented via modules).
    - Requirement: Secure authentication credentials and practices, such as strong passwords or certificate-based authentication.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Enforce authorization policies to control access to resources and functionalities based on user roles or permissions.
    - Requirement: Implement least privilege principle for access control, granting only necessary permissions.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all incoming HTTP requests to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
    - Requirement: Sanitize user-provided data before processing or logging to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Enforce HTTPS for all sensitive communications to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement: Use strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols for TLS/SSL configuration.
    - Requirement: Properly manage and secure TLS/SSL certificates and private keys.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Serving web content to users.
  - Proxying requests to backend application servers.
  - Load balancing traffic across multiple servers.
  - Ensuring website and application availability and performance.
- Data to Protect:
  - Configuration data: nginx configuration files contain sensitive information like TLS/SSL keys, upstream server addresses, and access control rules. Sensitivity: High.
  - Log data: Access logs and error logs may contain user IP addresses, requested URLs, and potentially sensitive application data. Sensitivity: Medium to High (depending on logging configuration and regulations).
  - Cached content: If caching is enabled, nginx may store cached copies of web content, which could include sensitive data. Sensitivity: Medium to High (depending on cached content).
