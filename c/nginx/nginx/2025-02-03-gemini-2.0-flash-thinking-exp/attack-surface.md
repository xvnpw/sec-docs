# Attack Surface Analysis for nginx/nginx

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflow_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting flaws within Nginx's core C code that lead to writing data beyond allocated memory buffers during operations like request parsing or header handling. This is a direct vulnerability in Nginx's implementation.
*   **Nginx Contribution:** Nginx's core codebase, being written in C, is susceptible to buffer overflows if not meticulously coded and vetted. Vulnerabilities in core functionalities directly expose the server.
*   **Example:** A malformed HTTP request with excessively long headers processed by Nginx triggers a buffer overflow in its header parsing routine. Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Leads to complete server compromise, granting attackers full control, data theft, content modification, or use of the server for further malicious activities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Nginx Up-to-Date:**  Immediately apply security updates by upgrading to the latest stable Nginx version. Patches often address known buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
    *   **Utilize Security Hardening Compiler Flags:** Compile Nginx from source using compiler flags that enable buffer overflow protection mechanisms (e.g., stack canaries, ASLR) during the build process.
    *   **Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to filter and block potentially malicious requests designed to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities before they reach Nginx.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Misconfiguration of `alias` or `root`](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_misconfiguration_of__alias__or__root_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting incorrect configurations of Nginx's `alias` or `root` directives within location blocks. This allows attackers to bypass intended directory restrictions enforced by Nginx and access files outside the designated web root. The misconfiguration is directly within Nginx's configuration.
*   **Nginx Contribution:** Nginx's `alias` and `root` directives, while essential for file serving, are a direct configuration point that, if misused, creates path traversal vulnerabilities. Incorrectly defined paths in Nginx configuration are the root cause.
*   **Example:** A location block configured with `alias /var/www/static/;` combined with a request to `/static../sensitive_file.txt`. Due to flawed `alias` handling in the configuration, Nginx incorrectly resolves this to `/var/www/sensitive_file.txt`, bypassing intended restrictions and granting access to sensitive files.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Results in unauthorized access to sensitive data, application source code, configuration files, or system files, potentially enabling further attacks and data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Configuration Review:** Conduct thorough reviews of Nginx configurations, focusing on `alias` and `root` directives. Ensure they strictly limit access to intended directories and prevent path traversal.
    *   **Careful Use of `alias` and `root`:**  Fully understand the behavior of `alias` and `root` directives, especially regarding trailing slashes and path resolution. Use them precisely as intended for secure file serving.
    *   **Apply Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure file system permissions to restrict access to sensitive files and directories, limiting the damage even if path traversal through Nginx is successful.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Nginx Reverse Proxy](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__in_nginx_reverse_proxy.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting Nginx's reverse proxy functionality to force it to make requests to unintended internal resources or external services. This is achieved by manipulating request elements that influence Nginx's upstream request destinations. Nginx's proxy behavior is the attack vector.
*   **Nginx Contribution:**  When acting as a reverse proxy, Nginx's configuration dictates how it forwards requests. If upstream destinations are not strictly controlled within Nginx's configuration and request handling, SSRF vulnerabilities arise.
*   **Example:** An attacker manipulates the `X-Forwarded-Host` header, which Nginx uses to construct upstream URLs. By injecting a malicious URL (e.g., `http://internal-service/sensitive-data`), the attacker forces Nginx to request this internal service, potentially retrieving sensitive information or triggering actions on the internal network via Nginx.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Enables access to internal resources behind firewalls, bypassing access controls, reading sensitive data from internal services, or performing actions on internal systems through Nginx as a proxy.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly Define Allowed Upstream Destinations in Nginx:**  Implement whitelists within Nginx configuration to explicitly define and validate allowed upstream servers and paths. Prevent Nginx from proxying to arbitrary destinations.
    *   **Sanitize and Validate Input Affecting Upstream Requests:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user-supplied input (headers, parameters) that could influence the construction of upstream request URLs within Nginx's proxy configuration.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate internal services and resources from the external-facing Nginx server through network segmentation to limit the potential impact of SSRF exploitation via Nginx.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration in Nginx](./attack_surfaces/insecure_ssltls_configuration_in_nginx.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfiguring SSL/TLS settings within Nginx, leading to the use of weak cipher suites, outdated protocols, or improper certificate handling. This weakens the security of HTTPS connections terminated by Nginx. The vulnerability lies in Nginx's SSL/TLS configuration.
*   **Nginx Contribution:** Nginx is directly responsible for SSL/TLS termination for HTTPS traffic. Incorrect or weak SSL/TLS configuration within Nginx directly results in insecure connections.
*   **Example:** Configuring Nginx to use outdated protocols like TLS 1.0 or allowing weak cipher suites like RC4. This makes connections vulnerable to attacks like POODLE, BEAST, or SWEET32, potentially allowing attackers to decrypt communication or perform man-in-the-middle attacks on traffic secured by Nginx.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Compromises the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over HTTPS connections handled by Nginx. Sensitive information can be intercepted and decrypted.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Configure Strong Cipher Suites in Nginx:**  Explicitly configure Nginx to use only strong and modern cipher suites. Prioritize forward secrecy ciphers (e.g., ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384) within Nginx's SSL configuration.
    *   **Disable Weak SSL/TLS Protocols in Nginx:**  Disable outdated and insecure protocols like SSLv3, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1 within Nginx's SSL configuration. Enforce the use of TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.
    *   **Enable HSTS in Nginx Configuration:**  Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) in Nginx configuration to force browsers to always connect via HTTPS, preventing downgrade attacks on connections handled by Nginx.
    *   **Regularly Review and Update Nginx SSL/TLS Configuration:**  Stay informed about SSL/TLS best practices and regularly review and update Nginx's SSL/TLS settings to maintain strong security. Use tools like SSL Labs SSL Server Test to evaluate Nginx's SSL configuration.
