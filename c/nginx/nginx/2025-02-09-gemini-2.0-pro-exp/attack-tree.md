## Attack Tree Path: [1. Vulnerability Exploitation - CVE-XXX (Known) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__vulnerability_exploitation_-_cve-xxx__known___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (documented in CVE databases) in the specific Nginx version being used. Exploits are often readily available, making this a common attack vector.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High/Very High (Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, or DoS)
*   **Effort:** Low/Medium (Pre-built exploit tools often exist)
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard (Requires vulnerability scanning and intrusion detection systems)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Keep Nginx updated to the latest stable release.
    *   Implement a robust patch management process.
    *   Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanners.
    *   Subscribe to Nginx security advisories.
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to help block known exploit attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Misconfiguration](./attack_tree_paths/2__misconfiguration.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.a. Default Credentials [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_a__default_credentials__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access using default, unchanged administrative credentials (e.g., "admin/password"). This provides immediate, high-level access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Assuming basic security practices are followed)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete server compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   *Never* use default credentials.
        *   Change all default passwords immediately after installation.
        *   Enforce strong password policies.
        *   Regularly audit configurations for default credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.b. Improper Access Control (missing HTTP Headers) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_b__improper_access_control__missing_http_headers___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** A broad category encompassing various misconfigurations that weaken security, including:
        *   Missing or improperly configured security headers (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`).
        *   Exposing internal server information.
        *   Misconfigured directory listings.
        *   Incorrect file permissions.
        *   Exposing management interfaces.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Due to the wide range of potential misconfigurations)
    *   **Impact:** Medium/High (Varies depending on the specific misconfiguration; can lead to XSS, clickjacking, data leaks, etc.)
    *   **Effort:** Low/Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard (Some are easily spotted, others require in-depth analysis)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement a secure configuration baseline for Nginx.
        *   Regularly audit the configuration for deviations.
        *   Use automated configuration management tools.
        *   Thoroughly understand and implement recommended security headers.
        *   Disable unnecessary features and modules.
        *   Restrict access to management interfaces.
        *   Use a WAF.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/3__resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.a. CPU Exhaustion (High Request Rate) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_a__cpu_exhaustion__high_request_rate___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood the server with a high volume of requests, overwhelming the CPU and preventing legitimate access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium/High
    *   **Impact:** Medium/High (Service disruption)
    *   **Effort:** Low/Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Unusual traffic patterns can be identified)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement rate limiting (e.g., Nginx's `limit_req` module).
        *   Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
        *   Monitor CPU usage and set up alerts.
        *   Implement DDoS protection mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.b. Memory Exhaustion (Large Request Size) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_b__memory_exhaustion__large_request_size___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send requests with large bodies or headers, consuming excessive memory and causing service disruption.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium/High (Service disruption)
    *   **Effort:** Low/Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Unusual traffic patterns and memory usage can be identified)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Configure limits on request body size (`client_max_body_size`).
        *   Configure limits on header size (`large_client_header_buffers`).
        *   Monitor memory usage and set up alerts.
        *   Implement DDoS protection mechanisms.
