# Deep Analysis: Weak `server_name` Configuration (Host Header Attacks) in Nginx

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the security implications of improperly configured `server_name` directives in Nginx, specifically focusing on how attackers can exploit this weakness to perform Host Header attacks.  We will identify the root causes, potential attack vectors, and robust mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to provide developers with actionable guidance to prevent this vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the `server_name` directive within Nginx configuration files and its relationship to the HTTP `Host` header.  It covers:

*   **Vulnerable Configurations:**  Wildcard (`_`), overly broad domain names, and missing default server blocks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Exploitation techniques leveraging manipulated `Host` headers.
*   **Impact:**  The range of potential consequences, from information disclosure to complete application compromise.
*   **Mitigation:**  Specific, practical steps to secure Nginx configurations against Host Header attacks.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other Nginx vulnerabilities unrelated to `server_name` and the `Host` header.
*   Vulnerabilities in application code that *might* be triggered by a Host Header attack (although we'll touch on this interaction).  This analysis focuses on the Nginx configuration layer.
*   Attacks that do not involve manipulating the `Host` header.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Technical Explanation:**  Detailed explanation of how Nginx uses `server_name` to process requests and how the `Host` header interacts with this process.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Identification of specific configuration weaknesses and how they create vulnerabilities.
3.  **Attack Vector Exploration:**  Description of various attack scenarios, including examples and potential payloads.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluation of the potential damage caused by successful attacks.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Detailed, step-by-step recommendations for securing Nginx configurations, including code examples and best practices.
6.  **Testing and Verification:**  Suggestions for testing the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1 Technical Explanation

Nginx uses a multi-stage process to determine which `server` block (virtual host) should handle an incoming HTTP request:

1.  **IP Address and Port Matching:** Nginx first identifies the `listen` directive that matches the incoming request's IP address and port.  Multiple `server` blocks can listen on the same IP and port.

2.  **`server_name` Matching:**  If multiple `server` blocks match the IP and port, Nginx examines the `Host` header in the HTTP request.  It compares the `Host` header value against the `server_name` directives in each matching `server` block.  The matching process follows this order of precedence:

    *   **Exact Name Match:**  `server_name example.com;`
    *   **Longest Wildcard Starting with an Asterisk:** `server_name *.example.com;`
    *   **Longest Wildcard Ending with an Asterisk:** `server_name www.example.*;`
    *   **First Matching Regular Expression:** `server_name ~^(?<user>.+)\.example\.net$;`
    *   **Default Server:** If no `server_name` matches, Nginx uses the "default server."  This is either the first `server` block defined in the configuration or a `server` block explicitly marked with `listen ... default_server;`.

3.  **Request Processing:** Once a `server` block is selected, Nginx processes the request according to the directives within that block (e.g., `location` blocks, proxy settings, etc.).

The `Host` header is crucial because it tells the web server *which* website the client intends to access, even if multiple websites are hosted on the same IP address.

### 4.2 Vulnerability Analysis

The core vulnerability lies in overly permissive or missing `server_name` configurations:

*   **Wildcard `server_name` (`_` or `*`):**  Using `server_name _;` or `server_name *;` means this `server` block will accept *any* `Host` header value.  This is extremely dangerous unless it's a deliberately configured "catch-all" that *immediately* rejects or sanitizes the request.

*   **Overly Broad Domain Names:**  Using `server_name *.example.com;` when you only intend to serve `www.example.com` and `api.example.com` leaves you vulnerable.  An attacker could use `evil.example.com`.

*   **Missing Default Server:**  If no `server` block is designated as the default (either implicitly as the first block or explicitly with `default_server`), and no `server_name` matches the `Host` header, Nginx's behavior is less predictable.  It might fall back to the first `server` block, which might not be configured to handle unexpected `Host` values securely.

*   **No validation of Host header in application:** Even if Nginx configuration is correct, application can be vulnerable if it blindly trusts Host header.

### 4.3 Attack Vector Exploration

Here are some common attack scenarios:

*   **Cache Poisoning:** An attacker sends a request with a malicious `Host` header (e.g., `Host: evil.com`).  If the application uses the `Host` header to generate cache keys *without proper validation*, the attacker can poison the cache with malicious content.  Subsequent legitimate users requesting the intended resource (e.g., `Host: example.com`) might receive the attacker's poisoned content.

*   **Bypassing Authentication:**  If an internal service or administrative interface is accessible only through a specific hostname (e.g., `admin.internal`), and a public-facing `server` block uses a wildcard `server_name`, an attacker could send a request with `Host: admin.internal` to bypass intended access controls.

*   **Password Reset Poisoning:**  Many web applications use the `Host` header to construct password reset links.  An attacker could inject a malicious `Host` header during the password reset process, causing the application to generate a link pointing to the attacker's server.  The victim, clicking the link, would unknowingly send their password reset token to the attacker.

*   **Routing to unintended backend:** If Nginx is used as reverse proxy, attacker can route request to unintended backend by manipulating Host header.

*   **Application-Specific Vulnerabilities:**  Many web applications rely on the `Host` header for various purposes (e.g., generating URLs, determining the current domain).  If the application doesn't validate the `Host` header, an attacker could exploit application-specific vulnerabilities by injecting unexpected values.

**Example Payload (Cache Poisoning):**

```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: attacker.com
Connection: close
```

If the application uses the `Host` header directly in the cache key, this request might be cached under a key associated with `attacker.com`.  If the attacker then sends malicious content with the same request, legitimate users might receive that content.

### 4.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful Host Header attack can range from low to critical:

*   **Low:**  Minor information disclosure (e.g., revealing internal server names).
*   **Medium:**  Cache poisoning, leading to denial of service or serving malicious content to some users.
*   **High:**  Bypassing authentication, accessing sensitive data, password reset poisoning.
*   **Critical:**  Complete application compromise, remote code execution (if the Host Header attack triggers a vulnerability in the application code).

### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

The following steps are crucial for mitigating Host Header attacks:

1.  **Define Specific `server_name` Values:**  Use the *exact* domain names you intend to serve.  Avoid wildcards unless absolutely necessary.

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com www.example.com;
        # ...
    }
    ```

2.  **Implement a Default Server Block (Catch-All):**  Create a dedicated `server` block that acts as a default, catching any requests with unmatched `Host` headers.  This block should *reject* the request, ideally with a `444` status code (Nginx's special code to close the connection without sending a response).

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        server_name _;  # Or simply omit server_name
        return 444;
    }
    ```

3.  **Validate the `Host` Header in Application Code (Defense in Depth):**  Even with a secure Nginx configuration, your application should *independently* validate the `Host` header.  Maintain a whitelist of allowed hostnames and reject any requests that don't match.  This is crucial because Nginx's `server_name` matching only protects at the virtual host level; it doesn't prevent application-level vulnerabilities. The best way is to use absolute URLs in application.

4.  **Use Absolute URLs:**  Whenever possible, use absolute URLs (including the scheme and hostname) within your application.  This reduces reliance on the `Host` header and makes your application less susceptible to injection attacks.

5.  **Regularly Review and Update Configurations:**  Periodically review your Nginx configurations to ensure they remain secure and up-to-date.

### 4.6 Testing and Verification

After implementing mitigations, thorough testing is essential:

1.  **Send Requests with Invalid `Host` Headers:**  Use tools like `curl` or `Burp Suite` to send requests with various invalid `Host` headers (e.g., `evil.com`, `attacker.net`, IP addresses).  Verify that Nginx returns the expected `444` status code (or your chosen error response).

    ```bash
    curl -H "Host: evil.com" http://your-server-ip
    ```

2.  **Test with Expected `Host` Headers:**  Ensure that legitimate requests with valid `Host` headers are processed correctly.

3.  **Test Application-Level Validation:**  If you've implemented `Host` header validation in your application code, test it thoroughly with various inputs, including edge cases and potentially malicious values.

4.  **Use Security Scanners:**  Employ web application security scanners to identify potential Host Header vulnerabilities and other security issues.

## 5. Conclusion

Weak `server_name` configurations in Nginx represent a significant security risk, enabling Host Header attacks that can lead to various consequences, from cache poisoning to complete application compromise. By understanding the underlying mechanisms, implementing specific `server_name` values, creating a default server block to reject invalid requests, and validating the `Host` header within the application itself, developers can effectively mitigate this vulnerability and significantly enhance the security of their web applications.  Regular testing and configuration reviews are crucial to maintain a strong security posture.
