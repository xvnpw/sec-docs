# Attack Surface Analysis for nginx/nginx

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Access Controls](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_access_controls.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured `allow` and `deny` directives in Nginx configuration files can grant unauthorized access to sensitive resources or administrative interfaces.

**How Nginx Contributes:** Nginx's access control mechanism directly enforces these rules. Misconfiguration here directly leads to the vulnerability.

**Example:** A configuration might allow access to the `/admin` location from any IP address, instead of restricting it to a specific set of internal IPs.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, administrative functions, or the ability to manipulate the application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement the principle of least privilege when configuring access controls.
* Thoroughly review all `allow` and `deny` directives.
* Utilize IP whitelisting instead of blacklisting where possible.
* Regularly audit access control configurations.
* Consider using authentication mechanisms in addition to IP-based restrictions.

## Attack Surface: [Directory Listing Enabled](./attack_surfaces/directory_listing_enabled.md)

**Description:** When the `autoindex on;` directive is enabled in a location block, Nginx will display a list of files and directories if no index file is present.

**How Nginx Contributes:** Nginx's built-in `autoindex` module provides this functionality.

**Example:** An attacker can browse the contents of a directory that was not intended to be publicly accessible, potentially discovering sensitive files or configuration details.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files, application source code, or internal directory structures.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure `autoindex off;` is set within relevant `location` blocks in the Nginx configuration.
* Place an `index` file (e.g., `index.html`) in directories to prevent automatic listing.
* Restrict access to directories that should not be publicly accessible via access control directives.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smuggling.md)

**Description:** Exploiting discrepancies in how Nginx and backend servers parse HTTP request boundaries, allowing attackers to inject malicious requests.

**How Nginx Contributes:** Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and needs to correctly interpret and forward HTTP requests. If its parsing differs from the backend, smuggling can occur.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a request with ambiguous `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers, leading Nginx and the backend to interpret the request boundaries differently, allowing the attacker to inject a second, malicious request.

**Impact:** Bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access, cache poisoning, and potentially executing arbitrary code on backend servers.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Nginx and backend servers are configured to strictly adhere to HTTP specifications.
* Normalize requests at the proxy level to eliminate ambiguities.
* Use HTTP/2 for backend connections where possible, as it is less susceptible to smuggling attacks.
* Regularly update Nginx and backend server software.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Misconfigured Proxying](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery_(ssrf)_via_misconfigured_proxying.md)

**Description:** If Nginx is configured to proxy requests based on user-controlled input without proper validation, attackers can force Nginx to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.

**How Nginx Contributes:** Nginx's `proxy_pass` directive allows it to forward requests to other servers. Misuse of this directive with user-provided URLs creates the vulnerability.

**Example:** A user-provided URL parameter is directly used in a `proxy_pass` directive, allowing an attacker to make Nginx send requests to internal services not intended to be public.

**Impact:** Access to internal services, reading sensitive data from internal resources, potential for further exploitation of internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using user-provided input directly in `proxy_pass` directives.
* Implement strict validation and sanitization of any user input used in proxy configurations.
* Use a predefined set of allowed upstream servers instead of dynamically generated ones.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_ssltls_configuration.md)

**Description:** Using weak ciphers, outdated protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0), or not enforcing HTTPS can expose traffic to interception and manipulation.

**How Nginx Contributes:** Nginx handles SSL/TLS termination based on its configuration. Insecure settings weaken the encryption.

**Example:** Nginx is configured to allow the use of the vulnerable SSLv3 protocol or weak ciphers like RC4.

**Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping on sensitive data, session hijacking.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure Nginx to use strong and modern TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
* Disable support for weak ciphers and prioritize secure cipher suites.
* Enforce HTTPS by redirecting HTTP traffic.
* Regularly update OpenSSL (if used by Nginx) to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Modules](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_modules.md)

**Description:** Security flaws within custom or third-party Nginx modules can introduce new attack vectors.

**How Nginx Contributes:** Nginx's modular architecture allows for extending its functionality, but these modules can contain vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A third-party authentication module has a vulnerability that allows bypassing the authentication mechanism.

**Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly vet and audit third-party modules before using them.
* Keep all modules updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Minimize the number of third-party modules used.
* Monitor security advisories for the modules being used.
