# Threat Model Analysis for nginx/nginx

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Misconfiguration](./threats/path_traversal_via_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate URLs to access files and directories outside the intended web root due to incorrect configuration of `alias` or `root` directives within Nginx. For example, an attacker might craft a URL like `/../../../../etc/passwd`.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential for configuration file access, and in severe cases, potentially leading to code execution if writable files are accessed.
*   **Affected Nginx Component:** `ngx_http_core_module` (handling of `alias` and `root` directives).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully configure `alias` and `root` directives, ensuring they point to the correct and restricted locations.
    *   Avoid using variables in `root` directives if not strictly necessary.
    *   Regularly audit Nginx configuration for potential path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./threats/known_vulnerabilities_(cves).md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the installed Nginx version. This could involve sending specially crafted requests directly to Nginx to trigger bugs leading to various impacts.
*   **Impact:** Can range from denial of service to remote code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability within Nginx.
*   **Affected Nginx Component:** Varies depending on the specific CVE, potentially affecting core modules or specific third-party modules within Nginx.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for remote code execution vulnerabilities), High (for other significant vulnerabilities).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Nginx to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for Nginx and related components.
    *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for virtual patching.

## Threat: [Request Smuggling](./threats/request_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send crafted HTTP requests that are interpreted differently by Nginx and the backend server. This discrepancy in interpretation, directly involving Nginx's parsing, can allow them to bypass security controls, route requests to unintended destinations, or poison caches.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls enforced by Nginx, unauthorized access to resources on the backend through Nginx, cache poisoning affecting users served by Nginx, and potentially executing commands on the backend server.
*   **Affected Nginx Component:** `ngx_http_proxy_module` (when used as a reverse proxy), core HTTP request parsing within Nginx.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Nginx and backend servers have consistent HTTP parsing configurations.
    *   Normalize requests within Nginx before forwarding them to the backend.
    *   Use HTTP/2 consistently between Nginx and the backend if possible.
    *   Implement strict request validation on both Nginx and the backend.

## Threat: [Response Splitting/Injection](./threats/response_splittinginjection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious content into HTTP response headers by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Nginx handles specific characters or input when constructing responses. This direct interaction with Nginx's response handling can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other client-side attacks.
*   **Impact:** Client-side attacks like XSS affecting users receiving responses from Nginx, session hijacking, and defacement.
*   **Affected Nginx Component:** `ngx_http_headers_module` (handling of response headers within Nginx).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid directly reflecting user input in response headers managed by Nginx.
    *   Properly sanitize and encode data before including it in response headers within Nginx configurations or modules.
    *   Implement strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks originating from Nginx's responses.

## Threat: [Weak TLS/SSL Configuration](./threats/weak_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Nginx is configured to use weak or outdated cipher suites or TLS protocol versions. This configuration vulnerability within Nginx makes the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks or protocol downgrade attacks targeting the Nginx instance.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of data confidentiality and integrity for connections terminated by Nginx, potential for session hijacking on the Nginx layer.
*   **Affected Nginx Component:** `ngx_stream_ssl_module` and `ngx_http_ssl_module` (handling of TLS/SSL within Nginx).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure strong and modern cipher suites using the `ssl_ciphers` directive within Nginx.
    *   Enforce the use of secure TLS protocol versions (TLS 1.2 or higher) using the `ssl_protocols` directive within Nginx.
    *   Regularly update OpenSSL (or the underlying TLS library) used by Nginx.

## Threat: [Improper Certificate Validation (when acting as a proxy)](./threats/improper_certificate_validation_(when_acting_as_a_proxy).md)

*   **Description:** When Nginx acts as a reverse proxy to backend HTTPS services, it might not properly validate the SSL/TLS certificates of those backend servers. This vulnerability within Nginx's proxy functionality can allow man-in-the-middle attacks between Nginx and the backend.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of data confidentiality and integrity between Nginx and backend servers.
*   **Affected Nginx Component:** `ngx_http_proxy_module` (handling of upstream HTTPS connections within Nginx).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure Nginx to verify the SSL/TLS certificates of backend servers using the `proxy_ssl_verify` and `proxy_ssl_trusted_certificate` directives.
