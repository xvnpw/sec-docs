## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Nginx Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/1._exploit_nginx_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs):**
    *   Attackers identify the specific version of Nginx running on the target application.
    *   They search for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with that version.
    *   If a relevant vulnerability exists, they utilize readily available exploit code or tools to target the Nginx instance.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Gain unauthorized access or execute code:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the server, potentially executing arbitrary commands or taking control of the system.

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Nginx Modules:**
    *   Attackers identify the core or third-party modules enabled within the Nginx configuration.
    *   They search for known vulnerabilities in these specific modules.
    *   If a vulnerability is found, they utilize existing exploits or develop custom ones to target the vulnerable module.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Gain unauthorized access or execute code through the module:** Successful exploitation of a module can provide a pathway to execute code within the Nginx process or gain access to resources managed by that module, potentially leading to broader system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Nginx Configuration:](./attack_tree_paths/2._abuse_nginx_configuration.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Misconfigured `proxy_pass`:**
        *   Incorrectly configured `proxy_pass` directives can lead to the Nginx server forwarding requests to unintended backend servers or resources.
        *   Bypass intended backend routing: Attackers can craft requests that, due to the misconfiguration, are routed to internal services or resources that are not meant to be publicly accessible.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Access sensitive internal resources:** This allows attackers to directly access sensitive data, APIs, or other internal functionalities that are not exposed through the intended application interface.

    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Misconfigured `alias` or `root` directives:**
        *   The `alias` and `root` directives control how Nginx maps URLs to the server's filesystem.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Access arbitrary files on the server:** Misconfigurations can allow attackers to access any file on the server's filesystem by manipulating the URL.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Expose sensitive data or configuration:** This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including database credentials, API keys, or even the Nginx configuration files themselves.

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Gain Unauthorized Access to Nginx Configuration Files:**
    *   Attackers aim to gain direct access to the `nginx.conf` file and other related configuration files.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit OS-level vulnerabilities to access files:** This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system to bypass file system permissions and access the configuration files.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit vulnerabilities in management interfaces (if any):** If Nginx is managed through a web interface or other management tools, vulnerabilities in these interfaces could allow attackers to download or modify the configuration files.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Manipulate file permissions through other means:** Attackers might leverage other compromised services or vulnerabilities to change the permissions of the configuration files, granting them read or write access.

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Configuration:**
    *   Attackers aim to modify the Nginx configuration to introduce malicious directives or alter existing ones.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise systems with access to configuration management:** This involves compromising systems that are used to manage and deploy Nginx configurations, such as configuration management tools or version control systems.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Introduce malicious directives or modify existing ones:** Once access is gained, attackers can inject malicious configurations that redirect traffic, expose sensitive information, or execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Manipulate Nginx Request Handling:](./attack_tree_paths/3._manipulate_nginx_request_handling.md)

*   **HTTP Request Smuggling/Desynchronization:**
    *   Attackers craft ambiguous HTTP requests that are interpreted differently by the Nginx frontend and the backend application server.
    *   Craft ambiguous HTTP requests: These requests exploit subtle differences in how the two servers parse headers like `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`.
    *   Cause Nginx and backend to interpret requests differently: This discrepancy allows the attacker to "smuggle" additional requests within the body of an initial request.
    *   Bypass security checks on one end: Security checks performed by Nginx might be bypassed for the smuggled requests.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Execute malicious actions on the other:** The smuggled requests are then processed by the backend server, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data manipulation, or access to restricted resources.
