### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Nginx

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve Nginx:

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Misconfigured `alias` or `root`
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a URL containing `../` sequences or similar techniques to bypass intended directory restrictions and access files outside the designated document root. This is often due to incorrect configuration of the `alias` or `root` directives within Nginx.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files such as configuration files, application source code, or user data. In severe cases, it could lead to remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Misconfigured `proxy_pass`
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the target URL in a `proxy_pass` directive, causing the Nginx server to make requests to unintended internal or external resources. This can be exploited if the upstream URL is dynamically generated based on user input without proper validation within the Nginx configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal services not meant to be publicly accessible, potential for data exfiltration from internal networks, or even triggering actions on internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** HTTP Request Smuggling
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests that are interpreted differently by the Nginx frontend and the backend server. This discrepancy allows the attacker to "smuggle" additional requests to the backend, potentially bypassing security controls or poisoning the cache. This often involves manipulating `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers and is a vulnerability within Nginx's core HTTP parsing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing web application firewalls or authentication mechanisms, gaining unauthorized access to resources, cache poisoning, and potentially executing arbitrary code on the backend server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Cache Poisoning
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the caching behavior of Nginx to serve malicious content to other users. This can be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Nginx determines cache keys or by injecting malicious content into responses that are then cached by Nginx.
    *   **Impact:** Serving malicious content to legitimate users, defacement of the website, spreading misinformation, or facilitating further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests or specially crafted requests to exhaust Nginx's resources (e.g., connections, memory, CPU), making the server unresponsive to legitimate users. This can involve techniques like slowloris attacks or exploiting vulnerabilities in Nginx's request processing.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting business operations and user experience.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Nginx Modules
    *   **Description:** Security flaws are discovered in third-party or even core Nginx modules. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to achieve various malicious outcomes, depending on the nature of the flaw within the specific Nginx module.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or other impacts depending on the specific module and vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
