## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: Gain unauthorized access and control over the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Nginx web server.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Nginx Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vector:** This path involves directly exploiting security flaws within the Nginx codebase itself.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Known Nginx Vulnerability:**
    *   **Attack Step: Identify Vulnerable Nginx Version:** Attackers first need to determine the specific version of Nginx running on the target application. This can be done through various techniques like examining server headers or probing for known version-specific behaviors.
    *   **Attack Step: Execute Exploit (e.g., Buffer Overflow, Integer Overflow):** Once a vulnerable version is identified, attackers can leverage publicly available exploits or develop their own to take advantage of the flaw. Common vulnerabilities include buffer overflows (writing beyond allocated memory), integer overflows (arithmetic errors leading to unexpected behavior), and other memory corruption issues. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the server.

**High-Risk Path: Leverage Nginx Misconfiguration**

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses created by incorrect or insecure configurations of the Nginx web server.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Misconfigured Access Control:**
    *   **Attack Step: Bypass Authentication/Authorization Rules:**  Attackers can exploit flaws in the configuration of `allow` and `deny` directives or other access control mechanisms to bypass authentication or authorization checks. This allows them to access resources they should not have permission to.
    *   **Attack Step: Access Restricted Resources without Proper Credentials:**  By successfully bypassing access controls, attackers can directly access sensitive data, administrative interfaces, or other restricted functionalities.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Insecure File Serving Configuration:**
    *   **Attack Step: Access Sensitive Files via Incorrect `alias` or `root` Directives:** Misconfigured `alias` or `root` directives can expose sensitive files and directories to the web. Attackers can craft specific URLs to access configuration files, source code, or other confidential information.
    *   **Attack Step: Directory Traversal via Misconfigured URI Handling:**  Incorrectly configured URI handling can allow attackers to use ".." sequences in URLs to navigate outside the intended document root and access arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Misconfigured Proxy Settings:**
    *   **Attack Step: Inject Malicious Headers via `proxy_set_header`:** If Nginx is configured to forward client-supplied headers without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious headers that are then passed on to the backend application. This can lead to various vulnerabilities like HTTP header injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) if the backend doesn't handle these headers securely.
    *   **Attack Step: Bypass Backend Security Checks due to Incorrect Header Forwarding:**  Incorrectly configured header forwarding can lead to situations where backend security checks are bypassed. For example, if the backend relies on specific headers for authentication or authorization, and Nginx is not forwarding them correctly or is forwarding manipulated versions, attackers might gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Attack Step: Cause Denial of Service by Overwhelming Backend Servers:**  Misconfigured proxy settings, such as not setting appropriate timeouts or connection limits, can allow attackers to send a large number of requests through Nginx to the backend servers, overwhelming them and causing a denial of service.

**High-Risk Path: Abuse Nginx Features for Malicious Purposes**

*   **Attack Vector:** This path involves using legitimate Nginx features in unintended and malicious ways to compromise the application.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit `proxy_pass` Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Attack Step: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Dynamic `proxy_pass`:** If the `proxy_pass` directive uses user-controlled input without proper sanitization, attackers can manipulate the target URL, causing Nginx to make requests to internal or external resources on their behalf. This can be used to scan internal networks, access internal services, or even interact with external APIs.
    *   **Attack Step: Inject Malicious Requests to Internal Services:** By exploiting the `proxy_pass` functionality, attackers can craft malicious requests that are then forwarded by Nginx to internal services. This can potentially exploit vulnerabilities in those internal services that are not directly exposed to the internet.
