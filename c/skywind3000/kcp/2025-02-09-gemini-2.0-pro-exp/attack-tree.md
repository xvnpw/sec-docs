## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Spoof Source Addresses](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_spoof_source_addresses.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends a large volume of KCP packets with forged source IP addresses. This makes it difficult to identify and block the attacker, and it can exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) as the server attempts to process these packets.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Rate limiting (per source IP, even if spoofed), connection tracking, and potentially more advanced techniques like SYN cookies (adapted for KCP).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Invalid CONV Values](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_invalid_conv_values.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends KCP packets with random or rapidly changing conversation IDs (CONVs). This disrupts the server's session management, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or denial of service for legitimate clients.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Strict CONV validation, rate limiting based on CONV, and potentially blacklisting CONVs associated with suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Rapid Connection/Disconnection](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_rapid_connectiondisconnection.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker repeatedly establishes and tears down KCP connections.  This can exhaust server resources related to connection management (e.g., connection tables, sockets).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Mitigation:** Connection rate limiting, connection timeouts, and potentially limiting the number of concurrent connections per source IP.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Compromise Network Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_compromise_network_infrastructure.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains control of network devices (routers, switches, DNS servers) between the client and server. This allows them to intercept, modify, or redirect KCP traffic.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
*   **Mitigation:** Network segmentation, intrusion detection systems (IDS), strong network device security, and end-to-end encryption (which makes the intercepted data useless to the attacker).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Bypass or Weaken Encryption (if misconfigured)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_bypass_or_weaken_encryption__if_misconfigured_.md)

*   **Description:** If KCP is used without encryption, or with weak encryption (e.g., weak ciphers, short keys, improper key management), the attacker can passively eavesdrop on the communication and read the transmitted data.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if strong encryption is used) / High (if encryption is disabled or weak)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low (if weak encryption) / Very High (if strong encryption)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (if weak encryption) / Expert (if strong encryption)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** *Mandatory use of strong, well-vetted encryption with KCP.* Use modern, secure ciphers and proper key management practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Inject Malicious Data via KCP](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_inject_malicious_data_via_kcp.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the *application* layer (not KCP itself) by sending specially crafted data via KCP.  This could be SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, or other application-specific vulnerabilities. KCP is merely the transport mechanism.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depends on application vulnerabilities)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (depends on the exploited vulnerability)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (depends on application-level security measures)
*   **Mitigation:** *Rigorous input validation and sanitization at the application layer.*  Never trust data received from KCP (or any other source) without thorough validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.2 Craft Exploit Payload (Buffer Overflow)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_2_craft_exploit_payload__buffer_overflow_.md)

*   **Description:** After identifying a buffer overflow vulnerability in the KCP library (3.1.1), the attacker crafts a KCP packet that triggers the overflow, overwriting memory and ultimately executing attacker-controlled code.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation:** Code review, fuzzing, static analysis, and using memory-safe languages or libraries where possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.2 Craft Exploit Payload (Integer Overflow/Underflow)](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_2_craft_exploit_payload__integer_overflowunderflow_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to buffer overflows, but exploiting integer handling errors in the KCP library. The attacker crafts a packet that causes an integer overflow or underflow, leading to memory corruption and potentially code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation:** Code review, fuzzing, static analysis, and careful integer handling in the code.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3.1 Use KCP to Deliver Exploit](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_1_use_kcp_to_deliver_exploit.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 2.2.1, but with the goal of achieving code execution. The attacker uses KCP to send data that exploits a vulnerability in the *application* layer, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depends on application vulnerabilities)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation:** *Rigorous input validation and sanitization at the application layer.* Secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities like command injection, format string bugs, etc.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2 Compromise Authentication (if any, on top of KCP)](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_compromise_authentication__if_any__on_top_of_kcp_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses an authentication mechanism *on top of* KCP, the attacker compromises this authentication (e.g., steals credentials, bypasses authentication logic). This allows the attacker to impersonate a legitimate client or server. This is *not* a KCP-specific vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Depends entirely on the authentication mechanism used.
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Depends entirely on the authentication mechanism used.
*   **Skill Level:** Depends entirely on the authentication mechanism used.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Depends entirely on the authentication mechanism used.
*   **Mitigation:** Use strong, well-vetted authentication mechanisms. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where appropriate. Protect credentials and session tokens.
