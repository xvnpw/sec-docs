# Threat Model Analysis for skywind3000/kcp

## Threat: [Packet Manipulation/Injection (Pre-KCP, Exploiting Lack of KCP-Level Integrity)](./threats/packet_manipulationinjection__pre-kcp__exploiting_lack_of_kcp-level_integrity_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic *before* it reaches the KCP receiver. They modify the payload of existing KCP packets or inject entirely new, crafted packets. Because KCP *does not* provide built-in payload integrity checks, the attacker can inject malicious data that KCP will reliably deliver to the application. This is a *direct* consequence of KCP's design, which prioritizes reliability over built-in security.
    *   **Impact:** Application data corruption, execution of malicious code (if the payload contains executable instructions), data leakage, denial of service. The impact depends entirely on the *application* and what it does with the corrupted data.
    *   **Affected KCP Component:** `ikcp_input` is directly affected. KCP will process these manipulated packets as if they were valid, passing the corrupted data to the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if no encryption is used at the application layer) or High (if weak or improperly implemented encryption is used).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory End-to-End Encryption:** *Must* encrypt the application data *within* the KCP payload using a strong, authenticated encryption scheme (e.g., TLS, DTLS, or a custom solution with AEAD ciphers). This is *not* optional for secure use of KCP.
        *   **Message Authentication Codes (MACs):** Calculate a MAC over the *encrypted* application data and include it in the payload. The receiver verifies the MAC *after* decryption to ensure integrity.
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Use digital signatures for non-repudiation and integrity, especially if the application requires strong authentication of the sender.

## Threat: [KCP Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/kcp_resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a flood of valid-looking KCP packets (even with garbage data) to the server. The attacker exploits KCP's stateful nature to exhaust server resources dedicated to managing KCP sessions (memory, CPU, connection tracking). This is a *direct* attack on the KCP implementation's ability to handle a large number of connections or high packet rates.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) specifically targeting the KCP handling component of the application. Legitimate KCP clients are unable to connect or experience severe performance degradation.
    *   **Affected KCP Component:** The entire KCP implementation is affected, particularly functions related to session management (`ikcp_create`, `ikcp_input`, internal connection tracking data structures).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Connection Rate Limiting:** Implement aggressive rate limiting on new KCP connections from a single IP address or range.
        *   **Per-Connection Bandwidth Limiting:** Limit the bandwidth allowed for each individual KCP connection.
        *   **Short Session Timeouts:** Configure short timeouts for inactive KCP sessions to quickly free up resources.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Set hard limits on the maximum number of concurrent KCP sessions and the total memory allocated to KCP.
        *   **KCP-Specific Monitoring:** Monitor KCP-related metrics (active sessions, buffer usage, packet rates) to detect and respond to DoS attempts.

## Threat: [Implementation Bugs in `skywind3000/kcp` (Exploitable Vulnerabilities)](./threats/implementation_bugs_in__skywind3000kcp___exploitable_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** The `skywind3000/kcp` library itself contains exploitable vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows, logic errors) in its C code. An attacker could craft malicious KCP packets or sequences of packets to trigger these vulnerabilities. This is a *direct* threat stemming from the code quality of the KCP library.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, *potentially* arbitrary code execution (depending on the nature and exploitability of the bug). This is the most severe potential outcome.
    *   **Affected KCP Component:** Potentially *any* part of the KCP library. Vulnerabilities could exist in core functions like `ikcp_input`, `ikcp_output`, `ikcp_update`, or in internal data structures and memory management routines.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep KCP Updated:** *Always* use the latest stable release of the `skywind3000/kcp` library to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Actively monitor the library's issue tracker, security advisories, and any relevant security mailing lists for reports of vulnerabilities.
        *   **Code Audit (If Critical):** If KCP is a *critical* component of your application, consider commissioning a professional security audit of the `skywind3000/kcp` codebase.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Employ fuzzing techniques to test the KCP library for vulnerabilities by feeding it malformed or unexpected input.
        *   **Memory Safety Tools:** During development and testing, use memory safety tools (AddressSanitizer, Valgrind) to detect memory corruption errors.
