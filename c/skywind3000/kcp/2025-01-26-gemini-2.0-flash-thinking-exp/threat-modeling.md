# Threat Model Analysis for skywind3000/kcp

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Packet Handling](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_packet_handling.md)

Description: An attacker sends specially crafted KCP packets with oversized fields or malformed headers that exploit vulnerabilities in KCP's packet parsing or processing logic. This could overwrite memory buffers within the KCP library.
Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the server or client, leading to complete system compromise, data breach, or denial of service.
Affected KCP Component: `ikcp_input`, `ikcp_parse_header`, potentially other packet processing functions in `ikcp.c`.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
* Thorough code review and static analysis of KCP library code, especially packet parsing and memory handling functions.
* Fuzz testing KCP library with malformed and oversized packets to identify buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
* Use memory-safe programming practices in KCP implementation.
* Keep KCP library updated to the latest version with security patches.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Sequence Number Handling](./threats/integer_overflow_in_sequence_number_handling.md)

Description: An attacker manipulates sequence numbers in KCP packets to cause integer overflows in KCP's internal calculations related to packet ordering, retransmission, or window management. This could lead to incorrect packet processing or state corruption.
Impact: Denial of service, connection disruption, potential for data injection or manipulation if combined with other vulnerabilities.
Affected KCP Component: `ikcp_update`, `ikcp_recv`, `ikcp_send`, sequence number related logic in `ikcp.c`.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
* Careful review of integer arithmetic operations in KCP, especially those involving sequence numbers and window sizes.
* Use appropriate data types (e.g., `size_t`, `uint32_t`) to prevent overflows.
* Implement checks and validations to detect and handle potential integer overflows.
* Fuzz testing with manipulated sequence numbers.

## Threat: [Replay Attack](./threats/replay_attack.md)

Description: An attacker captures legitimate KCP packets and replays them to the server to re-execute commands or resend data. This is possible due to KCP's lack of built-in security features and if encryption and authentication are not implemented on top of KCP or are implemented incorrectly.
Impact: Unauthorized actions, data manipulation, potential for financial loss or service disruption depending on the application.
Affected KCP Component: KCP protocol itself (lack of built-in security features).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
* **Mandatory:** Implement strong encryption and authentication *on top of* KCP. Use protocols like DTLS or application-level encryption with nonces/IVs and message authentication codes (MACs).
* Use unique session identifiers and regularly rotate encryption keys.
* Implement replay detection mechanisms at the application level if necessary, such as sequence number validation or timestamp checks (in addition to encryption layer).

## Threat: [Connection Hijacking](./threats/connection_hijacking.md)

Description: An attacker intercepts or spoofs KCP packets to inject themselves into an established KCP connection between a client and server. This is possible due to KCP's lack of built-in security features and if authentication and session management are not properly implemented. This could allow the attacker to eavesdrop on communication, inject malicious data, or impersonate a legitimate party.
Impact: Data breach, unauthorized access, data manipulation, complete compromise of the communication channel.
Affected KCP Component: KCP protocol itself (lack of built-in authentication and session management).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
* **Mandatory:** Implement strong mutual authentication between client and server *before* establishing a KCP connection.
* Securely manage session keys and identifiers.
* Use encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data, making hijacking less useful even if successful.
* Implement mechanisms to detect and terminate suspicious connections.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion DoS](./threats/resource_exhaustion_dos.md)

Description: An attacker floods the server with a large number of KCP connection requests or data packets, overwhelming server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) and causing denial of service for legitimate users.
Impact: Service unavailability, application downtime, financial loss.
Affected KCP Component: KCP library's connection management and packet processing, operating system's UDP handling.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
* Implement rate limiting on incoming KCP connection requests and data packets.
* Use connection limits to restrict the maximum number of concurrent KCP connections.
* Deploy network-level DoS mitigation techniques (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, DDoS protection services).
* Optimize KCP configuration and application code for resource efficiency.
