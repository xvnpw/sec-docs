## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting on Incoming KCP Connections](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_on_incoming_kcp_connections.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify KCP Connection Handling Code:** Pinpoint the code in your application responsible for accepting new KCP connections.
    2.  **Implement Connection Rate Tracking:** Use a mechanism to track the number of connection attempts from each source IP address within a defined time window.
    3.  **Define KCP Connection Rate Threshold:** Set a maximum limit on the number of new KCP connections allowed per time window from a single source. This limit should be tailored to your expected legitimate KCP connection rate.
    4.  **Enforce Rate Limit Before KCP Accept:** Before actually accepting a new KCP connection using KCP's API, check if the source IP has exceeded the defined connection rate limit.
    5.  **Reject Excess KCP Connections:** If the rate limit is exceeded, reject the new KCP connection attempt.  Inform the client (if appropriate) or simply drop the connection request.
    6.  **Log KCP Connection Rejections:** Log instances where KCP connection attempts are rejected due to rate limiting for monitoring and security analysis.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   DoS Attacks targeting KCP connection establishment (High Severity): Prevents attackers from overwhelming the server by rapidly initiating numerous KCP connections, exhausting resources needed for KCP connection handling.
*   **Impact:** High reduction in DoS risk related to KCP connection floods. Directly limits the rate at which attackers can establish KCP connections.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the `KCPConnectionManager` module, specifically in the `acceptNewConnection()` function before calling `ikcp_create()`. Configuration is in `kcp_server.config` under `[KCP_CONNECTION_LIMITS]` section.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No dynamic adjustment of KCP connection rate limits based on server load or detected attack patterns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Packet Rate Limiting for KCP Traffic](./mitigation_strategies/packet_rate_limiting_for_kcp_traffic.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate KCP Packet Processing:** Find the code section in your application where incoming KCP packets are processed after being received via UDP.
    2.  **Track KCP Packet Rate per Connection:** Implement tracking of the rate of incoming KCP packets specifically for each active KCP connection.
    3.  **Define KCP Packet Rate Thresholds:** Set thresholds for the maximum number of KCP packets allowed per second (or other time unit) per connection. This should be based on expected KCP traffic volume for legitimate communication.
    4.  **Enforce Packet Rate Limit in KCP Processing Loop:** Within the KCP packet processing loop, check if the incoming packet rate for the current connection exceeds the defined threshold.
    5.  **Discard Excess KCP Packets:** If the packet rate is exceeded, discard the incoming KCP packet *before* passing it to the KCP library's `ikcp_input()` function.
    6.  **Log Discarded KCP Packets:** Log instances of discarded KCP packets due to rate limiting, including connection ID and source IP if available, for monitoring and potential attack detection.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   DoS Attacks exploiting KCP's fast retransmission (High Severity): Prevents attackers from flooding the server with KCP packets, aiming to overwhelm KCP's internal processing and retransmission mechanisms, leading to resource exhaustion.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High reduction in DoS risk from KCP packet floods. Limits the rate of KCP packets processed, mitigating attacks that rely on overwhelming KCP's protocol logic.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented within the `KCPPacketHandler` class, in the `processPacket()` method before calling `ikcp_input()`. Thresholds are set via command-line arguments when starting the KCP server.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No global KCP packet rate limiting across all connections. No adaptive packet rate limiting based on server load or network conditions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration of KCP Parameters](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_of_kcp_parameters.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review KCP Configuration Options:** Carefully examine all configurable parameters offered by the KCP library (e.g., `nocomp`, `interval`, `resend`, `nc`, `sndwnd`, `rcvwnd`). Understand the function and security implications of each.
    2.  **Set Secure KCP Parameter Defaults:** Choose secure default values for KCP parameters. Avoid configurations that prioritize extreme performance at the cost of potential security weaknesses or increased attack surface.
    3.  **Disable KCP Compression if Unnecessary:** If data compression is not a critical requirement, disable KCP's built-in compression (`nocomp=1`). While generally safe, disabling unnecessary features reduces complexity and potential attack vectors.
    4.  **Tune KCP Parameters for Balanced Security and Performance:** Adjust KCP parameters to achieve a balance between security and performance that is appropriate for your application's needs. Avoid overly aggressive or lax settings.
    5.  **Centralized KCP Configuration Management:** Manage KCP configuration parameters in a centralized and secure manner (e.g., configuration files, environment variables).
    6.  **Document KCP Configuration Rationale:** Document the chosen KCP parameter configuration, explaining the reasons behind specific settings, especially concerning security considerations.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Performance Degradation due to misconfigured KCP (Low to Medium Severity): Incorrect KCP parameter settings can lead to suboptimal performance, which could be exploited to cause DoS or disrupt service.
    *   Subtle Protocol Exploits (Low Severity): In rare cases, specific combinations of KCP parameters might create subtle vulnerabilities that could be exploited by sophisticated attackers with deep protocol knowledge.
*   **Impact:** Low to Medium reduction in performance and subtle exploit risks. Secure KCP configuration ensures predictable and stable behavior, minimizing potential misconfiguration-related vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** KCP parameters are configured via a dedicated `kcp.conf` file loaded at server startup. Default values are set based on general security and performance best practices for KCP.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No automated validation of KCP configuration parameters against security best practices. No dynamic adjustment of KCP parameters based on runtime conditions or security events.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Audits of KCP Library Usage in Application](./mitigation_strategies/security_audits_of_kcp_library_usage_in_application.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Focus Audit on KCP Integration Points:** During security audits, specifically scrutinize the application code sections that interact with the KCP library.
    2.  **Review KCP API Usage:** Verify that KCP APIs are used correctly and securely. Check for potential misuse of KCP functions that could lead to vulnerabilities (e.g., improper buffer handling, incorrect state management).
    3.  **Analyze Data Handling over KCP:** Audit how data is prepared, sent, received, and processed when transmitted via KCP. Look for vulnerabilities related to data serialization, deserialization, and input validation in the context of KCP communication.
    4.  **Penetration Testing Targeting KCP Protocol:** Include penetration testing scenarios that specifically target the KCP protocol implementation and its integration within the application. Test for vulnerabilities in KCP packet handling, session management, and data processing over KCP.
    5.  **Address KCP-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Prioritize remediation of any security vulnerabilities identified during audits that are directly related to the application's use of the KCP library.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Security Vulnerabilities arising from improper KCP library usage (High Severity):  Incorrect or insecure use of KCP APIs and related code can introduce vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise the application or server.
*   **Impact:** High reduction in vulnerability risk related to KCP integration. Security audits specifically targeting KCP usage help identify and fix vulnerabilities that might be missed by general security assessments.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Code reviews include a section specifically dedicated to reviewing KCP integration code. SAST tools are configured to check for common coding errors in KCP-related code paths.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Dedicated DAST and penetration testing focused on KCP protocol vulnerabilities are not yet regularly performed. No formal checklist or guidelines for security auditing KCP integration are in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive KCP Connection Logging for Security Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_kcp_connection_logging_for_security_monitoring.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Log KCP Connection Lifecycle Events:** Implement logging for all significant events in the lifecycle of KCP connections, such as:
        *   KCP connection establishment (success/failure).
        *   KCP connection termination (normal/abnormal, reason).
        *   KCP connection state changes (if relevant).
    2.  **Log KCP Error Conditions:** Log any errors or exceptions encountered during KCP operation, including KCP library errors, network errors related to KCP communication, and application-level errors during KCP data processing.
    3.  **Include KCP Connection Identifiers in Logs:** Ensure logs include unique identifiers for each KCP connection to facilitate correlation of events related to a specific connection.
    4.  **Log Source/Destination IP and Ports for KCP Traffic:** Log the source and destination IP addresses and UDP ports involved in KCP communication for each connection.
    5.  **Integrate KCP Logs with Security Monitoring System:** Forward KCP connection logs to a centralized security monitoring system (e.g., SIEM) for real-time analysis, alerting, and incident response.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Delayed Security Incident Detection related to KCP (High Severity): Without comprehensive KCP connection logging, it can be difficult to detect and respond to security incidents that exploit or target KCP communication.
    *   Limited Forensic Analysis of KCP-Related Attacks (High Severity): Lack of detailed KCP logs hinders forensic analysis after a security incident, making it harder to understand the attack and improve defenses.
*   **Impact:** High reduction in delayed incident detection and limited forensic analysis risks. Detailed KCP connection logs provide crucial visibility into KCP-related activity for security monitoring and incident response.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic logging of KCP connection establishment and termination events is in place. Logs are written to application log files.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Logging of KCP error conditions and more detailed connection state information is not yet implemented. Integration of KCP logs with a SIEM system is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring KCP Performance Metrics for Anomaly Detection](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring_kcp_performance_metrics_for_anomaly_detection.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Key KCP Performance Indicators:** Track key performance metrics specific to KCP operation, such as:
        *   KCP packet loss rate.
        *   KCP retransmission rate.
        *   KCP round-trip time (RTT).
        *   KCP send/receive window utilization.
        *   KCP congestion window size (if exposed by the library).
    2.  **Establish Baselines for KCP Metrics:** Determine normal ranges and baseline values for KCP performance metrics under typical operating conditions.
    3.  **Implement Real-time KCP Metric Monitoring:** Use monitoring tools to collect and visualize KCP performance metrics in real-time.
    4.  **Define Anomaly Detection Rules for KCP Metrics:** Create rules or thresholds to detect deviations from baseline KCP performance metrics that could indicate anomalies or potential security issues. For example, unusually high packet loss or retransmission rates.
    5.  **Alert on Anomalous KCP Performance:** Configure alerts to notify administrators when KCP performance metrics exceed defined anomaly thresholds, triggering investigation of potential problems.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Detection of Performance-based DoS Attacks targeting KCP (Medium Severity): Anomalous KCP performance metrics (e.g., sudden increase in packet loss) can indicate DoS attacks aimed at degrading KCP communication.
    *   Early Warning of Network Issues Affecting KCP (Medium Severity): Monitoring KCP metrics can provide early warnings of network problems that are impacting KCP performance and potentially service availability.
*   **Impact:** Medium reduction in DoS attack detection and network issue early warning risks. Monitoring KCP performance metrics provides insights into KCP's operational health and can help detect performance-based attacks or network problems.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic monitoring of KCP packet loss and RTT is implemented using Prometheus and Grafana.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Monitoring of other key KCP metrics (retransmission rate, window utilization, congestion window) is not yet implemented. Anomaly detection rules and automated alerting based on KCP metrics are not fully configured.
