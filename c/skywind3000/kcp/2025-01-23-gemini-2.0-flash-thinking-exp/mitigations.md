## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Connection Limits (KCP Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_connection_limits__kcp_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify the KCP server component in your application that handles incoming KCP connections and packets.
    *   Step 2: Implement connection limits directly within the KCP server logic.
        *   Track the number of active KCP connections, potentially per source IP address.
        *   Use KCP library's connection management features (if available) or implement custom connection tracking.
        *   Reject new KCP connection attempts when a predefined connection limit is reached.
    *   Step 3: Implement packet rate limiting for incoming KCP packets.
        *   Utilize operating system level traffic control (e.g., `iptables`, `tc` on Linux) to limit UDP packet rates to the KCP server port.
        *   Alternatively, implement packet rate limiting within the KCP server application logic by tracking packet arrival rates and discarding packets exceeding a threshold.
    *   Step 4: Configure appropriate thresholds for connection and packet rate limits based on expected legitimate traffic and server capacity.
    *   Step 5: Monitor KCP connection counts and packet rates to observe the effectiveness of rate limiting and detect potential DoS attempts.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks via Connection Exhaustion (Severity: High): Attackers attempting to exhaust server resources by establishing a large number of KCP connections.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks via Packet Flooding (Severity: High): Attackers overwhelming the server with a high volume of KCP packets, even if connections are limited.
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High): Server CPU, memory, and bandwidth being consumed by excessive KCP connections or packet processing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS via Connection Exhaustion: Significantly reduces risk by preventing attackers from establishing an overwhelming number of connections.
    *   DoS via Packet Flooding: Moderately to Significantly reduces risk by limiting the rate of incoming packets, depending on the effectiveness of the rate limiting mechanism and attack sophistication.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Significantly reduces risk by controlling resource consumption related to KCP connection and packet handling.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Needs Assessment. Check if connection limits and packet rate limiting are implemented specifically for KCP connections in your application or infrastructure.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Likely missing in KCP server components if not explicitly implemented. Should be implemented in the KCP connection handling logic and potentially at the network level for packet rate limiting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Monitoring and Alerting (KCP Specific Metrics)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_monitoring_and_alerting__kcp_specific_metrics_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify KCP specific metrics that are relevant for security and performance monitoring. Examples include:
        *   Number of active KCP connections.
        *   Incoming and outgoing KCP packet rates.
        *   KCP retransmission rates.
        *   KCP round-trip time (RTT).
        *   CPU and memory usage of KCP processing threads/processes.
    *   Step 2: Implement monitoring to collect these KCP specific metrics.
        *   Utilize KCP library's API (if it exposes metrics) to gather internal statistics.
        *   Instrument your application code to track KCP connection events and packet processing.
        *   Use system monitoring tools to observe CPU, memory, and network usage related to KCP server processes.
    *   Step 3: Define baseline values and expected ranges for these KCP metrics under normal operating conditions.
    *   Step 4: Configure alerts to trigger when KCP metrics deviate significantly from baselines or exceed predefined thresholds.
        *   Alert on sudden spikes in connection counts, packet rates, retransmission rates, or resource usage.
        *   Alert on unusually high or low RTT values.
    *   Step 5: Integrate alerts with notification systems to inform security and operations teams of potential issues.
    *   Step 6: Regularly review KCP monitoring data and alerts to identify anomalies, potential attacks, or performance problems related to KCP.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Early Detection) (Severity: High):  Early detection of DoS attacks targeting KCP by monitoring connection and packet rate anomalies.
    *   Performance Degradation related to KCP (Severity: Medium): Identification of performance issues stemming from KCP configuration or network conditions through RTT and retransmission monitoring.
    *   Potential Security Incidents (Anomaly Detection) (Severity: Medium): Detection of unusual KCP traffic patterns that might indicate malicious activity or misconfiguration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS Attacks (Early Detection): Moderately reduces risk by enabling faster detection and response to DoS attacks, potentially mitigating their impact.
    *   Performance Degradation: Moderately reduces risk by enabling proactive identification and resolution of performance issues related to KCP.
    *   Security Incidents (Anomaly Detection): Minimally to Moderately reduces risk by providing early warnings of potential security incidents related to KCP traffic.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. General server monitoring might be in place, but specific KCP metrics monitoring and alerting are likely missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Specific monitoring and alerting for KCP connection metrics, packet rates, retransmission rates, RTT, and resource usage related to KCP processing. Should be implemented to enhance incident detection and performance management for KCP.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure KCP Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_kcp_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Thoroughly review all configurable parameters of the KCP library used in your application (refer to KCP documentation and source code).
    *   Step 2: Understand the security implications of each KCP parameter, especially those related to:
        *   `nocomp`: Compression settings (disabling compression might be more secure if compression algorithms have known vulnerabilities).
        *   `interval`:  Control interval (setting it too low might increase CPU usage and potential DoS vulnerability).
        *   `resend`:  Retransmission timeout (incorrect setting can impact reliability and performance).
        *   `nc`:  No delay mode (understand the trade-offs between latency and bandwidth usage).
    *   Step 3: Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring KCP. Only enable features and set parameters that are strictly necessary for the application's required performance and reliability.
    *   Step 4: Disable KCP compression (`nocomp=1`) if compression is not essential and if there are concerns about potential compression-related vulnerabilities (though KCP's simple compression is less likely to be vulnerable than complex algorithms).
    *   Step 5: Set `interval`, `resend`, and `nc` parameters to values that balance performance and security. Avoid extreme values that might increase attack surface or resource consumption.
    *   Step 6: Document the chosen KCP configuration parameters and the security rationale behind each setting.
    *   Step 7: Regularly review and adjust KCP configuration based on performance monitoring, security audits, and evolving application requirements.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Configuration Vulnerabilities in KCP (Severity: Medium): Insecure or suboptimal KCP configurations that might introduce vulnerabilities or performance issues specific to KCP library behavior.
    *   Performance Degradation due to KCP Misconfiguration (Severity: Medium): Incorrect KCP parameter settings leading to inefficient resource utilization or performance bottlenecks within the KCP layer.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Configuration Vulnerabilities in KCP: Moderately reduces risk by minimizing potential attack vectors arising from insecure KCP configurations.
    *   Performance Degradation due to KCP Misconfiguration: Moderately reduces risk by optimizing KCP configuration for performance and resource efficiency within the KCP protocol layer.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. KCP configuration is likely set, but a security-focused review and documentation of the configuration parameters specifically for KCP security might be missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Security review and hardening of KCP configuration parameters, specifically focusing on the security implications of each KCP setting. Documentation of the chosen KCP configuration and its security rationale. Should be implemented as part of KCP integration security hardening.
