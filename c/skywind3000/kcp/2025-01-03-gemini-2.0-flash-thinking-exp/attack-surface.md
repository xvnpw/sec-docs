# Attack Surface Analysis for skywind3000/kcp

## Attack Surface: [UDP Amplification Attack](./attack_surfaces/udp_amplification_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker spoofs the source IP address of requests to the application's KCP endpoint, making it appear the requests are coming from a victim. The application then sends potentially large response packets to the victim, overwhelming their network.

**How KCP Contributes:** KCP operates over UDP, which is connectionless and allows for easy source IP address spoofing. KCP's reliable delivery mechanisms might involve sending multiple packets or larger packets in response to certain triggers, amplifying the effect.

**Example:** An attacker sends a small, crafted KCP packet with a spoofed source IP to the application. The application, believing it's a legitimate request, sends back a larger data segment or retransmission request to the spoofed IP, flooding the victim.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) against the victim. The victim's network and systems become unavailable due to the overwhelming traffic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting on the KCP endpoint to restrict the number of packets processed from a single source within a time window.
*   Employ ingress filtering at network boundaries to drop packets with spoofed source IP addresses from outside the expected network range.
*   Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns and high volumes of outgoing traffic to single destinations.
*   Consider using connection-oriented protocols where feasible, or adding application-level connection establishment on top of KCP with proper authentication.

## Attack Surface: [Implementation Vulnerabilities (Buffer Overflows, Integer Overflows)](./attack_surfaces/implementation_vulnerabilities__buffer_overflows__integer_overflows_.md)

**Description:** Bugs within the KCP library itself, such as buffer overflows or integer overflows, could be exploited by sending specially crafted KCP packets.

**How KCP Contributes:** As with any software library, KCP's internal code might contain vulnerabilities. The way it handles packet parsing, buffer management, and calculations related to sequence numbers or window sizes could be susceptible to these flaws.

**Example:** Sending a KCP packet with a header indicating an extremely large payload size could trigger a buffer overflow in the library's memory allocation routines.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (critical), denial of service (crash), information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the KCP library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Perform thorough input validation on data received through KCP at the application layer as a defense-in-depth measure.
*   Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the KCP library or its integration.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (Connection State if Implemented)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__connection_state_if_implemented_.md)

**Description:** Even though KCP is UDP-based and connectionless, the application using it might maintain some form of connection state or session information. An attacker could flood the application with connection requests to exhaust server resources.

**How KCP Contributes:** While KCP itself doesn't manage connections, the application built on top of it might. The ease of sending UDP packets can make it simple for attackers to generate a large number of seemingly valid connection attempts.

**Example:** An attacker rapidly sends initial KCP packets that trigger the application to allocate resources for a new session, without completing the session establishment. This can lead to resource exhaustion on the server.

**Impact:** Denial of service. The server becomes unresponsive due to lack of resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement connection request rate limiting.
*   Use connection timeouts to reclaim resources from inactive or incomplete connections.
*   Employ connection puzzles or challenges to make connection initiation more expensive for attackers.
*   Monitor server resource usage for anomalies.
