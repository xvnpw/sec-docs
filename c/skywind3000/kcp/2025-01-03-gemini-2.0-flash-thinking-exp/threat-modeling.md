# Threat Model Analysis for skywind3000/kcp

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in KCP Implementation](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_kcp_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted KCP packets with excessively large data fields or header values that exceed the allocated buffer sizes within the KCP library. This could lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution on the system running the KCP implementation.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, complete system compromise, denial of service.
*   **Affected KCP Component:** Core KCP library implementation (potential vulnerabilities in memory handling).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the KCP library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   While application developers can't directly fix KCP's internal buffer handling, rigorous testing and reporting of potential issues to the KCP maintainers are crucial.

## Threat: [ACK/NAK Flooding](./threats/acknak_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of forged acknowledgement (ACK) or negative acknowledgement (NAK) packets to the receiver's KCP instance. This can overwhelm the KCP instance's processing capacity, leading to resource exhaustion within the KCP library itself and potentially causing a denial of service for that specific KCP connection or the application relying on it.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service for KCP connections, reduced performance for legitimate communication using KCP.
*   **Affected KCP Component:** Reliability Mechanisms (acknowledgement processing within KCP).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on incoming packets at the network level or within the application layer *before* they reach the KCP library.
    *   Source IP address filtering or blacklisting can be used to block malicious sources at the network level.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in KCP Calculations](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_kcp_calculations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends packets with values that cause integer overflows or underflows in KCP's internal arithmetic calculations (e.g., related to packet sizes, sequence numbers, window sizes). This could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect state transitions *within the KCP library*, potentially causing vulnerabilities or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Application malfunction due to KCP errors, potential security breaches arising from incorrect KCP state.
*   **Affected KCP Component:** Core KCP library implementation (arithmetic operations).
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the specific overflow - considered High for this refined list as it's a direct KCP issue).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the KCP library updated to the latest version to benefit from fixes for such issues.
    *   This threat primarily relies on the robustness of the KCP library's implementation.

## Threat: [Exploiting Weak or Missing Encryption (if KCP's built-in is used)](./threats/exploiting_weak_or_missing_encryption__if_kcp's_built-in_is_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If the optional built-in encryption feature of KCP is used and it has vulnerabilities in its cryptographic algorithm or implementation, an attacker could potentially decrypt or manipulate the communication.
*   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, data breaches, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks on the KCP connection.
*   **Affected KCP Component:** KCP's optional encryption module (if enabled).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if sensitive data is transmitted using KCP's built-in encryption).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using KCP's built-in encryption if strong security is required. Instead, rely on well-established and vetted secure transport protocols like DTLS layered on top of UDP.
    *   If KCP's built-in encryption is used, ensure the KCP library is up-to-date to patch any known cryptographic vulnerabilities.
