## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Authentication/Authorization (Inherited from KCP's Design)](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_authenticationauthorization__inherited_from_kcp's_design_.md)

**Description:** KCP, by design, does not provide any built-in mechanisms for authenticating the sender or receiver of packets. This fundamental lack of authentication means the application using KCP must implement its own robust authentication and authorization layer. If this is not done correctly or is missing entirely, it opens the door to significant vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Impersonation of Legitimate Users](./attack_tree_paths/impersonation_of_legitimate_users.md)

**Attack Vector:**
    *   Without authentication, an attacker can craft and send KCP packets that appear to originate from a legitimate, authorized user.
    *   The attacker needs to understand the application's protocol and how user identities are (or are not) handled.
    *   By spoofing the source identifier, the attacker can potentially perform actions as that legitimate user, gaining unauthorized access to resources or data.
*   **Impact:**  Full access to the targeted user's account and associated data. The attacker can perform any action the legitimate user is authorized to do.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement a strong authentication mechanism at the application layer. This could involve:
    *   Using cryptographic signatures to verify the sender's identity.
    *   Employing token-based authentication where clients present a valid token to prove their identity.
    *   Utilizing mutual authentication where both client and server verify each other's identities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Injection/Manipulation without Verification](./attack_tree_paths/data_injectionmanipulation_without_verification.md)

**Attack Vector:**
    *   Due to the lack of built-in authentication and data integrity checks in KCP, an attacker can inject arbitrary data into the communication stream or modify existing data in transit.
    *   Without a way to verify the source and integrity of packets, the receiving application cannot distinguish between legitimate data and malicious injections.
    *   This allows the attacker to manipulate application state, insert malicious commands, or corrupt data.
*   **Impact:** Corruption of application data, execution of unintended commands, manipulation of business logic, and potential compromise of the application's integrity.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement data integrity checks and source verification at the application layer. This can be achieved by:
    *   Using Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs) to ensure data integrity and authenticity.
    *   Including nonces or sequence numbers to prevent replay attacks and ensure the freshness of messages.
    *   Combining authentication with data integrity checks to ensure both the sender's identity and the data's integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Encryption in KCP](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_encryption_in_kcp.md)

**Description:** KCP does not provide any built-in encryption. All data transmitted using KCP is sent in plaintext. This makes the communication vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation if the attacker can intercept the network traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks.md)

**Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker positioned on the network path between the client and server can intercept KCP traffic.
    *   Because the data is unencrypted, the attacker can read the content of the communication, including sensitive information like credentials, personal data, or application-specific secrets.
    *   Furthermore, the attacker can modify the intercepted packets before forwarding them, potentially altering data in transit or injecting malicious commands.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of data confidentiality and potentially integrity. The attacker can steal sensitive information, manipulate communication, and potentially take control of the application.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement encryption at the application layer. This can be done by:
    *   Using established cryptographic libraries like libsodium to encrypt the data before sending it over KCP.
    *   Implementing a custom encryption protocol on top of KCP.
    *   Considering using a secure tunneling protocol over KCP, such as a lightweight TLS implementation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Eavesdropping on Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/eavesdropping_on_sensitive_information.md)

**Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker on the network path can passively monitor KCP traffic without actively interfering with the communication.
    *   Since the data is transmitted in plaintext, the attacker can easily capture and analyze the packets to extract sensitive information.
    *   This attack is often difficult to detect as it doesn't necessarily disrupt the communication flow.
*   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality. Sensitive data transmitted through the application can be exposed to unauthorized parties.
*   **Mitigation:**  The primary mitigation is to implement encryption at the application layer as described for MitM attacks. Encrypting the data ensures that even if an attacker intercepts the traffic, they cannot understand its content without the decryption key.
