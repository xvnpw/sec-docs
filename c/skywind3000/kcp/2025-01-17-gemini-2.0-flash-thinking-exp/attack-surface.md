# Attack Surface Analysis for skywind3000/kcp

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion (Connection Handling)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion__connection_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to establish a large number of KCP connections simultaneously, exhausting server resources.
*   **How KCP Contributes:** KCP requires resources to manage each connection state. A flood of connection requests can overwhelm the application's KCP implementation.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a rapid stream of connection initiation requests, causing the application to allocate excessive memory and CPU to manage these pending connections.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application slowdown, potential for system instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement connection rate limiting specifically for KCP connections.
    *   Set maximum connection limits within the application's KCP integration.
    *   Use connection timeouts to release resources from inactive or stalled KCP connections.

## Attack Surface: [Encryption Vulnerabilities (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/encryption_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If KCP's built-in encryption is used, vulnerabilities in the implementation or weak configuration can be exploited.
*   **How KCP Contributes:** KCP offers optional encryption. If enabled, the security of the communication directly depends on the strength and correct implementation of this KCP-provided encryption.
*   **Example:** Using a weak or default encryption key configured within KCP, or a flaw in KCP's encryption logic, could allow an attacker to decrypt the communication.
*   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, exposure of sensitive data transmitted via KCP.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong, randomly generated encryption keys when configuring KCP's encryption.
    *   Ensure the KCP library is up-to-date to benefit from any security patches related to its encryption implementation.
    *   Consider the suitability of KCP's built-in encryption for the application's security requirements; a more robust application-layer encryption might be necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure configuration of KCP parameters can create vulnerabilities.
*   **How KCP Contributes:** KCP has various configurable parameters that, if set incorrectly, can directly increase the attack surface related to KCP's functionality.
*   **Example:** Setting excessively large send/receive windows in KCP's configuration might make the application more susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks related to KCP's buffering.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to various issues depending on the misconfiguration, including DoS, performance degradation, or unexpected behavior in KCP's reliability mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and understand the security implications of each KCP configuration option.
    *   Avoid using default or overly permissive settings for KCP parameters.
    *   Regularly audit the KCP configuration to ensure it aligns with security best practices.
