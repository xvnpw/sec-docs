# Threat Model Analysis for skywind3000/kcp

## Threat: [Source IP Address Spoofing](./threats/source_ip_address_spoofing.md)

**Description:** An attacker can forge the source IP address in UDP packets sent to the application's KCP endpoint. This allows them to impersonate legitimate users at the KCP level, potentially bypassing initial connection checks or sending malicious data that KCP processes.

**Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized actions within the KCP connection, bypassing initial IP-based filtering (if any), and making it difficult to trace malicious activity at the KCP layer. This can be a precursor to further attacks within the established KCP session.

**Affected KCP Component:** UDP Socket Handling

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms *within the KCP session* or at the application layer on top of KCP, that do not rely solely on IP addresses.
*   Consider using cryptographic signatures on KCP packets to verify the sender's identity within the KCP session.

## Threat: [Packet Replay Attacks](./threats/packet_replay_attacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts valid KCP packets and resends them later to perform unauthorized actions or disrupt the application's state *within the KCP session*. For example, replaying a packet that triggers a state change or initiates an action within the KCP-managed communication.

**Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized actions, data manipulation, or denial of service by replaying control packets *within the KCP session*. This exploits KCP's reliability mechanisms to re-inject previously valid commands.

**Affected KCP Component:** Reliability Module (ARQ), specifically the sequence number handling within KCP.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement anti-replay mechanisms *within the KCP session* using monotonically increasing sequence numbers with a sufficiently large window. Ensure the application logic correctly handles out-of-order or duplicate packets.
*   Incorporate timestamps or nonces into the application-level protocol *transmitted over KCP* to ensure uniqueness of messages.
*   Use encryption on the KCP payload to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the packets, making them unusable if replayed without the correct key.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Connection Flooding](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_connection_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to establish a large number of KCP connections to the application server, consuming server resources (memory, CPU) *dedicated to managing KCP connections*, even if no data is actively being transmitted within those connections.

**Impact:** Can lead to denial of service by exhausting server resources *used by KCP*, making the application unresponsive to legitimate KCP connection attempts.

**Affected KCP Component:** Connection Management within the KCP library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement connection limits and rate limiting on new KCP connection requests.
*   Employ connection state management within the application's KCP integration to efficiently handle and expire inactive KCP connections.

## Threat: [Weak Encryption Ciphers or Modes (If Using KCP's Built-in Encryption)](./threats/weak_encryption_ciphers_or_modes__if_using_kcp's_built-in_encryption_.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes KCP's built-in encryption, using weak or outdated ciphers or modes can make the communication *within the KCP session* vulnerable to eavesdropping and decryption.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality of data transmitted *through KCP*, allowing attackers to intercept and read sensitive information exchanged within the KCP session.

**Affected KCP Component:** Encryption Module (if enabled within KCP)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   If using KCP's encryption, ensure strong and up-to-date encryption algorithms and modes are configured within the KCP settings.
*   Consider using established cryptographic libraries for more robust encryption options at the application layer, encrypting the payload *before* passing it to KCP, regardless of KCP's built-in encryption.

## Threat: [Key Management Issues (If Using Encryption with KCP)](./threats/key_management_issues__if_using_encryption_with_kcp_.md)

**Description:** If encryption is used with KCP (either built-in or application-layer), insecure key exchange or storage mechanisms can compromise the confidentiality of the communication *within the KCP session*. Attackers could obtain the encryption keys used by KCP, allowing them to decrypt past or future KCP communications.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality of data transmitted *through KCP*, allowing attackers to decrypt sensitive information.

**Affected KCP Component:** Encryption Module (if enabled within KCP), Key Management (external to KCP but crucial for its secure operation).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement secure key exchange protocols for keys used with KCP.
*   Ensure keys used by KCP are stored securely and are not hardcoded in the application.
*   Regularly rotate encryption keys used with KCP.

## Threat: [Bugs and Vulnerabilities in the KCP Library](./threats/bugs_and_vulnerabilities_in_the_kcp_library.md)

**Description:** The KCP library itself might contain bugs or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers interacting directly with the KCP endpoint.

**Impact:** Can lead to various security issues depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including denial of service *at the KCP level*, remote code execution *within the context of the application using KCP*, or information disclosure related to KCP's internal state.

**Affected KCP Component:** Various modules within the KCP library depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, can be Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated with the latest releases of the KCP library and monitor for reported security vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using static analysis tools to scan the KCP library code if possible.

## Threat: [Incorrect Usage of the KCP Library](./threats/incorrect_usage_of_the_kcp_library.md)

**Description:** Developers might misuse the KCP library, leading to security vulnerabilities *within the KCP communication*. For example, improper handling of buffer sizes when sending or receiving data through KCP, leading to buffer overflows within the KCP processing.

**Impact:** Can lead to various security issues, including buffer overflows *within KCP's memory space*, denial of service *at the KCP level*, or potentially remote code execution if vulnerabilities are present in KCP's handling of malformed data.

**Affected KCP Component:** Various modules within KCP depending on the misuse, particularly those involved in data handling and processing.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High depending on the vulnerability, can be Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Provide thorough training to developers on the correct and secure usage of the KCP library.
*   Conduct code reviews specifically focusing on the application's interaction with the KCP library.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to KCP for transmission and *after* receiving data from KCP.
