# Attack Surface Analysis for octalmage/robotjs

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Input Injection (Keyboard)](./attack_surfaces/unintended_input_injection__keyboard_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary keystrokes into the system, potentially executing commands or manipulating applications.
*   **How `robotjs` Contributes:** The `robotjs.typeString()` and related functions allow programmatic generation of keyboard input. If user input or external data directly controls these functions without sanitization, malicious strings can be injected.
*   **Example:** A poorly designed application uses user-provided text to be "typed" using `robotjs.typeString()`. An attacker provides a string containing shell commands, which are then executed by the system.
*   **Impact:** Command execution, data theft, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Never directly use unsanitized user input or external data to control `robotjs.typeString()` or similar functions. Implement strict input validation and sanitization. Consider using whitelists for allowed characters or commands.
    *   **Users:** Be cautious about applications that request keyboard control permissions. Understand the application's purpose and its need for such access.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Input Injection (Mouse)](./attack_surfaces/unintended_input_injection__mouse_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can simulate mouse clicks and movements to interact with the system in unintended ways.
*   **How `robotjs` Contributes:** Functions like `robotjs.moveMouse()`, `robotjs.mouseClick()`, and `robotjs.scrollMouse()` enable programmatic control of the mouse. If these are controlled by untrusted sources, malicious actions can be simulated.
*   **Example:** An application uses `robotjs` to automate UI interactions based on data from a remote server. If the server is compromised, an attacker could send commands to click on malicious links or buttons.
*   **Impact:** Clickjacking, unintended actions within applications, potential malware installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Avoid directly mapping external data to mouse actions. Implement confirmation steps or user verification for critical actions triggered by `robotjs`. Limit the scope of mouse control to specific application windows if possible.
    *   **Users:** Be wary of applications that perform mouse actions without explicit user initiation. Monitor for unexpected mouse movements or clicks.

## Attack Surface: [Screen Content Exposure](./attack_surfaces/screen_content_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information displayed on the screen can be captured and potentially exfiltrated.
*   **How `robotjs` Contributes:** Functions like `robotjs.screen.capture()` and `robotjs.getPixelColor()` allow reading the contents of the screen. If this data is not handled securely, it can be a source of information leakage.
*   **Example:** A remote support application using `robotjs` to view the user's screen doesn't have proper security measures. An attacker gains access and captures screenshots containing passwords or confidential documents.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violation, exposure of credentials or sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict access control for screen capture functionality. Encrypt or redact sensitive information before transmitting or storing captured screen data. Inform users when screen capture is active.
    *   **Users:** Be mindful of what information is displayed on the screen when using applications with screen capture capabilities. Avoid displaying sensitive data unnecessarily.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation (Context Dependent)](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation__context_dependent_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application using `robotjs` runs with elevated privileges, vulnerabilities in the application can be leveraged to perform actions with those elevated privileges via `robotjs`.
*   **How `robotjs` Contributes:** `robotjs` actions are performed with the same privileges as the application using it. If the application has excessive privileges, so do the `robotjs` actions.
*   **Example:** An application running with administrator privileges uses `robotjs` and has an input validation vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to inject commands that are then executed with administrator privileges via `robotjs`.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, ability to install malware, modify system settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if the application runs with high privileges)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges. Implement robust security measures to prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited to control `robotjs`.
    *   **Users:** Be cautious about granting excessive permissions to applications. Understand why an application needs certain privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in `robotjs`](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__robotjs_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the `robotjs` library itself or its dependencies can be exploited.
*   **How `robotjs` Contributes:** The application directly relies on the `robotjs` library. If `robotjs` has vulnerabilities, the application inherits them.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of `robotjs` allows for arbitrary code execution. An application using this vulnerable version is also susceptible to this attack.
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability in `robotjs`, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Regularly update the `robotjs` library to the latest stable version. Monitor security advisories for `robotjs` and its dependencies. Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:** Ensure that the applications they use are kept up-to-date, as updates often include fixes for dependency vulnerabilities.
