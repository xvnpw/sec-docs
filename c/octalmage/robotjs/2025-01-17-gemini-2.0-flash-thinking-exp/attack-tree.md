## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Control of the Host System via the Application](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_control_of_the_host_system_via_the_application.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies a complete compromise of the target system through the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RobotJS Functionality Directly](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_robotjs_functionality_directly.md)

This node encompasses attacks that directly leverage the features of the RobotJS library to interact with the operating system. Successful exploitation bypasses application logic and directly manipulates the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Passes Unsanitized Input to RobotJS Keyboard/Mouse Functions](./attack_tree_paths/application_passes_unsanitized_input_to_robotjs_keyboardmouse_functions.md)

This is a critical vulnerability where the application fails to validate or sanitize user-provided input before using it in RobotJS functions that control keyboard and mouse actions. This allows for command injection and other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Registers Global Keyboard/Mouse Hooks via RobotJS](./attack_tree_paths/application_registers_global_keyboardmouse_hooks_via_robotjs.md)

Registering global hooks provides a powerful mechanism for interacting with system events. However, if not handled securely, it becomes a critical point where attackers can inject malicious code or intercept sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [RobotJS Contains a Vulnerability (e.g., Buffer Overflow, Code Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/robotjs_contains_a_vulnerability__e_g___buffer_overflow__code_injection_.md)

A vulnerability within the RobotJS library itself is a critical concern. Exploiting such a flaw can grant attackers significant control over any application using the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Improper Handling of RobotJS](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_improper_handling_of_robotjs.md)

This node represents vulnerabilities arising from how the application integrates and manages the RobotJS library. Poor design choices or insecure configurations can create critical weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Exposes an API or Interface that Directly Calls RobotJS Functions](./attack_tree_paths/application_exposes_an_api_or_interface_that_directly_calls_robotjs_functions.md)

Directly exposing RobotJS functionality through an API without proper security measures creates a critical entry point for attackers to directly control system automation features.

## Attack Tree Path: [This Input is Directly Passed to RobotJS Functions Without Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/this_input_is_directly_passed_to_robotjs_functions_without_sanitization.md)

Similar to the earlier input validation node, this highlights the critical failure to sanitize input specifically before it's used by RobotJS, leading to potential command execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Runs RobotJS with Elevated Privileges](./attack_tree_paths/application_runs_robotjs_with_elevated_privileges.md)

Running RobotJS with elevated privileges (like administrator) is a critical misconfiguration. If RobotJS is compromised, the attacker inherits these elevated privileges, significantly increasing the impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Keystrokes/Mouse Events](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_keystrokesmouse_events.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides malicious input to the application, which is then unsafely passed to RobotJS keyboard or mouse control functions.

**Example:** Injecting shell commands into a text field that the application uses with `robot.typeString()`, leading to command execution on the host.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Global Keyboard/Mouse Hooks](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_global_keyboardmouse_hooks.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application registers global keyboard or mouse hooks using RobotJS. An attacker exploits the lack of input validation in the hook handler to inject and execute malicious code when specific events occur.

**Example:** Injecting code into a global keyboard hook that executes a reverse shell when a specific key combination is pressed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in RobotJS Library Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_robotjs_library_itself.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application triggers a vulnerable code path within the RobotJS library. This could involve passing specially crafted arguments to a RobotJS function that exploits a buffer overflow or code injection flaw.

**Example:** Passing an overly long string to a RobotJS function that doesn't properly handle buffer sizes, leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose RobotJS Functionality to Untrusted Users/Code](./attack_tree_paths/expose_robotjs_functionality_to_untrusted_userscode.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application exposes an API or interface that directly calls RobotJS functions without proper authentication or authorization. Attackers can directly invoke these functions to perform actions on the host system.

**Example:** A web endpoint that allows unauthenticated users to trigger arbitrary keyboard events on the server running the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Input Validation Before Passing to RobotJS](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_input_validation_before_passing_to_robotjs.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application receives input from an untrusted source and directly passes it to RobotJS functions without any sanitization or validation.

**Example:** Taking user-provided text from a web form and directly using it in `robot.typeString()`, allowing an attacker to inject commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Excessive Permissions Granted to RobotJS Process](./attack_tree_paths/excessive_permissions_granted_to_robotjs_process.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application runs the RobotJS process with elevated privileges (e.g., administrator). If any vulnerability in RobotJS or the application's use of it is exploited, the attacker gains those elevated privileges.

**Example:** Running the application and RobotJS as administrator. If an attacker can inject keystrokes, they can perform administrative tasks.
