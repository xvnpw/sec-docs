# Threat Model Analysis for octalmage/robotjs

## Threat: [Malicious Keystroke Injection](./threats/malicious_keystroke_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could leverage `robotjs` to simulate keystrokes on the user's system. This could involve injecting commands into a terminal, entering data into forms (including credentials), or manipulating application controls. The attacker might gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, or disrupt system operations.
    *   **Impact:**  Account compromise, data breach, unauthorized actions, system instability, financial loss.
    *   **Affected RobotJS Component:** `keyboard` module, specifically functions like `typeString`, `keyTap`, `keyToggle`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any input that could influence the keystrokes generated by `robotjs`.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided input to control `robotjs` keyboard functions.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to the application using `robotjs`.
        *   Consider requiring user confirmation for sensitive actions triggered by simulated keystrokes.
        *   Run the application with the least necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Malicious Mouse Click Simulation](./threats/malicious_mouse_click_simulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could use `robotjs` to simulate mouse clicks at arbitrary locations on the screen. This could be used to interact with UI elements without user consent, bypass security prompts, trigger unintended actions within applications, or even click on malicious links or buttons.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, bypassing security measures, potential malware installation, data modification, system compromise.
    *   **Affected RobotJS Component:** `mouse` module, specifically functions like `moveMouse`, `moveMouseSmooth`, `mouseClick`, `mouseToggle`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate the context and conditions under which mouse clicks are simulated.
        *   Avoid relying solely on UI interactions for security-critical actions. Implement backend checks and validations.
        *   Consider requiring user confirmation for actions triggered by simulated mouse clicks, especially for sensitive operations.
        *   Implement rate limiting to prevent rapid and excessive mouse click simulations.
        *   Run the application with the least necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Screenshot Capture](./threats/unauthorized_screenshot_capture.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit `robotjs` to capture screenshots of the user's screen without their knowledge or consent. This could expose sensitive information displayed on the screen, such as personal data, financial details, confidential documents, or credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violation, exposure of sensitive information, potential identity theft.
    *   **Affected RobotJS Component:** `screen` module, specifically functions like `captureScreen`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the `robotjs` screen capture functionality to only authorized parts of the application.
        *   Clearly inform users when screen capture is being used and obtain explicit consent.
        *   Implement secure storage and transmission mechanisms for any captured screenshots, if necessary.
        *   Minimize the duration and frequency of screen captures.
        *   Run the application with the least necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in RobotJS](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_robotjs.md)

*   **Description:**  The `robotjs` library itself might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the system or execute arbitrary code within the context of the application using `robotjs`.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, remote code execution, data breach, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected RobotJS Component:**  Potentially any module or function within the `robotjs` library, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if remote code execution is possible), High (for other vulnerabilities).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `robotjs` library updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories related to `robotjs` and Node.js.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on RobotJS Dependency](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_robotjs_dependency.md)

*   **Description:** The `robotjs` package or its dependencies on npm could be compromised by malicious actors. This could lead to malicious code being injected into applications that use `robotjs`, potentially allowing attackers to gain control of the system or steal data.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, data breach, malware installation, widespread impact on applications using the compromised package.
    *   **Affected RobotJS Component:** The `robotjs` package itself and its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a package lock file (e.g., `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions.
        *   Regularly audit your project's dependencies for suspicious or unexpected changes.
        *   Use reputable package registries and consider using dependency scanning tools that check for known malicious packages.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) practices.

## Threat: [Misuse of Elevated Privileges via RobotJS](./threats/misuse_of_elevated_privileges_via_robotjs.md)

*   **Description:** If the application using `robotjs` is running with elevated privileges (e.g., as administrator or root), an attacker who gains control of the application could leverage `robotjs` to perform actions that would normally require those elevated privileges. This could lead to significant system compromise.
    *   **Impact:** System-wide compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive resources, installation of malware, complete control over the system.
    *   **Affected RobotJS Component:** All modules and functions within `robotjs` become more dangerous when the application has elevated privileges.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running it as administrator or root unless absolutely necessary.
        *   Implement robust access controls and authorization mechanisms within the application.
        *   Isolate the part of the application that uses `robotjs` and ensure it runs with minimal necessary privileges.
        *   Employ sandboxing techniques to limit the impact of a potential compromise.

## Threat: [Unvalidated Input Leading to RobotJS Abuse](./threats/unvalidated_input_leading_to_robotjs_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** If user-provided input or data from external sources is directly used to control `robotjs` functions without proper validation and sanitization, an attacker could manipulate this input to perform unintended and potentially malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:**  Similar to malicious keystroke injection or mouse click simulation, leading to unauthorized actions, data breaches, or system compromise.
    *   **Affected RobotJS Component:**  Any module or function where external input influences its behavior (e.g., `typeString`, `moveMouse`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input before using it to control `robotjs` functions.
        *   Use parameterized queries or similar techniques to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Implement input validation on both the client-side and server-side.
        *   Follow secure coding practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
