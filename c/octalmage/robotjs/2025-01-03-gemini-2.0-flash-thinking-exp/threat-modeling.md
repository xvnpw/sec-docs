# Threat Model Analysis for octalmage/robotjs

## Threat: [Arbitrary Command Execution via Input Injection (Keyboard)](./threats/arbitrary_command_execution_via_input_injection_(keyboard).md)

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Command Execution via Input Injection (Keyboard)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious keyboard input if user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being used with `robotjs` keyboard functions (e.g., `typeString`, `keyTap`). The attacker might craft input that, when typed by the server, executes commands in an active terminal window or other applications running on the server. This directly involves `robotjs`'s ability to simulate keyboard input.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server if the injected commands are executed with sufficient privileges. This could lead to data breaches, installation of malware, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected `robotjs` Component:** `keyboard` module, specifically functions like `typeString`, `keyTap`, `keyToggle`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input before using it with `robotjs` keyboard functions. Implement allow-lists for characters and patterns.
        *   **Avoid Direct Input Mapping:**  Do not directly map user input to `robotjs` typing. Instead, use predefined actions or commands that the application translates into `robotjs` calls.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running the application as root or with unnecessary administrative rights.
        *   **Sandboxing:** If feasible, run the `robotjs` component in a sandboxed environment with restricted access to system resources.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Excessive Mouse and Keyboard Activity](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_excessive_mouse_and_keyboard_activity.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Excessive Mouse and Keyboard Activity
    *   **Description:** An attacker could trigger rapid and continuous mouse movements and keyboard inputs using `robotjs` functions. This could consume significant CPU resources on the server, potentially leading to a denial of service for the application and other services running on the same machine. This directly utilizes `robotjs`'s mouse and keyboard control features.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, impacting the availability of the application and potentially other services on the server.
    *   **Affected `robotjs` Component:** `mouse` module (e.g., `moveMouse`, `dragMouse`), `keyboard` module (e.g., `typeString`, `keyTap`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on actions that trigger `robotjs` mouse and keyboard functions.
        *   **Throttling:**  Introduce delays or pauses between `robotjs` actions to prevent overwhelming the system.
        *   **Input Validation and Limits:**  If user input controls the frequency or duration of `robotjs` actions, enforce strict limits and validation.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual CPU or memory consumption related to the application.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Screen Capture](./threats/information_disclosure_via_screen_capture.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Screen Capture
    *   **Description:** If an attacker can control the parameters of the `robotjs` screen capture functionality (e.g., capture area), they could potentially capture sensitive information displayed on the server's screen. This directly exploits `robotjs`'s screen capturing capability.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potentially leading to further attacks or data breaches.
    *   **Affected `robotjs` Component:** `screen` module, specifically the `captureScreen` function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Access to Screen Capture:**  Limit the ability to trigger or configure screen captures to authorized users or internal processes only.
        *   **Secure Configuration:** Ensure that the application does not inadvertently expose the screen capture functionality to external users.
        *   **Minimal Capture Area:** If screen capture is necessary, limit the capture area to the absolute minimum required.
        *   **Data Sanitization:** If the captured screen data is processed or stored, implement appropriate sanitization techniques to remove sensitive information.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on `robotjs`](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_`robotjs`.md)

*   **Threat:**  Supply Chain Attack on `robotjs`
    *   **Description:**  Although less directly controlled by the application developers, the `robotjs` library itself could be compromised, potentially introducing malicious functionality that the application unknowingly uses. This directly involves the security of the `robotjs` library.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts, from information disclosure and data breaches to complete server compromise, depending on the nature of the malicious code injected into `robotjs`.
    *   **Affected `robotjs` Component:**  Potentially all modules and functions within the `robotjs` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (due to potential widespread impact)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or other security scanners.
        *   **Verify Checksums:** Verify the integrity of downloaded `robotjs` packages using checksums.
        *   **Monitor for Updates:** Stay informed about security updates and vulnerabilities reported for `robotjs`.
        *   **Consider Alternatives:** If security concerns are significant, evaluate alternative libraries or approaches that might offer better security guarantees.
