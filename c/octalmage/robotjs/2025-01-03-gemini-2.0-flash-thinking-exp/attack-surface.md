# Attack Surface Analysis for octalmage/robotjs

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input Injection via Simulated Events](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_injection_via_simulated_events.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control over the parameters used to generate simulated keyboard or mouse events, injecting malicious commands or data into other applications.

**How RobotJS Contributes:** `robotjs` provides the functionality to programmatically simulate keyboard and mouse inputs. If the application using `robotjs` takes external input (e.g., from network, user input without proper sanitization) to determine these simulated events, it can be exploited.

**Example:** A malicious actor could send specially crafted commands to an application using `robotjs` to simulate typing commands into a terminal window opened by another application, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Potentially complete compromise of the system or other applications, data breaches, unauthorized actions.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:**
    * **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any external input used to determine simulated events. Use whitelisting rather than blacklisting.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running with elevated permissions if possible.
    * **Secure Communication:** If input comes from a network, use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS).
    * **Code Reviews:** Regularly review code that handles input for simulated events to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Screen Content Capture and Information Leakage](./attack_surfaces/screen_content_capture_and_information_leakage.md)

**Description:** The ability to capture screenshots allows for the exfiltration of sensitive information displayed on the screen.

**How RobotJS Contributes:** `robotjs` provides functions to capture the screen content. If this functionality is exposed or used without proper security measures, attackers can exploit it.

**Example:** An attacker compromises an application using `robotjs` and uses the screen capture function to steal credentials, personal data, or confidential business information displayed in other applications running on the user's machine.

**Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information, privacy violations.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:**
    * **Restrict Access:** Implement access controls to limit which parts of the application can use the screen capture functionality.
    * **Secure Storage:** If screenshots are stored, encrypt them securely.
    * **Minimize Capture:** Only capture the necessary portions of the screen and for the minimum required duration.
    * **User Consent:** If capturing user screens, obtain explicit consent and provide clear indication of when capturing is active.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Underlying Native Code Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_underlying_native_code_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the native C++ code of `robotjs` itself can be exploited.

**How RobotJS Contributes:** `robotjs` is a native addon, meaning it includes compiled C++ code that interacts directly with the operating system. Vulnerabilities in this code can lead to serious security flaws.

**Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the `robotjs` native code could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.

**Impact:** Complete system compromise, arbitrary code execution, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:**
    * **Regularly Update RobotJS:** Keep `robotjs` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    * **Dependency Audits:** Be aware of the security of `robotjs`'s dependencies (both JavaScript and native).
    * **Secure Development Practices:**  The `robotjs` developers should follow secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities in the native code.
