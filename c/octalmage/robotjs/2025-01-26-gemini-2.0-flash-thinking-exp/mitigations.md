## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for RobotJS Action Parameters](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_robotjs_action_parameters.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify RobotJS action parameters from external sources:** Pinpoint all instances where parameters for RobotJS functions (e.g., `mouse.move`, `keyboard.typeString`, `screen.capture`) are derived from external inputs such as user input, API data, or configuration files.
    2.  **Define valid parameter constraints:** For each RobotJS action parameter, establish strict constraints based on the expected usage and security requirements. This includes:
        *   **Data type validation:** Ensure parameters are of the correct data type (e.g., numbers for coordinates, strings for text input).
        *   **Range validation:**  Restrict numerical parameters to acceptable ranges (e.g., mouse coordinates within screen bounds, limited string lengths).
        *   **Format validation:**  Enforce specific formats for string parameters if necessary (e.g., using regular expressions to allow only alphanumeric characters).
        *   **Sanitization of string inputs:**  Escape or remove potentially harmful characters or sequences from string parameters to prevent command injection or other vulnerabilities if RobotJS actions indirectly interact with system commands.
    3.  **Implement validation and sanitization routines:** Before passing any external input as a parameter to a RobotJS function, apply the defined validation and sanitization routines.
    4.  **Handle invalid parameters securely:** If validation fails, reject the input, log the error, and prevent the RobotJS action from being executed. Provide informative error messages for debugging and security monitoring.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious RobotJS Action Injection (High Severity):** Attackers inject malicious input that, when used as RobotJS parameters, causes the application to perform unintended and harmful actions like executing system commands, accessing sensitive data, or disrupting system operations.
    *   **Unintended RobotJS Automation Errors (Medium Severity):**  Invalid or out-of-range parameters can lead to RobotJS performing actions outside of intended boundaries, causing application errors, data corruption, or unexpected system behavior due to incorrect automation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious RobotJS Action Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing attackers from directly manipulating RobotJS actions through crafted input parameters.
    *   **Unintended RobotJS Automation Errors:** Substantially reduces the likelihood of errors caused by invalid parameters, improving application stability and the reliability of RobotJS-driven automation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially implemented in [Project Area: Input Processing Module].** Basic type checking exists for some RobotJS parameters, but comprehensive range, format validation, and sanitization are not consistently applied across all RobotJS action calls.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in [Project Area: RobotJS Action Handlers]:** Validation and sanitization are not consistently implemented directly before calls to RobotJS functions in various parts of the application.
    *   **Missing in [Project Area: Configuration Parsing for Automation]:** Parameters for RobotJS actions read from configuration files are not validated or sanitized.
    *   **Missing in [Project Area: API Data Processing for Automation]:** Data received from external APIs that is used to control RobotJS actions lacks validation and sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [User Awareness and Explicit Consent for RobotJS Automation](./mitigation_strategies/user_awareness_and_explicit_consent_for_robotjs_automation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify user-impacting RobotJS actions:** Determine which RobotJS actions directly affect the user's system interaction or could be perceived as intrusive (e.g., mouse and keyboard control outside the application window, screen content reading, clipboard access via automation).
    2.  **Implement explicit consent mechanisms before RobotJS actions:** For each user-impacting RobotJS action, require explicit user consent *before* the action is executed. This can be achieved through:
        *   **Clear and informative prompts:** Display dialog boxes or in-app prompts explaining the intended RobotJS action, its purpose, and potential impact on the user's system.  The prompt should clearly state that RobotJS is being used for automation.
        *   **Granular consent options:** Offer users fine-grained control over different categories of RobotJS actions, allowing them to selectively enable or disable certain types of automation.
        *   **Persistent consent management:** Implement a mechanism to store and manage user consent preferences, allowing users to set their preferences once and have them persist across application sessions.
    3.  **Provide clear visual feedback during RobotJS automation:** When RobotJS is actively automating actions, provide unambiguous visual cues to the user to indicate that automation is in progress. This could include:
        *   **Mouse cursor highlighting or change:** Briefly highlight the mouse cursor or change its appearance when RobotJS is controlling it.
        *   **On-screen automation indicators:** Display a small, unobtrusive icon or message on the screen to signal active RobotJS automation.
        *   **Application-specific UI feedback:** Within the application's user interface, clearly display the status and progress of RobotJS-driven automation tasks.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **User Confusion and Mistrust (Medium Severity):** Unexplained or unexpected RobotJS actions can confuse users, erode trust in the application, and potentially lead to users disabling necessary features or misinterpreting application behavior as malicious.
    *   **Perceived Privacy Violations (Medium Severity):** Automated screen reading or clipboard access without user awareness can be perceived as privacy violations, even if unintentional, damaging user trust and potentially raising legal or ethical concerns.
    *   **Accidental Interference with Automation (Medium Severity):** Users unaware of active RobotJS automation might unintentionally interfere with automated processes, leading to application errors, data corruption, or disruption of intended workflows.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **User Confusion and Mistrust:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring users are informed and in control of RobotJS automation, fostering trust and improving user experience.
    *   **Perceived Privacy Violations:** Partially mitigates the risk by making users aware of potentially privacy-sensitive RobotJS actions and giving them control over their execution.
    *   **Accidental Interference with Automation:** Reduces the risk by improving user understanding of automation processes, minimizing the likelihood of unintended interference.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially implemented in [Project Area: User Interface].** Some user-initiated actions trigger basic confirmation prompts, but these prompts often lack clear explanations about RobotJS involvement and the extent of automation. Visual feedback during RobotJS automation is minimal and inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in [Project Area: Consent Management Module]:** A dedicated consent management module is needed to consistently handle user consent for various RobotJS actions and manage user preferences.
    *   **Missing in [Project Area: Visual Feedback System for Automation]:**  More robust and consistent visual feedback mechanisms are required to clearly and reliably indicate when RobotJS automation is active.
    *   **Missing in [Project Area: User Onboarding and Documentation]:** User onboarding processes and documentation should clearly explain the application's use of RobotJS, the purpose of automation, and how users can manage consent and understand visual feedback.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Instrument code to log RobotJS function calls:** Modify the application code to log every call to RobotJS functions (e.g., `mouse.move`, `keyboard.typeString`, `screen.capture`).
    2.  **Log relevant parameters for each RobotJS call:** For each logged RobotJS function call, capture and record the parameters passed to the function. This includes:
        *   **Target coordinates for mouse actions.**
        *   **Keys or text strings for keyboard actions.**
        *   **Screen regions for screen capture actions.**
        *   **Any other relevant parameters specific to the RobotJS function.**
    3.  **Include contextual information in logs:**  Enhance log entries with contextual information to aid in analysis and incident response. This includes:
        *   **Timestamp of the RobotJS call.**
        *   **User or process ID initiating the RobotJS action.**
        *   **Application component or module making the RobotJS call.**
        *   **Outcome of the RobotJS call (success or failure, if detectable).**
    4.  **Centralize and secure RobotJS action logs:**  Store RobotJS action logs in a secure, centralized logging system that is protected from unauthorized access and tampering.
    5.  **Implement monitoring and alerting for anomalous RobotJS activity:**  Establish monitoring rules and alerts to detect unusual or suspicious patterns in RobotJS function call logs. This could include:

    *   **Missing in [Project Area: Monitoring and Alerting Configuration]:** Monitoring rules and alerting mechanisms need to be configured to analyze RobotJS action logs and detect anomalous activity patterns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sandboxed Execution Environment for RobotJS Components](./mitigation_strategies/sandboxed_execution_environment_for_robotjs_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Isolate RobotJS-dependent application components:** Identify the specific modules or components of the application that directly utilize the RobotJS library.
    2.  **Deploy RobotJS components in a sandboxed environment:**  Run the isolated RobotJS components within a restricted or sandboxed execution environment. This can be achieved using:
        *   **Operating System-level sandboxing:** Utilize OS features like containers (Docker, Podman), or process sandboxing mechanisms (e.g., namespaces, cgroups on Linux, AppContainers on Windows) to limit the RobotJS component's access to system resources and the broader application environment.
        *   **Virtualization:**  Deploy the RobotJS component within a virtual machine (VM) to provide a strong isolation boundary from the host system and other application components.
    3.  **Restrict permissions within the sandbox:** Configure the sandboxed environment to grant the RobotJS component only the minimum necessary permissions required for its intended functionality. This includes limiting:
        *   **File system access:** Restrict access to only necessary files and directories.
        *   **Network access:** Limit or disable network access if not required for the RobotJS component's operation.
        *   **System capabilities:** Drop unnecessary system capabilities to reduce the potential attack surface within the sandbox.
    4.  **Establish secure inter-process communication (IPC):** If the sandboxed RobotJS component needs to communicate with other parts of the application, implement secure and well-defined IPC mechanisms (e.g., APIs, message queues, secure sockets) with strict authorization and data validation at the communication boundaries.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Containment of RobotJS-Related Security Breaches (High Severity):** If a vulnerability in the RobotJS component or its dependencies is exploited, sandboxing limits the attacker's ability to escalate privileges or move laterally to compromise other parts of the application or the underlying system.
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface for RobotJS Exploits (Medium Severity):** By isolating RobotJS, the overall attack surface exposed by the application is reduced, as vulnerabilities specifically within RobotJS or its execution environment are less likely to impact the broader application or system.
    *   **Improved Application Stability and Resilience (Medium Severity):** Sandboxing can prevent errors, resource exhaustion, or crashes within the RobotJS component from propagating to other parts of the application, improving overall stability and resilience.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Containment of RobotJS-Related Security Breaches:** Significantly reduces the potential impact of a security breach originating from the RobotJS component by limiting the attacker's scope of access and control.
