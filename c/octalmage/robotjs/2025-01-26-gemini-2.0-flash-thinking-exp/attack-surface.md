# Attack Surface Analysis for octalmage/robotjs

## Attack Surface: [1. Unintended System Actions via Input Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/1__unintended_system_actions_via_input_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate input data used to control `robotjs` actions (keyboard, mouse, clipboard) to execute unintended commands or actions on the server's OS.
*   **How robotjs contributes:** `robotjs` translates software commands into system-level actions. Unvalidated input controlling these commands allows attackers to leverage `robotjs` for malicious purposes.
*   **Example:** A web application uses user input to "type" text via `robotjs`. An attacker injects shell commands into this input, which `robotjs` then types into the server's active window, leading to command execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, System Compromise, Data Exfiltration, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input data before using it with `robotjs`. Use whitelists for allowed characters and commands.
    *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:** Sanitize input based on the specific `robotjs` function being used (e.g., sanitize for shell command injection if using `robotjs.typeString`).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the Node.js process with minimal necessary privileges. Avoid running as root or administrator if possible.
    *   **Isolate robotjs Functionality:**  Isolate `robotjs` related code into a separate, less privileged process if feasible.

## Attack Surface: [2. Privilege Escalation (Indirect)](./attack_surfaces/2__privilege_escalation__indirect_.md)

*   **Description:** Application vulnerabilities combined with `robotjs` running with elevated privileges can grant attackers system-level control, even if the initial vulnerability isn't directly privilege escalation.
*   **How robotjs contributes:** `robotjs` often requires elevated privileges. If the application inherits or is granted these privileges, any application vulnerability that can control `robotjs` becomes a privilege escalation path.
*   **Example:** An XSS vulnerability in a web application allows attacker-controlled JavaScript execution. This code interacts with a backend Node.js application using `robotjs` with elevated privileges. The attacker leverages XSS to trigger `robotjs` actions with those privileges, escalating to system-level control.
*   **Impact:** Full System Compromise, Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Node.js Process):**  Run the Node.js application with the absolute minimum privileges required. Avoid unnecessary permissions.
    *   **Minimize robotjs Privilege Requirements:**  Configure the system and application to minimize the privileges needed for `robotjs` to function.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct security audits and penetration testing to find and fix application vulnerabilities exploitable with `robotjs`.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (as in point 1):** Prevents attackers from controlling application logic and indirectly `robotjs` actions.

## Attack Surface: [3. Information Disclosure via Screenshotting/Screen Reading](./attack_surfaces/3__information_disclosure_via_screenshottingscreen_reading.md)

*   **Description:** `robotjs`'s screen capture capabilities can be misused to expose sensitive information displayed on the server's screen.
*   **How robotjs contributes:** `robotjs` provides functions for screenshots and reading screen pixel data. Uncontrolled access or mishandling of captured data can lead to information leaks.
*   **Example:** A debugging feature uses `robotjs` to take screenshots for error reporting. If error logs are publicly accessible or an attacker can trigger and access screenshots, they could view sensitive data on the server's screen (API keys, configuration, dashboards).
*   **Impact:** Data Breach, Exposure of Confidential Information, Privacy Violation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (depending on data sensitivity on the server screen)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Access to Screenshot Functionality:** Limit access to `robotjs` screenshot functions to authorized users/processes only.
    *   **Secure Storage and Handling of Screenshots:** Securely store screenshots, preventing public access. Implement access controls and encryption if needed.
    *   **Minimize Sensitive Information on Server Screen:** Reduce sensitive data displayed on the server screen, especially in production.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review code using screenshot functionality for vulnerabilities and information leakage.

## Attack Surface: [4. Dependency Vulnerabilities in robotjs or its Native Modules](./attack_surfaces/4__dependency_vulnerabilities_in_robotjs_or_its_native_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in `robotjs` or its native dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application and server.
*   **How robotjs contributes:** `robotjs` relies on native modules for system interaction. Vulnerabilities in these modules or in `robotjs` itself introduce security flaws.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is found in a native library used by `robotjs` for screen capture. If the application uses the vulnerable `robotjs` version, an attacker could exploit this for unauthorized access or code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, System Compromise, Data Breach (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability type)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep `robotjs` and all dependencies updated with the latest security patches.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in `robotjs` and its dependencies.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for `robotjs` and dependencies to stay informed about vulnerabilities and updates.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Review code changes in `robotjs` updates for potential security implications.
