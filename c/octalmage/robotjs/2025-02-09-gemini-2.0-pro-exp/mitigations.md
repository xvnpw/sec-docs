## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (for `robotjs` Input)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization__for__robotjs__input_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify All `robotjs` Input Points:**  List every location in your code where data from *any* source (user input, API responses, configuration files, database reads, etc.) is used, directly or indirectly, as input to *any* `robotjs` function (e.g., `typeString`, `keyTap`, `moveMouse`, `getPixelColor`, `screen.capture`).
    2.  **Define Whitelists (per Input Point):** For *each* identified input point, create a precise whitelist of *allowed* values.  This whitelist should be as restrictive as possible, defining the *exact* acceptable input.  Examples:
        *   `keyTap("enter")`: Whitelist is *only* the string "enter".
        *   `typeString(username)`: Whitelist is a regular expression *exactly* matching valid usernames (e.g., `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,15}$`).
        *   `moveMouse(x, y)`: Whitelist is a list of valid `x, y` coordinate pairs.
    3.  **Implement Validation (Before `robotjs` Calls):** Before *any* `robotjs` call, validate the input against the corresponding whitelist.  Use a robust validation library.  If the input is *not* in the whitelist, *reject* it.  Do *not* attempt to "fix" invalid input.
    4.  **Sanitize (Secondary Defense):** Even after validation, perform sanitization as a secondary defense.  This might involve escaping special characters.  However, *rely primarily on whitelisting*.
    5.  **Error Handling (for Rejected Input):**  When input is rejected, log the event (including the invalid input and the source) and handle the error gracefully.  Do *not* expose detailed error messages to the user.
    6.  **Centralize Validation (Optional):** Consider creating a centralized validation module or function to handle all `robotjs` input validation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Untrusted Input Injection:** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary commands or data into `robotjs` functions.
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls:** (Severity: High) - Makes it harder to bypass UI-based security measures using `robotjs`.
    *   **Indirect Privilege Escalation:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk if the application has elevated privileges.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Untrusted Input Injection:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (if implemented correctly).
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **Indirect Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Input validation for the `username` field in the `login` function ( `/src/auth.js`) uses a regular expression.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: The `processConfig` function ( `/src/config.js`) uses settings from a configuration file with `robotjs` without validation.
    *   Example: The function `handleExternalData` in `/src/api.js` uses data from external API and uses it with `robotjs`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize and Restrict Screen Reading (`robotjs` Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_and_restrict_screen_reading___robotjs__specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Audit `getPixelColor` and `screen.capture` Usage:** Review all instances of these functions. Document *why* screen reading is necessary for each.
    2.  **Explore Alternatives (to Screen Reading):**  For each instance, investigate if there's a way to achieve the same functionality *without* reading the screen.  Consider APIs, IPC, or OS-level features.
    3.  **Minimize Capture Area (If Unavoidable):** If screen reading is *essential*, drastically reduce the captured area.  Calculate the *precise* coordinates and dimensions of the *smallest possible rectangle* needed.  Use variables to store these coordinates, ensuring they are *not* influenced by user input.
    4.  **Pre-calculate Coordinates (If Fixed):** If the target area is fixed, pre-calculate the coordinates and dimensions *at development time* and store them as constants.
    5.  **Validate Coordinates (If Dynamic):** If coordinates *must* be calculated dynamically, implement strict validation to ensure they are within safe bounds.  Define a maximum allowed size.
    6. **Add delays:** Add small delays before and after screen reading operations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Screen Scraping and Data Exfiltration:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of stealing sensitive information from the screen.
    *   **Indirect Privilege Escalation:** (Severity: High) - Reduces risk if the application has elevated privileges.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Screen Scraping and Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (or Low if eliminated).
    *   **Indirect Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `getColorAtLoginButton` ( `/src/ui_interaction.js`) captures only a 10x10 pixel area.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `monitorApplicationState` ( `/src/monitoring.js`) captures the entire screen.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Throttling (`robotjs` Calls)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_throttling___robotjs__calls_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify High-Frequency `robotjs` Calls:** Identify all `robotjs` function calls that could be executed rapidly or repeatedly.
    2.  **Implement Rate Limiting (per Call):** For *each* identified call, implement rate limiting using techniques like:
        *   **Token Bucket:** Allows a certain number of calls within a time window.
        *   **Leaky Bucket:** Allows calls at a constant rate.
        *   **Rate-Limiting Libraries:** Use a library for your language (e.g., `express-rate-limit` in Node.js).
    3.  **Define Appropriate Limits:** Determine rate limits based on the *legitimate* needs of your application.  Start restrictively and adjust as needed.
    4.  **Error Handling (for Rate Limits):**  When a rate limit is exceeded, log the event and handle the error gracefully (e.g., return an error, temporarily disable functionality, queue the request).
    5.  **Monitor Usage:** Continuously monitor the rate of `robotjs` calls and adjust limits.
    6. **Add delays:** Add small delays between `robotjs` calls.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents overwhelming the system with excessive `robotjs` calls.
    *   **Screen Scraping and Data Exfiltration:** (Severity: High) - Slows down screen scraping attempts.
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls:** (Severity: High) - Makes rapid automation of security controls more difficult.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Screen Scraping and Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `mouseMoveLoop` ( `/src/animation.js`) is limited to 10 calls/second.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `typeTextFromAPI` ( `/src/api_integration.js`) types text from an API without rate limiting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Dynamic `robotjs` Calls (Use Static Calls or Lookup Tables)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_dynamic__robotjs__calls__use_static_calls_or_lookup_tables_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic Calls:** Find instances where the *choice* of `robotjs` function, or its *arguments*, are determined by user input or external data.
    2.  **Refactor to Static Calls:** If possible, refactor to use *static* `robotjs` calls (hardcoded function calls and arguments).
    3.  **Use a Lookup Table (If Dynamic is Necessary):** If dynamic behavior is *unavoidable*, use a strictly controlled lookup table (e.g., a dictionary or map) or an enum:
        *   *Keys:* Limited set of *safe*, predefined values (e.g., enum values).
        *   *Values:* Corresponding `robotjs` function calls and arguments (predefined and safe).
        *   User input is used *only* to select a *key* from the table.  *Never* construct calls directly from input.
    4.  **Validate Lookup Key:** Before using the table, validate that the user-provided key is a *valid* key.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Untrusted Input Injection:** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents controlling which `robotjs` functions are called and with what arguments.
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Indirect Privilege Escalation:** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Untrusted Input Injection:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (if implemented correctly).
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **Indirect Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `performAction` ( `/src/actions.js`) uses a lookup table.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `executeCommand` ( `/src/commands.js`) takes a command string and uses it directly with `robotjs.typeString`.
