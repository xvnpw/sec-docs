# Threat Model Analysis for octalmage/robotjs

## Threat: [Malicious System Command Execution](./threats/malicious_system_command_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious System Command Execution

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects input that causes the application to use `robotjs` to simulate keystrokes that execute arbitrary system commands.  This leverages `robotjs`'s ability to mimic user input to open a terminal or command prompt and then type malicious commands, potentially leading to complete system takeover.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker could gain full control, steal data, install malware, or cause data loss.
    *   **Affected `robotjs` Component:** `keyTap()`, `keyToggle()`, `typeString()`, `typeStringDelayed()`. Any function simulating keyboard input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation. Never directly pass user input to `robotjs` keyboard functions. Use a whitelist of allowed characters/commands.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimum necessary privileges. *Do not* run as administrator.
        *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Isolate the application to limit damage from a compromise.
        *   **Avoid Direct Command Execution:** If possible, avoid using `robotjs` for direct system command execution. Use safer, controlled APIs.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exfiltration via Screen Capture](./threats/sensitive_data_exfiltration_via_screen_capture.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exfiltration via Screen Capture

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability or injects malicious input to make the application use `robotjs` to capture screenshots of the user's screen. These screenshots, potentially containing sensitive information like passwords or financial data, are then exfiltrated to the attacker. This directly uses `robotjs`'s screen capture capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, leading to identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected `robotjs` Component:** `screen.capture()`, `getPixelColor()` (can be used to reconstruct screen content).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize Screen Capture:** Avoid `screen.capture()` unless absolutely essential.
        *   **User Consent and Notification:** Obtain explicit user consent *before* capturing. Clearly inform the user. Provide a visual indicator.
        *   **Secure Data Transmission:** Use strong encryption (e.g., HTTPS with TLS 1.3+) for transmission.
        *   **Secure Data Storage:** Encrypt screenshots at rest.
        *   **Data Minimization:** Capture only the necessary screen region.

## Threat: [Clipboard Hijacking and Data Theft](./threats/clipboard_hijacking_and_data_theft.md)

*   **Threat:** Clipboard Hijacking and Data Theft

    *   **Description:** The attacker uses `robotjs` to either read the contents of the user's clipboard (stealing potentially sensitive data) or to overwrite the clipboard with malicious content (e.g., a phishing link or command). This directly exploits `robotjs`'s clipboard access functions.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential execution of malicious code, or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Affected `robotjs` Component:** `getCopyText()`, `setCopyText()`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize Clipboard Access:** Avoid using `robotjs` for clipboard interaction unless essential.
        *   **Sanitize Clipboard Data:** If reading from the clipboard, sanitize the data *before* use.
        *   **Clear Clipboard After Use:** Clear sensitive data from the clipboard immediately after use.
        *   **User Awareness:** Educate users about clipboard hijacking risks.

## Threat: [Undetectable Keylogging](./threats/undetectable_keylogging.md)

* **Threat:** Undetectable Keylogging

    * **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability to make the application use `robotjs` to simulate key presses and record *all* user keystrokes (including passwords and sensitive data) without the user's knowledge. The recorded keystrokes are then sent to the attacker. This leverages `robotjs`'s ability to interact with the keyboard.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of *all* user keystrokes, leading to account compromise, identity theft, and financial loss.
    * **Affected `robotjs` Component:** `keyTap()`, `keyToggle()`, `typeString()`, `typeStringDelayed()`.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Global Keystroke Capture:** Do *not* use `robotjs` to capture all system keystrokes. Restrict monitoring to the application's own window and only when absolutely necessary.
        *   **User Consent and Notification:** If *any* keystroke monitoring is required, obtain explicit, informed consent. Clearly explain what is captured and why. Provide a visual indicator.
        *   **Secure Input Fields:** Encourage the use of secure input fields (e.g., password fields) to prevent interception.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
        * **Sandboxing:** Isolate application.
