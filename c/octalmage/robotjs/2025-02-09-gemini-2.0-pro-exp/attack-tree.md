## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker's Goal: Gain Unauthorized OS Control via RobotJS](./attack_tree_paths/attacker's_goal_gain_unauthorized_os_control_via_robotjs.md)

*   **[[Attacker's Goal: Gain Unauthorized OS Control via RobotJS]]**
    *   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to gain unauthorized control over the user's operating system, leveraging vulnerabilities related to the application's use of RobotJS. This includes actions like executing arbitrary code, stealing data, manipulating the UI, and disrupting system operations.
    *   **Why Critical:** This is the root of the attack tree and defines the attacker's objective. All other nodes are steps towards achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Inject Malicious RobotJS Code](./attack_tree_paths/1__inject_malicious_robotjs_code.md)

*   **[[1. Inject Malicious RobotJS Code]]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker aims to execute their own crafted RobotJS code within the application's context. This provides the most direct and powerful way to control the system through RobotJS.
    *   **Why Critical:** Successful code injection grants the attacker near-complete control over the RobotJS API, allowing them to perform a wide range of malicious actions.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** This path is high-risk due to the prevalence of vulnerabilities like XSS, which facilitate code injection, and the high impact of successful code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 XSS/Code Injection](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_xsscode_injection.md)

*   **[[1.1 XSS/Code Injection]]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability or another code injection flaw to insert malicious JavaScript code that utilizes RobotJS.
    *   **Why Critical:** XSS is a common and well-understood vulnerability that directly enables code injection, making it a critical attack vector.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** XSS vulnerabilities are frequently found in web applications, and successful exploitation leads directly to the high-impact outcome of code injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Find XSS Vuln](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_find_xss_vuln.md)

*   **[[1.1.1 Find XSS Vuln]]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker identifies a vulnerability in the application that allows for JavaScript code injection. This typically involves finding an input field or other entry point where user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in the application's output or logic.
    *   **Why Critical:** This is the necessary first step for an XSS attack. Without finding a vulnerability, the attacker cannot proceed.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends heavily on application security)
    *   **Impact:** High (Enables code injection)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding an exploitable input)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires XSS knowledge)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Standard testing can find many XSS vulns)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Craft Payload](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_craft_payload.md)

*   **[[1.1.2 Craft Payload]]**
    *   **Description:** Once an XSS vulnerability is found, the attacker creates a malicious JavaScript payload. This payload will use RobotJS functions to perform actions on the user's system, such as simulating key presses, mouse movements, or capturing screen contents.
    *   **Why Critical:** The payload is the actual code that executes the attacker's malicious intent.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Once XSS is found, crafting a payload is easy)
    *   **Impact:** High (Directly controls RobotJS)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Requires basic JavaScript and RobotJS knowledge)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of JavaScript and RobotJS)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Payload execution might be detected)
