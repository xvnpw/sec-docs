# Attack Surface Analysis for octalmage/robotjs

## Attack Surface: [1. Command Injection via Keyboard Input](./attack_surfaces/1__command_injection_via_keyboard_input.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious operating system commands through simulated keyboard input provided by `robotjs`.
    *   **How `robotjs` Contributes:**  The `robotjs.typeString()` and `robotjs.keyTap()` functions are the *direct* means of injecting arbitrary text and key combinations, enabling command execution if the input reaches a command-line interpreter.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Application uses `robotjs.typeString()` to populate a command prompt based on user input.  Attacker provides input like `; rm -rf /;` (Linux/macOS) or `; powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest ...)"` (Windows).
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data loss, data exfiltration, malware installation, remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Absolute Prohibition:** *Never* use `robotjs` to interact with a command-line interface or any application that interprets input as commands. This is the paramount mitigation.  Find alternative, non-`robotjs` solutions.
        *   **Strict Input Validation (If Unavoidable - Highly Discouraged):** If, against all advice, `robotjs` *must* be used in a way that could influence a command line, implement extremely rigorous input validation and sanitization. Use whitelisting of a very limited set of safe characters and patterns.  Assume all input is malicious.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage of a successful injection.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate the application or the `robotjs` component within a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container) to contain the impact of a compromise.

## Attack Surface: [2. UI Manipulation via Mouse and Keyboard (Leading to Command Injection or Sensitive Action)](./attack_surfaces/2__ui_manipulation_via_mouse_and_keyboard__leading_to_command_injection_or_sensitive_action_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses `robotjs`'s mouse and keyboard control to manipulate the UI, ultimately leading to either command injection (covered above) or the execution of a sensitive action without proper authorization.  This entry focuses on the *indirect* path to high-severity consequences.
    *   **How `robotjs` Contributes:** `robotjs.moveMouse()`, `robotjs.mouseClick()`, `robotjs.typeString()`, and `robotjs.keyTap()` provide the *direct* mechanism for interacting with any visible UI element, allowing the attacker to navigate to dangerous functionality.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Attacker uses `robotjs` to navigate through menus and dialogs to reach a "Run Command" feature within the application (even if that feature is normally hidden or protected).
        *   Attacker uses `robotjs` to click an "OK" button on a system-level permission dialog, granting the application elevated privileges.
        *   Attacker uses `robotjs` to open a web browser and navigate to a malicious site that exploits a browser vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the ultimate action achieved, but can include command injection (Critical), data modification, unauthorized actions, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if it leads to command injection)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Indirect Control Only:** *Never* allow user input to directly specify mouse coordinates or keyboard input sequences.  Instead, map user input to a *predefined, limited set* of safe UI actions.
        *   **Contextual Validation (Ideal but Difficult):** The application should ideally be aware of the UI state and validate that the intended `robotjs` action is permissible *before* executing it. This is complex to implement reliably.
        *   **External Confirmation:** For any action that could have significant consequences, require explicit user confirmation *outside* of the `robotjs`-controlled UI. This prevents `robotjs` from automating the confirmation.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the frequency of `robotjs` calls to prevent rapid, automated UI traversal.

## Attack Surface: [3. Sensitive Data Exposure via Screen Capture](./attack_surfaces/3__sensitive_data_exposure_via_screen_capture.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker leverages `robotjs`'s screen capture capabilities to obtain sensitive information displayed on the screen, originating from *other* applications or system components.
    *   **How `robotjs` Contributes:** The `robotjs.screen.capture()` function (and related functions) are the *direct* means of accessing pixel data from the screen.
    *   **Example:**
        *   If the application captures a screen region based on user-provided parameters, an attacker could manipulate those parameters to capture areas displaying credentials from a password manager or sensitive data from a document.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of credentials, confidential documents, private messages, financial data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize Capture Area:** Capture only the *absolute minimum* necessary screen area. Avoid full-screen captures.
        *   **Prohibit User-Defined Regions:** *Never* allow user input to directly control the screen capture region. Use only predefined, fixed regions that are guaranteed to *not* overlap with areas where other applications might display sensitive data.
        *   **Secure Handling:** If captured data must be stored or transmitted, use strong encryption and secure communication channels.
        *   **Immediate Deletion:** Delete captured screen data as soon as it is no longer needed.
