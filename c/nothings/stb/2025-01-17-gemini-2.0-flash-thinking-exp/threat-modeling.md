# Threat Model Analysis for nothings/stb

## Threat: [Malicious Image File Leading to Buffer Overflow](./threats/malicious_image_file_leading_to_buffer_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPG, BMP) with manipulated header information or embedded data. When the application uses `stb_image` to load this image, the library attempts to allocate an insufficient buffer or writes beyond the allocated buffer due to incorrect size calculations derived from the malicious file.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potentially arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overflowed data.
*   **Affected `stb` Component:** `stb_image.h` (specifically functions like `stbi_load`, `stbi_load_from_memory`, and related decoding functions for different image formats).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate image dimensions and file sizes before passing them to `stb_image` functions. Implement strict limits.
    *   Consider using a separate, more robust image processing library for initial validation or sanitization.
    *   Implement robust error handling to catch failures from `stbi_load` and avoid further processing of potentially malicious data.
    *   Run the image processing in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
    *   Keep the `stb` library updated (though updates are infrequent, be aware of any reported vulnerabilities).

## Threat: [Malicious Audio File Leading to Out-of-Bounds Read](./threats/malicious_audio_file_leading_to_out-of-bounds_read.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted audio file (e.g., Ogg Vorbis) with malformed metadata or stream data. When the application uses `stb_vorbis` to decode this file, the library attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer while parsing the file structure or decoding audio samples.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential information disclosure if the out-of-bounds read accesses sensitive memory.
*   **Affected `stb` Component:** `stb_vorbis.c` (specifically functions like `stb_vorbis_open_filename`, `stb_vorbis_decode_frame`, and related parsing and decoding functions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate audio file headers and metadata before decoding. Implement checks for expected values and ranges.
    *   Implement robust error handling to catch decoding errors and prevent further processing.
    *   Limit the size of audio files that can be processed.
    *   Run the audio decoding in a sandboxed environment.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Image Dimension Calculation](./threats/integer_overflow_in_image_dimension_calculation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides an image file with extremely large dimensions specified in the header. When `stb_image` attempts to calculate memory allocation sizes based on these dimensions, an integer overflow occurs, resulting in a much smaller buffer being allocated than required. Subsequent operations then write beyond this undersized buffer.
*   **Impact:** Buffer overflow, application crash, potential code execution.
*   **Affected `stb` Component:** `stb_image.h` (specifically within the decoding functions where image dimensions are read and used for memory allocation).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Explicitly check for integer overflows when reading image dimensions. Ensure that multiplication operations for calculating buffer sizes do not wrap around.
    *   Impose strict limits on maximum image dimensions.
    *   Use data types large enough to accommodate the maximum possible image dimensions without overflowing.
