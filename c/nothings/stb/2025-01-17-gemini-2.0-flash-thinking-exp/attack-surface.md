# Attack Surface Analysis for nothings/stb

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow in Image Decoding](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflow_in_image_decoding.md)

**Description:** A malformed image file with crafted header information or image data can cause `stb_image.h` to write beyond the allocated buffer, overwriting adjacent memory.

**How `stb` Contributes:** `stb_image.h` handles the parsing and decoding of various image formats. Vulnerabilities in its decoding logic for specific formats (PNG, JPG, etc.) can lead to buffer overflows if input data exceeds expected boundaries.

**Example:** A specially crafted PNG file with an excessively large width or height field could cause `stb` to allocate an insufficient buffer, leading to a write out-of-bounds when the image data is processed.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to application crashes, denial of service, or, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten memory.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Update to the latest version of `stb_image.h` as it may contain fixes for known vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using memory-safe languages or wrappers around `stb` if feasible for critical parts of the application.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflow in Image Processing](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflow_in_image_processing.md)

**Description:** During image processing within `stb_image.h`, calculations involving image dimensions, buffer sizes, or color components might overflow integer limits. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including allocating smaller-than-needed buffers.

**How `stb` Contributes:** `stb_image.h` performs arithmetic operations on image data. If these operations are not carefully checked for overflows, malicious input can trigger them.

**Example:** A crafted image file with extremely large dimensions could cause an integer overflow when calculating the required buffer size, leading to a heap overflow when the image data is written into the undersized buffer.

**Impact:** Heap corruption, potentially leading to application crashes, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Update to the latest version of `stb_image.h` as it may contain fixes for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow in TrueType Font Rasterization](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflow_in_truetype_font_rasterization.md)

**Description:** When using `stb_truetype.h` to render text, a malformed font file with crafted glyph data or table structures can cause `stb` to write beyond allocated buffers during the rasterization process.

**How `stb` Contributes:** `stb_truetype.h` parses and rasterizes TrueType font files. Vulnerabilities in its parsing or rasterization logic can lead to buffer overflows when processing malicious font data.

**Example:** A crafted TrueType font file with an overly complex glyph definition or a malformed hinting table could cause a buffer overflow during rasterization.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to application crashes, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Update to the latest version of `stb_truetype.h` as it may contain fixes for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow in Vorbis Audio Decoding](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflow_in_vorbis_audio_decoding.md)

**Description:** When using `stb_vorbis.c` to decode Vorbis audio streams, a malformed stream with crafted packet data or header information can cause `stb` to write beyond allocated buffers.

**How `stb` Contributes:** `stb_vorbis.c` handles the parsing and decoding of Vorbis audio. Vulnerabilities in its decoding logic can lead to buffer overflows when processing malicious audio data.

**Example:** A crafted Vorbis stream with an invalid packet size or malformed header could cause a buffer overflow during decoding.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to application crashes, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Update to the latest version of `stb_vorbis.c` as it may contain fixes for known vulnerabilities.
