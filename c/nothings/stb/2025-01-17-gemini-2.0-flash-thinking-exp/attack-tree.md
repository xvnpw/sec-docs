# Attack Tree Analysis for nothings/stb

Objective: Compromise application using the `stb` library by exploiting its weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise Application Using stb
* OR Exploit Image Loading Vulnerabilities (stb_image.h) **CRITICAL NODE**
    * AND Supply Malicious Image File **CRITICAL NODE**
        * OR Trigger Buffer Overflow **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Inject Shellcode (Achieve Remote Code Execution) **HIGH-RISK PATH**
        * OR Trigger Heap Overflow
            * Overwrite Function Pointers (Achieve Remote Code Execution) **HIGH-RISK PATH**
        * OR Exploit Format-Specific Vulnerabilities (e.g., PNG, JPG, BMP) **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Refer to known CVEs and format specifications for specific attack vectors **HIGH-RISK PATH**
    * AND Application Incorrectly Handles stb_image Output **CRITICAL NODE**
        * OR Incorrect Memory Allocation/Deallocation **CRITICAL NODE**
* OR Exploit Build/Integration Issues **CRITICAL NODE**
    * AND Use an Outdated or Vulnerable Version of stb **HIGH-RISK PATH**, **CRITICAL NODE**
        * Refer to known CVEs for the specific stb version **HIGH-RISK PATH**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Loading -> Supply Malicious Image File -> Trigger Buffer Overflow -> Inject Shellcode (Achieve Remote Code Execution)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_loading_-_supply_malicious_image_file_-_trigger_buffer_overflow_-_inject_shellcode__ac_fc1bd2bc.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious image file that, when processed by `stb_image.h`, causes a buffer overflow. This overflow overwrites memory, allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code on the system running the application.
    * **Mechanism:** This typically involves providing image data where the declared size or dimensions are smaller than the actual data provided, leading to out-of-bounds writes during the decoding process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Loading -> Supply Malicious Image File -> Trigger Heap Overflow -> Overwrite Function Pointers (Achieve Remote Code Execution)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_loading_-_supply_malicious_image_file_-_trigger_heap_overflow_-_overwrite_function_poi_d75b95c7.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious image file that, when processed by `stb_image.h`, causes a heap overflow. This overflow overwrites memory on the heap, specifically targeting function pointers or other critical data structures. By overwriting a function pointer with the address of their malicious code, the attacker can gain control when that function pointer is subsequently called.
    * **Mechanism:** This often involves manipulating image metadata or compressed data in a way that leads to incorrect size calculations or allocation sizes, resulting in writing beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Loading -> Supply Malicious Image File -> Exploit Format-Specific Vulnerabilities (when CVE exists)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_loading_-_supply_malicious_image_file_-_exploit_format-specific_vulnerabilities__when__54ba6b38.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker leverages known vulnerabilities (identified by CVEs) within the specific image formats supported by `stb_image.h` (e.g., PNG, JPG, BMP). These vulnerabilities are often related to parsing specific chunks or markers within the image file format.
    * **Mechanism:** This requires understanding the specific format's structure and the details of the vulnerability. Attackers may use existing exploits or craft their own based on the CVE details.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Build/Integration Issues -> Use an Outdated or Vulnerable Version of stb -> Refer to known CVEs for the specific stb version](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_buildintegration_issues_-_use_an_outdated_or_vulnerable_version_of_stb_-_refer_to_known_cves_4d392072.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application is using an older version of the `stb` library that contains known security vulnerabilities (identified by CVEs). Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities directly if they know the application is using a vulnerable version.
    * **Mechanism:** This often involves readily available exploits or techniques documented in the CVE details. The attacker doesn't need to discover a new vulnerability but rather leverage an existing one.
