## Attack Tree Path: [1. Attack: Compromise Application via stb Library [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__attack_compromise_application_via_stb_library__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the root goal of the attacker. Success means achieving unauthorized access, control, or disruption of the application through stb library exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Memory Safety Vulnerabilities in stb [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2___high-risk_path__exploit_memory_safety_vulnerabilities_in_stb__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting common memory safety issues in C code within stb, such as buffer overflows, heap overflows, use-after-free, and out-of-bounds reads.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the application and potentially the underlying system. Can also cause application crashes and denial of service.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Robust input validation, sanitization, memory safety checks during development, use of memory-safe coding practices, and sandboxing of stb processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3___high-risk_path__buffer_overflow__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Overwriting memory buffers beyond their allocated size due to insufficient bounds checking in stb when processing input data.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Input File with Exceedingly Long Data Fields:** Providing malicious image or font files with crafted excessively long data fields (e.g., filenames, metadata, color palettes) that exceed expected buffer sizes in stb.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Integer Overflow leading to Small Buffer Allocation:** Crafting input files that trigger integer overflows during buffer size calculations within stb, leading to allocation of smaller-than-needed buffers and subsequent overflows during data processing.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, application crash, denial of service.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Strict input length validation, safe integer arithmetic, use of bounds-checking functions where applicable, and memory safety tools during development.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Heap Overflow [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4___high-risk_path__heap_overflow__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Overwriting heap memory beyond allocated chunks during dynamic memory operations within stb, often triggered by processing complex or malformed input files. This can occur during image decoding, resizing, or other heap-intensive operations.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, application crash, denial of service.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Secure memory management practices, careful handling of dynamic memory allocation within stb usage, and memory safety tools during development.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Out-of-Bounds Read](./attack_tree_paths/5___high-risk_path__out-of-bounds_read.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Reading memory outside the allocated buffer boundaries during stb processing. This can be triggered by crafted input files that cause stb to access data beyond the intended buffer limits, for example, when accessing pixel data or font glyph information.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive data from memory), application crash, or potentially leading to further exploitation if the out-of-bounds read influences program control flow.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Thorough bounds checking in stb code paths, careful index and pointer arithmetic, and memory safety tools to detect out-of-bounds accesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6__denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting stb's processing logic to consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory) leading to application slowdown or unavailability.
    *   **CPU Exhaustion:** Providing malicious image or font files with high computational complexity that force stb to perform extensive processing, consuming excessive CPU time and potentially starving other application components. Example: Complex image compression algorithms or intricate font rendering instructions.
    *   **Memory Exhaustion:** Providing malicious image or font files that require stb to allocate excessive amounts of memory, potentially exhausting available memory and causing application crashes or system instability. Example: Very large images or image formats that lead to uncontrolled memory growth during decoding.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, degraded performance.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Input size limits (file size, image dimensions, font sizes), resource quotas for stb processing, timeouts for stb operations, and monitoring resource usage to detect and respond to DoS attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Specific stb Modules Used [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/7___high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_specific_stb_modules_used__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting known or zero-day vulnerabilities within specific stb modules, particularly `stb_image.h` and `stb_truetype.h`, which handle complex parsing and decoding of image and font formats.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] stb_image.h Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the image format decoders in `stb_image.h` (PNG, JPG, BMP, etc.).
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Format-Specific Vulnerabilities (PNG, JPG, BMP, etc.):** Targeting known or zero-day vulnerabilities specific to the decoding logic of individual image formats within `stb_image.h`. Example: Exploiting a PNG chunk parsing vulnerability.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] General Image Decoding Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting general logic errors or vulnerabilities in the overall image decoding process within `stb_image.h`, regardless of the specific format.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] stb_truetype.h Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the font parsing and rasterization logic in `stb_truetype.h`.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Font Parsing Vulnerabilities:** Targeting vulnerabilities in the logic that parses TrueType font files, potentially exploiting errors in handling font tables, glyph data, or other font structures.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Rasterization Vulnerabilities:** Targeting vulnerabilities in the font rasterization algorithms within `stb_truetype.h`, potentially exploiting errors in converting font glyph outlines into bitmaps.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, application crash, denial of service, information disclosure (depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Staying informed about known vulnerabilities in stb and underlying image/font formats, applying patches if available (though less common for single-file libraries, but consider updates if using a modified version), using static analysis tools to scan for vulnerabilities, and robust input validation and sanitization for image and font files.
