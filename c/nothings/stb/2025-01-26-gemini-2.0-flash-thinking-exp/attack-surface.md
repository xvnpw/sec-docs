# Attack Surface Analysis for nothings/stb

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** Writing data beyond the allocated memory buffer.
    *   **stb Contribution:** `stb`'s C implementation and manual memory management can lead to buffer overflows due to insufficient bounds checking during operations like image decoding or font parsing.
    *   **Example:** Processing a maliciously crafted PNG image with a header declaring an extremely large width, causing `stb_image` to allocate a buffer based on this width. If bounds checks are inadequate during pixel data processing, `stb_image` might write beyond the allocated buffer.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, program crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow overwrites critical data or code pointers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate image dimensions, font sizes, and other input parameters before using `stb` functions. Enforce reasonable limits.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Limit the maximum size of images and fonts processed by the application to prevent excessively large inputs that could trigger overflows.
        *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Employ memory safety tools like AddressSanitizer or MemorySanitizer during development and testing to detect buffer overflows.
        *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of the application's integration with `stb`, paying close attention to memory handling and potential overflow points.
        *   **Compiler Security Features:** Enable compiler-level security features such as stack canaries and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to mitigate exploitability of buffer overflows.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflow](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** Arithmetic operations resulting in a value exceeding the maximum representable value for the data type, leading to unexpected wrapping or truncation.
    *   **stb Contribution:** `stb` performs calculations involving image dimensions, font sizes, and other parameters. Integer overflows in these calculations can result in undersized buffer allocations, subsequently leading to buffer overflows.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides an image file with width and height values that, when multiplied, cause an integer overflow. `stb_image` might allocate a buffer based on the overflowed (smaller) result. During image decoding, it will then write beyond this undersized buffer.
    *   **Impact:** Undersized buffer allocation leading to buffer overflows, memory corruption, program crash, potential for code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate image dimensions, font sizes, and other input parameters to ensure they are within safe ranges and will not cause integer overflows during calculations.
        *   **Safe Integer Arithmetic:** Utilize safe integer arithmetic functions or libraries that check for overflows before performing operations, or implement manual overflow checks in the application code.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Limit the maximum dimensions and sizes of input data to prevent excessively large values that could contribute to overflows.
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review code that performs calculations with input parameters, especially those related to buffer sizes, to identify potential integer overflow vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Heap Corruption (Use-After-Free, Double-Free)](./attack_surfaces/heap_corruption__use-after-free__double-free_.md)

*   **Description:** Errors in dynamic memory management leading to corruption of the heap. Use-after-free occurs when memory is accessed after it has been freed, and double-free occurs when memory is freed multiple times.
    *   **stb Contribution:** Memory management errors within `stb`'s internal operations, such as incorrect freeing of allocated memory or accessing memory after it has been freed, can corrupt the heap.
    *   **Example:** A bug in `stb_truetype`'s font parsing logic could cause it to free a memory buffer containing glyph data prematurely, and then later attempt to access that freed memory location when rendering text.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, program crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if heap metadata is corrupted in an exploitable way.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Utilize memory safety tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) during development and testing to detect use-after-free and double-free vulnerabilities.
        *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of `stb` integration, focusing on memory allocation and deallocation patterns, particularly in error handling paths and complex parsing routines.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `stb` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes, including those related to memory management.
        *   **Sandboxing:** If processing untrusted input, consider running `stb` within a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of heap corruption vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious input designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) causing the application to become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **stb Contribution:** Processing specially crafted images or fonts with complex or highly compressed data can lead to excessive CPU usage or memory allocation within `stb`, resulting in a DoS.
    *   **Example:** A crafted TIFF image with a deeply nested and highly compressed structure could cause `stb_image` to consume excessive CPU time and memory attempting to decompress and parse the image, leading to application unresponsiveness.
    *   **Impact:** Application unresponsiveness, service disruption, potential server downtime.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement strict timeouts for image and font processing operations. Limit the maximum file size, image dimensions, and font complexity that the application will process.
        *   **Input Validation:** Perform robust validation on input files to reject obviously malformed, excessively large, or overly complex files before passing them to `stb`.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on requests that involve processing images or fonts to prevent attackers from overwhelming the system with malicious requests.
        *   **Process Isolation:** Run `stb` processing in a separate process with resource limits enforced by the operating system to contain resource exhaustion and prevent it from impacting the main application.
