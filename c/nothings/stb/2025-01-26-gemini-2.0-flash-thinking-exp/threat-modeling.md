# Threat Model Analysis for nothings/stb

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Image Parsing](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_image_parsing.md)

Description: An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPG, BMP) to the web application. This file is specifically designed to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability within the image decoding functions of `stb_image.h`. By carefully crafting the image data, the attacker can cause `stb_image.h` to write data beyond the allocated buffer boundaries during parsing.
*   Impact:
    *   Code Execution: Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to overwrite critical memory regions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This is the most severe outcome.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Buffer overflows can also cause application crashes, resulting in a denial of service.
    *   Data Corruption: Overwritten memory can corrupt application data or internal structures, leading to unpredictable and potentially exploitable behavior.
*   Affected STB Component: `stb_image.h` (specifically image decoding functions like `stbi_load`, `stbi_load_from_memory`, and format-specific decoding routines).
*   Risk Severity: **Critical**
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Strict Input Validation: Implement robust input validation *before* passing image files to `stb_image.h`. This should include checks on file headers, file sizes, and potentially using safer image processing methods for initial validation.
    *   Memory Limits and Resource Management: Enforce strict memory limits on image processing operations to prevent excessive memory allocation and potential overflow exploitation.
    *   Sandboxing and Process Isolation: Run image processing operations in a sandboxed environment or isolated process to limit the potential damage if a buffer overflow is exploited.
    *   Regular Monitoring and Updates: Although direct patching of `stb` might be necessary, monitor for any reported security vulnerabilities related to `stb_image.h` and consider updating to newer versions or applying patches if available.
    *   Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP): Ensure that ASLR and DEP are enabled on the server operating system to make exploitation more difficult, although they are not foolproof mitigations.
    *   Consider Memory-Safe Language Wrappers: If feasible, consider wrapping the usage of `stb_image.h` in a memory-safe language (like Rust or Go) to add a layer of protection against memory-related vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow leading to Buffer Overflow in Font Rendering](./threats/integer_overflow_leading_to_buffer_overflow_in_font_rendering.md)

Description: An attacker provides a maliciously crafted font file (e.g., TrueType, OpenType) to the application. This font file is designed to trigger an integer overflow vulnerability in `stb_truetype.h` during font loading or rasterization. The overflow typically occurs when calculating buffer sizes or offsets based on font metrics. This integer overflow can then lead to the allocation of an undersized buffer, which is subsequently overflowed when data is written into it.
*   Impact:
    *   Code Execution: Similar to image buffer overflows, exploiting an integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow in font rendering can potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Crashes due to memory corruption or unexpected program behavior are a likely outcome.
    *   Incorrect or Corrupted Rendering: Font rendering may fail or produce corrupted output, which could impact application functionality or user experience, although this is a less severe impact compared to code execution or DoS.
*   Affected STB Component: `stb_truetype.h` (specifically functions related to font loading, glyph rasterization, and font metric calculations like `stbtt_BakeFontBitmap`, `stbtt_GetCodepointBitmap`, `stbtt_GetFontVMetrics`).
*   Risk Severity: **High**
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Font File Validation: Implement validation of font files before processing. This should include checks on file headers and potentially using font validation tools to detect malformed or suspicious font files.
    *   Size and Complexity Limits: Impose limits on font file sizes and the complexity of font structures to reduce the likelihood of triggering integer overflows during processing.
    *   Memory Limits and Resource Management: Limit the amount of memory allocated for font processing operations.
    *   Sandboxing and Process Isolation: Isolate font rendering processes to contain the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Regular Monitoring and Updates: Monitor for any reported security issues related to `stb_truetype.h` and consider updating or patching if necessary.
    *   Careful Code Review and Auditing: Conduct thorough code reviews of the application's font rendering logic, paying close attention to how font metrics are handled and how buffers are allocated and used in conjunction with `stb_truetype.h`.
    *   Memory Sanitizers during Development: Utilize memory sanitizers like AddressSanitizer (ASan) during development and testing to detect integer overflows and buffer overflows early in the development cycle.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free or Double-Free in Memory Management within `stb`](./threats/use-after-free_or_double-free_in_memory_management_within__stb_.md)

Description: Due to potential programming errors in `stb`'s C code, use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities might exist. An attacker could craft specific input files or trigger certain application states that expose these memory management errors within the `stb` library. These vulnerabilities arise from incorrect handling of dynamically allocated memory within `stb`.
*   Impact:
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Application crashes are a common consequence of use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities due to memory corruption.
    *   Code Execution (Potentially): In certain scenarios, particularly with use-after-free vulnerabilities, attackers might be able to manipulate memory to achieve arbitrary code execution. This is often more complex to exploit but represents a critical risk.
*   Affected STB Component: Potentially any `stb` library, as these are general memory management issues that can occur in C code and are not specific to a particular module within `stb`.
*   Risk Severity: **High**
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Memory Sanitizers (Development and Testing): Employ memory sanitizers like AddressSanitizer (ASan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan) during development and testing phases to proactively detect use-after-free and double-free errors.
    *   Thorough Code Auditing: Conduct in-depth code audits of the application's usage of `stb` and, if feasible, review the relevant parts of `stb`'s source code to identify potential memory management flaws.
    *   Static Analysis Tools: Utilize static analysis tools to automatically detect potential memory management vulnerabilities in the application code and potentially within `stb` itself.
    *   Sandboxing and Process Isolation: Isolate media processing operations to limit the scope of damage if a memory corruption vulnerability is exploited.
    *   Regular Monitoring and Updates: Stay informed about any reported security issues or updates related to `stb` and consider applying patches or updates if they become available.
    *   Careful Memory Management Practices in Application Code: Ensure that the application code that interacts with `stb` also follows secure memory management practices to avoid introducing additional memory-related vulnerabilities.
