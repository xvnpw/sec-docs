# Threat Model Analysis for nothings/stb

## Threat: [Heap Buffer Overflow in `stb_image`](./threats/heap_buffer_overflow_in__stb_image_.md)

*   **Threat:** Heap Buffer Overflow in `stb_image`

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., PNG, JPG, BMP) with specially designed header information or compressed data. When `stb_image.h` attempts to load and decode this image, it writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap due to an integer overflow or incorrect size calculation.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). The attacker could overwrite critical data structures or function pointers, leading to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
        *   Data corruption, leading to application crashes or unpredictable behavior.
    *   **Affected `stb` Component:** `stb_image.h`, specifically functions like `stbi_load`, `stbi_load_from_memory`, and related image decoding functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Before calling any `stbi_load*` function, rigorously validate the image dimensions (width, height, number of channels) and file size. Reject images that exceed predefined limits.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing tools (e.g., AFL, libFuzzer) to test `stb_image` with a wide variety of malformed image files. This is *crucial* for finding subtle vulnerabilities.
        *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Compile and run the application with AddressSanitizer (ASan) enabled to detect heap buffer overflows at runtime.
        *   **Upstream Updates:** Regularly update to the latest version of `stb_image.h` to incorporate any bug fixes or security patches.
        *   **Limit Allocation Size:** Implement a wrapper around memory allocation functions (e.g., `malloc`, `realloc`) used by `stb_image` to enforce a maximum allocation size.

## Threat: [Stack Buffer Overflow in `stb_truetype`](./threats/stack_buffer_overflow_in__stb_truetype_.md)

*   **Threat:** Stack Buffer Overflow in `stb_truetype`

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted TrueType font file (.ttf) with malicious data in specific font tables (e.g., `glyf`, `loca`). When `stb_truetype.h` parses these tables, it might write data beyond the bounds of a stack-allocated buffer.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE), although stack overflows are often harder to exploit than heap overflows.
        *   Application crashes.
    *   **Affected `stb` Component:** `stb_truetype.h`, specifically functions related to parsing font tables and glyph data, such as `stbtt_GetGlyphShape`, `stbtt_GetFontOffsetForIndex`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the font file size and check for obviously malformed header data before processing.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz `stb_truetype` with a variety of corrupted font files.
        *   **Stack Canaries:** Compile the application with stack canaries (e.g., `-fstack-protector-all` in GCC/Clang) to detect stack buffer overflows.
        *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Use ASan to detect stack overflows during runtime.
        *   **Upstream Updates:** Keep `stb_truetype.h` updated.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow Leading to Heap Buffer Overflow in `stb_vorbis`](./threats/integer_overflow_leading_to_heap_buffer_overflow_in__stb_vorbis_.md)

*   **Threat:** Integer Overflow Leading to Heap Buffer Overflow in `stb_vorbis`

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Ogg Vorbis audio file (.ogg) with manipulated header data or frame sizes.  An integer overflow occurs during calculations within `stb_vorbis.c`, leading to an undersized buffer allocation.  Subsequent decoding operations then write beyond the bounds of this buffer.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        *   Application crashes or data corruption.
    *   **Affected `stb` Component:** `stb_vorbis.c`, specifically functions involved in decoding Ogg Vorbis data, such as `stb_vorbis_decode_frame_pushdata`, `stb_vorbis_decode_memory`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the Ogg Vorbis file size and check for inconsistencies in header data.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz `stb_vorbis` with a wide range of malformed Ogg Vorbis files.
        *   **Safe Integer Arithmetic:** Use techniques to detect and prevent integer overflows.  This could involve using larger integer types, checking for overflow conditions before performing arithmetic operations, or using a safe integer library.
        *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Use ASan.
        *   **Upstream Updates:** Keep `stb_vorbis.c` updated.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free in `stb_vorbis` (Error Handling)](./threats/use-after-free_in__stb_vorbis___error_handling_.md)

*   **Threat:** Use-After-Free in `stb_vorbis` (Error Handling)

    *   **Description:**  An error occurs during Ogg Vorbis decoding (e.g., due to a malformed file).  If the error handling in `stb_vorbis.c` is not perfectly implemented, a pointer to a previously freed memory block might be used, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) or application crashes.
    *   **Affected `stb` Component:** `stb_vorbis.c`, specifically the error handling paths within decoding functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz `stb_vorbis` with malformed Ogg Vorbis files to trigger various error conditions.
        *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Use Valgrind Memcheck or ASan to detect use-after-free errors.
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review the error handling code in `stb_vorbis.c` to ensure that memory is properly managed and that freed pointers are not reused.
        *   **Upstream Updates:** Keep `stb_vorbis.c` updated.
