## Attack Tree Path: [`stb_image.h`](./attack_tree_paths/_stb_image_h_.md)

*   **1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   The most severe outcome, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

    *   **1.1 Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL]**
        *   A fundamental vulnerability where data written to a buffer exceeds its allocated size, overwriting adjacent memory.

        *   **1.1.1 Heap Overflow (during image decoding) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   Occurs on the heap (dynamically allocated memory).

            *   **1.1.1.1 Crafted image with excessively large dimensions. [CRITICAL]**
                *   Attacker provides an image with dimensions (width * height * channels) that, when multiplied, result in a memory allocation request larger than available or intended, potentially leading to a buffer overflow when the (smaller) allocated buffer is written to.
                *   *Example:* An image claiming to be 100,000 x 100,000 pixels with 4 channels (RGBA) would require a massive amount of memory.

            *   **1.1.1.2 Crafted image with invalid compressed data (e.g., zlib, PNG chunks). [CRITICAL]**
                *   Attacker provides an image with deliberately corrupted compressed data.  When `stb_image` attempts to decompress this data, it might write more data than expected to the output buffer, causing a heap overflow.  This exploits vulnerabilities in the decompression algorithms.
                *   *Example:*  A PNG image with a malformed IDAT chunk that, when decompressed, produces more data than indicated in the chunk header.

        *   **1.1.3 Integer Overflow leading to Buffer Overflow [HIGH RISK]**
            *   An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be represented by the data type.

            *   **1.1.3.1 Crafted image with dimensions that cause integer overflows. [CRITICAL]**
                *   Attacker provides image dimensions that, when used in calculations (e.g., `width * height * channels`), cause an integer overflow.  This results in a smaller-than-expected memory allocation, leading to a buffer overflow when the image data is decoded.
                *   *Example:*  If `width`, `height`, and `channels` are large `int` values, their product might wrap around to a small positive number due to integer overflow.

    *   **1.3 Out-of-bounds Write [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Writing data outside the boundaries of an allocated memory region.

        *   **1.3.1 Crafted image with corrupted data that causes writes outside allocated memory. [CRITICAL]**
            *   Attacker provides an image with corrupted data that, due to errors in the parsing logic, causes `stb_image` to write data *before* the start or *after* the end of the allocated image buffer. This can overwrite critical data structures or code pointers.
            *   *Example:*  A malformed JPEG image where the Huffman table decoding logic is tricked into writing data outside the intended buffer.

*   **2. Denial of Service (DoS)**

    *   **2.1 Excessive Memory Allocation [CRITICAL]**
        *   Forcing the application to allocate an unreasonable amount of memory.
        *   **2.1.1 Crafted image with extremely large dimensions.**
            *   Similar to 1.1.1.1, but the goal is to exhaust memory, not necessarily to achieve RCE.

    *   **2.3 Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL]**
        *   Depleting system resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
        *   **2.3.1 Repeatedly sending large or complex images.**
            *   A simple but effective attack where the attacker repeatedly sends requests to the application, each containing a large or computationally expensive image.

## Attack Tree Path: [`stb_truetype.h`](./attack_tree_paths/_stb_truetype_h_.md)

*   **1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   The most severe outcome, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

    *   **1.1 Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL]**
        *   A fundamental vulnerability where data written to a buffer exceeds its allocated size.

        *   **1.1.1 Heap Overflow (during font parsing or rendering) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   Occurs on the heap.

            *   **1.1.1.1 Crafted font with excessively large glyph data. [CRITICAL]**
                *   Attacker provides a font file where the data describing a glyph (its shape) is excessively large, leading to a large memory allocation.  If the allocation is larger than expected or if there are errors in handling this large data, a buffer overflow can occur.
                *   *Example:* A TrueType font with a 'glyf' table entry containing a glyph with an extremely complex outline, requiring a huge amount of memory to store.

            *   **1.1.1.2 Crafted font with invalid table entries (e.g., 'glyf', 'loca', 'head'). [CRITICAL]**
                *   TrueType fonts are structured into tables (e.g., 'glyf' for glyph data, 'loca' for glyph locations, 'head' for header information).  The attacker provides a font with deliberately corrupted or invalid table entries.  This can cause `stb_truetype` to miscalculate buffer sizes or access memory incorrectly, leading to a buffer overflow.
                *   *Example:* A font with a 'loca' table that contains incorrect offsets, causing `stb_truetype` to read or write data outside the bounds of the 'glyf' table.

        *   **1.1.3 Integer Overflow leading to Buffer Overflow [HIGH RISK]**
            *   An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value too large to be represented.

            *   **1.1.3.1 Crafted font with table sizes or offsets that cause integer overflows. [CRITICAL]**
                *   Attacker provides a font where the sizes or offsets of tables within the font file are manipulated to cause integer overflows during calculations. This leads to incorrect memory allocation and subsequent buffer overflows.
                *   *Example:*  A font with a 'maxp' table (maximum profile) that specifies a very large number of glyphs, which, when multiplied by other values, causes an integer overflow.

    *   **1.3 Out-of-bounds Write [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Writing data outside the boundaries of an allocated memory region.

        *   **1.3.1 Crafted font with corrupted data causing writes outside allocated memory. [CRITICAL]**
            *   Attacker provides a font with corrupted data that, due to errors in the parsing logic (especially within specific table parsers like 'cmap' or 'hmtx'), causes `stb_truetype` to write data outside the allocated buffer.
            *   *Example:* A malformed 'cmap' table (character map) that causes incorrect indexing into the glyph data, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

*   **2. Denial of Service (DoS)**

    *   **2.1 Excessive Memory Allocation [CRITICAL]**
        *   Forcing the application to allocate an unreasonable amount of memory.
        *   **2.1.1 Crafted font with extremely large glyphs or a large number of glyphs.**
            *   Similar to 1.1.1.1, but the goal is to exhaust memory.

    *   **2.3 Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL]**
        *   Depleting system resources.
        *   **2.3.1 Repeatedly sending large or complex fonts.**
            *   Repeatedly sending requests with large or computationally expensive fonts.
