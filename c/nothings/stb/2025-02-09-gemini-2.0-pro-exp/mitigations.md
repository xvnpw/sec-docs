# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nothings/stb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Automated Version Tracking and Update Procedure](./mitigation_strategies/automated_version_tracking_and_update_procedure.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Version Tracking File:** Create a plain text file (e.g., `stb_versions.txt`).
2.  **Record Versions:**  For each `stb` library, add a line to `stb_versions.txt`:  `library_name: commit_hash` (e.g., `stb_image.h: a1b2c3d4e5f6...`). Get the commit hash from GitHub.  If the `stb` header has a version string, use that.
3.  **Update Script (Optional but Recommended):** Create a script that:
    *   Reads `stb_versions.txt`.
    *   Fetches the latest commit hash (or tag) from the `stb` GitHub repository (using the GitHub API or cloning).
    *   Compares current and latest versions.
    *   If newer, prints a warning or sends a notification.
4.  **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate the script (or a manual check) into your CI/CD pipeline. Run it regularly (e.g., weekly).
5.  **Manual Update Process:** When an update is found:
    *   Download the new header file from the *official* GitHub repository.
    *   Replace the existing header file.
    *   Update `stb_versions.txt` with the new commit hash.
    *   Recompile the application.
    *   Run *full* regression tests.
    *   Commit the changes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Outdated Libraries with Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: High to Critical):** Using an old version with a public vulnerability.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Severity: Critical):** Updates can fix unknown vulnerabilities.
    *   **Subtle Bugs Affecting Security (Severity: Medium to High):** Bugs that indirectly create security issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Outdated Libraries:**  Reduces risk significantly (High impact).
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:**  Reduces risk moderately (Medium impact).
    *   **Subtle Bugs:**  Reduces risk slightly (Low to Medium impact).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Specifically Before `stb` Calls)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization__specifically_before__stb__calls_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Input Points:** Find all points where external data is passed to `stb` functions.
2.  **Define Maximum Sizes:** Calculate the *absolute maximum* input size based on the expected data format (e.g., image dimensions, color depth). Add a safety margin.
3.  **Pre-Validation Checks:** *Before* calling *any* `stb` function:
    *   **Size Check:** Verify the input size (in bytes) is <= the calculated maximum. Reject if it exceeds.
    *   **Format-Specific Checks:**
        *   **Images (`stb_image`):** Read the image header *manually* (without `stb_image`) and check:
            *   Magic number (e.g., PNG signature).
            *   Reported width and height (compare to your maximum).
            *   Color depth and channel count.
        *   **Fonts (`stb_truetype`):** Read the font header and check:
            *   'magic' number.
            *   Sanity check table offsets and sizes.
        *   **Other Libraries:** Apply similar checks based on data type.
    *   **Reject Invalid Input:** If *any* check fails, reject the input *immediately*. Do *not* call the `stb` function. Log the rejection.
4.  **Wrapper Functions (Recommended):** Create wrapper functions around `stb` calls to encapsulate these checks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Buffer Overflows (Severity: Critical):** Oversized input causing writes beyond allocated buffers.
    *   **Integer Overflows (Severity: High to Critical):** Malformed input causing incorrect calculations.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium to High):** Malformed input causing excessive resource use.
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Variable):** Unexpected input triggering logic errors within `stb`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Buffer Overflows:** Reduces risk dramatically (Very High impact).
    *   **Integer Overflows:** Reduces risk significantly (High impact).
    *   **DoS:** Reduces risk considerably (Medium to High impact).
    *   **Logic Errors:** Reduces risk moderately (Medium impact).

## Mitigation Strategy: [`stb` Specific Error Handling and Memory Management (Within Wrappers)](./mitigation_strategies/_stb__specific_error_handling_and_memory_management__within_wrappers_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Wrapper Functions:** Create wrapper functions around *all* `stb` calls.  This is *crucial* for this strategy.
2.  **Error Checking:** Inside the wrappers, *always* check the return value of the `stb` function. Understand the success/failure convention for each function.
3.  **Consistent Error Handling:** If an error is detected:
    *   Log the error (including the `stb` function and any error info).
    *   Return an appropriate error code.
    *   *Do not* continue processing potentially corrupted data.
    *   Consider a global error handling mechanism.
4. **Memory Allocation Awareness:** If using custom memory allocators with `STB_*_MALLOC`, `STB_*_REALLOC`, and `STB_*_FREE`, ensure they are correct and thoroughly tested. If *not* using custom allocators, be aware of the default allocation behavior of the `stb` library and ensure it's compatible with your application.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Use-After-Free (Severity: Critical):** Using freed memory.
    *   **Double-Free (Severity: Critical):** Freeing the same memory twice.
    *   **Memory Leaks (Severity: Medium to High):** Exhausting memory.
    *   **Null Pointer Dereference (Severity: High):** Accessing memory through a null pointer (often returned by `stb` on error).
    *   **Uninitialized Memory Access (Severity: High):** Reading from uninitialized memory.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Use-After-Free, Double-Free, Null Pointer Dereference:** Reduces risk significantly (High impact) *if dynamic analysis is also used*. The wrapper itself helps with consistent handling.
    *   **Memory Leaks:** Reduces risk moderately (Medium impact).
    *   **Uninitialized Memory Access:** Reduces risk (Medium impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Placeholder* ]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Placeholder* ]

## Mitigation Strategy: [`stb` Configuration via Preprocessor Defines](./mitigation_strategies/_stb__configuration_via_preprocessor_defines.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Minimal Feature Set:** Examine the preprocessor defines for each `stb` library. Disable *any* features you don't need.  For example, disable support for unused image formats in `stb_image.h`.
2.  **Review Defines:** Carefully review *all* preprocessor defines used with `stb` libraries. Understand their purpose and ensure they are set correctly. Avoid enabling experimental features.
3. **Documentation:** Document the chosen configuration (enabled/disabled features, preprocessor defines) in comments or a separate configuration file.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Unused Code (Severity: Variable):** Disabling unused features reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Misconfiguration (Severity: Variable):** Incorrect defines can lead to unexpected behavior or disable security features.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Unused Code:** Reduces risk moderately (Medium impact).
    *   **Misconfiguration:** Reduces risk (Medium impact).

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Placeholder* ]
