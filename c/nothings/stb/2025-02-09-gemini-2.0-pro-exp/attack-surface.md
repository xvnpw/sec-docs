# Attack Surface Analysis for nothings/stb

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption (Buffer Overflows, Use-After-Free, etc.)](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption__buffer_overflows__use-after-free__etc__.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from incorrect memory handling, allowing attackers to overwrite memory regions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **`stb` Contribution:**  `stb` libraries are written in C, which lacks built-in memory safety.  Manual memory management and pointer arithmetic are common, increasing the risk of these errors.  Parsing complex data formats (images, fonts, audio) is particularly risky.
    *   **Example:**  A maliciously crafted PNG image with an oversized width/height value causes `stb_image.h` to allocate an insufficient buffer.  Subsequent image data writes overflow this buffer, overwriting adjacent memory.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fuzzing:**  Extensive fuzz testing with tools like AFL, libFuzzer, or Honggfuzz to identify input that triggers memory corruption.
        *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (Clang Static Analyzer, Coverity) to detect potential memory errors during development.
        *   **Memory Sanitizers:**  Compile and run with AddressSanitizer (ASan), MemorySanitizer (MSan), and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan) to catch errors at runtime.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Rigorously validate all input dimensions, sizes, and formats *before* passing data to `stb` functions.  Implement strict size limits.
        *   **Code Review:**  Carefully review code that interacts with `stb` libraries, focusing on memory allocation, deallocation, and pointer arithmetic.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflows](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflows.md)

*   **Description:**  Arithmetic operations on integer values that result in a value exceeding the maximum (or minimum) representable value for the integer type, leading to unexpected behavior and potential memory corruption.
    *   **`stb` Contribution:**  `stb` libraries often perform calculations related to data sizes, buffer offsets, and other parameters.  These calculations can be vulnerable to integer overflows if input values are maliciously crafted.
    *   **Example:**  In `stb_rect_pack.h`, providing extremely large rectangle dimensions could cause an integer overflow during the packing calculations, leading to incorrect memory allocation and a potential buffer overflow.
    *   **Impact:**  Memory corruption, denial of service, potentially arbitrary code execution (depending on how the overflowed value is used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly limit input values to reasonable ranges.  Reject excessively large or small values.
        *   **Overflow Checks:**  Use safer integer arithmetic libraries or techniques that explicitly check for overflow conditions (e.g., using `__builtin_add_overflow` in GCC/Clang).
        *   **Fuzzing:**  Fuzz testing can help identify integer overflow vulnerabilities.
        *   **Static Analysis:**  Static analysis tools can often detect potential integer overflow issues.

## Attack Surface: [Undefined Behavior](./attack_surfaces/undefined_behavior.md)

*   **Description:** C language has many cases of undefined behavior. Undefined behavior can lead to unexpected program behavior, including security vulnerabilities.
    *   **`stb` Contribution:** `stb` libraries are written in C.
    *   **Example:** Shift operation with negative value.
    *   **Impact:**  Application unavailability, service disruption, arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to detect potential undefined behavior issues.
        *   **Compiler warnings:** Enable all compiler warnings and treat warnings as errors.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzzing can help identify undefined behavior.
