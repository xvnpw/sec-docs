# Threat Model Analysis for nothings/stb

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Image Decoding](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_image_decoding.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file with dimensions or data exceeding the expected buffer size during decoding within `stb_image`. The library attempts to write beyond the allocated memory, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions.

**Impact:** Memory corruption can lead to application crashes, unexpected behavior, or, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten memory.

**Affected Component:** `stb_image.h` (specifically image loading/decoding functions like `stbi_load`, `stbi_load_from_memory`, etc.)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Image Dimension Handling](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_image_dimension_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides an image file with extremely large or negative values for image width, height, or other size-related parameters. This can cause integer overflows or underflows within `stb_image`, leading to incorrect memory allocation sizes and subsequent buffer overflows during decoding.

**Impact:** Can lead to buffer overflows, heap corruption, application crashes, and potentially remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** `stb_image.h` (specifically the part of the decoding process that parses image headers and calculates memory requirements).

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Out-of-Bounds Read in Image Decoding](./threats/out-of-bounds_read_in_image_decoding.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a crafted image file that causes `stb_image` to attempt to read data from memory locations outside the allocated buffer for the image due to incorrect index calculations or boundary checks during the decoding process within the library.

**Impact:** Can lead to application crashes or, in some cases, the disclosure of sensitive information from the application's memory.

**Affected Component:** `stb_image.h` (the image data processing and decoding functions).

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Audio Decoding](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_audio_decoding.md)

**Description:** A malicious audio file with excessive data or manipulated headers can cause buffer overflows when processed by `stb_vorbis.c` or other audio decoding components within the `stb` library.

**Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected behavior, potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** `stb_vorbis.c`, `stb_truetype.h` (if processing font data as audio-like streams), or other relevant audio decoding components within `stb`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Specific `stb` Sub-libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_specific_`stb`_sub-libraries.md)

**Description:** Individual sub-libraries within `stb` (e.g., `stb_truetype.h` for font rendering, `stb_rect_pack.h` for rectangle packing) might contain specific vulnerabilities related to their functionality. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing malicious input tailored to that specific component.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, ranging from crashes to potential code execution.

**Affected Component:** Specific `stb` header files and their associated functions (e.g., functions within `stb_truetype.h`).

**Risk Severity:** Can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on `stb`](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_`stb`.md)

**Description:** If the source code hosted on GitHub or the distribution mechanism for `stb` were compromised, a malicious version of `stb` could be introduced. If the application uses this compromised version, it could be vulnerable to various attacks.

**Impact:** Potentially complete compromise of the application, depending on the nature of the malicious code injected into `stb`.

**Affected Component:** All components of `stb`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical
