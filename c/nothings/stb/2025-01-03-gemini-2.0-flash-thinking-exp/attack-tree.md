## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Processing Vulnerabilities -> Provide Malicious Image File -> Trigger Buffer Overflow](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_processing_vulnerabilities_-_provide_malicious_image_file_-_trigger_buffer_overflow.md)

* Attack Vector: Providing a crafted image file designed to cause a buffer overflow during processing by `stb_image`.
* Critical Nodes within this path:
    * Exploit Integer Overflow Leading to Small Buffer Allocation:
        * Description: The attacker crafts an image header where integer values representing dimensions or other size parameters are close to the maximum integer value. This causes an integer overflow during memory allocation calculations, resulting in a smaller-than-expected buffer being allocated. When the image data is copied into this undersized buffer, a buffer overflow occurs.
    * Provide Image with Exceedingly Large Dimensions:
        * Description: The attacker provides an image file with extremely large dimension values in its header. If `stb_image` attempts to allocate memory based on these large dimensions without proper bounds checking, it can lead to an allocation of an unexpectedly large buffer (potentially causing resource exhaustion) or, more critically, an integer overflow during size calculations leading to a smaller buffer and subsequent overflow.
    * Provide Image with Excessive Color Channels or Components:
        * Description: Similar to large dimensions, manipulating the number of color channels or components in the image header can lead to integer overflows during buffer size calculations, resulting in buffer overflows during data processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Processing Vulnerabilities -> Provide Malicious Image File -> Trigger Heap Overflow](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_processing_vulnerabilities_-_provide_malicious_image_file_-_trigger_heap_overflow.md)

* Attack Vector: Providing a crafted image file designed to cause a heap overflow during processing by `stb_image`.
* Critical Nodes within this path:
    * Craft Image with Specific Header Values to Cause Out-of-Bounds Write:
        * Description: The attacker carefully crafts specific values within the image header that, when processed by `stb_image`, cause the library to write data beyond the boundaries of an allocated heap buffer. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially leading to code execution.
    * Exploit Vulnerability in Memory Allocation within stb_image:
        * Description: This involves exploiting a specific flaw within the memory allocation routines or logic of `stb_image`. This could be a double-free, use-after-free, or another type of memory management error that an attacker can trigger through a specially crafted image.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Processing Vulnerabilities -> Provide Malicious Image File -> Exploit Format-Specific Vulnerabilities (e.g., PNG, JPG, BMP)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_processing_vulnerabilities_-_provide_malicious_image_file_-_exploit_format-specific_vulnerabilities_(e.g.,_png,_jpg,_bmp).md)

* Attack Vector: Providing a crafted image file that exploits a known or novel vulnerability specific to the image format being processed by `stb_image`.
* Critical Nodes within this path:
    * Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in the Specific Image Format Parser within stb_image:
        * Description: The attacker leverages publicly known vulnerabilities (e.g., from CVE databases) in the parsing logic for specific image formats (like PNG, JPG, BMP) as implemented within `stb_image`. This often involves crafting an image that triggers a specific parsing error leading to memory corruption or other exploitable conditions.
    * Craft Image Leveraging Undocumented or Edge-Case Features of the Format:
        * Description: This involves a more sophisticated attacker who has deep knowledge of the internal workings of a specific image format. They craft an image that utilizes undocumented features or edge cases in the format specification that are not handled correctly by `stb_image`, leading to exploitable behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Audio Processing Vulnerabilities -> Provide Malicious Audio File -> Trigger Buffer Overflow](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_audio_processing_vulnerabilities_-_provide_malicious_audio_file_-_trigger_buffer_overflow.md)

* Attack Vector: Providing a crafted audio file designed to cause a buffer overflow during processing by `stb_vorbis`.
* Critical Nodes within this path:
    * Exploit Integer Overflow Leading to Small Buffer Allocation:
        * Description: Similar to image processing, the attacker crafts an audio file header with integer values representing sample counts, channel counts, or other size parameters that cause an integer overflow during buffer allocation, leading to an undersized buffer and subsequent overflow.
    * Provide Audio with Exceedingly Large Number of Samples or Channels:
        * Description: Providing an audio file with an extremely high number of samples or channels in its header can lead to integer overflows during buffer size calculations, resulting in buffer overflows during data processing.
    * Provide Audio with Malformed Packet Sizes:
        * Description: The attacker crafts an audio file with malformed packet size information in its headers. When `stb_vorbis` attempts to read and process these packets based on the incorrect size, it can lead to buffer overflows or out-of-bounds reads/writes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Audio Processing Vulnerabilities -> Provide Malicious Audio File -> Trigger Heap Overflow](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_audio_processing_vulnerabilities_-_provide_malicious_audio_file_-_trigger_heap_overflow.md)

* Attack Vector: Providing a crafted audio file designed to cause a heap overflow during processing by `stb_vorbis`.
* Critical Nodes within this path:
    * Craft Audio with Specific Header Values to Cause Out-of-Bounds Write:
        * Description: The attacker carefully crafts specific values within the audio header that, when processed by `stb_vorbis`, cause the library to write data beyond the boundaries of an allocated heap buffer, potentially leading to code execution.
    * Exploit Vulnerability in Memory Allocation within stb_vorbis:
        * Description: This involves exploiting specific flaws within the memory allocation routines or logic of `stb_vorbis`, such as double-frees or use-after-frees, triggered by a specially crafted audio file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Audio Processing Vulnerabilities -> Provide Malicious Audio File -> Exploit Format-Specific Vulnerabilities (Ogg Vorbis)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_audio_processing_vulnerabilities_-_provide_malicious_audio_file_-_exploit_format-specific_vulnerabilities_(ogg_vorbis).md)

* Attack Vector: Providing a crafted audio file that exploits a known or novel vulnerability specific to the Ogg Vorbis format being processed by `stb_vorbis`.
* Critical Nodes within this path:
    * Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in the Ogg Vorbis Parser within stb_vorbis:
        * Description: The attacker leverages publicly known vulnerabilities in the parsing logic for the Ogg Vorbis format as implemented within `stb_vorbis`. This often involves crafting an audio file that triggers a specific parsing error leading to memory corruption or other exploitable conditions.
    * Craft Audio Leveraging Undocumented or Edge-Case Features of the Format:
        * Description: A sophisticated attacker with deep knowledge of the Ogg Vorbis format crafts an audio file that utilizes undocumented features or edge cases not handled correctly by `stb_vorbis`, leading to exploitable behavior.
