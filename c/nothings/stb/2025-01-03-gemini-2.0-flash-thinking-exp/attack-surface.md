# Attack Surface Analysis for nothings/stb

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflows](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflows.md)

**Description:** Occur when `stb` attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer during file parsing.

**How stb Contributes:** `stb`'s parsing logic for image and font formats might not sufficiently validate input data sizes, leading to insufficient buffer allocation and subsequent out-of-bounds writes.

**Example:** A crafted PNG image with an oversized header causes `stb_image.h` to write pixel data beyond the allocated buffer. A malformed TrueType font file with excessively long glyph data triggers an overflow in `stb_truetype.h`.

**Impact:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regular Updates:** Ensure the application uses the latest version of `stb` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches addressing buffer overflows.
* **Compiler Security Features:** Compile the application with stack canaries and address space layout randomization (ASLR) to make exploitation more difficult (though this doesn't prevent the overflow in `stb`).

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflows](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflows.md)

**Description:** Occur within `stb` when arithmetic operations on input data result in values exceeding the maximum representable value for the integer type, potentially leading to undersized buffer allocations.

**How stb Contributes:** `stb` performs calculations based on data read from image or font files (e.g., calculating buffer sizes). Maliciously large values in these files can cause integer overflows within `stb`'s internal calculations.

**Example:**  In `stb_image.h`, excessively large width and height values in an image header cause an integer overflow when calculating the required buffer size, leading to a smaller-than-needed buffer allocation.

**Impact:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regular Updates:** Keep `stb` updated to benefit from fixes for integer overflow vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Format-Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/format-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Bugs or oversights in `stb`'s parsing logic for specific features or malformed data within particular file formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG, TrueType).

**How stb Contributes:** `stb` is responsible for interpreting the specific syntax and semantics of various image and font file formats. Errors in this interpretation can lead to exploitable conditions.

**Example:** A vulnerability in `stb_image.h`'s handling of a specific PNG chunk type allows for injection of malicious data. A flaw in `stb_truetype.h`'s parsing of a specific font table allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regular Updates:** This is the primary mitigation. Stay up-to-date with `stb` releases to patch known format-specific vulnerabilities.
* **Fuzzing (Development Phase):** If you have control over the build process, consider using fuzzing tools to test `stb` against a wide range of malformed files to identify potential format-specific vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption (beyond buffer overflows)](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption_(beyond_buffer_overflows).md)

**Description:** Errors within `stb`'s code that lead to incorrect memory management, such as use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities.

**How stb Contributes:** Bugs in `stb`'s allocation or deallocation logic, or incorrect handling of memory pointers during file processing, can lead to memory corruption.

**Example:** A bug in `stb_vorbis.c` causes a memory buffer to be freed prematurely, and a subsequent attempt to access that buffer leads to a use-after-free.

**Impact:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regular Updates:**  Updating `stb` is crucial to address memory corruption vulnerabilities.
* **Memory Safety Tools (Development Phase):** During development, using memory safety tools like Valgrind or AddressSanitizer can help identify memory management errors within `stb`'s usage.
