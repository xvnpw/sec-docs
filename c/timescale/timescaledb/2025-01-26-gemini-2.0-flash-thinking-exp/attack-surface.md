# Attack Surface Analysis for timescale/timescaledb

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via TimescaleDB Functions](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_timescaledb_functions.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in user input sanitization when using TimescaleDB-specific SQL functions, leading to malicious SQL code execution.
*   **TimescaleDB Contribution:** TimescaleDB introduces new functions (e.g., `time_bucket`, `create_hypertable`) that, if used in dynamically constructed queries with unsanitized user input, can become injection points.
*   **Example:** A web application allows users to specify a time interval for data aggregation. If the application directly uses this user-provided interval in a `time_bucket` function within a SQL query without validation, an attacker could input malicious SQL code instead of a valid interval, potentially executing arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, unauthorized access, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements): Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions, especially when user input is involved.
    *   Input Validation and Sanitization: Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in SQL queries, especially when constructing queries involving TimescaleDB functions.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Grant database users only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Resource-Intensive TimescaleDB Features](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_resource-intensive_timescaledb_features.md)

*   **Description:** Abuse of resource-intensive TimescaleDB features (e.g., continuous aggregates, large time-range queries) to overwhelm the database server and cause denial of service.
*   **TimescaleDB Contribution:** TimescaleDB's features designed for time-series data, while powerful, can be computationally expensive. Uncontrolled or malicious use of these features can strain database resources.
*   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly sends requests to an API endpoint that triggers a very broad time-range query on a large hypertable without proper filtering. This forces TimescaleDB to scan massive amounts of data, consuming excessive CPU, memory, and I/O, potentially leading to database slowdown or crash.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, performance degradation, application unavailability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Query Limits and Throttling: Implement query limits and request throttling at the application level to prevent abuse of resource-intensive queries.
    *   Query Optimization: Optimize queries, especially those involving large time ranges or continuous aggregates.
    *   Resource Monitoring and Alerting: Monitor database resource usage and set up alerts to detect unusual spikes.
    *   Rate Limiting API Endpoints: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints that interact with TimescaleDB.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in TimescaleDB Extension Code](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_timescaledb_extension_code.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities within the TimescaleDB extension's codebase (C and SQL code).
*   **TimescaleDB Contribution:** As a software extension, TimescaleDB's code itself can contain vulnerabilities like any other software.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in a TimescaleDB function that handles time-series data processing. An attacker could craft a specific input that triggers this overflow, potentially leading to code execution on the database server.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data corruption, denial of service, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep TimescaleDB Updated: Regularly update TimescaleDB to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Security Monitoring and Intrusion Detection: Implement security monitoring and intrusion detection systems.
    *   Vulnerability Scanning: Periodically scan the database system for known vulnerabilities in TimescaleDB.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Extension Installation and Update Process](./attack_surfaces/insecure_extension_installation_and_update_process.md)

*   **Description:** Compromising the process of installing or updating the TimescaleDB extension, leading to the introduction of malicious code.
*   **TimescaleDB Contribution:** The extension installation and update process is a potential attack vector if not secured.
*   **Example:** A man-in-the-middle attack during the download of the TimescaleDB extension package, replacing it with a malicious one.
*   **Impact:** Installation of backdoors, data compromise, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Verify Download Integrity: Always download TimescaleDB extensions from official and trusted sources and verify package integrity.
    *   Secure Communication Channels (HTTPS): Ensure secure communication channels for downloads and updates.
    *   Secure Package Management: Use secure package management practices.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege for Installation: Restrict access to the database server and extension installation.
