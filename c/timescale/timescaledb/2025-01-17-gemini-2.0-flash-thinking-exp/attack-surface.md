# Attack Surface Analysis for timescale/timescaledb

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Continuous Aggregate Definition](./attack_surfaces/malicious_continuous_aggregate_definition.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges crafts a continuous aggregate definition that includes malicious logic or queries.
    *   **How TimescaleDB Contributes:** Continuous aggregates are a core TimescaleDB feature that materializes query results. Their definition is stored and executed by the database.
    *   **Example:** A malicious aggregate could be defined to query sensitive data outside its intended scope, perform resource-intensive operations leading to denial of service, or even attempt to execute code through SQL injection if input sanitization is lacking in the underlying functions.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, denial of service, potential code execution on the database server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict permissions for creating and modifying continuous aggregates to authorized users only.
        *   Implement code reviews for continuous aggregate definitions, especially those involving user-provided input or complex logic.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the database user executing the aggregate refresh process.
        *   Monitor resource consumption during aggregate refreshes for anomalies.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting User-Defined Actions (UDAs) and User-Defined Functions (UDFs)](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_user-defined_actions__udas__and_user-defined_functions__udfs_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in custom UDAs or UDFs, or inject malicious code through them if input validation is insufficient.
    *   **How TimescaleDB Contributes:** TimescaleDB allows the creation of UDAs and UDFs to extend its functionality, which can introduce custom code into the database environment.
    *   **Example:** A poorly written UDF might be vulnerable to SQL injection if it directly incorporates user-provided input into a SQL query. A malicious UDA could be designed to exfiltrate data or modify database settings.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution on the database server, data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strict code review processes for all UDAs and UDFs.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within UDAs and UDFs to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining the permissions for UDAs and UDFs.
        *   Consider using parameterized queries within UDFs to mitigate SQL injection risks.
        *   Regularly audit and update UDAs and UDFs to address potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in TimescaleDB Toolkit Functions](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_timescaledb_toolkit_functions.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the functions provided by the TimescaleDB Toolkit.
    *   **How TimescaleDB Contributes:** The TimescaleDB Toolkit provides a set of specialized functions for time-series analysis. Vulnerabilities in these functions could be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in a toolkit function could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the database server.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep TimescaleDB and the TimescaleDB Toolkit updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to TimescaleDB and its toolkit.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when using toolkit functions, especially when handling user-provided input.
