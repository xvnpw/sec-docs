# Threat Model Analysis for timescale/timescaledb

## Threat: [Leaked TimescaleDB Credentials](./threats/leaked_timescaledb_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might find connection strings hardcoded in the application code, exposed in configuration files, or accessible through compromised developer machines. They would then use these credentials to connect directly to the TimescaleDB instance.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, modify or delete data, or potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands leading to further system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication System, Connection Handling
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store database credentials securely using secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in application code or configuration files.
    *   Use environment variables for sensitive configuration.
    *   Implement robust access control mechanisms within TimescaleDB.
    *   Regularly rotate database credentials.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Exploiting TimescaleDB Function Vulnerabilities](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_exploiting_timescaledb_function_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might discover and exploit vulnerabilities within the implementation of specific TimescaleDB functions or features. This could allow them to bypass intended security checks or gain elevated privileges within the database system itself.
*   **Impact:** The attacker could gain administrative control over the TimescaleDB instance, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Function Execution Engine, specific TimescaleDB functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with the latest TimescaleDB releases and apply security patches promptly.
    *   Carefully review release notes and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege when granting database permissions to users and roles.
    *   Consider disabling or restricting access to potentially vulnerable functions if they are not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Exploiting TimescaleDB-Specific Bugs](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_exploiting_timescaledb-specific_bugs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might discover and exploit undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities within TimescaleDB's core functionality, particularly in areas related to hypertable management, chunking, or data compression. This could lead to data corruption or inconsistencies within the database.
*   **Impact:** Loss of data integrity, inaccurate reporting, and potential application malfunctions due to corrupted data.
*   **Affected Component:** Hypertable Management, Chunk Management, Compression Algorithms, Storage Engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with the latest TimescaleDB releases and apply security patches promptly.
    *   Implement robust data validation and integrity checks within the application.
    *   Regularly back up the TimescaleDB database.
    *   Consider using TimescaleDB's built-in data integrity features and consistency checks.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to TimescaleDB Extensions](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_timescaledb_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities within the implementation of third-party extensions used with TimescaleDB or leverage insecure configurations of these extensions to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code within the database environment.
*   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the database server, data breaches, or denial of service depending on the extension's capabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** Extension Management, specific third-party extensions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully evaluate the security of any third-party extensions before installation.
    *   Keep extensions updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Limit the use of unnecessary extensions.
    *   Implement strong access controls for extension functionality.
