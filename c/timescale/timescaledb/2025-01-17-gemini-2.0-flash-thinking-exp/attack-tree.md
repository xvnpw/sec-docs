## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit TimescaleDB Specific SQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_timescaledb_specific_sql_injection__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application queries that interact with TimescaleDB. This can occur through various input points if proper sanitization and parameterized queries are not implemented.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Attackers can bypass security controls, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or manipulating application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject into Queries Targeting Hypertables](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_into_queries_targeting_hypertables.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers specifically target queries that interact with hypertables, the core data structure in TimescaleDB.
    *   **Impact:**  Can result in accessing or modifying data across different time ranges or partitions, potentially bypassing intended data isolation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Craft malicious queries that bypass chunk boundaries to access or modify data in unintended chunks](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__craft_malicious_queries_that_bypass_chunk_boundaries_to_access_or_modify_data_in_uni_2f92f3c6.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `WHERE` clause or other query components, attackers can craft SQL injection payloads that circumvent the intended chunk boundaries, allowing them to access or modify data in chunks they should not have access to.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to historical or future data, modification of data in isolated partitions, potentially leading to data breaches or data integrity issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject into Queries Targeting Continuous Aggregates](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_into_queries_targeting_continuous_aggregates.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target queries that define or refresh continuous aggregates, which are materialized views that automatically update.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to the manipulation of aggregated data, providing incorrect or misleading information, or bypassing access controls to the underlying raw data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Inject SQL to alter the underlying logic of continuous aggregates, leading to incorrect or misleading data](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__inject_sql_to_alter_the_underlying_logic_of_continuous_aggregates__leading_to_incorr_23e26264.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject SQL into the queries that define or refresh continuous aggregates, altering the aggregation functions, filtering criteria, or grouping logic.
    *   **Impact:**  Generation of incorrect business metrics, flawed dashboards and reports, potentially leading to incorrect decision-making based on manipulated data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Craft queries that bypass the aggregate layer to access the raw data in hypertables, potentially bypassing access controls](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__craft_queries_that_bypass_the_aggregate_layer_to_access_the_raw_data_in_hypertables__734dad8e.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft SQL injection payloads that circumvent the continuous aggregate layer, directly querying the underlying hypertables.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing intended access controls on the raw data, potentially exposing sensitive information that was meant to be accessed only through aggregated views.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit TimescaleDB Specific Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_timescaledb_specific_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage TimescaleDB-specific features to exhaust database resources, making the application or database unavailable.
    *   **Impact:**  Service disruption, impacting application availability and potentially leading to financial losses or reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Resource Exhaustion via Hypertables](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__resource_exhaustion_via_hypertables.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit the way TimescaleDB manages hypertables and their underlying chunks.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to disk space exhaustion, metadata storage overload, and overall database performance degradation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Craft queries or data insertion patterns that force the creation of an excessive number of small chunks, exhausting disk space or metadata storage](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__craft_queries_or_data_insertion_patterns_that_force_the_creation_of_an_excessive_num_e0ed8ec8.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers send a large volume of data with highly variable timestamps or use specific data patterns that force TimescaleDB to create an excessive number of small chunks.
    *   **Impact:** Rapid consumption of disk space, inode exhaustion, and metadata storage overload, leading to database instability, performance degradation, and potential service outages.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit TimescaleDB Specific Privilege Escalation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_timescaledb_specific_privilege_escalation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to gain higher privileges within the database or even on the underlying operating system by exploiting TimescaleDB-specific features or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Full control over the database, access to sensitive data, and potentially the ability to compromise the entire server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Abuse TimescaleDB Admin Functions](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__abuse_timescaledb_admin_functions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit misconfigured permissions on TimescaleDB administrative functions.
    *   **Impact:**  Gaining the ability to perform administrative tasks, such as creating or dropping databases, altering user permissions, or accessing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Misconfigured Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_misconfigured_permissions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application's database user is granted excessive permissions on TimescaleDB-specific administrative functions.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can leverage these excessive permissions to perform actions beyond their intended scope, potentially gaining full control over the database or accessing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Gain OS-Level Access](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__gain_os-level_access.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the TimescaleDB extension code itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the database server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive files, or install malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Manipulate Chunk Metadata](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__manipulate_chunk_metadata.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers directly alter the metadata associated with hypertable chunks, potentially through SQL injection or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Inconsistencies and corruption within the hypertable data, leading to incorrect query results, data loss, or application malfunction. This can make the time-series data unreliable and impact any applications relying on it.
