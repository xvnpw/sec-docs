# Attack Surface Analysis for timescale/timescaledb

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection in TimescaleDB-Specific Functions](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_in_timescaledb-specific_functions.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the implementation of TimescaleDB's custom SQL functions to inject malicious SQL code.
    * **How TimescaleDB Contributes:** TimescaleDB introduces new functions for interacting with hypertables, continuous aggregates, and other features. These functions, if not carefully implemented, can become injection points.
    * **Example:**  An application uses a function to filter data within a hypertable based on a time range provided by user input. If this input isn't properly sanitized, an attacker could inject SQL to bypass the intended filter and access unauthorized data or manipulate data.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use Parameterized Queries:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with TimescaleDB, especially when user input is involved in filtering or data manipulation within TimescaleDB-specific functions.
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in SQL queries, paying close attention to the expected data types and formats for TimescaleDB functions.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular code reviews and security audits specifically focusing on the usage of TimescaleDB functions and their potential for SQL injection.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation via TimescaleDB Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_via_timescaledb_extension_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the TimescaleDB extension itself to gain higher privileges within the PostgreSQL database.
    * **How TimescaleDB Contributes:** TimescaleDB is implemented as a PostgreSQL extension, adding new functionalities and potentially introducing new attack vectors if the extension code contains vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in the extension's code related to managing hypertables or continuous aggregates could be exploited by a low-privileged user to gain administrative access or execute arbitrary code within the database context.
    * **Impact:** Full database compromise, unauthorized data access and modification, potential for operating system compromise if database user has sufficient privileges.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep TimescaleDB Updated:**  Regularly update TimescaleDB to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        * **Restrict Extension Installation:**  Limit who can install and manage extensions within the PostgreSQL database.
        * **Monitor Extension Permissions:**  Carefully review and restrict the permissions granted to the TimescaleDB extension and any roles interacting with it.
        * **Security Audits of Extension Code (if feasible):** If possible, conduct or review security audits of the TimescaleDB extension code itself.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Hypertable Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_hypertable_resource_exhaustion.md)

* **Description:** Crafting malicious queries or actions that consume excessive database resources when interacting with hypertables, leading to service disruption.
    * **How TimescaleDB Contributes:** Hypertables, especially with a large number of chunks or complex partitioning, can be resource-intensive for certain operations if not handled efficiently.
    * **Example:** An attacker could craft a query that forces the database to scan an extremely large number of chunks unnecessarily, overwhelming the I/O and CPU resources and making the database unresponsive.
    * **Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting application functionality and potentially leading to financial losses or reputational damage.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Query Optimization:**  Ensure all queries targeting hypertables are optimized and use appropriate indexing.
        * **Resource Limits:**  Implement resource limits and timeouts for database queries and connections.
        * **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on API endpoints or application features that interact with TimescaleDB.
        * **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor database resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        * **Proper Chunking and Partitioning Strategies:** Design hypertable chunking and partitioning strategies to optimize query performance and prevent excessive scans.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting User-Defined Actions for Malicious Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_user-defined_actions_for_malicious_code_execution.md)

* **Description:**  Leveraging the functionality of user-defined actions to execute arbitrary code on the database server.
    * **How TimescaleDB Contributes:** TimescaleDB allows defining custom actions that are triggered by data lifecycle events (e.g., compression, retention). If these actions are not carefully implemented and secured, they can be exploited.
    * **Example:** A malicious user with sufficient privileges could create a user-defined action triggered by data compression that executes a shell script to compromise the database server or exfiltrate data.
    * **Impact:** Full database server compromise, data breach, data loss, and potential for further system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Restrict User-Defined Action Creation:**  Limit the ability to create and modify user-defined actions to highly trusted administrators.
        * **Secure Implementation of Actions:**  Thoroughly review and sanitize any code used in user-defined actions. Avoid direct execution of shell commands within actions if possible.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege for Actions:**  Ensure actions run with the minimum necessary privileges.
        * **Auditing of User-Defined Actions:**  Log all creations, modifications, and executions of user-defined actions.
