## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** This path represents the classic and still prevalent threat of SQL Injection. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in application code that constructs SQL queries using untrusted data, allowing them to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Input Points [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Application Code Directly Constructing SQL Queries: Developers concatenate user input directly into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
        *   ORM Misconfiguration or Vulnerabilities: Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) might be misconfigured or have vulnerabilities that allow for SQL injection.
    *   **Craft Malicious SQL Payload:**
        *   Standard SQL Injection Techniques: Using common SQL injection techniques like `UNION` clauses, subqueries, or conditional logic to extract or manipulate data.
    *   **Execute Malicious SQL:**
        *   Bypass Input Validation: Successfully circumventing any input validation mechanisms in place.
        *   Database Executes Malicious Query: The database server executes the attacker's injected SQL code.
    *   **Achieve Goal:**
        *   **Data Exfiltration [HIGH-IMPACT] [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Using `SELECT` statements to retrieve sensitive data from the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_misconfigurations.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in the configuration of the TimescaleDB database or its surrounding environment. Misconfigurations often provide easy entry points for attackers.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Identify Misconfiguration [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Weak or Default Database Credentials: Using easily guessable or default usernames and passwords for database accounts.
        *   Insecure Network Configuration: Exposing the TimescaleDB instance directly to the internet or untrusted networks without proper firewall rules.
        *   Overly Permissive Access Control Lists (ACLs): Granting excessive permissions to database users or network segments.
        *   Unnecessary or Insecurely Configured TimescaleDB Features: Enabling features like remote access without proper authentication or encryption (e.g., no TLS).
        *   Failure to Apply Security Patches: Running outdated versions of TimescaleDB or PostgreSQL with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Leverage Misconfiguration:**
        *   Direct Access via Exposed Port: Connecting directly to the database server through an open port.
        *   Brute-force Weak Credentials: Attempting to guess usernames and passwords through automated attacks.
        *   Exploit Lack of Authentication/Authorization for Specific Features: Accessing sensitive functionalities or data due to missing or weak authentication.
    *   **Achieve Goal:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access [HIGH-IMPACT] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Directly accessing and viewing sensitive data due to weak access controls.
        *   Data Modification [HIGH-IMPACT]: Altering or deleting data due to insufficient permissions.
        *   Denial of Service [HIGH-IMPACT]:  Overloading the database server with requests due to lack of proper security measures.
        *   Complete Database Takeover [HIGH-IMPACT]: Gaining full administrative control over the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes Breakdown](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_breakdown.md)

*   **Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:** This is a critical node because successful exploitation opens the door to various high-impact outcomes, primarily data breaches.
*   **Identify Vulnerable Input Points:** This is a critical node because it's the initial step in the SQL injection attack path. Preventing attackers from identifying these points significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** This is a critical node representing a high-impact outcome – the successful theft of sensitive data.
*   **Exploit Misconfigurations:** This is a critical node because misconfigurations often provide easy pathways for attackers to gain unauthorized access or disrupt the database.
*   **Identify Misconfiguration:** This is a critical node as it represents the initial discovery of a weakness that can be exploited.
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** This is a critical node representing a direct and significant security breach – unauthorized access to sensitive information.

These High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes should be prioritized for security efforts, including code reviews, penetration testing, security hardening, and monitoring.
