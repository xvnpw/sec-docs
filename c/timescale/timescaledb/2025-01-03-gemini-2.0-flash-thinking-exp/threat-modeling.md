# Threat Model Analysis for timescale/timescaledb

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Hyperfunction Arguments](./threats/sql_injection_in_hyperfunction_arguments.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into application queries that pass user-controlled data as arguments to TimescaleDB hyperfunctions (e.g., `time_bucket`, `first`, `last`). This allows them to execute arbitrary SQL commands within the context of the database user.

**Impact:** Data breach (accessing sensitive data), data modification or deletion, potential for privilege escalation if the database user has elevated permissions, denial of service by executing resource-intensive queries.

**Affected Component:** TimescaleDB Hyperfunctions, Query Parser, Data Access Layer.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use Parameterized Queries: Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing SQL queries that include user input, especially when calling hyperfunctions. This prevents the database from interpreting user input as executable code.
* Input Validation and Sanitization: Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs on the application side before using them in database queries. This includes checking data types, formats, and lengths.
* Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure the database user used by the application has only the necessary privileges to perform its intended tasks. Avoid granting overly permissive roles.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Raw Chunk Data](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_raw_chunk_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the underlying file system of the PostgreSQL server could potentially directly access the raw data files (chunks) that store TimescaleDB data, bypassing database-level access controls.

**Impact:** Data breach (accessing potentially sensitive time-series data), potential for data corruption if the attacker modifies the chunk files directly.

**Affected Component:** TimescaleDB Chunk Storage, PostgreSQL Data Directory.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure File System Permissions: Restrict access to the PostgreSQL data directory and chunk files to only the necessary operating system users and processes.
* Disk Encryption: Encrypt the underlying file system where the PostgreSQL data directory resides. This adds a layer of protection even if the attacker gains file system access.
* Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of the server and file system configurations to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in TimescaleDB Extensions](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_timescaledb_extensions.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes any TimescaleDB extensions, vulnerabilities within those extensions could be exploited by attackers to compromise the database or the application.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could include data breach, data corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution within the database context.

**Affected Component:** TimescaleDB Extensions (specific extension with the vulnerability).

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be high or critical depending on the extension and vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Extensions Updated: Regularly update all TimescaleDB extensions to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* Use Reputable Extensions: Only use extensions from trusted sources and with a strong security track record.
* Security Assessments: Conduct security assessments or penetration testing that includes the analysis of used extensions.
* Principle of Least Functionality: Only install and enable necessary extensions. Disable any extensions that are not actively used.
