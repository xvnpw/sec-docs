# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for timescale/timescaledb

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Secure Data Retention Policies (TimescaleDB Specific Implementation)](./mitigation_strategies/1__secure_data_retention_policies__timescaledb_specific_implementation_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Data Retention Policies (TimescaleDB Specific Implementation)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Data Retention Requirements:** Clearly document legal, regulatory, and business requirements for time-series data stored in TimescaleDB.
    2.  **Implement Retention Policies using `drop_chunks`:** Utilize TimescaleDB's `drop_chunks` function in scheduled jobs to automatically remove *chunks* older than the defined retention period. This is specific to TimescaleDB's chunk-based architecture.
        *   Example SQL: `SELECT drop_chunks(interval '3 months', hypertable => 'sensor_data');`
    3.  **Regularly Review and Audit `drop_chunks` Execution:** Periodically review data retention policies and audit logs of `drop_chunks` executions to verify proper operation of TimescaleDB's chunk dropping mechanism.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach due to Excessive Data Retention (Severity: Medium to High):** Retaining data longer than necessary in TimescaleDB's chunked format increases the attack surface.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Severity: High):** Failure to comply with data retention regulations when using TimescaleDB for time-series data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach due to Excessive Data Retention:** High reduction. Limits the amount of sensitive time-series data stored in TimescaleDB chunks.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** High reduction. Directly addresses regulatory requirements for time-series data retention within TimescaleDB.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `drop_chunks` jobs are configured for `sensor_data` hypertable, leveraging TimescaleDB's chunk management.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automate `drop_chunks` jobs for other hypertables like `web_application_metrics` based on their retention policies.
    *   Implement audit logging specifically for `drop_chunks` executions to track TimescaleDB data removal actions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Secure Continuous Aggregate Access Control (TimescaleDB Feature Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/2__secure_continuous_aggregate_access_control__timescaledb_feature_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Continuous Aggregate Access Control (TimescaleDB Feature Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Continuous Aggregates:** Determine which *continuous aggregates* (a TimescaleDB feature) contain sensitive summarized information.
    2.  **Apply RBAC to Continuous Aggregate Views:** Utilize PostgreSQL's RBAC to control access to these *materialized views* that are continuous aggregates in TimescaleDB.
        *   Example SQL:
            ```sql
            CREATE ROLE analyst WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'secure_password';
            GRANT SELECT ON TABLE web_application_metrics_hourly TO analyst; -- Access to the continuous aggregate
            REVOKE ALL ON TABLE web_application_metrics_hourly FROM public;
            ```
    3.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Continuous Aggregate Access:** Grant users only necessary permissions to access specific *continuous aggregates*, not broader hypertable access if only aggregated data is needed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Aggregated Insights (Severity: Medium to High):** Unauthorized users gaining access to *TimescaleDB continuous aggregates* could reveal confidential insights derived from time-series data.
    *   **Data Leakage through Aggregated Data (Severity: Medium):** Even summarized data from *TimescaleDB continuous aggregates* can reveal sensitive information if not properly secured.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Aggregated Insights:** High reduction. Restricts access to *TimescaleDB continuous aggregates* to authorized personnel.
    *   **Data Leakage through Aggregated Data:** Medium reduction. Limits access points to potentially sensitive summaries generated by *TimescaleDB continuous aggregates*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. General RBAC is used, but specific access controls for *TimescaleDB continuous aggregates* are not explicitly configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement specific RBAC rules for all *TimescaleDB continuous aggregates*, especially those derived from sensitive hypertables.
    *   Document access control policies specifically for *TimescaleDB continuous aggregates*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Query Optimization for Large Time-Series Data (TimescaleDB Context)](./mitigation_strategies/3__query_optimization_for_large_time-series_data__timescaledb_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Query Optimization for Large Time-Series Data (TimescaleDB Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Optimize Queries Against Hypertables:** Focus query optimization efforts on queries targeting *hypertables*, TimescaleDB's core time-series data structure, as these can grow very large.
    2.  **Utilize TimescaleDB Indexing Features:** Leverage TimescaleDB's specialized indexing, such as time-based indexes and space-time indexes, which are crucial for efficient querying of time-series data in hypertables.
        *   Example: `CREATE INDEX sensor_data_time_idx ON sensor_data (time DESC);`
    3.  **Query Tuning for TimescaleDB Functions:** Optimize queries that use TimescaleDB-specific functions and features to ensure efficient execution within the TimescaleDB environment.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Poorly optimized queries against large *TimescaleDB hypertables* can exhaust resources.
    *   **Slow Application Performance (Severity: Medium):** Inefficient queries against *TimescaleDB* can lead to slow application response times when dealing with time-series data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Resource Exhaustion:** High reduction. Prevents resource exhaustion caused by inefficient queries on *TimescaleDB hypertables*.
    *   **Slow Application Performance:** High reduction. Improves query performance specifically for time-series data in *TimescaleDB*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic indexing is in place on hypertables, and some query optimization has been done, but not systematically focused on TimescaleDB-specific features.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement a regular query performance analysis process specifically targeting queries against *TimescaleDB hypertables*.
    *   Document indexing strategies optimized for *TimescaleDB* and time-series data access patterns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [5. TimescaleDB Aware Backup and Restore Procedures (Chunk Aware)](./mitigation_strategies/5__timescaledb_aware_backup_and_restore_procedures__chunk_aware_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** TimescaleDB Aware Backup and Restore Procedures (Chunk Aware)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Backup Methods Compatible with TimescaleDB Chunks:** Utilize backup methods that understand TimescaleDB's chunk-based architecture. While standard PostgreSQL backups work, consider tools optimized for *TimescaleDB* that can handle large numbers of chunks efficiently.
    2.  **Test Restore of Hypertables and Chunks:** Specifically test the restoration process for *hypertables* and ensure that *chunks* are correctly restored and data integrity is maintained in the TimescaleDB context.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Loss in TimescaleDB due to System Failure (Severity: High to Critical):** Lack of *TimescaleDB-aware* backups can complicate or hinder recovery of time-series data stored in chunks.
    *   **Extended Downtime during TimescaleDB Recovery (Severity: High):** Inefficient backup/restore for *TimescaleDB's chunked structure* can prolong recovery time.
