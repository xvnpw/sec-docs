# Attack Surface Analysis for timescale/timescaledb

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via TimescaleDB Functions](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_timescaledb_functions.md)

*   **1. SQL Injection via TimescaleDB Functions**

    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through TimescaleDB-specific functions by exploiting improperly handled user input.
    *   **How TimescaleDB Contributes:** TimescaleDB introduces numerous custom SQL functions that accept parameters, increasing the potential for injection points if not used carefully.
    *   **Example:** An application uses user-supplied input to set the chunk time interval: `SELECT create_hypertable('my_table', 'time', chunk_time_interval => '` + userInput + `');`.  If `userInput` is `1 day'); DROP TABLE my_table; --`, the attacker can drop the table.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data modification, unauthorized data access, database compromise, execution of arbitrary code on the database server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** *Always* use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for *all* SQL interactions, including those with TimescaleDB functions.  This prevents the database from interpreting user input as SQL code.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate user input *before* it reaches the database. This is a *defense-in-depth* measure.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Grant database users only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help, but it should not be the sole defense.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Chunk Creation](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_chunk_creation.md)

*   **2. Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Chunk Creation**

    *   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the database by creating a massive number of small chunks, impacting performance and potentially causing instability.
    *   **How TimescaleDB Contributes:** TimescaleDB's chunking mechanism, while designed for performance, can be abused if chunk time intervals are not properly managed.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates the application to create hypertables with extremely small chunk time intervals (e.g., milliseconds), leading to millions of tiny chunks.
    *   **Impact:** Database performance degradation, service unavailability, potential database crashes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Enforce strict validation on any user input that influences chunk time intervals. Implement minimum and maximum allowed values.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate at which users can create hypertables or modify chunk time intervals.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor the number of chunks and their sizes. Set alerts for unusual activity.
        *   **Application Logic Review:** Carefully review the application logic that determines chunk time intervals.

## Attack Surface: [DoS via Uncontrolled Continuous Aggregate Materialization](./attack_surfaces/dos_via_uncontrolled_continuous_aggregate_materialization.md)

*   **3. DoS via Uncontrolled Continuous Aggregate Materialization**

    *   **Description:** An attacker triggers excessive materialization of continuous aggregates, consuming CPU and storage resources.
    *   **How TimescaleDB Contributes:** Continuous aggregates are materialized views that are automatically refreshed.  If the refresh policy or the underlying query is manipulated, it can lead to excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the refresh interval of a continuous aggregate to be very frequent (e.g., every second), or they modify the underlying query to be extremely complex.
    *   **Impact:** Database performance degradation, service unavailability, potential storage exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Least Privilege:** Restrict permissions to create, alter, or drop continuous aggregates.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate any user input that influences the definition or refresh policy of continuous aggregates.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor the resource consumption of continuous aggregate materialization.
        *   **Review Continuous Aggregate Definitions:** Carefully review the definitions and refresh policies.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Hypertable Access/Modification](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_hypertable_accessmodification.md)

*   **4. Unauthorized Hypertable Access/Modification**

    *   **Description:** An attacker with some database access gains unauthorized access to hypertables, allowing them to drop, alter, or insert malicious data.
    *   **How TimescaleDB Contributes:** Hypertables are the core data structure in TimescaleDB.  Misconfigured permissions can expose them to unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** A database user with limited privileges is mistakenly granted `ALTER` or `DROP` privileges on a hypertable.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant database users only the minimum necessary permissions on hypertables. Use granular permissions.
        *   **Regular Permission Audits:** Regularly review and audit database user permissions.
        *   **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Consider using PostgreSQL's RLS.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in TimescaleDB Background Workers](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_timescaledb_background_workers.md)

* **5. Vulnerabilities in TimescaleDB Background Workers**
    * **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the background workers used for tasks like continuous aggregate maintenance and data retention.
    * **How TimescaleDB Contributes:** TimescaleDB relies on background workers for various internal operations.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in a background worker responsible for data retention could be exploited to prevent data from being deleted, leading to storage exhaustion, or to delete data prematurely.
    * **Impact:** Data loss, performance degradation, service disruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep TimescaleDB Updated:** Apply security patches and updates promptly.
        * **Monitor Background Worker Activity:** Monitor the activity and resource consumption of background workers.
        * **Restrict Permissions:** Ensure that the background workers operate with the least necessary privileges.
