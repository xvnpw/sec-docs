# Threat Model Analysis for timescale/timescaledb

## Threat: [Forged Timestamp Data Insertion](./threats/forged_timestamp_data_insertion.md)

*   **Threat:** Forged Timestamp Data Insertion

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious data payloads with manipulated timestamps. They might insert data points far in the future or past to disrupt time-series analysis, trigger false alerts based on time windows, or bypass time-based access controls (e.g., inserting data that should be outside a retention period).
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, inaccurate analysis, incorrect alerts, potential bypass of security controls, and compromised data integrity.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hypertables (specifically, the time column and any indexes based on it).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Timestamping:** Use server-side timestamp generation (e.g., `NOW()`) whenever possible.
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of client-provided timestamps.
        *   **Trusted Data Sources:** Establish trust mechanisms (e.g., digital signatures) for external data sources.
        *   **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Use RLS to restrict timestamp ranges for insertions.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Hypertable Schema Modification](./threats/unauthorized_hypertable_schema_modification.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Hypertable Schema Modification

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains sufficient database privileges to execute `ALTER TABLE` commands on a hypertable. They could change data types, add/remove columns, or modify chunking parameters (`chunk_time_interval`).
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, application errors, performance degradation, potential denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hypertables, `chunk_time_interval` setting, TimescaleDB internal metadata.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant *only* necessary permissions to the application's database user. *Do not* grant `ALTER` privileges on hypertables.
        *   **Database User Segmentation:** Use separate database users for different application components.
        *   **Change Management:** Implement strict change management procedures for schema modifications.
        *   **Auditing:** Enable PostgreSQL auditing (e.g., `pgAudit`) to track schema changes.

## Threat: [Continuous Aggregate Manipulation](./threats/continuous_aggregate_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Continuous Aggregate Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges alters the definition of a continuous aggregate (using `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW`) or directly manipulates the materialized data.
    *   **Impact:** Inaccurate pre-calculated results, leading to incorrect reports or decisions. Potentially exposes sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Continuous Aggregates (materialized views), `timescaledb.continuous_aggregate` catalog table.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to `CREATE CONTINUOUS AGGREGATE` and `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` commands.
        *   **Regular Validation:** Periodically compare continuous aggregate results with raw data calculations.
        *   **Auditing:** Monitor logs for unauthorized changes to continuous aggregate definitions.
        *   **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Apply RLS to control access based on user roles.

## Threat: [Direct Chunk Data Tampering](./threats/direct_chunk_data_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Direct Chunk Data Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the underlying PostgreSQL data files and modifies the data within individual chunks, bypassing TimescaleDB's access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, circumvention of database-level security.
    *   **Affected Component:** Underlying PostgreSQL data files representing TimescaleDB chunks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Operating System Security:** Harden the OS and file system.
        *   **Encryption at Rest:** Implement encryption for database data files.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Use FIM tools to detect unauthorized changes.
        *   **Regular Backups and Verification:** Perform and verify regular backups.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Continuous Aggregates](./threats/information_disclosure_via_continuous_aggregates.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Continuous Aggregates

    *   **Description:** A continuous aggregate is misconfigured or lacks appropriate access controls, exposing sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, violation of privacy regulations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Continuous Aggregates (materialized views).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Minimization:** Include only the minimum necessary information in aggregates.
        *   **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Implement RLS to restrict access.
        *   **Views with Security Barriers:** Use views to control access and enforce security checks.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Queries)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__queries_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Queries)

    *   **Description:** An attacker submits poorly optimized queries against large hypertables, consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, database performance degradation, system instability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hypertables, TimescaleDB query planner, PostgreSQL resource management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Query Optimization:** Use indexes, time-based filters, and continuous aggregates.
        *   **`EXPLAIN` Analysis:** Analyze query plans with `EXPLAIN`.
        *   **Query Timeouts:** Implement query timeouts.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure PostgreSQL resource limits.
        *   **Connection Pooling:** Use connection pooling.

## Threat: [Disk Space Exhaustion (Uncontrolled Data Growth)](./threats/disk_space_exhaustion__uncontrolled_data_growth_.md)

*   **Threat:** Disk Space Exhaustion (Uncontrolled Data Growth)

    *   **Description:** Hypertables grow without bounds due to a lack of data retention policies, filling up disk space.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, database unavailability, potential data loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hypertables, TimescaleDB chunk management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Retention Policies:** Use `drop_chunks` to remove old data.
        *   **Disk Space Monitoring:** Monitor disk usage and set up alerts.
        *   **Compression:** Enable TimescaleDB's native compression.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via `SECURITY DEFINER` Functions](./threats/privilege_escalation_via__security_definer__functions.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via `SECURITY DEFINER` Functions

    *   **Description:** A TimescaleDB function with `SECURITY DEFINER` executes with the creator's privileges. An attacker exploits this to gain elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Attacker gains the privileges of the function's creator.
    *   **Affected Component:** TimescaleDB functions created with the `SECURITY DEFINER` attribute.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `SECURITY DEFINER`:** Use `SECURITY INVOKER` whenever possible.
        *   **Code Review:** Rigorously review code if `SECURITY DEFINER` is necessary.
        *   **Restrict Creation:** Limit who can create `SECURITY DEFINER` functions.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate all inputs to `SECURITY DEFINER` functions.
