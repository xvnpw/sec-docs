## GoAccess Threat List (High & Critical)

Here are the high and critical severity threats that directly involve the GoAccess application:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Log Injection leading to Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts specially formatted log entries containing escape sequences or other malicious payloads that exploit vulnerabilities in GoAccess's log parsing logic. When GoAccess processes these logs, the malicious payload is interpreted as code and executed on the server. This could allow the attacker to gain complete control of the system.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service, malware installation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Log Parsing Module (specifically the functions handling different log formats and escape sequences).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate log data before it is processed by GoAccess. Implement strict input validation rules based on the expected log format.
        *   Run GoAccess in a sandboxed environment or with restricted user privileges to limit the impact of potential code execution.
        *   Regularly update GoAccess to the latest version to patch known parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a dedicated log management system with built-in security features before feeding logs to GoAccess.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Log Injection leading to Information Disclosure
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects crafted log entries designed to exploit vulnerabilities in GoAccess's parsing or reporting mechanisms. This could cause GoAccess to inadvertently reveal sensitive information from other log entries or internal system data within its reports (text, HTML, or JSON).
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data like user credentials, API keys, internal IP addresses, or other confidential information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Log Parsing Module, Report Generation Modules (HTML, JSON, Text).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate log data before processing. Implement strict input validation.
        *   Configure GoAccess to exclude sensitive fields or patterns from its reports.
        *   Restrict access to GoAccess reports to authorized personnel only.
        *   Implement data masking or redaction techniques on log data before processing with GoAccess.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTML Reports
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into log entries. When GoAccess generates an HTML report containing these entries, the unsanitized script is included in the HTML output. When a user views this report in their browser, the malicious script executes, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise of users viewing the malicious report, potential for further attacks on the application or other systems accessible from the user's browser.
    *   **Affected Component:** HTML Report Generation Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure GoAccess properly sanitizes user-controlled data when generating HTML reports. Use output encoding techniques to prevent the interpretation of malicious scripts.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers on the web server serving the GoAccess reports to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid directly serving GoAccess-generated HTML reports to untrusted users.
