# Attack Surface Analysis for woltapp/blurhash

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Large/Complex Image Encoding](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_largecomplex_image_encoding.md)

*   **Description:** Resource Exhaustion via Large/Complex Image Encoding
    *   **How BlurHash Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The BlurHash encoding process requires processing image data. Submitting extremely large or computationally complex images can consume significant server resources *during the BlurHash generation*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a multi-gigabyte image to a profile picture endpoint that uses BlurHash to generate a preview. This overwhelms the server's CPU and memory specifically during the BlurHash calculation, potentially causing slowdowns or crashes for other users.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), impacting application availability and performance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file size limits for uploaded images *before BlurHash processing*.
        *   Set timeouts for the BlurHash encoding process.
        *   Perform BlurHash encoding asynchronously in a background queue or worker process.
        *   Limit the number of concurrent encoding processes.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service via Maliciously Crafted Encoding Images](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_via_maliciously_crafted_encoding_images.md)

*   **Description:** Denial of Service via Maliciously Crafted Encoding Images
    *   **How BlurHash Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Underlying image processing libraries used by BlurHash encoding might have vulnerabilities. специально crafted images could exploit these, causing crashes or excessive resource consumption *during the BlurHash encoding phase*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a PNG image with specific header values that trigger a bug in the image decoding library used by the BlurHash encoder, leading to a segmentation fault and crashing the encoding process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially crashing the application or specific image processing components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the BlurHash library and its underlying image processing dependencies updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for image processing *involved in BlurHash encoding*.
        *   Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms for the encoding process.
