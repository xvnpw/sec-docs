## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via BlurHash Exploitation ](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_blurhash_exploitation.md)

* **Compromise Application via BlurHash Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful compromise achieved by exploiting weaknesses related to the BlurHash functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Handling of BlurHash ](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_handling_of_blurhash.md)

* **Exploit Application's Handling of BlurHash [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application integrates and uses the BlurHash library, rather than flaws within the library itself. These are often easier to exploit due to common development oversights.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Input Handling ](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_input_handling.md)

* **Vulnerable Input Handling [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This critical node highlights the risk associated with not properly validating user-supplied or external data before processing it. It opens the door for various attacks by allowing unexpected or malicious input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Doesn't Validate BlurHash Format ](./attack_tree_paths/application_doesn't_validate_blurhash_format.md)

* **Application Doesn't Validate BlurHash Format [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector: Supply Non-BlurHash String:**
        * **Description:** If the application fails to verify that an input string conforms to the expected BlurHash format, an attacker can provide arbitrary strings.
        * **Consequences:** This can lead to application errors or crashes when the non-BlurHash string is passed to the decoding library. It can also potentially bypass expected application logic if the application relies on the input being a valid BlurHash for subsequent operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Output Handling ](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_output_handling.md)

* **Vulnerable Output Handling [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This critical node emphasizes the risks of displaying or using decoded BlurHash images without proper consideration for their potential content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Blindly Rendering Decoded Output ](./attack_tree_paths/blindly_rendering_decoded_output.md)

* **Blindly Rendering Decoded Output [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector: Supply BlurHash Leading to Visually Malicious Output:**
        * **Description:** If the application directly renders the decoded image without any checks or sanitization, an attacker can craft a BlurHash string that, when decoded, produces a visually offensive, misleading, or harmful image.
        * **Consequences:** This can lead to social engineering attacks, where users are tricked by the deceptive blurry image. It can also be used for defacement or displaying inappropriate content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion via Repeated Decoding ](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_via_repeated_decoding.md)

* **Resource Exhaustion via Repeated Decoding [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector: Attacker Forces Repeated Decoding of Complex BlurHashes:**
        * **Description:** An attacker can repeatedly send requests to the application to decode BlurHash strings, particularly those that are computationally expensive to decode.
        * **Consequences:** This can overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory), leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) where the application becomes unresponsive to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Generate Resource-Intensive Decoding ](./attack_tree_paths/generate_resource-intensive_decoding.md)

* **Generate Resource-Intensive Decoding [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * While not a "HIGH-RISK PATH" on its own due to potentially lower likelihood of *finding* such inputs, this node is critical because it represents a potential vulnerability within the BlurHash decoding logic itself.
    * **Potential Attack Vector (Implicit):** A carefully crafted BlurHash string could exploit algorithmic inefficiencies in the decoding process, causing excessive resource consumption even with a single request.
    * **Consequences:**  Similar to the repeated decoding attack, this can lead to DoS by exhausting server resources.
