# Threat Model Analysis for woltapp/blurhash

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the BlurHash Library (Supply Chain Risk)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_blurhash_library__supply_chain_risk_.md)

* **Description:**
    * **Attacker might do and how:** An attacker could exploit undiscovered vulnerabilities within the `blurhash` library's code (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows) by providing specially crafted input during encoding or decoding. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or a crash.
* **Impact:**
    * Remote code execution on the server or client, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control of the system. Information disclosure, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data. Denial of service, crashing the application or service.
* **Affected Component:**
    * Entire `blurhash` library code base (encoding and decoding modules).
* **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly update the `blurhash` library to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues related to the `blurhash` library.
    * Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the library and its dependencies.
