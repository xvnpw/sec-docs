# Threat Model Analysis for woltapp/blurhash

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Input Image (Encoding)](./threats/maliciously_crafted_input_image__encoding_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image as input to the BlurHash encoding function. This could involve images with extremely large dimensions, unusual color profiles, or corrupted data designed to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the encoding process. The attacker aims to cause the encoding process to consume excessive resources or trigger errors within the BlurHash library.
* **Impact:** Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) within the BlurHash encoding process, potentially leading to denial-of-service (DoS) for the application or specific functionalities relying on BlurHash. Potential application crashes or unexpected behavior originating from the BlurHash library.
* **Affected Component:** BlurHash encoding function (likely within the core library logic handling image processing).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement input validation on images before encoding, checking for acceptable dimensions, file sizes, and formats *before* passing them to the BlurHash library.
    * Set resource limits (e.g., timeouts, memory limits) specifically for the BlurHash encoding process.
    * Consider using a dedicated image processing library for pre-processing and sanitization before passing images to BlurHash.

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted BlurHash String (Decoding)](./threats/maliciously_crafted_blurhash_string__decoding_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted BlurHash string as input to the decoding function. This string could be intentionally malformed, excessively long, or designed to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the decoding logic *within the BlurHash library*. The attacker aims to cause the decoding process to consume excessive resources, trigger errors, or potentially exploit underlying vulnerabilities in BlurHash's decoding implementation.
* **Impact:** Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) within the BlurHash decoding process, leading to denial-of-service (DoS) for the application or specific functionalities relying on BlurHash. Potential application crashes or unexpected behavior originating from the BlurHash library. In less likely scenarios, vulnerabilities in the decoding logic *of BlurHash* could potentially be exploited for code execution if the output is not handled securely by the rendering component.
* **Affected Component:** BlurHash decoding function (likely within the core library logic handling string parsing and image reconstruction).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict validation of BlurHash strings before decoding, checking for expected format, length, and character set *before* passing them to the BlurHash library.
    * Set resource limits (e.g., timeouts, memory limits) specifically for the BlurHash decoding process.
    * Ensure the component rendering the decoded blurhash is secure and resistant to potential injection attacks (though less likely with image data).

## Threat: [Implementation Vulnerabilities in the BlurHash Library](./threats/implementation_vulnerabilities_in_the_blurhash_library.md)

* **Description:** The BlurHash library itself might contain security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other coding errors in its C/C++ or other language implementations. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing specific inputs to the encoding or decoding functions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or crashes *within the context of the application using BlurHash*.
* **Impact:** Potentially critical impact, including arbitrary code execution on the server, data breaches, or denial-of-service directly caused by flaws in the BlurHash library.
* **Affected Component:** Core BlurHash library code (encoding and decoding logic).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly update the BlurHash library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in the BlurHash library.
    * Consider using static analysis security testing (SAST) tools on the application's codebase that integrates with BlurHash, specifically looking for potential vulnerabilities in the library's usage.
