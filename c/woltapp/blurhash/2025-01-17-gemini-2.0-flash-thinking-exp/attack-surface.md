# Attack Surface Analysis for woltapp/blurhash

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Image Input (Encoding)](./attack_surfaces/malformed_image_input__encoding_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malformed Image Input (Encoding)
    *   **Description:** The `blurhash` library processes image data to generate the BlurHash string. Providing a malformed or corrupted image can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
    *   **How BlurHash Contributes:** The library's encoding function directly interacts with image decoding libraries (like Pillow in Python). Vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries, triggered by malformed input, can be exploited through `blurhash`.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PNG file with an invalid header. When the application uses `blurhash` to encode this image, the underlying image library crashes, causing a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential for arbitrary code execution if the underlying image library has severe vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation on image uploads, verifying file headers and formats before passing them to `blurhash`.
        *   Use a well-maintained and regularly updated image processing library.
        *   Consider sandboxing the image processing operations to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement error handling to gracefully catch exceptions during image decoding and encoding.
