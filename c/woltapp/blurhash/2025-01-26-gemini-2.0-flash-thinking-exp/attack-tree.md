## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL] Compromise Application using BlurHash Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical__compromise_application_using_blurhash_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This is the root goal of the attacker.  Success means the attacker has achieved some level of compromise in the application by exploiting vulnerabilities related to BlurHash processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [CRITICAL] Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities (via BlurHash Generation):](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical__exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities__via_blurhash_generation_.md)

*   This critical node represents the attacker's chosen path to compromise the application: targeting the server-side BlurHash generation process.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the BlurHash generation library itself (though considered lower likelihood in our full analysis, server-side vulnerabilities are generally higher impact).
    *   Overwhelming the server resources during BlurHash generation, leading to Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL] Trigger Server-Side Denial of Service (DoS):](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical__trigger_server-side_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   This is the immediate objective within the server-side exploitation path.  A successful DoS disrupts the application's availability and can be a stepping stone for further attacks or simply the goal itself.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Crafting malicious input images that consume excessive server resources during BlurHash generation.
    *   Flooding the server with a large number of BlurHash generation requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [HIGH RISK] 3. Craft Malicious Input Image for Resource Exhaustion during BlurHash Generation:](./attack_tree_paths/4___high_risk__3__craft_malicious_input_image_for_resource_exhaustion_during_blurhash_generation.md)

*   This High-Risk Path focuses on using malicious images to cause server-side DoS.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - It is relatively easy for an attacker to provide large or potentially complex images.
*   **Impact:** Low to Medium - Can lead to server DoS, impacting application availability.
*   **Effort:** Low - Requires minimal effort to send malicious images.
*   **Skill Level:** Low - No specialized skills are needed.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - Server monitoring can detect increased resource usage.

    *   **4.1. [HIGH RISK] 3.1. Extremely Large Image Files:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Submitting or linking to extremely large image files for BlurHash generation.
        *   **Mechanism:** Processing very large images consumes significant server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, disk I/O), potentially leading to resource exhaustion and DoS.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict image size limits (file size and dimensions) on the server-side. Implement resource quotas for image processing tasks.

    *   **4.2. [HIGH RISK] 3.3. Repeated Requests for BlurHash Generation:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a flood of requests to the BlurHash generation endpoint.
        *   **Mechanism:**  Overwhelming the server with a high volume of requests, even with normal-sized images, can exhaust server resources and cause DoS.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting on the BlurHash generation endpoint to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given time frame.
