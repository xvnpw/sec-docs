# Attack Surface Analysis for woltapp/blurhash

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Encoding Overload](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_encoding_overload.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood the server with requests to encode large images or use excessively high component counts, consuming CPU resources and causing a denial of service.  This is specific to the *encoding* process of BlurHash.
*   **How BlurHash Contributes:** The BlurHash *encoding* algorithm's computational complexity increases significantly with image size and the requested component counts (X and Y). This inherent characteristic makes it a target.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends numerous requests to a BlurHash generation endpoint, each with a very large image (e.g., 10000x10000 pixels) and a high component count (e.g., 9x9). This overwhelms the server's CPU.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Enforce strict limits on the maximum dimensions (width and height) of images accepted for encoding.
    *   **Component Count Limits:** Set reasonable maximum values for the X and Y component counts (e.g., a maximum of 9x9, or lower).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting specifically on the BlurHash *generation* endpoint.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Offload BlurHash generation to a background queue.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU usage to detect this specific type of overload.

## Attack Surface: [Code Execution via Buffer Overflow/Underflow (Decoding - Less Likely, but Critical)](./attack_surfaces/code_execution_via_buffer_overflowunderflow__decoding_-_less_likely__but_critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit buffer overflows or underflows in the *decoder* (especially in C/C++ implementations) using maliciously crafted BlurHash strings. This is a direct attack on the decoder's handling of the BlurHash string.
*   **How BlurHash Contributes:** While the vulnerability is in the decoder's *implementation*, the attack vector is a *maliciously crafted BlurHash string* designed to trigger the memory corruption.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a BlurHash string with specific byte sequences that, when processed by a vulnerable C/C++ decoder, overwrite memory, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (Although less likely with well-maintained libraries and memory-safe languages, the impact is severe.)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Memory-Safe Languages:** Prioritize using memory-safe languages (Rust, Go, Python, Java) for decoder implementations.
    *   **Code Review & Audit:** For C/C++ decoders, perform rigorous code reviews and security audits, focusing on memory handling and input validation related to the BlurHash string.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing, specifically targeting the BlurHash *decoder* with a wide range of malformed and edge-case BlurHash strings.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Consider running the decoder in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   **Up-to-Date Libraries:** Use the latest version of well-maintained decoder libraries, and ensure they are patched against known vulnerabilities.
