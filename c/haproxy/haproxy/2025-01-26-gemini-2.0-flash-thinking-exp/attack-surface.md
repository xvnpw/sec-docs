# Attack Surface Analysis for haproxy/haproxy

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Access Control Lists (ACLs)](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_access_control_lists__acls_.md)

*   **Description:** ACLs in HAProxy control access to backend servers and functionalities. Misconfigurations can lead to unintended access or bypass security policies.
*   **HAProxy Contribution:** HAProxy's core functionality relies on ACLs for routing and security. Incorrectly defined ACL rules directly create vulnerabilities within HAProxy's control.
*   **Example:** An ACL intended to block access to `/admin` panel is configured with a typo, allowing unauthorized users to access it through HAProxy.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive application areas, data breaches, privilege escalation facilitated by HAProxy's routing decisions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thoroughly review and test ACL configurations within HAProxy:** Use HAProxy's configuration testing tools and staging environments to validate ACL rules before production deployment.
    *   **Employ principle of least privilege in HAProxy ACLs:** Only grant necessary access through HAProxy ACLs, minimizing the scope of potential misconfigurations.
    *   **Use explicit `deny` rules in HAProxy ACLs where needed:** Ensure HAProxy's default behavior is to deny access unless explicitly allowed by an ACL.
    *   **Regularly audit HAProxy ACL configurations:** Periodically review and update HAProxy ACLs to reflect changing security requirements and application access policies.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Runtime API](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_runtime_api.md)

*   **Description:** HAProxy's Runtime API allows for dynamic configuration changes and monitoring. Unsecured access allows attackers to directly control HAProxy's behavior.
*   **HAProxy Contribution:** HAProxy provides the Runtime API as a management interface. Leaving it unauthenticated or weakly authenticated is a direct vulnerability in HAProxy's management plane.
*   **Example:** The HAProxy Runtime API socket is exposed on a network interface without authentication. An attacker connects and uses Runtime API commands to disable security features configured in HAProxy or redirect traffic to malicious backends.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of HAProxy's functionality and security posture, service disruption orchestrated through HAProxy, data manipulation by altering HAProxy's routing, potential access to backend servers by bypassing HAProxy's intended controls.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable strong authentication for HAProxy Runtime API:** Utilize socket permissions, ACLs within HAProxy configuration, or dedicated authentication mechanisms supported by the HAProxy version.
    *   **Restrict network access to HAProxy Runtime API:** Only allow access from trusted networks or dedicated management interfaces, limiting exposure to potential attackers.
    *   **Consider disabling HAProxy Runtime API if not actively used:** If dynamic configuration via the API is not a requirement, disable the Runtime API in HAProxy configuration to eliminate this direct attack vector.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:** Discrepancies in how HAProxy and backend servers parse HTTP request boundaries can be exploited to smuggle requests. This leverages HAProxy's role as an intermediary to bypass security controls.
*   **HAProxy Contribution:** HAProxy acts as an HTTP proxy and load balancer, parsing HTTP requests before forwarding them. Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in HAProxy's HTTP parsing logic, especially in conjunction with backend servers, can enable request smuggling through HAProxy.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that is interpreted as a single request by HAProxy but as two separate requests by the backend server due to differences in header parsing. The second smuggled request bypasses HAProxy's security checks and is processed directly by the backend.
*   **Impact:** Security bypass of HAProxy's intended controls, unauthorized access to backend resources through HAProxy, cache poisoning via HAProxy's caching mechanisms (if enabled), web application firewall (WAF) evasion when HAProxy is used in front of a WAF.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Ensure consistent HTTP parsing between HAProxy and backend servers:** Configure both HAProxy and backend servers to strictly adhere to HTTP standards and RFC specifications for request parsing.
    *   **Utilize HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 where possible with HAProxy:** These protocols are inherently less susceptible to classic HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities due to their framing mechanisms.
    *   **Enable HTTP normalization in HAProxy:** Use HAProxy's `http-request normalize-uri` and other normalization directives to standardize incoming requests processed by HAProxy, reducing parsing ambiguities.
    *   **Regularly update HAProxy and backend server software:** Patch known vulnerabilities related to HTTP parsing in both HAProxy and backend server software.

## Attack Surface: [SSL/TLS Vulnerabilities (within HAProxy and its dependencies)](./attack_surfaces/ssltls_vulnerabilities__within_haproxy_and_its_dependencies_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS protocols or the SSL/TLS libraries used by HAProxy can be exploited to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of communication secured by HAProxy.
*   **HAProxy Contribution:** HAProxy relies on SSL/TLS libraries (like OpenSSL, LibreSSL) for handling HTTPS and other secure protocols. Vulnerabilities within these libraries or in HAProxy's usage of them directly impact HAProxy's ability to provide secure communication.
*   **Example:** HAProxy is compiled against an outdated version of OpenSSL containing a known vulnerability like Heartbleed. Attackers exploit this vulnerability against HAProxy to extract sensitive data from HAProxy's memory, including SSL private keys or decrypted traffic.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches of traffic intended to be secured by HAProxy, man-in-the-middle attacks against connections proxied by HAProxy, denial of service against HAProxy by exploiting SSL/TLS processing vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Maintain up-to-date HAProxy and underlying SSL/TLS libraries:** Regularly apply security patches and updates to both HAProxy itself and the SSL/TLS libraries it depends on.
    *   **Employ strong SSL/TLS configurations within HAProxy:** Disable weak ciphers and protocols in HAProxy's SSL/TLS configuration, enforce strong key exchange algorithms, and use recommended security settings.
    *   **Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) in HAProxy:** Configure HAProxy to send HSTS headers to enforce HTTPS connections for clients, mitigating downgrade attacks.
    *   **Regularly scan for SSL/TLS vulnerabilities in HAProxy's environment:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to assess HAProxy's SSL/TLS configuration and identify potential weaknesses in its setup and dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Lua Scripting Vulnerabilities (within HAProxy, if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/lua_scripting_vulnerabilities__within_haproxy__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** Custom Lua scripts integrated into HAProxy can introduce vulnerabilities if not securely developed. This includes code injection, logic flaws, and resource exhaustion within the HAProxy context.
*   **HAProxy Contribution:** HAProxy allows the integration of Lua scripting for extending its functionality. Insecurely written Lua scripts executed within HAProxy become a direct attack surface within HAProxy's operational environment.
*   **Example:** A Lua script within HAProxy processes user-provided HTTP headers without proper sanitization and uses this data in a Lua `os.execute()` call. An attacker injects malicious commands into a crafted HTTP header, leading to command execution on the HAProxy server running the Lua script.
*   **Impact:** Code execution on the HAProxy server itself, privilege escalation if HAProxy is running with elevated privileges, data manipulation by the Lua script within HAProxy's context, denial of service against HAProxy due to resource-intensive or malicious Lua scripts.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Adopt secure Lua script development practices for HAProxy:** Follow secure coding guidelines specifically for Lua in the context of HAProxy, emphasizing input validation, output encoding, and secure API usage.
    *   **Minimize the use of external commands in HAProxy Lua scripts:** Avoid using functions like `os.execute()` or other system-level calls within Lua scripts running in HAProxy to reduce the risk of command injection.
    *   **Implement robust input validation and sanitization in HAProxy Lua scripts:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all external data processed by Lua scripts within HAProxy to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regularly review and audit HAProxy Lua scripts:** Conduct security code reviews and audits of all custom Lua scripts integrated into HAProxy to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Apply principle of least privilege to HAProxy Lua scripts:** Limit the capabilities and permissions granted to Lua scripts running within HAProxy, restricting their access to system resources and HAProxy functionalities.
