## Attack Tree Path: [Application Compromise via HAProxy Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/application_compromise_via_haproxy_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal. Success means the attacker has compromised the application, potentially gaining unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HAProxy Software Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_haproxy_software_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Identifying the HAProxy version in use (e.g., via Server header, probing).
        *   Searching public CVE databases for known vulnerabilities affecting that version.
        *   Obtaining and executing publicly available exploit code.
    *   **Why High Risk:** Public exploits are readily available for known CVEs, and if the HAProxy instance is running a vulnerable version, exploitation is relatively straightforward for attackers with moderate skills.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HAProxy Misconfiguration (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_haproxy_misconfiguration__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

**Insecure Access Control Lists (ACLs) (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Analyzing HAProxy configuration (if accessible, e.g., via exposed stats page or configuration files).
        *   Identifying weak or overly permissive ACLs that allow unauthorized access.
        *   Crafting HTTP requests to bypass ACLs and access restricted backend resources or functionalities.
    *   **Why High Risk:** Misconfigured ACLs are a common issue. If ACLs are not properly designed and tested, attackers can bypass intended access controls and reach sensitive parts of the application.

*   **Exposed HAProxy Statistics/Admin Interface (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Discovering an exposed statistics or admin interface (e.g., via port scanning, common path guessing).
        *   Attempting to access the interface with default or weak credentials (if any).
        *   Exploiting weak or missing authentication/authorization mechanisms on the interface.
        *   Gaining control over HAProxy configuration or monitoring data, potentially leading to application compromise or DoS.
    *   **Why High Risk:**  Exposing management interfaces without proper security is a critical mistake. If compromised, attackers can directly manipulate HAProxy's behavior and potentially the application.

*   **Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Weak Ciphers and Protocols (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Identifying weak ciphers and protocols supported by HAProxy (e.g., using SSL Labs, nmap).
            *   Attempting downgrade attacks to force the use of weaker ciphers or protocols.
            *   Intercepting and decrypting traffic due to the use of weak encryption.
        *   **Why High Risk:**  Using weak ciphers and protocols undermines the confidentiality of communication. Attackers can potentially decrypt sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS.

    *   **Certificate Mismanagement (e.g., Private Key Exposure, Weak Key) (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Identifying certificate details (e.g., via SSL handshake).
            *   Attempting to obtain the private key through exposed configuration files, compromised storage, or weak key generation.
            *   Using the compromised private key to impersonate the server or conduct Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
        *   **Why High Risk:**  Compromised private keys are catastrophic. They allow attackers to completely impersonate the server, intercept traffic, and potentially steal user credentials or sensitive data.

*   **Backend Server Misrouting/Exposure (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Analyzing HAProxy configuration (if accessible).
        *   Identifying misconfigured routing rules or default backend configurations.
        *   Crafting HTTP requests to target unintended backend servers or internal services that should not be publicly accessible.
    *   **Why High Risk:** Misrouting can expose internal systems and services that are not designed for public access, potentially revealing sensitive information or providing pathways for further attacks.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Configuration Flaws (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (e.g., Connection Limits, Memory Leaks due to config) (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Analyzing HAProxy configuration for resource limits (if accessible).
            *   Identifying configuration flaws that could lead to resource exhaustion (e.g., insufficient connection limits, memory leaks).
            *   Sending a large number of requests to exhaust HAProxy's resources (connections, memory, CPU), causing a denial of service.
        *   **Why High Risk:**  Misconfigured resource limits can make HAProxy vulnerable to relatively simple DoS attacks, disrupting application availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Protocol/Feature Weaknesses via HAProxy](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_protocolfeature_weaknesses_via_haproxy.md)

**HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Identifying potential request smuggling or splitting vulnerabilities in HAProxy's HTTP request parsing.
        *   Crafting specially crafted HTTP requests that exploit these vulnerabilities.
        *   Bypassing security controls implemented in HAProxy or the backend application.
        *   Accessing restricted backend resources or functionalities.
    *   **Why High Risk:** Request smuggling/splitting can lead to severe security bypasses, allowing attackers to circumvent security measures and potentially compromise backend systems.

*   **HTTP Desync Attacks (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Identifying HTTP desync vulnerabilities in HAProxy's handling of HTTP/1.1 connections.
        *   Crafting HTTP requests that cause desynchronization between HAProxy and backend servers.
        *   Achieving request hijacking, cache poisoning, or other malicious outcomes due to desynchronization.
    *   **Why High Risk:** HTTP desync attacks are complex but can have significant impact, potentially affecting multiple users and backend systems.

*   **Slowloris/Slow HTTP DoS Attacks (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Sending slow and incomplete HTTP requests to HAProxy.
        *   Exploiting HAProxy's connection handling limits by keeping connections open for extended periods.
        *   Exhausting HAProxy's connection resources and causing a denial of service.
    *   **Why High Risk:** Slowloris attacks are relatively easy to execute and can effectively cause DoS by exhausting server resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise HAProxy Infrastructure (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_haproxy_infrastructure__critical_node_.md)

**Operating System Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Identifying the operating system and version running HAProxy (e.g., via OS fingerprinting).
        *   Searching for known vulnerabilities in the identified OS version.
        *   Exploiting OS vulnerabilities to gain system-level access to the HAProxy server.
        *   Compromising HAProxy and the application running behind it.
    *   **Why High Risk:**  Compromising the underlying OS grants the attacker complete control over the HAProxy server and any applications it serves. OS vulnerabilities are a common entry point for attackers.
