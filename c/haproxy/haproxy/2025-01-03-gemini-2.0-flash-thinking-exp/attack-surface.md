# Attack Surface Analysis for haproxy/haproxy

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smuggling.md)

**Description:** Exploits discrepancies in how HAProxy and backend servers parse HTTP requests, allowing an attacker to inject malicious requests within legitimate ones.

**How HAProxy Contributes:** As a reverse proxy, HAProxy parses the initial request and forwards it. If its parsing logic differs from the backend, attackers can craft requests that are interpreted differently by each, leading to actions on behalf of other users or access to restricted resources.

**Example:** An attacker sends a crafted request with ambiguous `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers. HAProxy might forward one request, while the backend interprets it as two, allowing the attacker to inject a subsequent malicious request.

**Impact:**  Bypassing security controls, session hijacking, gaining unauthorized access, cache poisoning.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict and consistent HTTP parsing on both HAProxy and backend servers.
*   Normalize HTTP requests within HAProxy to ensure consistent interpretation.
*   Use HTTP/2 where possible, as it mitigates some forms of request smuggling.
*   Regularly update HAProxy to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [SSL/TLS Downgrade Attacks](./attack_surfaces/ssltls_downgrade_attacks.md)

**Description:** Attackers attempt to force the use of older, less secure SSL/TLS protocols or cipher suites.

**How HAProxy Contributes:** As an SSL/TLS terminator, HAProxy negotiates the connection parameters. Misconfiguration allowing weak ciphers or older TLS versions makes the application vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker uses tools to force the connection to use SSLv3 or a cipher suite with known vulnerabilities like POODLE or BEAST.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the encrypted connection.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure HAProxy to only allow strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
*   Use a strong and curated list of cipher suites, disabling weak or vulnerable ones.
*   Enable features like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to force HTTPS usage.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Security](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_security.md)

**Description:** If the HAProxy configuration file is compromised, attackers can gain full control over HAProxy's behavior and potentially the backend servers.

**How HAProxy Contributes:** The configuration file dictates how HAProxy operates. Unauthorized access allows modification of routing rules, security settings, and more.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to `haproxy.cfg` and modifies it to redirect traffic to a malicious server or to expose internal services.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially backend servers.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict access to the HAProxy configuration file using appropriate file system permissions.
*   Store the configuration file securely and consider using configuration management tools.
*   Regularly audit the configuration file for any unauthorized changes.
