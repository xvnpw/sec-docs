# Threat Model Analysis for haproxy/haproxy

## Threat: [Insecure Default Ciphers](./threats/insecure_default_ciphers.md)

**Description:** An attacker could eavesdrop on encrypted traffic if HAProxy is configured to use weak or outdated cryptographic ciphers. The attacker might perform passive decryption or exploit vulnerabilities in the weak ciphers. This directly involves HAProxy's TLS configuration.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS.

**Affected Component:** `ssl` module, specifically the `ssl-default-bind-options` and `tune.ssl.default-dh-param` settings.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure HAProxy to use strong and modern cipher suites (e.g., those supporting TLS 1.3 and PFS).
*   Disable support for older, vulnerable protocols like SSLv3 and TLS 1.0.
*   Regularly update the list of allowed ciphers based on current security recommendations.

## Threat: [Private Key Compromise](./threats/private_key_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the private key used for TLS termination *on HAProxy*. This compromise directly impacts HAProxy's ability to secure traffic.

**Impact:** Complete loss of confidentiality and integrity for encrypted traffic, potential for data manipulation and server impersonation.

**Affected Component:** The file system where the private key is stored, the `ssl` module for its usage.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store the private key securely with restricted access permissions.
*   Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) or key management systems (KMS) for enhanced protection.
*   Regularly rotate the private key and certificate.
*   Monitor access logs for any unauthorized access attempts to the key file.

## Threat: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./threats/http_request_smuggling.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests that are interpreted differently by *HAProxy* and the backend server(s). This discrepancy is a direct result of how HAProxy handles and forwards requests.

**Impact:**  Bypassing security checks, cache poisoning, unauthorized access to resources, potential for executing arbitrary commands on backend servers (depending on backend vulnerabilities).

**Affected Component:** The HTTP parsing logic within HAProxy, particularly how it handles request boundaries and header processing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure HAProxy to normalize HTTP requests.
*   Ensure that HAProxy and backend servers have consistent interpretations of HTTP specifications.
*   Disable support for ambiguous or less secure HTTP features.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_(dos)_via_connection_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods *HAProxy* with a large number of connection requests, exceeding its capacity to handle new connections. This directly targets HAProxy's connection handling capabilities.

**Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting legitimate users and potentially causing financial losses or reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** The connection handling logic within HAProxy, particularly the listeners and connection limits.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure connection limits (`maxconn`) and rate limiting (`rate-limit sessions`) in HAProxy.
*   Implement SYN cookies on the operating system to mitigate SYN flood attacks.
*   Deploy HAProxy behind a network firewall or DDoS mitigation service.
*   Monitor connection metrics and set up alerts for abnormal activity.

## Threat: [Access Control Bypass via Misconfigured ACLs](./threats/access_control_bypass_via_misconfigured_acls.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits flaws or overly permissive rules in *HAProxy's* Access Control Lists (ACLs) to bypass intended security restrictions. This is a direct consequence of HAProxy's ACL configuration.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, potential compromise of backend systems.

**Affected Component:** The ACL processing engine within HAProxy's configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design and test ACLs, ensuring they are specific and restrictive.
*   Regularly review and audit ACL configurations.
*   Avoid overly complex or ambiguous ACL rules.
*   Use logging to monitor ACL hits and misses for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Manipulation of HTTP Headers for Backend Exploitation](./threats/manipulation_of_http_headers_for_backend_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker might manipulate HTTP headers *as they pass through HAProxy* to exploit vulnerabilities in the backend servers. While the ultimate target is the backend, the manipulation happens within HAProxy's processing.

**Impact:** Potential for various backend vulnerabilities to be exploited, including code injection, authentication bypass, or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** The HTTP header processing and forwarding logic within HAProxy.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on backend vulnerabilities)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure HAProxy to remove or sanitize potentially dangerous headers before forwarding requests.
*   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to inspect and filter malicious headers.
