## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known CVEs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_cves.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify a specific version of HAProxy running and search for publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with that version. If a relevant and exploitable vulnerability is found, they attempt to execute an exploit to gain control over the HAProxy instance.
* **Steps:**
    * Identify Vulnerable HAProxy Version: Gathering information about the HAProxy version in use (e.g., through server headers, error messages, or probing).
    * Search Public Vulnerability Databases: Using the identified version to search databases like NVD for known vulnerabilities.
    * Execute Exploit [CRITICAL NODE]: Utilizing a readily available exploit or developing a custom one to target the identified vulnerability, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Security Controls (Manipulate Headers to Bypass WAF Rules)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_security_controls_(manipulate_headers_to_bypass_waf_rules).md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers craft HTTP requests with manipulated headers specifically designed to evade detection by a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that is positioned in front of or integrated with HAProxy. By successfully bypassing the WAF, they can then send malicious requests to the backend application.
* **Steps:**
    * Manipulate Headers to Bypass WAF Rules [CRITICAL NODE]: Experimenting with various header combinations, encodings, or techniques known to bypass common WAF rules (e.g., header smuggling, obfuscation, exploiting WAF parsing differences).

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Stickiness or Session Persistence (Manipulate Cookies or Session Identifiers)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_stickiness_or_session_persistence_(manipulate_cookies_or_session_identifiers).md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit the session management mechanisms of the application, often facilitated by HAProxy's stickiness features. By manipulating session cookies or other session identifiers, they can potentially hijack legitimate user sessions and gain unauthorized access to their accounts and data.
* **Steps:**
    * Manipulate Cookies or Session Identifiers [CRITICAL NODE]: Obtaining or guessing valid session identifiers and using them to impersonate a legitimate user, bypassing authentication checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses (ACL Bypass)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses_(acl_bypass).md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers analyze the HAProxy configuration, specifically the Access Control Lists (ACLs), to identify logical errors or weaknesses in their rules. They then craft HTTP requests that exploit these weaknesses to bypass the intended access restrictions and access protected resources.
* **Steps:**
    * Identify Weak or Incorrect ACL Rules: Examining the HAProxy configuration file for flaws in ACL logic, such as incorrect matching patterns, missing checks, or overly permissive rules.
    * Craft Requests to Circumvent ACLs [CRITICAL NODE]: Creating HTTP requests that specifically satisfy the conditions for bypassing the identified weak ACL rules, gaining unauthorized access to restricted parts of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses (Exposure of Administrative Interface)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses_(exposure_of_administrative_interface).md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers discover that the administrative interface of HAProxy is accessible, either due to misconfiguration or lack of proper access controls. They then attempt to gain access to this interface, often by exploiting weak or default credentials, which would grant them full control over the HAProxy instance.
* **Steps:**
    * Identify Accessible Administrative Interface: Scanning for common or default paths associated with the HAProxy administrative interface.
    * Exploit Weak or Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]: Attempting to log in to the administrative interface using default credentials or through brute-force attacks on weak passwords.
