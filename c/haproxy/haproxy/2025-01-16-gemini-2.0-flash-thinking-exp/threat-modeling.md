# Threat Model Analysis for haproxy/haproxy

## Threat: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./threats/http_request_smuggling.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests that are interpreted differently by HAProxy and the backend server. This allows the attacker to inject additional requests that bypass HAProxy's security checks and are processed directly by the backend.

**Impact:** Circumvention of security controls, potential for unauthorized access to backend resources, execution of arbitrary code on backend servers (depending on backend vulnerabilities).

**Affected Component:** HTTP request parsing and forwarding logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure HAProxy and backend servers have consistent HTTP parsing configurations.
* Use the `option httplog` directive to log full requests for analysis and detection.
* Implement strict HTTP validation on both HAProxy and backend servers.
* Consider using HTTP/2 which is less susceptible to request smuggling.

## Threat: [Default or Weak Statistics Page Credentials](./threats/default_or_weak_statistics_page_credentials.md)

**Description:** An administrator uses default credentials or sets weak passwords for the HAProxy statistics page authentication. Attackers can easily guess or brute-force these credentials to gain access to sensitive information.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information like backend server IPs, port numbers, health status, and traffic volume. This information can be used to plan further attacks against backend systems or to understand the application's architecture.

**Affected Component:** `stats auth` directive, user authentication mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies for the statistics page authentication.
* Regularly rotate the credentials for the statistics page.
* Avoid using default credentials provided in documentation or examples.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Connection Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_connection_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a large number of connection requests to HAProxy, exhausting its connection limits and preventing legitimate users from connecting.

**Impact:** Service unavailability, inability for legitimate users to access the application.

**Affected Component:** Connection management, listener processes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure appropriate connection limits in HAProxy using directives like `maxconn`.
* Implement rate limiting on incoming connections using ACLs and `tcp-request connection rate-limit`.
* Use SYN cookies to mitigate SYN flood attacks.
* Consider using a DDoS mitigation service in front of HAProxy.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known HAProxy Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_known_haproxy_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific version of HAProxy being used.

**Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep HAProxy updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
* Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor for announcements of new vulnerabilities.
* Implement a vulnerability management program to regularly scan and address known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to HAProxy Configuration Files](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_haproxy_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the server hosting HAProxy and modifies the configuration files directly.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of HAProxy functionality, ability to redirect traffic, disable security features, expose backend servers.

**Affected Component:** Configuration file parsing and loading.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls on the server hosting HAProxy.
* Restrict file system permissions for HAProxy configuration files.
* Use configuration management tools to manage and audit configuration changes.
* Consider storing sensitive configuration details (like TLS certificates) securely using secrets management solutions.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) on Backend Connections](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__on_backend_connections.md)

**Description:** If the connection between HAProxy and backend servers is not encrypted (e.g., using HTTP instead of HTTPS), an attacker on the network can intercept and potentially modify traffic.

**Impact:** Data breaches, manipulation of data sent to backend servers, potential for unauthorized actions.

**Affected Component:** Backend connection handling, SSL/TLS configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use HTTPS for communication between HAProxy and backend servers.
* Configure HAProxy to verify the SSL/TLS certificates of backend servers.
* Ensure proper certificate management and rotation.
