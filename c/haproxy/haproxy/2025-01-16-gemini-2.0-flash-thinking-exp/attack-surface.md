# Attack Surface Analysis for haproxy/haproxy

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** HAProxy is deployed with default settings that are not secure for production environments.
    *   **How HAProxy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** HAProxy's default configuration might include weak or default credentials for management interfaces, overly permissive access controls, or insecure default ports.
    *   **Example:** The statistics interface is accessible without authentication on the default port, revealing sensitive information about backend servers and traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to management functions, potential for service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Change default credentials for the statistics interface and runtime API.
        *   Configure strong authentication mechanisms for management interfaces.
        *   Restrict access to management interfaces to specific IP addresses or networks.
        *   Disable or change default ports for management interfaces if not needed.
        *   Review and harden all default configuration settings before deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured SSL/TLS](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_ssltls.md)

*   **Description:** HAProxy is configured with weak or outdated SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers, or with incorrect certificate handling.
    *   **How HAProxy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** HAProxy is responsible for SSL/TLS termination in many deployments. Misconfiguration here directly exposes the application to SSL/TLS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** HAProxy is configured to allow the use of SSLv3 or weak ciphers like RC4, making it vulnerable to attacks like POODLE or BEAST.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, compromise of confidentiality and integrity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce the use of strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   Configure a strong and secure cipher suite, disabling weak or vulnerable ciphers.
        *   Ensure proper SSL/TLS certificate management, including using valid certificates from trusted CAs.
        *   Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to force secure connections.
        *   Configure OCSP stapling to improve certificate validation performance and privacy.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit discrepancies in how HAProxy and backend servers parse HTTP requests, allowing them to inject malicious requests.
    *   **How HAProxy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** As a reverse proxy, HAProxy forwards requests to backend servers. If HAProxy and the backend have different interpretations of request boundaries (e.g., Content-Length vs. Transfer-Encoding), smuggling can occur.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that HAProxy interprets as one request, but the backend interprets as two, allowing the attacker to inject a second, potentially harmful request.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access, performing actions on behalf of other users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure HAProxy and backend servers have consistent HTTP parsing behavior.
        *   Normalize requests in HAProxy before forwarding them to backends.
        *   Disable support for ambiguous HTTP features like chunked encoding if not strictly necessary.
        *   Implement strict request validation on both HAProxy and backend servers.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Management Interfaces (Statistics Interface, Runtime API)](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_management_interfaces__statistics_interface__runtime_api_.md)

*   **Description:** HAProxy's management interfaces are exposed without proper authentication or authorization.
    *   **How HAProxy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** HAProxy provides interfaces for monitoring and managing its operation. If these are not secured, attackers can gain control or access sensitive information.
    *   **Example:** The statistics interface is accessible without authentication, revealing information about backend server status, traffic patterns, and potentially sensitive configuration details. The runtime API is exposed without authentication, allowing attackers to reconfigure HAProxy or disrupt service.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized configuration changes, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication (e.g., username/password, client certificates) for the statistics interface and runtime API.
        *   Restrict access to these interfaces to specific IP addresses or networks.
        *   Disable these interfaces if they are not required.
        *   Use HTTPS to encrypt communication with these interfaces.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can overwhelm HAProxy with a large number of requests, exhausting its resources and causing a denial of service.
    *   **How HAProxy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** As the entry point for traffic, HAProxy is a target for DoS attacks. Misconfigured timeouts or lack of rate limiting can exacerbate this.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of SYN packets or HTTP requests to HAProxy, exceeding its connection limits and preventing legitimate users from accessing the application.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting business operations and user experience.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure appropriate timeouts for client and server connections.
        *   Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source.
        *   Use connection limits to prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or DDoS mitigation service in front of HAProxy.
