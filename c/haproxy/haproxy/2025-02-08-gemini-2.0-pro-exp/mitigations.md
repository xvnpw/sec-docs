# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for haproxy/haproxy

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict ACL Implementation and Management (HAProxy-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_acl_implementation_and_management__haproxy-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** **Strict ACL Implementation and Management (HAProxy-Specific)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`deny all` in Frontends/Backends:**  Start with `default_backend no_backend` (or a similar "deny" backend) in each `frontend` and a `http-request deny` or `tcp-request connection reject` as the *first* rule in each `backend` and `frontend`.
        2.  **Specific ACL Rules:** Create individual ACL rules using HAProxy's `acl` directive.  Define conditions based on:
            *   `src`: Source IP address/network.
            *   `dst`: Destination IP address/network.
            *   `dst_port`: Destination port.
            *   `method`: HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
            *   `path_beg`, `path_end`, `path_reg`: URL path matching (beginning, ending, regular expression).
            *   `hdr(header_name)`:  HTTP header values (use with caution and validation).
        3.  **ACL Ordering:** Place more specific ACLs *before* more general ones. HAProxy uses a first-match system.
        4.  **`use_backend` and `block`:** Use `use_backend <backend_name> if <acl_name>` to direct traffic based on ACLs. Use `http-request deny if <acl_name>` or `tcp-request connection reject if <acl_name>` to block traffic.
        5.  **HAProxy Logging for Testing:** Use HAProxy's logging (`log global` and `log <address> <facility> [<level>]`) to verify ACL behavior during testing.  Analyze logs to confirm allowed and blocked traffic.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):**  Directly prevents unauthorized access via HAProxy.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium-High):**  Limits access to internal resources exposed through HAProxy.
        *   **Bypassing Security Controls (Severity: High):**  Ensures HAProxy enforces access restrictions.
        *   **Request Smuggling/Splitting (Severity: High):**  Can be part of a multi-layered defense.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (potentially eliminated with perfect implementation).
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Request Smuggling/Splitting:** Risk reduced (in conjunction with other mitigations).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented in `frontend http-in` and `backend api_servers`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Missing comprehensive "deny all" defaults.
        *   Insufficient negative testing using HAProxy logs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting Prevention (HAProxy-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/http_request_smugglingsplitting_prevention__haproxy-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** **HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting Prevention (HAProxy-Specific)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`option http-ignore-probes`:**  Add this to the `defaults` or `frontend` section.
        2.  **`option http-use-htx`:** Add this to the `defaults` or `frontend` section to enable the HTX engine.
        3.  **`http-request disable-l7-retry` (Conditional):**  If L7 retries are *not* essential, add this to the relevant `frontend` or `backend`.
        4.  **Header Manipulation:** Use HAProxy's header directives:
            *   `http-request set-header <header> <value>`:  Set or overwrite a header.
            *   `http-request del-header <header>`:  Delete a header.
            *   `http-request replace-header <header> <regex> <replacement>`:  Rewrite a header using a regular expression.
            *   Use these to remove or rewrite ambiguous headers like conflicting `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`.  Enforce strict header validation.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Request Smuggling/Splitting (Severity: High):**  The primary focus.
        *   **Cache Poisoning (Severity: High):**  Prevents cache poisoning.
        *   **Request Hijacking (Severity: High):**  Prevents request hijacking.
        *   **Bypassing Security Controls (Severity: High):**  Prevents bypassing security.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Request Smuggling/Splitting:** Risk significantly reduced (potentially eliminated).
        *   **Cache Poisoning:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Request Hijacking:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Risk significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `option http-ignore-probes` is enabled.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `option http-use-htx` is not enabled.
        *   `http-request disable-l7-retry` is not implemented.
        *   Comprehensive header manipulation rules are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [DoS Protection (HAProxy-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/dos_protection__haproxy-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** **DoS Protection (HAProxy-Specific)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`timeout client` and `timeout server`:** Set these in `defaults`, `frontend`, and `backend` sections.  Use short values (e.g., seconds) to prevent slow clients from holding connections open.
        2.  **`maxconn` (Global and Frontend):**  Limit concurrent connections globally (`global` section) and per frontend (`frontend` section).
        3.  **`rate-limit sessions`:**  Use this in the `frontend` section to limit the *rate* of new connections from a single IP address.  Example: `rate-limit sessions 10` (limit to 10 new connections per period).
        4.  **Stick Tables and ACLs:**
            *   `stick-table type ip size 1m expire 30m store gpc0,conn_rate(3s)`:  Create a stick table to track IP addresses and their connection rates.
            *   `tcp-request connection track-sc0 src`:  Track the source IP in stick table slot 0.
            *   `acl is_dos_attacker sc0_conn_rate gt 100`:  Create an ACL to identify IPs exceeding a connection rate (e.g., 100 connections in 3 seconds).
            *   `tcp-request connection reject if is_dos_attacker`:  Reject connections from IPs flagged by the ACL.
        5.  **`tune.bufsize` and `tune.maxrewrite`:**  Adjust these in the `global` section.  Incorrect values can increase vulnerability to certain DoS attacks.  Refer to HAProxy documentation for appropriate values based on your environment.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Slowloris (Severity: High):**  Mitigated by timeouts and rate limiting.
        *   **Connection Exhaustion (Severity: High):**  Mitigated by `maxconn` and stick table-based blocking.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):**  Mitigated by a combination of all the above.
        *   **Application-Layer DoS (Severity: Medium-High):**  Can help, especially with stick tables.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Slowloris:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Connection Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Application-Layer DoS:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic `timeout client` and `timeout server` values are set.
        *   `maxconn` is set globally.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `rate-limit sessions` is not implemented.
        *   Stick tables and associated ACLs are not used.
        *   `tune.bufsize` and `tune.maxrewrite` have not been optimized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Information Leakage Prevention (HAProxy-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/information_leakage_prevention__haproxy-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** **Information Leakage Prevention (HAProxy-Specific)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`http-response set-header Server <generic_value>`:**  Use this in the `frontend` or `backend` to modify the `Server` header.  Replace it with something generic (e.g., "Web Server") or remove it entirely.
        2.  **`errorfile`:**  Use this directive to define custom error pages.  Avoid displaying detailed error information.
        3.  **`http-response del-header <header_name>`:**  Remove any other potentially sensitive headers before sending responses.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium-High):**  Reduces leakage of backend details.
        *   **Reconnaissance (Severity: Medium):**  Makes reconnaissance harder.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Reconnaissance:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic `errorfile` configuration exists.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `http-response set-header Server` is not used.
        *   Comprehensive header removal with `http-response del-header` is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Stick Table Usage (HAProxy-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_stick_table_usage__haproxy-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** **Secure Stick Table Usage (HAProxy-Specific)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`size` Parameter:**  Carefully choose the `size` of the stick table (number of entries).  It should be large enough for expected usage but not excessively large.
        2.  **`expire` Parameter:**  Set a reasonable `expire` time for entries to prevent stale entries from accumulating.
        3.  **Simple Keys:**  Use simple keys (e.g., `src` for source IP) for efficiency.
        4.  **Monitor via Stats Page:**  Regularly check stick table usage on the HAProxy stats page (see next mitigation).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):**  Prevents excessive memory use.
        *   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium):**  Ensures stick table operations are efficient.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Low-Medium):**  Indirectly, by encouraging good practices.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (if sensitive data is not stored directly).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   No stick tables are currently in use.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   All aspects are missing, as stick tables are not used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Stats Page Access (HAProxy-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_stats_page_access__haproxy-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** **Secure Stats Page Access (HAProxy-Specific)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **ACLs:** Use ACLs to restrict access to the stats page.  Example:
            ```haproxy
            frontend stats
                bind *:8404
                stats enable
                stats uri /stats
                stats refresh 10s
                acl allowed_ip src 192.168.1.0/24  # Allow only this network
                http-request deny if !allowed_ip
                stats auth admin:password  # Basic authentication
            ```
        2.  **`stats auth`:**  Require authentication (username and password).
        3.  **Separate Frontend (Optional):**  Use a different `frontend` with a different `bind` address/port.
        4.  **`stats enable` (Conditional):**  If you *don't* need the stats page, remove this directive entirely.
        5. **HTTPS:** Use `bind` with `ssl` and `crt` options to enable the HTTPS.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):**  Prevents unauthorized access to stats.
        *   **Reconnaissance (Severity: Medium):**  Makes reconnaissance harder.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Reconnaissance:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Stats page is enabled.
        *   Basic authentication (`stats auth`) is implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   ACL-based access restriction is not implemented.
        *   A separate frontend is not used.
        *   HTTPS is not used.
