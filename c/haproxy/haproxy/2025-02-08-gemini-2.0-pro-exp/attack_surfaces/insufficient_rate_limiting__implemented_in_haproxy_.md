# Deep Analysis: Insufficient Rate Limiting in HAProxy

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Insufficient Rate Limiting" vulnerability within the context of an HAProxy deployment.  This includes identifying specific misconfigurations, weaknesses, and potential attack vectors that exploit this vulnerability.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations for secure configuration and mitigation.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on rate limiting mechanisms *within HAProxy itself*.  It does not cover rate limiting implemented at other layers (e.g., application code, web application firewalls, or cloud provider services), except to briefly discuss how HAProxy's rate limiting can interact with those layers.  The scope includes:

*   **HAProxy Configuration:**  Analyzing `haproxy.cfg` for relevant directives related to stick-tables, ACLs, and other rate-limiting features.
*   **HAProxy Versions:**  Considering potential differences in rate-limiting capabilities and best practices across different HAProxy versions (focusing on commonly used, supported versions).
*   **Attack Scenarios:**  Examining specific attack scenarios that exploit insufficient rate limiting, focusing on how HAProxy's configuration (or lack thereof) enables these attacks.

7.  **Monitoring and Logging Guidance:**  Explain how to configure HAProxy's logging and statistics to detect and respond to rate-limiting issues.
8.  **Testing Recommendations:** Suggest methods for testing the effectiveness of implemented rate limits.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1 Configuration Review and Common Misconfigurations

A common root cause of insufficient rate limiting is simply *not configuring it at all*.  A default HAProxy installation provides no inherent rate limiting.  Other common misconfigurations include:

*   **Missing `stick-table` Definitions:**  The `stick-table` directive is fundamental to HAProxy's rate limiting.  If it's absent, no tracking of request rates occurs.
*   **Incorrect `stick-table` `type`:** Using an inappropriate `type` (e.g., `ip` when tracking per-user is needed) renders the rate limiting ineffective.
*   **Missing `store` Directives:**  The `store` directive specifies what to track (e.g., `http_req_rate(10s)`).  Without it, the stick-table is useless for rate limiting.
*   **Insufficient `size`:**  A `stick-table` that's too small will quickly fill up, leading to inaccurate tracking and potential bypasses.  The size should be chosen based on expected traffic and the number of unique entities being tracked.
*   **Overly Permissive ACLs:**  Even with a properly configured stick-table, overly permissive ACLs can negate its effects.  For example, an ACL that allows all traffic without checking the stick-table's rate limits.
*   **Ignoring HTTP Methods:**  Rate limiting should often be applied differently to different HTTP methods.  For example, `POST` requests to a login endpoint should be more strictly limited than `GET` requests to a static asset.
*   **Lack of Granularity:**  Applying a single, global rate limit to all traffic is often insufficient.  Different endpoints and users may require different limits.
* **Ignoring http_req_rate vs http_conn_rate:** Not using correct rate. `http_req_rate` is for HTTP requests, `http_conn_rate` is for connections.

### 2.2 Attack Vector Analysis

*   **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Without rate limiting on `/login`, `/admin`, or similar endpoints, an attacker can make thousands of attempts to guess usernames and passwords.  HAProxy, if properly configured, can track the number of requests from a given IP or user and block further attempts after a threshold is reached.

*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  An attacker might target an endpoint that performs a complex database query or image processing.  Without rate limiting, they can flood this endpoint, consuming server resources and causing a denial of service.  HAProxy can limit the rate of requests to these specific endpoints.

*   **Application-Layer DoS:**  Attackers can exploit application-specific logic to cause a denial of service.  For example, repeatedly triggering a resource-intensive search function.  HAProxy can be configured to limit the rate of requests to these vulnerable application features.

*   **API Rate Limit Bypass:**  If an API is protected by rate limits *only* at the application level, an attacker might be able to bypass these limits if HAProxy is not also configured to enforce them.  HAProxy can provide an additional layer of defense.

### 2.3 Stick-Table Deep Dive

Stick-tables are the core of HAProxy's rate limiting.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **`type` Options:**
    *   `ip`: Tracks based on the source IP address.  Good for general rate limiting but vulnerable to attackers using multiple IPs.
    *   `string`: Tracks based on an arbitrary string, often extracted from the request (e.g., a username, API key, or session ID).  Allows for per-user or per-resource rate limiting.
    *   `integer`: Tracks based on an integer value, useful for scenarios where you have a numerical identifier.
    *   `binary`: Tracks based on a binary key.

*   **`store` Directives:**  These define *what* is tracked and stored in the stick-table.  Crucial for rate limiting:
    *   `http_req_rate(period)`: Tracks the rate of HTTP requests over the specified `period` (e.g., `10s`, `1m`).
    *   `http_conn_rate(period)`: Tracks the rate of new connections.
    *   `gpc0`, `gpc1`: General-purpose counters, which can be incremented by ACLs and used for custom rate limiting logic.
    *   `bytes_out_rate(period)`:  Tracks the rate of outgoing bytes.
    *   `conn_cur`: Tracks the current number of connections.

*   **Common Errors:**
    *   **Mismatched `type` and `store`:**  Using `type ip` but trying to store a username (a string) will not work.
    *   **Incorrect Period:**  Using a period that's too short (e.g., `1s`) might be too sensitive, while a period that's too long (e.g., `1h`) might be ineffective.
    *   **Not Using `track-sc[0-2]`:** The `track-sc[0-2]` directives in the `frontend` or `backend` are essential to link the stick-table to the request processing. Without these, the stick-table is defined but not used.

*   **Memory Considerations:**  Each entry in a stick-table consumes memory.  The `size` parameter should be chosen carefully to balance effectiveness and memory usage.  HAProxy provides statistics on stick-table usage, which can be used to monitor and adjust the size.

### 2.4 ACL Analysis

ACLs (Access Control Lists) are used to define conditions and actions.  They are essential for using stick-table data to enforce rate limits.  Examples:

```
# Define an ACL that checks if the request rate from an IP exceeds 10 requests per second.
acl exceeds_rate  src_http_req_rate(my_stick_table)  gt 10

# Define an ACL that checks if a specific URL path is being accessed.
acl is_login_page  path_beg /login

# Use the ACLs to deny requests that exceed the rate limit.
http-request deny  if is_login_page exceeds_rate
```

Common ACL-related issues:

*   **Incorrect Comparison Operators:**  Using `lt` (less than) instead of `gt` (greater than) when checking rate limits.
*   **Missing ACLs:**  Defining a stick-table but not creating ACLs to use it.
*   **Logic Errors:**  Complex ACL logic can be prone to errors, leading to unintended behavior.

### 2.5 Dynamic Threshold Analysis

HAProxy doesn't have built-in, fully automatic dynamic thresholds in the same way some dedicated rate-limiting tools do. However, you can achieve *pseudo-dynamic* behavior using a combination of features:

1.  **Lua Scripting:** HAProxy supports Lua scripting, which allows you to write custom logic to adjust rate limits based on various factors (e.g., server load, time of day, or external data sources). This is the most flexible approach.

2.  **Map Files:** You can use map files to store thresholds and update them externally (e.g., using a script that monitors server load). HAProxy can then use these map files in ACLs to dynamically adjust rate limits.

3.  **Stick-Table Counters and ACLs:** You can use stick-table counters (like `gpc0`) to track metrics (e.g., the number of errors in the last minute) and then use ACLs to adjust rate limits based on these counters. This is less flexible than Lua but simpler to implement.

Example (Conceptual - using stick-table counters):

```
# In the frontend:
stick-table type ip size 1M expire 1m store gpc0,http_req_rate(10s)
track-sc0 src

# In the backend:
# Increment gpc0 if a 5xx error occurs
http-response set-var(sess.gpc0)  inc(sess.gpc0)  if { status ge 500 }

# In the frontend:
# Define ACLs based on gpc0
acl high_error_rate  sc0_gpc0 gt 100
acl normal_rate_limit  src_http_req_rate(my_stick_table) gt 10
acl reduced_rate_limit src_http_req_rate(my_stick_table) gt 5

# Apply different rate limits based on error rate
http-request deny if normal_rate_limit !high_error_rate
http-request deny if reduced_rate_limit high_error_rate
```

### 2.6 Mitigation Recommendations

*   **Implement Stick-Tables:**  Use stick-tables to track request rates. Choose the appropriate `type` and `store` directives based on your needs.
*   **Use Specific ACLs:**  Create ACLs that accurately identify the traffic you want to rate limit (e.g., specific endpoints, HTTP methods, or user agents).
*   **Layer Rate Limits:**  Implement rate limiting at multiple levels:
    *   **Per IP:**  A basic defense against simple flooding attacks.
    *   **Per User/Session:**  More granular control, preventing individual users from abusing the system.
    *   **Per Endpoint:**  Protect specific resources that are vulnerable to abuse.
*   **Set Realistic Thresholds:**  Choose rate limits that are appropriate for your application and expected traffic.  Too low, and you'll block legitimate users; too high, and the rate limiting will be ineffective.
*   **Use `http_req_rate` and `http_conn_rate` Appropriately:** Use `http_req_rate` for limiting the number of requests and `http_conn_rate` for limiting the number of connections.
*   **Consider Dynamic Thresholds:** Explore using Lua scripting, map files, or stick-table counters to implement dynamic rate limits.
*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Use load testing tools to verify that your rate limits are working as expected and that they don't block legitimate traffic.
*   **Fail Open or Fail Closed:** Decide whether to allow or deny traffic when the stick-table is full.  `option  stick-table-fail-open` controls this behavior. The default is to fail closed (deny).
* **Use `tcp-request content` rules:** Use `tcp-request content` rules in the `frontend` to apply stick-table tracking and rate limiting before the full HTTP request is parsed. This can help mitigate slowloris and other connection-based attacks.

**Example Configuration Snippet:**

```
frontend http_front
    bind *:80
    mode http

    # Stick-table for tracking request rates by IP
    stick-table type ip size 1M expire 1m store http_req_rate(10s)
    tcp-request connection track-sc1 src
    tcp-request content track-sc0 src

    # ACL to check if the request rate exceeds 100 requests per 10 seconds
    acl exceeds_ip_rate  src_http_req_rate(http_front)  gt 100

    # ACL for login page
    acl is_login_page  path_beg /login

    # Stick-table for tracking login attempts by username (extracted from POST data)
    stick-table type string len 32 size 100k expire 1m store http_req_rate(60s)
    http-request track-sc2 req.body_param(username) if is_login_page

    # ACL to check if login attempts exceed 5 per minute
    acl exceeds_login_rate  sc2_http_req_rate(http_front)  gt 5

    # Deny requests based on rate limits
    http-request deny if exceeds_ip_rate
    http-request deny if is_login_page exceeds_login_rate

    default_backend http_back

backend http_back
    mode http
    server server1 192.168.1.10:80 check
```

### 2.7 Monitoring and Logging Guidance

*   **HAProxy Statistics:**  Enable HAProxy's statistics page (`stats enable`).  This provides real-time information about stick-table usage, request rates, and other metrics.  Monitor the `sc0_http_req_rate`, `sc1_http_req_rate`, and `sc2_http_req_rate` (and similar) values to see current request rates. Also, monitor stick-table utilization (`use`, `entries`).

*   **Logging:**  Configure HAProxy to log relevant information, including:
    *   Denied requests due to rate limiting.  Use the `log` directive in conjunction with your ACLs.  For example: `http-request deny  if exceeds_rate log`
    *   Stick-table events (e.g., creation, deletion, and updates).

*   **External Monitoring:**  Use external monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) to collect and visualize HAProxy metrics.  This allows you to set up alerts for unusual traffic patterns or rate-limiting events.

### 2.8 Testing Recommendations

*   **Load Testing Tools:**  Use tools like `ab` (Apache Bench), `wrk`, `JMeter`, or `Locust` to simulate high traffic loads and test the effectiveness of your rate limits.

*   **Targeted Tests:**  Create specific tests that target the endpoints and scenarios you want to protect.  For example, simulate brute-force login attempts or requests to resource-intensive endpoints.

*   **Varying Traffic Patterns:**  Test with different traffic patterns, including:
    *   Constant load.
    *   Bursts of traffic.
    *   Gradually increasing load.

*   **Monitor HAProxy Statistics:**  During testing, monitor HAProxy's statistics page to see how the stick-tables are behaving and to identify any potential issues.

*   **Test Edge Cases:**  Test scenarios where the stick-table is full or where requests are just below the rate limit.

* **Test with multiple source IPs:** Use tools that can simulate traffic from multiple source IPs to test IP-based rate limiting.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the "Insufficient Rate Limiting" vulnerability in HAProxy and offers actionable steps to mitigate it. Remember to tailor the configurations and recommendations to your specific application and environment. Regularly review and update your rate-limiting configuration as your application evolves and traffic patterns change.
