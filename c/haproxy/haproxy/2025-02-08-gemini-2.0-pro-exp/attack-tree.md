## Attack Tree Path: [1. Disrupt Service Availability [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__disrupt_service_availability__high_risk_.md)

*   **DoS/DDoS (AND):** Attacks aimed at overwhelming HAProxy or backend servers, making the service unavailable.
    *   **HTTP Flood Attacks [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Sending a massive volume of seemingly legitimate HTTP requests to exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, connections).
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Slowloris Attacks [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Establishing numerous connections to HAProxy but sending only partial HTTP requests, keeping the connections open and consuming resources.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Resource Exhaustion via Configuration:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting overly permissive HAProxy configurations (e.g., extremely high `maxconn`, large buffers) to cause resource exhaustion on the HAProxy server itself.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

* **Exploit Vulnerability:**
    * **Description:** Leveraging a known or, more critically, a zero-day vulnerability in the HAProxy code to cause a denial of service.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** Very High
    * **Effort:** High
    * **Skill Level:** Expert
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

*   **Misconfiguration {CRITICAL}:**
    *   **Description:** Errors in the HAProxy configuration that make it more susceptible to DoS attacks. Examples include not setting appropriate timeouts, connection limits, or rate limits.
    *   This is a critical node because it amplifies the effectiveness of other DoS attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Gain Unauthorized Access/Data [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__gain_unauthorized_accessdata__high_risk_.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerability in HAProxy [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting a known or zero-day vulnerability in HAProxy to gain unauthorized access to the system or data. Zero-day vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

*   **Compromise Backend via HAProxy [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** Using HAProxy as a stepping stone to attack backend servers. This often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the backend applications, but HAProxy's configuration can influence the success of these attacks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **Misconfiguration - Weak Auth/Authz:**
    *   **Description:** Exposing HAProxy's statistics page or API without proper authentication or with weak credentials, allowing an attacker to gain access to sensitive information or control HAProxy.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

* **Misconfiguration {CRITICAL}:**
    * **Description:** General misconfiguration of HAProxy that can lead to unauthorized access. This includes weak ACLs, improper header handling, and lack of input validation at the HAProxy level.
    * This is a critical node because it can facilitate various attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access.
