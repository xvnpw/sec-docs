# Attack Surface Analysis for haproxy/haproxy

## Attack Surface: [ACL Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/acl_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured Access Control Lists (ACLs) within HAProxy allow unauthorized access to backend resources or expose sensitive information. This is a *direct* function of HAProxy's configuration.
*   **HAProxy Contribution:** HAProxy's ACL engine is the *sole* component responsible for enforcing access control based on these rules.  Errors here directly and immediately expose the application.
*   **Example:** An ACL intended to block access to `/admin` fails due to a typo (`/admn`), allowing attackers to access the administrative interface *through HAProxy*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, system compromise, data modification/deletion.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum necessary access *within HAProxy's ACLs*.
    *   **Deny-by-Default:** Start with a default deny rule in HAProxy, then explicitly allow specific traffic.
    *   **Regular Expression Validation:** Carefully validate any regular expressions used in HAProxy's ACLs.
    *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test HAProxy's ACLs with various inputs, including malicious ones.
    *   **Automated Validation:** Use tools to automatically check HAProxy's ACL syntax and logic.
    *   **Auditing:** Regularly review and audit HAProxy's ACL configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched HAProxy Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_haproxy_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Running an outdated version of *HAProxy itself* that contains known security vulnerabilities.
*   **HAProxy Contribution:** The vulnerability exists *within the HAProxy software*. This is not a configuration issue, but a flaw in the HAProxy code.
*   **Example:** A known buffer overflow vulnerability in an older HAProxy version allows remote code execution *on the HAProxy instance*.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise (of the HAProxy instance and potentially the backend), data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Update HAProxy to the latest stable release promptly. This is the *primary* mitigation.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners to identify outdated HAProxy installations.
    *   **Security Advisories:** Subscribe to HAProxy security advisories and mailing lists.
    *   **Patch Management Process:** Implement a formal process for applying security patches to HAProxy.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Rate Limiting (Implemented in HAProxy)](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_rate_limiting__implemented_in_haproxy_.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of or inadequate rate limiting *configured within HAProxy* allows attackers to flood the server with requests.
*   **HAProxy Contribution:** HAProxy provides built-in rate limiting features (stick-tables, etc.).  Failure to utilize these *HAProxy features* or configuring them improperly is the direct cause of the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends thousands of requests per second to a login endpoint, overwhelming the backend server *because HAProxy is not configured to limit the rate*.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS), resource exhaustion, application unavailability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stick Tables:** Utilize HAProxy's stick-tables to track and limit requests based on various criteria (IP, user, etc.). This is a *HAProxy-specific* mitigation.
    *   **Multi-Layered Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at multiple levels within HAProxy (e.g., per IP, per user, per endpoint).
    *   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Consider using dynamic rate limits within HAProxy that adjust based on current traffic conditions.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor HAProxy's rate limiting effectiveness and adjust thresholds as needed.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Timeout Configuration (Within HAProxy)](./attack_surfaces/improper_timeout_configuration__within_haproxy_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect timeout settings *within HAProxy* can lead to resource exhaustion or slowloris-type attacks.
*   **HAProxy Contribution:** HAProxy's timeout settings (`timeout client`, `timeout server`, etc.) *directly* control connection handling and are the source of this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** `timeout client` in HAProxy is set too high, allowing an attacker to open many connections to HAProxy and hold them open with slow data transmission (slowloris), exhausting HAProxy's resources.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, resource exhaustion (of HAProxy), application unavailability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Tune Timeouts:** Carefully tune `timeout client`, `timeout server`, `timeout connect`, and `timeout http-request` *within the HAProxy configuration* based on application needs.
    *   **Short Timeouts:** Favor shorter timeouts in HAProxy where possible to prevent resource holding.
    *   **Slowloris Protection:** Combine short timeouts with rate limiting *within HAProxy* to mitigate slowloris attacks.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor HAProxy's connection counts and resource usage to detect potential timeout-related issues.
