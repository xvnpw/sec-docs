### High and Critical HAProxy Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical severity threats that directly involve HAProxy:

*   **Threat:** Insecure TLS Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack by downgrading the connection to a weaker, vulnerable protocol or cipher suite. This allows them to intercept and potentially decrypt sensitive data transmitted between the client and the backend server.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data exfiltration, potential manipulation of data in transit.
    *   **Affected Component:** SSL/TLS configuration within the `frontend` or `listen` sections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure HAProxy to use only strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   Utilize strong and secure cipher suites, disabling weak or vulnerable ones.
        *   Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to force clients to use HTTPS.
        *   Configure and enable OCSP stapling to improve TLS handshake performance and security.

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Access Control List (ACL) Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker can bypass intended security measures or gain unauthorized access to specific backend servers or functionalities due to poorly configured ACLs. This could involve accessing restricted parts of the application or exploiting vulnerabilities in specific backends.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, potential data breaches, compromise of backend servers.
    *   **Affected Component:** The ACL processing engine within HAProxy's `frontend`, `backend`, or `listen` sections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design and test ACLs to ensure they enforce the intended access control policies.
        *   Use the principle of least privilege when defining ACLs.
        *   Regularly review and audit ACL configurations.

*   **Threat:** HTTP Request Smuggling
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits discrepancies in how HAProxy and backend servers parse HTTP requests to inject malicious requests. This can lead to bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access, or even executing commands on backend servers.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation, potential remote code execution on backend servers.
    *   **Affected Component:** The HTTP parsing and forwarding logic within HAProxy.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure HAProxy and backend servers have consistent HTTP parsing configurations.
        *   Use the `option httplog` with appropriate format strings to detect anomalies.
        *   Implement strict request validation on both HAProxy and backend servers.
        *   Consider using `option http-server-close` or `option forceclose` to prevent connection reuse in vulnerable scenarios.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Connection Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker floods HAProxy with a large number of connection requests, exhausting its connection limits and preventing legitimate clients from connecting.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** Connection management within HAProxy.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure appropriate `maxconn` limits in the `global` and `frontend` sections.
        *   Implement rate limiting on incoming connections.
        *   Use SYN cookies to mitigate SYN flood attacks.
        *   Consider using a dedicated DDoS mitigation service in front of HAProxy.

*   **Threat:** Slowloris Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends incomplete HTTP requests slowly, keeping many connections open and exhausting HAProxy's resources, preventing it from handling legitimate requests.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** Connection management and timeout handling within HAProxy.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure aggressive timeouts for client requests (`timeout client`).
        *   Implement connection limits and rate limiting.
        *   Consider using a WAF or reverse proxy with built-in Slowloris protection.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting HAProxy Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities in the HAProxy software itself (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs, logic errors) to gain unauthorized access, cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the HAProxy instance, potential access to backend servers, service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various modules and functions within the HAProxy codebase depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep HAProxy updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories related to HAProxy.
        *   Follow secure coding practices if developing custom extensions or Lua scripts for HAProxy.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Lua Scripting (if enabled)
    *   **Description:** If Lua scripting is enabled, vulnerabilities in custom Lua scripts used for request processing or manipulation could be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code within the HAProxy process or to bypass security checks.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the HAProxy instance, potential access to backend servers, service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** The Lua interpreter and any custom Lua scripts used by HAProxy.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when writing Lua scripts.
        *   Carefully validate and sanitize any external input used in Lua scripts.
        *   Limit the privileges of the HAProxy process.
        *   Consider disabling Lua scripting if it's not strictly necessary.
