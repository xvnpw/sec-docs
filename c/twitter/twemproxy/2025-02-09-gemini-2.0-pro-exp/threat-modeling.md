# Threat Model Analysis for twitter/twemproxy

## Threat: [Backend Server Spoofing](./threats/backend_server_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates DNS resolution or network routing to make Twemproxy connect to a malicious server instead of the legitimate backend (Redis/Memcached). The attacker could achieve this through ARP spoofing, DNS cache poisoning, or compromising a service discovery system.  Twemproxy's lack of built-in backend authentication makes it vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data theft: The attacker can read all data intended for the real backend.
        *   Data modification: The attacker can alter data before it reaches the application.
        *   Data fabrication: The attacker can inject false data into the application.
        *   Denial of Service: The attacker can prevent the application from accessing the backend data.
    *   **Twemproxy Component Affected:** Configuration parsing (`conf.c`, related functions that handle server address resolution), connection establishment logic (functions within `nc_connection.c` that handle connecting to backend servers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Static Configuration:** Use a static, hardcoded list of backend server IP addresses in the Twemproxy configuration file.  Avoid dynamic configuration updates if possible.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Place Twemproxy and backend servers in a dedicated, isolated network segment with strict firewall rules.
        *   **IP Whitelisting:** Configure firewall rules to allow Twemproxy to connect *only* to the specific IP addresses of the backend servers.
        *   **mTLS (If Supported/Modified):** Ideally, use mutual TLS (mTLS) between Twemproxy and the backend servers. This requires modifications to Twemproxy or a wrapper, as it's not a standard feature.
        *   **Secure Service Discovery:** If using dynamic configuration, ensure the service discovery mechanism is highly secure (e.g., using strong authentication, encryption, and integrity checks).

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering](./threats/configuration_file_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Twemproxy server and modifies the `nutcracker.yml` (or equivalent) configuration file. They could change server addresses, sharding rules, timeouts, or other settings, directly impacting Twemproxy's behavior.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Redirection of traffic to malicious servers.
        *   Disruption of sharding, leading to data inconsistency or loss.
        *   Denial of service by setting inappropriate timeouts or resource limits.
        *   Exposure of sensitive configuration details.
    *   **Twemproxy Component Affected:** Configuration file parsing (`conf.c` and related functions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Use a FIM tool to monitor the configuration file for changes and alert on any modifications.
        *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Use a configuration management system (Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc.) to manage the configuration and ensure its integrity.
        *   **Read-Only Mount:** Mount the configuration file as read-only to prevent modifications.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Twemproxy as a non-root user with minimal permissions.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the configuration file for unauthorized changes.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Twemproxy Overload](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__-_twemproxy_overload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods Twemproxy with a large number of connections or requests, exhausting its resources (CPU, memory, file descriptors). This directly targets Twemproxy's ability to handle connections and process requests.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application unavailability: Legitimate clients cannot connect to the application.
        *   Potential server instability.
    *   **Twemproxy Component Affected:** Connection handling (`nc_connection.c`), request processing (`nc_request.c`), and overall resource management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure Twemproxy with appropriate resource limits (e.g., `max_connections`, timeouts) in the configuration file.
        *   **Rate Limiting (External):** Implement rate limiting *in front of* Twemproxy using a firewall, load balancer, or reverse proxy.
        *   **Connection Timeouts:** Configure appropriate connection timeouts in Twemproxy to prevent slow clients from tying up resources.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Backend Amplification](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__-_backend_amplification.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker sends specially crafted requests to Twemproxy (e.g., large `multiget` in Memcached) that Twemproxy then forwards to the backend, amplifying the attack. This leverages Twemproxy's request forwarding behavior.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Backend server overload: The backend servers become unavailable, impacting the application.
        *   Potential resource exhaustion on the backend servers.
    *   **Twemproxy Component Affected:** Request parsing and forwarding logic (particularly related to `multiget` handling in `nc_request.c` and `nc_memcache.c`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Application-Level Limits:** The *application* should limit the number of keys allowed in a `multiget` request *before* sending it to Twemproxy. This is the most effective mitigation.
        *   **Twemproxy Configuration (Limited):** Twemproxy has limited built-in mechanisms to control this; application-level control is crucial.
        *   **Backend Monitoring:** Monitor the backend servers for signs of overload.

## Threat: [Code Execution Vulnerability (Hypothetical)](./threats/code_execution_vulnerability__hypothetical_.md)

*   **Description:** A buffer overflow, format string vulnerability, or other code execution vulnerability exists in Twemproxy (though less likely in a mature project, it's still a possibility). An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the Twemproxy process. This is a direct vulnerability *within* Twemproxy's code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete system compromise: The attacker could gain full control of the Twemproxy server.
        *   Data theft, modification, or deletion.
        *   Use of the server for further attacks.
    *   **Twemproxy Component Affected:** Potentially any part of the codebase, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Run as Non-Root:** Run Twemproxy as a non-root user with limited privileges.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Twemproxy and its dependencies up to date to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the Twemproxy server for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Hardening:** Apply security hardening best practices to the server.
        *   **Code Audits (For Developers):** Conduct regular code audits to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
