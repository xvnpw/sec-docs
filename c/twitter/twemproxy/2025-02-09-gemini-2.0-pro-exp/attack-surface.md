# Attack Surface Analysis for twitter/twemproxy

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Injection](./attack_surfaces/configuration_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to modify the Twemproxy configuration file (typically YAML), injecting malicious settings.
*   **How Twemproxy Contributes:** Twemproxy's behavior is *entirely* determined by its configuration file. Unauthorized modification directly controls its functionality and security.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access and modifies the `servers` section to point to a malicious backend, enabling data theft. Or, they disable security features.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data breach, denial of service, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File Permissions:**  Restrictive permissions (read-only for Twemproxy user, no write access for others).
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring:**  Detect unauthorized changes to the configuration file (e.g., AIDE, Tripwire).
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:**  Use tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for consistent and secure configuration.
    *   **No User Input to Config:**  *Never* allow user input to influence the configuration file. Use secure templating.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Twemproxy as a non-root user.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Connection Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__-_connection_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers flood Twemproxy with connection requests, exceeding its limits and blocking legitimate clients.
*   **How Twemproxy Contributes:** Twemproxy acts as a connection multiplexer and has finite connection handling capacity.
*   **Example:**  A botnet opens thousands of connections to Twemproxy, exhausting the `client_connections` limit.
*   **Impact:**  Service unavailability for legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Connection Limits:**  Configure a reasonable `client_connections` limit in Twemproxy.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Pre-Twemproxy):**  Implement rate limiting *before* requests reach Twemproxy (firewall, load balancer, application logic). This is *essential*.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Use multiple Twemproxy instances behind a load balancer.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor connection counts and alert on high numbers.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (CPU/Memory)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__-_resource_exhaustion__cpumemory_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send crafted requests to consume excessive CPU or memory on the Twemproxy server.
*   **How Twemproxy Contributes:** While lightweight, Twemproxy can still be overwhelmed by malicious or excessive requests.
*   **Example:**  An attacker sends many pipelined requests with large keys/values, causing high memory usage. Or, they exploit a bug in Twemproxy's request parsing.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, potential server crashes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (Pre-Twemproxy):**  Essential to prevent resource exhaustion. Implement *before* Twemproxy.
    *   **Request Size Limits:** If possible, limit request and pipeline sizes.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor Twemproxy's CPU and memory usage.
    *   **cgroups (Linux):**  Use cgroups to limit Twemproxy's resource consumption.
    * **Command Filtering (with extreme caution):** Restrict allowed commands at Twemproxy level if feasible, but carefully to avoid breaking application.

## Attack Surface: [Backend Server Exposure (Due to Twemproxy Misconfiguration)](./attack_surfaces/backend_server_exposure__due_to_twemproxy_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers bypass Twemproxy or exploit *its* misconfigurations to directly access backend servers.
*   **How Twemproxy Contributes:** Twemproxy's role is to proxy, but incorrect configuration can expose the backend. This is distinct from general network misconfigurations.
*   **Example:**  Twemproxy is configured with an incorrect `listen` address, making the backend servers directly accessible on a public interface. Or, Twemproxy's error messages leak backend server IP addresses.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service on backend servers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Correct `listen` Configuration:** Ensure Twemproxy listens only on the intended interface and port, and that this interface is *not* publicly accessible.
    *   **Backend Authentication:** Use strong authentication between Twemproxy and backend servers (e.g., TLS with client certificates, if supported).
    *   **Avoid Information Leakage:** Configure Twemproxy to provide generic error messages, preventing backend server detail disclosure.
    *  **Network Segmentation and Firewalling:** While not *solely* Twemproxy's responsibility, these are critical in preventing direct backend access *even if* Twemproxy is misconfigured.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Communication (Facilitated by Twemproxy's Default)](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_communication__facilitated_by_twemproxy's_default_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is transmitted in plain text because Twemproxy doesn't enable encryption by default.
*   **How Twemproxy Contributes:** Twemproxy, by default, does *not* encrypt traffic. This requires explicit configuration.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the network captures unencrypted Redis commands and responses.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, credential theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **TLS/SSL (Client-Twemproxy):** Configure TLS/SSL for client-to-Twemproxy communication.
    *   **TLS/SSL (Twemproxy-Backend):** Configure TLS/SSL for Twemproxy-to-backend communication (if supported by the backend).
    *   **Secure Tunnels (Alternative):** If the backend lacks TLS support, use secure tunnels (SSH, VPN).
