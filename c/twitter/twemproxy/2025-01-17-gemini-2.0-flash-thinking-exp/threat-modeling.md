# Threat Model Analysis for twitter/twemproxy

## Threat: [Lack of Authentication/Authorization to Twemproxy](./threats/lack_of_authenticationauthorization_to_twemproxy.md)

- **Threat:** Lack of Authentication/Authorization to Twemproxy
    - **Description:** An attacker on the network can connect to Twemproxy and send arbitrary commands to the backend servers. Twemproxy itself does not provide built-in authentication, making it a direct entry point if not properly secured at the network level.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend data stores, potential data manipulation or deletion, denial of service on backend servers.
    - **Affected Component:** Connection handling logic within Twemproxy, lack of built-in authentication mechanisms.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement network-level access controls (firewalls, network segmentation) to strictly limit access to Twemproxy.
        - If feasible, configure backend servers to only accept connections originating from the Twemproxy instance's IP address.
        - Consider architectural changes to introduce an authentication/authorization layer before requests reach Twemproxy.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Server Pools Leading to Data Leakage](./threats/misconfigured_server_pools_leading_to_data_leakage.md)

- **Threat:** Misconfigured Server Pools Leading to Data Leakage
    - **Description:** An attacker could exploit a misconfiguration in Twemproxy's server pool definitions. This could cause requests intended for a specific backend to be incorrectly routed to another, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized clients or leading to data corruption. This is a direct consequence of Twemproxy's routing logic.
    - **Impact:** Data leakage, data corruption, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    - **Affected Component:** `server_groups` configuration parsing and request routing logic within Twemproxy.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement rigorous testing and validation of the server pool configuration in `nutcracker.yml`.
        - Implement monitoring and alerting to detect unexpected request routing patterns.
        - Use clear and consistent naming conventions for server pools to minimize configuration errors.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on Twemproxy](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_on_twemproxy.md)

- **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on Twemproxy
    - **Description:** An attacker can directly target Twemproxy with a flood of requests, overwhelming its connection handling and request processing capabilities. This prevents Twemproxy from proxying legitimate requests, effectively disrupting access to the backend data stores.
    - **Impact:** Service disruption, impacting application availability by making the cached data inaccessible.
    - **Affected Component:** Connection handling, request parsing and processing within Twemproxy.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement rate limiting and connection limits within Twemproxy's configuration if available, or at the network level in front of Twemproxy.
        - Deploy Twemproxy behind load balancers and firewalls that can help mitigate large-scale DoS attacks.
        - Monitor Twemproxy's resource usage (CPU, memory, connections) to detect and respond to potential attacks.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Twemproxy](./threats/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_twemproxy.md)

- **Threat:** Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Twemproxy
    - **Description:** An attacker could exploit publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities present in a specific version of the Twemproxy software itself. This is a direct risk associated with running outdated or vulnerable software.
    - **Impact:**  Impact varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could include remote code execution on the Twemproxy server, unauthorized access to backend systems, or denial of service.
    - **Affected Component:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability within Twemproxy's codebase.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical (if actively exploited vulnerabilities exist) to High (for known but not actively exploited vulnerabilities).
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Establish a process for regularly updating Twemproxy to the latest stable version.
        - Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for Twemproxy.
        - Implement a vulnerability management program to track and remediate known vulnerabilities.
        - Consider using automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in the deployed Twemproxy version.
