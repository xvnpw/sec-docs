### Key Attack Surface List: mozjpeg Library (High & Critical, Direct Involvement)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malformed JPEG Input leading to Memory Corruption
    *   **Description:**  Providing a specially crafted or malformed JPEG file can exploit vulnerabilities in `mozjpeg`'s parsing and decoding logic, leading to memory corruption (e.g., buffer overflows, out-of-bounds writes/reads).
    *   **How mozjpeg Contributes:** `mozjpeg`'s role is to decode and process JPEG data. Bugs in its implementation of the JPEG standard or its optimization algorithms can be triggered by unexpected or malicious data structures within the JPEG file.
    *   **Example:** A JPEG file with an excessively large or negative value in a header field could cause `mozjpeg` to allocate an insufficient buffer, leading to a buffer overflow when subsequent data is written.
    *   **Impact:**  Memory corruption can lead to application crashes, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution if an attacker can carefully control the corrupted memory.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust JPEG validation *before* passing the image to `mozjpeg`. This includes checking header structure, metadata, and potentially using a separate, hardened library for initial validation.
        *   Ensure `mozjpeg` is compiled with appropriate compiler flags and security features (e.g., stack canaries, address space layout randomization - ASLR) to mitigate the impact of memory corruption vulnerabilities.
        *   Keep `mozjpeg` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

*   **Attack Surface:** Malformed JPEG Input leading to Integer Overflows/Underflows
    *   **Description:**  Malformed JPEG files can cause integer overflows or underflows during size calculations or memory allocation within `mozjpeg`.
    *   **How mozjpeg Contributes:** `mozjpeg` performs numerous calculations based on data within the JPEG file. If these calculations are not properly handled, especially with untrusted input, they can result in integer overflows or underflows.
    *   **Example:** A JPEG file with a header indicating a very large image dimension could cause an integer overflow when calculating the required buffer size, leading to a heap overflow when the actual image data is processed.
    *   **Impact:**  Integer overflows/underflows can lead to incorrect memory allocation, buffer overflows, and other memory safety issues, potentially resulting in crashes or exploitable vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate JPEG header fields and data sizes before using them in calculations within the application or by `mozjpeg` (if configurable).
        *   Consider using libraries or techniques that provide built-in protection against integer overflows.
        *   Keep `mozjpeg` updated to benefit from any fixes related to integer handling.
