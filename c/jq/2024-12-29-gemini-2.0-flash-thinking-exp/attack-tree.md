## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the `jq` library.

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application, or disrupt the application's functionality by leveraging vulnerabilities in how the application uses `jq`.

**High-Risk and Critical Sub-Tree:**

*   Compromise Application via jq Exploitation
    *   Exploit Malicious Input Processing
        *   [CRITICAL] Inject Malicious jq Filters via Input
            *   *** Direct Filter Injection ***
    *   Exploit Interaction Between Application and jq
        *   *** Vulnerable Construction of jq Command ***
            *   [CRITICAL] *** Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in Command Arguments ***
        *   [CRITICAL] Treat jq Output as Executable Code (e.g., `eval`)
    *   Exploit jq Filter Language Features
        *   Abuse Built-in Functions
            *   *** File System Access via `--from-file` or `--slurpfile` ***

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. High-Risk Path: Exploit Malicious Input Processing -> Inject Malicious jq Filters via Input -> Direct Filter Injection**

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application directly incorporates user-provided input into the `jq` filter string without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker can inject malicious `jq` filter commands.
*   **How it Works:** The attacker crafts input that, when used to build the `jq` filter, includes commands that perform actions beyond the intended filtering. This could involve using functions like `input` to read arbitrary data, `debug` to leak information, or even more complex manipulations.
*   **Likelihood:** High - This is a common vulnerability if developers are not careful about how they construct `jq` filters.
*   **Impact:** High - Successful injection can lead to information disclosure (reading data the user shouldn't have access to), denial of service (by crafting resource-intensive filters), or potentially even more severe consequences depending on how the application uses the `jq` output.
*   **Effort:** Low - Requires a basic understanding of `jq` filter syntax.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low - If input and executed `jq` commands are logged, malicious filter injections can be relatively easy to spot.

**2. Critical Node: Inject Malicious jq Filters via Input**

*   **Attack Vector:**  The ability to inject malicious `jq` filters is a critical point of failure.
*   **Why it's Critical:**  Gaining control over the `jq` filter allows the attacker to manipulate the data processing logic directly within `jq`, bypassing the application's intended behavior. This can lead to a wide range of attacks.
*   **Likelihood:** Depends on the application's input handling and filter construction.
*   **Impact:** High - As described above, this can lead to information disclosure, DoS, and other vulnerabilities.
*   **Effort:**  Depends on the specific injection point.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:**  Depends on logging and monitoring.

**3. High-Risk Path: Exploit Interaction Between Application and jq -> Vulnerable Construction of jq Command -> Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in Command Arguments**

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application constructs the command-line string used to execute `jq` by concatenating user-provided input without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to command injection.
*   **How it Works:** The attacker crafts input that, when inserted into the command string, allows them to execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the application. For example, they might inject commands using shell metacharacters like `;`, `&&`, or `||`.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - This is a well-known and common vulnerability in applications that execute external commands.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute any command with the privileges of the user running the application, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and other severe consequences.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Requires understanding of command injection techniques and shell syntax.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring system calls, process execution logs, or by observing unexpected system behavior.

**4. Critical Node: Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in Command Arguments**

*   **Attack Vector:** The ability to inject arbitrary commands into the system through the `jq` execution is a critical vulnerability.
*   **Why it's Critical:** This grants the attacker direct control over the server's operating system, making it one of the most severe vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Depends on how the application constructs the `jq` command.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Full system compromise.
*   **Effort:**  Depends on the injection point.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

**5. Critical Node: Treat jq Output as Executable Code (e.g., `eval`)**

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application naively treats the output of `jq` as executable code (e.g., using functions like `eval` in some programming languages), an attacker can inject malicious code through the `jq` output.
*   **How it Works:** The attacker manipulates the input data or `jq` filter in a way that causes `jq` to output code that, when executed by the application, performs malicious actions.
*   **Likelihood:** Low - This is generally considered a poor security practice and is less common in well-developed applications.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
*   **Effort:** Low - If the vulnerability exists, it's relatively easy to exploit.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low - Easily detectable through code review.

**6. High-Risk Path: Exploit jq Filter Language Features -> Abuse Built-in Functions -> File System Access via `--from-file` or `--slurpfile`**

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application allows user-controlled file paths to be used with the `--from-file` or `--slurpfile` options of `jq`, an attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the server.
*   **How it Works:** The attacker provides a file path (either directly or indirectly through manipulating input data) that points to a sensitive file on the server's file system. When `jq` is executed with this attacker-controlled path, it reads the contents of that file, which can then be accessed or exfiltrated by the attacker.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on whether the application naively uses user input for file paths without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **Impact:** High - Allows the attacker to read sensitive files, potentially including configuration files, database credentials, or other confidential data.
*   **Effort:** Low - Requires knowing or guessing file paths on the server.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring the arguments passed to the `jq` command or by observing unusual file access patterns.
