### High and Critical Mongoose Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats directly involving the Mongoose web server library:

*   **Threat:** Malformed HTTP Request Handling
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with unexpected formatting, oversized headers, or invalid characters. This directly exploits vulnerabilities in **Mongoose's HTTP request parsing logic**, potentially leading to a crash or unexpected behavior within the Mongoose process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the server becomes unavailable to legitimate users due to a failure in the Mongoose process.
    *   **Affected Component:** HTTP Request Parser (within the core Mongoose library)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Mongoose's request size limits to prevent oversized requests.
        *   Keep Mongoose updated to the latest version, which includes bug fixes and security patches for its parsing logic.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via File Serving
    *   **Description:** If the application relies on **Mongoose's static file serving functionality** based on user-provided input, an attacker can craft a malicious path (e.g., using `../`) to access files outside the intended web directory. This is a direct vulnerability in how Mongoose handles file path resolution.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information Disclosure: Accessing sensitive configuration files, source code, or other confidential data managed by the server.
        *   Potential for Remote Code Execution (if executable files accessible by Mongoose are accessed and executed).
    *   **Affected Component:** Static File Handler (within the core Mongoose library)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Mongoose's configuration options to strictly define the document root and prevent access to parent directories.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths for Mongoose to serve.

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via CGI
    *   **Description:** If the application uses CGI scripts and **Mongoose's CGI handler** passes unsanitized user input to these scripts, an attacker can inject malicious commands that will be executed on the server. This is a direct consequence of how Mongoose interacts with and passes data to external processes.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) - the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the Mongoose process or the CGI script's user.
    *   **Affected Component:** CGI Handler (within the core Mongoose library)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using CGI scripts if possible.
        *   If CGI is necessary, ensure Mongoose's configuration limits the capabilities of executed scripts.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Include (SSI) Injection
    *   **Description:** If SSI is enabled in **Mongoose's configuration**, an attacker can inject malicious code into SSI directives within web pages. When **Mongoose's SSI processor** handles these pages, the injected code will be executed on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) - the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the Mongoose process.
    *   **Affected Component:** SSI Processor (within the core Mongoose library)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable SSI in Mongoose's configuration if it's not explicitly required.

*   **Threat:** Weak TLS Configuration
    *   **Description:** **Mongoose's TLS/SSL implementation** might be configured to use outdated or weak TLS protocols or cipher suites. This is a direct issue with how Mongoose handles secure connections.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data Breach: Sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS can be intercepted and potentially decrypted due to weaknesses in the encryption.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Attackers can intercept and modify communication between the client and server because of the insecure connection.
    *   **Affected Component:** TLS/SSL Implementation (within the core Mongoose library)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Mongoose to use strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or 1.3).
        *   Disable weak cipher suites in Mongoose's configuration.
        *   Ensure that the server's TLS certificate used by Mongoose is valid and properly configured.
