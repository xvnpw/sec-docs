## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Mongoose [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_mongoose_[critical_node].md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Successful exploitation of any of the sub-nodes can lead to this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_[critical_node].md)

This is a critical entry point for attackers. By manipulating user-supplied input, attackers can bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Header Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_header_injection_[high-risk_path].md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious characters, such as Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF), into HTTP headers.
* Potential Impact: This allows attackers to inject arbitrary headers, leading to HTTP Response Splitting (injecting malicious content into the response, potentially leading to XSS), session fixation (forcing a user to use a known session ID), or information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Path Traversal via URL [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_path_traversal_via_url_[high-risk_path]_[critical_node].md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers manipulate the URL by including sequences like `../` to access files and directories outside the intended web root.
* Potential Impact: This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files containing credentials or internal application details. In some cases, if writable directories are accessed, it could even lead to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_[critical_node].md)

Misconfigurations in Mongoose's settings can create significant security weaknesses that attackers can exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default or Weak Credentials (if used for admin interface or similar) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_or_weak_credentials_(if_used_for_admin_interface_or_similar)_[high-risk_path]_[critical_node].md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers attempt to log in using default or easily guessable credentials for any administrative interfaces or features provided by Mongoose or the application using it.
* Potential Impact: Successful exploitation grants the attacker administrative access, allowing them to fully control the server, manipulate data, and disrupt services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Configuration Options [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_configuration_options_[high-risk_path]_[critical_node].md)

This covers a range of misconfigurations that can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Enable insecure features (if available and not required) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/enable_insecure_features_(if_available_and_not_required)_[high-risk_path]_[critical_node].md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers target specific features of Mongoose that are enabled but not necessary and contain known vulnerabilities. A common example is an insecurely configured CGI setup.
* Potential Impact: Exploiting vulnerabilities in these features can often lead to remote code execution, granting the attacker complete control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File System Access Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_system_access_vulnerabilities_[critical_node].md)

Weaknesses in how Mongoose handles file system access can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to files or even execute malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Directory Listing (if enabled) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_directory_listing_(if_enabled)_[high-risk_path].md)

* Attack Vector: If directory listing is enabled without proper access controls, attackers can browse the server's file system through a web browser.
* Potential Impact: This allows attackers to discover sensitive files and directories that should not be publicly accessible, potentially revealing configuration details, source code, or other confidential information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Write Access Vulnerabilities (if enabled and misconfigured) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_write_access_vulnerabilities_(if_enabled_and_misconfigured)_[high-risk_path]_[critical_node].md)

* Attack Vector: If Mongoose allows file uploads or writing to the file system and these functionalities are not properly secured, attackers can upload malicious files.
* Potential Impact:  Uploading and executing malicious files can lead to remote code execution, giving the attacker complete control over the server.
