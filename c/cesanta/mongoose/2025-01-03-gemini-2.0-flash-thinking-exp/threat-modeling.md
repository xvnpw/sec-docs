# Threat Model Analysis for cesanta/mongoose

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Request Handling](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_request_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request with an overly long header or body that exceeds the allocated buffer size in Mongoose's request parsing logic. This could overwrite adjacent memory regions.

**Impact:** Could lead to a crash of the Mongoose server (Denial of Service), or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten memory.

**Affected Component:** HTTP Request Parsing module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Mongoose updated to benefit from any bug fixes related to buffer handling.
* Rely on Mongoose's internal input validation and size limits for request headers and bodies.
* Consider using memory safety tools during development and testing of applications using Mongoose.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Multiple Connections](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_multiple_connections.md)

**Description:** An attacker establishes a large number of connections to the Mongoose server, exhausting available resources like file descriptors, memory, or threads.

**Impact:** Leads to a Denial of Service, preventing legitimate users from accessing the application.

**Affected Component:** Connection Management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure maximum connection limits within Mongoose.
* Implement rate limiting at the application or network level to restrict the number of connections from a single IP address.
* Monitor server resource usage to detect and respond to potential attacks.

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability in Logging](./threats/format_string_vulnerability_in_logging.md)

**Description:** If Mongoose's logging mechanism directly uses user-controlled input as a format string (e.g., in a `printf`-like function), an attacker could inject format specifiers to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.

**Impact:** Could lead to information disclosure (reading sensitive data from memory) or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** Logging module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that user-provided data is never directly used as a format string in logging functions within Mongoose's codebase.
* If extending Mongoose or using custom logging, sanitize any user-provided input before including it in log messages.
