# Attack Surface Analysis for cesanta/mongoose

## Attack Surface: [Malformed HTTP Request Handling](./attack_surfaces/malformed_http_request_handling.md)

**Description:** Mongoose needs to parse incoming HTTP requests. Sending malformed or oversized requests can exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing logic.

**How Mongoose Contributes:** Mongoose's core functionality is handling HTTP requests. Its parsing implementation determines how robust it is against malformed input.

**Example:** Sending an HTTP request with an excessively long header line or a malformed `Content-Length` header.

**Impact:** Denial of service (server crash or resource exhaustion), potential for buffer overflows leading to arbitrary code execution (less likely in modern implementations but still a concern).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure Mongoose with appropriate limits for header sizes, request body sizes, and the number of headers.
*   Keep Mongoose updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches related to parsing.

## Attack Surface: [File Serving Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/file_serving_path_traversal.md)

**Description:** If Mongoose is used to serve static files, improper handling of file paths can allow attackers to access files outside the intended directory.

**How Mongoose Contributes:** Mongoose's file serving mechanism needs to sanitize and validate requested file paths.

**Example:** Requesting a file with a path like `../../../../etc/passwd`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully configure the `document_root` setting to restrict the accessible file system area.
*   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths.

## Attack Surface: [CGI/SSI Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/cgissi_command_injection.md)

**Description:** If CGI or Server-Side Includes (SSI) are enabled in Mongoose, attackers can inject arbitrary commands that are executed on the server.

**How Mongoose Contributes:** Mongoose's support for CGI and SSI involves executing external programs or processing server-side directives.

**Example:** Crafting a URL that executes a shell command through a CGI script or an SSI directive.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Disable CGI and SSI support entirely unless absolutely necessary.**
*   If CGI/SSI is required, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization for any data passed to CGI scripts or used in SSI directives.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker can send requests that consume excessive server resources, leading to a denial of service.

**How Mongoose Contributes:** Mongoose handles connections and processes requests, consuming resources like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.

**Example:** Sending a large number of concurrent requests, sending very large request bodies, or exploiting inefficient request handlers.

**Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure connection limits in Mongoose.
*   Set timeouts for connections and request processing.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Mongoose might rely on other libraries that contain security vulnerabilities.

**How Mongoose Contributes:** By including and using vulnerable dependencies, Mongoose indirectly exposes the application to those vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A vulnerability in a logging library used by Mongoose.

**Impact:** Depends on the severity of the vulnerability in the dependency, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the dependency vulnerability (can be Critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Mongoose to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for dependency vulnerabilities.
