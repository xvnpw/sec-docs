```
**Threat Model: Mongoose Web Application - High-Risk Subtree**

**Objective:** Compromise application using Mongoose by exploiting its weaknesses.

**Attacker Goal:** Gain unauthorized access or control over the application or its underlying system by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the Mongoose web server library.

**High-Risk Subtree:**

Compromise Application via Mongoose **(CRITICAL NODE)**
*   Exploit Vulnerability in Mongoose Core **(HIGH RISK PATH START)**
    *   Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerability (C/C++) **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        *   Trigger Buffer Overflow **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
        *   Access sensitive files using "..", "%2e%2e", etc. in URI
            *   Target system files **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   Exploit HTTP Request Smuggling
        *   Send ambiguous requests exploiting differences in how Mongoose and backend interpret them
            *   Hijack user requests **(CRITICAL NODE)**
*   Abuse Mongoose Functionality
    *   Abuse CGI/Lua Scripting (if enabled) **(HIGH RISK PATH START)**
        *   Inject malicious code into CGI scripts **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
        *   Exploit vulnerabilities in Lua scripts **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
        *   Access sensitive information or execute arbitrary commands **(CRITICAL NODE)**

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Mongoose (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_mongoose__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Successful compromise means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access or control over the application or the underlying system. This can be achieved through various exploitation paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Mongoose Core (HIGH RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_mongoose_core__high_risk_path_start_.md)

This signifies the attacker's focus on leveraging inherent weaknesses within the Mongoose web server library itself. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can often lead to more severe consequences compared to misconfiguration issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerability (C/C++) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_corruption_vulnerability__cc++___critical_node_.md)

Mongoose is written in C/C++, making it susceptible to memory corruption vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, heap overflows, or use-after-free errors, can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers send data exceeding the allocated buffer size for HTTP headers, request URIs, or POST data. This overwrites adjacent memory locations, potentially corrupting data or hijacking program execution flow to execute malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_path_traversal_vulnerability__high_risk_path_.md)

If Mongoose is configured to serve static files, attackers can exploit path traversal vulnerabilities to access files outside the intended `document_root`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access sensitive files using "..", "%2e%2e", etc. in URI](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_files_using_____%2e%2e__etc__in_uri.md)

By manipulating the file path in the URL, attackers can navigate the file system to access restricted files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target system files (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/target_system_files__critical_node_.md)

Accessing critical system files can allow attackers to gain complete control over the server, install backdoors, or steal sensitive system information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_http_request_smuggling.md)

Attackers craft ambiguous HTTP requests that are interpreted differently by Mongoose and any backend servers it might be proxying to.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send ambiguous requests exploiting differences in how Mongoose and backend interpret them](./attack_tree_paths/send_ambiguous_requests_exploiting_differences_in_how_mongoose_and_backend_interpret_them.md)

By manipulating headers like `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`, attackers can inject malicious requests that are processed by the backend server but not by Mongoose, or vice versa.

## Attack Tree Path: [Hijack user requests (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/hijack_user_requests__critical_node_.md)

Successful request smuggling can allow attackers to intercept and modify legitimate user requests, potentially leading to account takeover or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Mongoose Functionality (HIGH RISK PATH START - specifically CGI/Lua)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_mongoose_functionality__high_risk_path_start_-_specifically_cgilua_.md)

This focuses on the risks associated with using Mongoose's dynamic content generation features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse CGI/Lua Scripting (if enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_cgilua_scripting__if_enabled_.md)

If the application utilizes CGI or Lua scripting, it introduces potential attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious code into CGI scripts (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_cgi_scripts__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers can inject malicious commands or scripts into CGI scripts, which are then executed on the server, leading to code execution and potential system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in Lua scripts (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_lua_scripts__high_risk_path_.md)

Vulnerabilities in the application's Lua scripts can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access sensitive information or execute arbitrary commands (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_information_or_execute_arbitrary_commands__critical_node_.md)

Successful exploitation of CGI or Lua scripting vulnerabilities allows attackers to directly access sensitive data or execute commands on the server, leading to significant compromise.
