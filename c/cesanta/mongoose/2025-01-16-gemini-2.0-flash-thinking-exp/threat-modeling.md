# Threat Model Analysis for cesanta/mongoose

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Information](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_information.md)

* **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Information
    * **Description:** An attacker could exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities *within Mongoose itself* to access the `mongoose.conf` file or other configuration data handled by Mongoose. This could involve vulnerabilities in Mongoose's file handling or configuration parsing logic.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, internal network configurations, or other secrets managed by Mongoose. This could lead to further compromise of the application and its backend systems.
    * **Affected Component:** Configuration loading module, potentially file handling functions within Mongoose.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Store sensitive information outside the `mongoose.conf` file, using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
        * Ensure the `mongoose.conf` file has restrictive permissions at the operating system level.
        * Stay updated with the latest Mongoose version to patch potential configuration parsing or file handling vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Serving Unintended Files (Directory Traversal)](./threats/serving_unintended_files__directory_traversal_.md)

* **Threat:** Serving Unintended Files (Directory Traversal)
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the intended web root. This is possible due to vulnerabilities in *Mongoose's* static file serving module's path validation.
    * **Impact:** Access to sensitive files managed by Mongoose, including source code, configuration files, database backups, or other confidential data. This can lead to information disclosure, further exploitation, or even complete system compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** Static file serving module, path handling functions within Mongoose.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure strict path validation is enforced by Mongoose's static file serving module (stay updated with patches).
        * Avoid serving the entire filesystem; restrict the document root to the necessary directories within Mongoose's configuration.
        * Consider using a reverse proxy in front of Mongoose to handle static file serving with more robust security features if Mongoose's built-in capabilities are insufficient.

## Threat: [Command Injection via CGI](./threats/command_injection_via_cgi.md)

* **Threat:** Command Injection via CGI
    * **Description:** If CGI (Common Gateway Interface) is enabled *within Mongoose*, an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in how Mongoose handles CGI requests or inject malicious commands through unsanitized input passed to these scripts. Mongoose directly executes these scripts.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server with the privileges of the Mongoose process. This can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:** CGI handler module within Mongoose.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using CGI within Mongoose if possible. Modern alternatives are generally more secure.
        * If CGI is necessary, ensure Mongoose is updated to the latest version to mitigate any known vulnerabilities in its CGI handling.
        * Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization in all CGI scripts (this is primarily an application concern, but the risk is enabled by Mongoose's CGI support).

## Threat: [Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection](./threats/server-side_includes__ssi__injection.md)

* **Threat:** Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection
    * **Description:** If SSI is enabled *within Mongoose*, an attacker could inject malicious code into SSI directives within served files. When Mongoose processes these files, the injected code is executed on the server *by Mongoose*.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server with the privileges of the Mongoose process. This can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:** SSI parser module within Mongoose.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Disable SSI within Mongoose if it's not required.
        * If SSI is necessary, ensure Mongoose is updated to the latest version to mitigate any known vulnerabilities in its SSI parsing.
        * Carefully sanitize any user-provided data that might be included in SSI directives (this is primarily an application concern, but the risk is enabled by Mongoose's SSI support).

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

* **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion (DoS)
    * **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests or specifically crafted requests designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. This targets *Mongoose's* core connection and request handling mechanisms.
    * **Impact:** The application becomes unavailable to legitimate users, impacting business operations and potentially causing financial losses or reputational damage.
    * **Affected Component:** Connection handling module, request processing module within Mongoose.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Configure connection limits and timeouts *within Mongoose's configuration*.
        * Implement rate limiting *using Mongoose's features or a reverse proxy*.
        * Stay updated with Mongoose versions that may include fixes for DoS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Mongoose Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_mongoose_library_itself.md)

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Mongoose Library Itself
    * **Description:** Mongoose, like any software, might contain undiscovered or publicly known security vulnerabilities in its codebase. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service *directly through flaws in Mongoose*.
    * **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, the impact could range from information disclosure and denial of service to arbitrary code execution and complete system compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** Various modules and functions within the Mongoose library.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Crucially, regularly update Mongoose to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.**
        * Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to Mongoose.
