### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Access sensitive files using "..", "%2e%2e", etc. in URI

#### 4.1 Vulnerability Description

This attack path describes a **path traversal vulnerability**, also known as a **directory traversal vulnerability**. This vulnerability arises when an application uses user-supplied input (in this case, the URI path) to construct file paths without proper sanitization and validation.

Attackers can exploit this by including special characters and sequences like `..`, `%2e%2e` (URL-encoded `..`), `..\/`, `..\\`, and other variations in the URI. These sequences instruct the operating system to navigate up the directory structure. By repeatedly using these sequences, an attacker can potentially escape the intended webroot directory and access files and directories outside of the application's designated file space.

#### 4.2 Mechanism of Attack

The core mechanism involves manipulating the URI path to trick the Mongoose server into serving files it shouldn't. Here's how it works:

1. **Vulnerable Code:** The application or Mongoose configuration directly uses the URI path to locate files on the server's file system.
2. **Malicious URI Construction:** An attacker crafts a URI containing path traversal sequences. For example, if the application serves files from a directory `/var/www/html/public/`, an attacker might try the following:
    * `/../../../../etc/passwd`
    * `/static/../../../config/database.ini`
    * `/images/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/secrets.txt`
3. **Path Resolution:** When Mongoose receives the request, it attempts to resolve the file path based on the provided URI. If proper sanitization is lacking, the `..` sequences will be interpreted literally, causing the server to navigate up the directory tree.
4. **Unauthorized Access:** If the attacker successfully navigates to a sensitive file, Mongoose will serve its content to the attacker.

#### 4.3 Mongoose Specifics and Potential Weaknesses

While Mongoose is generally considered a lightweight and secure web server, its susceptibility to path traversal depends on how it's configured and how the application utilizes it. Potential weaknesses could arise from:

* **Default Configuration:**  If the default configuration doesn't enforce strict path restrictions or input validation, it might be vulnerable.
* **Application Logic:**  If the application code itself constructs file paths based on user input without proper sanitization before passing it to Mongoose for serving, it introduces the vulnerability.
* **Alias Configuration:**  If Mongoose's alias feature is configured improperly, it could potentially allow access to unintended directories.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** If Mongoose doesn't automatically sanitize or normalize file paths, it relies on the application to do so.

It's crucial to consult the Mongoose documentation to understand its default behavior regarding path handling and any built-in security features related to path traversal.

#### 4.4 Potential Impact

A successful path traversal attack can have severe consequences:

* **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Attackers can access configuration files (containing database credentials, API keys), source code, user data, and other confidential information.
* **System Compromise:** In some cases, attackers might be able to access system files, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
* **Data Breach:**  Accessing sensitive user data can lead to data breaches and regulatory penalties.
* **Reputation Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation and trust of the application and the organization.

#### 4.5 Attack Vectors

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through various means:

* **Direct Browser Requests:**  Simply typing the malicious URI into the browser's address bar.
* **Automated Tools and Scripts:** Using scripts or tools specifically designed to identify and exploit path traversal vulnerabilities.
* **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**  Intercepting and modifying legitimate requests to inject malicious path traversal sequences.
* **Exploiting Other Vulnerabilities:**  Combining path traversal with other vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS) to further their attack.

#### 4.6 Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate this vulnerability, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Whitelist Allowed Characters:**  Only allow a predefined set of safe characters in file paths.
    * **Reject Malicious Sequences:**  Explicitly block sequences like `..`, `%2e%2e`, `\/`, and `\\`.
    * **Canonicalization:**  Convert the provided path to its canonical form (e.g., by resolving symbolic links and removing redundant separators) before using it to access files. This helps prevent bypasses using different encoding schemes.
* **Restrict File Access:**
    * **Webroot Confinement:** Ensure that Mongoose is configured to serve files only from a designated webroot directory and prevent access to files outside this directory.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the Mongoose process only the necessary permissions to access the required files and directories.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Avoid Direct File Path Construction:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly using user input to construct file paths. Instead, use predefined mappings or identifiers.
    * **Use Safe File Access APIs:**  Utilize secure file access APIs provided by the operating system or programming language that offer built-in protection against path traversal.
* **Mongoose Configuration:**
    * **Review Default Settings:**  Understand Mongoose's default behavior regarding path handling and security.
    * **Configure Aliases Carefully:**  If using aliases, ensure they are configured securely and don't expose sensitive directories.
    * **Consider `protect_uri_from_dots` Option (if available):** Some web servers offer configuration options to automatically block or sanitize URIs containing `..`. Check if Mongoose provides such an option.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Periodically assess the application and its configuration for vulnerabilities, including path traversal.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Implement a WAF to detect and block malicious requests containing path traversal sequences.

#### 4.7 Example Attack Scenario

Consider an application using Mongoose to serve static files from the `/var/www/html/public/` directory. A user requests an image using the URI `/images/logo.png`.

**Vulnerable Scenario:**

If the application or Mongoose configuration doesn't properly sanitize the URI, an attacker could craft the following request:

```
GET /images/../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable.example.com
```

In this scenario, the `../../../` sequence attempts to navigate up three directories from the `/images/` directory, potentially reaching the root directory and then accessing the `/etc/passwd` file. If successful, the attacker would receive the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

**Mitigated Scenario:**

With proper mitigation in place, the server would either:

1. **Reject the request:**  The WAF or Mongoose would detect the malicious `..` sequence and block the request.
2. **Normalize the path:** The application or Mongoose would sanitize the path, removing the `..` sequences and potentially returning a "file not found" error or serving a default error page.
3. **Restrict access:** Even if the path was somehow processed, the server's configuration would prevent access to files outside the designated webroot.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Access sensitive files using "..", "%2e%2e", etc. in URI" attack path represents a significant security risk for applications using Mongoose. Understanding the mechanics of path traversal attacks and implementing robust mitigation strategies is crucial to protect sensitive data and prevent system compromise. The development team should prioritize input validation, secure coding practices, and proper Mongoose configuration to effectively address this vulnerability. Regular security assessments and penetration testing are essential to ensure the ongoing security of the application.
