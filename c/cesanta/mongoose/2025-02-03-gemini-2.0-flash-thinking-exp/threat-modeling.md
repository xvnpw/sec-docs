# Threat Model Analysis for cesanta/mongoose

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in HTTP Header Parsing](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_http_header_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request with excessively long headers that exceed allocated buffer sizes in Mongoose's header parsing routines. This memory corruption can lead to server crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten data.
**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE).
**Affected Mongoose Component:** `http_parser.c` (specifically header parsing functions).
**Risk Severity:** High.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use the latest stable version of Mongoose, which includes buffer overflow fixes.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on HTTP headers within the application logic as a defense-in-depth measure.
*   Utilize compile-time and runtime buffer overflow detection tools during development and testing.
*   Consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter out requests with excessively long headers.

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability in Logging/Error Handling](./threats/format_string_vulnerability_in_loggingerror_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits format string vulnerabilities if Mongoose uses user-controlled input directly within format strings in logging or error handling functions. By injecting format specifiers, the attacker can read from arbitrary memory locations (information disclosure) or write to arbitrary memory locations (potentially leading to code execution).
**Impact:** Information Disclosure, potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE).
**Affected Mongoose Component:** Logging functions, error handling routines across the Mongoose codebase.
**Risk Severity:** High.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly audit Mongoose's source code for instances of `printf` or similar functions using user-provided data as format strings.
*   Ensure user-provided data is never directly used as a format string argument. Use safe alternatives like `snprintf` or parameterized logging.
*   Enable compiler warnings that detect format string vulnerabilities during compilation.

## Threat: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./threats/http_request_smuggling.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts ambiguous HTTP requests that are interpreted differently by Mongoose and upstream proxies or backend servers. This discrepancy in interpretation allows the attacker to "smuggle" requests, potentially bypassing security controls, poisoning caches, or gaining unauthorized access to other users' requests.
**Impact:** Security bypass, unauthorized access, cache poisoning, data manipulation.
**Affected Mongoose Component:** `http_parser.c` (request parsing logic, handling of connection boundaries, chunked encoding, etc.).
**Risk Severity:** High.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Conduct rigorous testing of Mongoose's HTTP parsing implementation against known request smuggling techniques.
*   Ensure consistent configuration and interpretation of HTTP requests between Mongoose and any upstream proxies or load balancers.
*   Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with specific request smuggling detection and prevention capabilities.
*   Prefer using HTTP/2 where request smuggling is inherently less likely due to its binary framing.

## Threat: [Directory Traversal via File Path Manipulation](./threats/directory_traversal_via_file_path_manipulation.md)

**Description:** If Mongoose's static file serving module or the application using Mongoose improperly handles file paths, an attacker can manipulate file paths (e.g., using `../` sequences) to access files and directories outside the intended web root. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive application files, configuration files, or even system files.
**Impact:** Information Disclosure, potential for privilege escalation or system compromise.
**Affected Mongoose Component:** Static file serving module, file path handling functions.
**Risk Severity:** High.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully configure the document root to strictly limit access to the intended directories for static file serving.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization of file paths within the application if file paths are constructed dynamically.
*   Avoid directly exposing file system paths to users. Use abstract identifiers or controlled mappings if possible.
*   Regularly audit the configured document root and served files to ensure no unintended files are accessible.
