- security control: Basic authentication mechanisms (implementation details need to be verified in the code).
- accepted risk: Reliance on users to configure security settings appropriately.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities inherent in C/C++ code.
- accepted risk: Security posture depends heavily on the application embedding Mongoose.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated security testing (SAST, DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Regularly update dependencies and Mongoose library itself to patch vulnerabilities.
- security control: Provide secure configuration defaults and guidance for users.
- security control: Implement input validation and output encoding throughout the library.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
  - Requirement: For administrative interfaces or control panels exposed by Mongoose, strong authentication mechanisms must be implemented to verify the identity of users.
  - Requirement: Consider supporting multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
- Authorization:
  - Requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization controls to manage access to different resources and functionalities within Mongoose-powered applications.
  - Requirement: Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions.
- Input Validation:
  - Requirement: All external inputs, including network requests, configuration parameters, and user-provided data, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, cross-site scripting).
  - Requirement: Implement input sanitization and encoding to neutralize potentially harmful data.
- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Use strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and protocols for all security-sensitive operations, such as TLS/SSL for secure communication and hashing for password storage.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- For applications embedding Mongoose, critical business processes depend on the functionality provided by those applications. If Mongoose is used to provide core networking or web service functionality, then those processes are critical. Examples include:
  - Data acquisition and transmission in IoT devices.
  - Web-based control panels for industrial equipment.
  - Internal communication within distributed systems.

Data Sensitivity:
- The sensitivity of data handled by Mongoose depends entirely on the application using it. Mongoose itself is a networking library and doesn't inherently handle specific business data. However, applications using Mongoose might handle sensitive data, including:
  - User credentials for authentication.
  - Configuration data, which might include sensitive settings.
  - Application-specific data transmitted over the network (e.g., sensor data, financial transactions, personal information).
- Data sensitivity should be assessed in the context of the applications that utilize Mongoose.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the intended use cases for Mongoose? Is it primarily for embedded systems, general-purpose applications, or both?
- Are there specific security features or functionalities that are planned for future development?
- What is the process for reporting and patching security vulnerabilities in Mongoose?
- What are the typical deployment environments for applications using Mongoose? (e.g., cloud, on-premises, embedded devices).
- Is there a security contact or team responsible for Mongoose?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: Mongoose is intended to be a general-purpose networking library and web server for a wide range of applications. Security is a concern, but ease of use and performance are also important priorities.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Current security controls are basic, and there is room for improvement, especially in areas like automated security testing, secure configuration defaults, and input validation. The security posture heavily relies on the developers using Mongoose correctly.
- DESIGN: The design is modular, with core networking and web server functionalities separated. Deployment scenarios are varied, ranging from embedded systems to server applications. The build process is assumed to be using standard CI/CD practices, but security aspects can be enhanced.
