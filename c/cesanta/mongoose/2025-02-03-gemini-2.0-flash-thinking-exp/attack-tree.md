## Attack Tree Path: [1. [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1 Exploit Mongoose Code Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1___high_risk_path__1_1_exploit_mongoose_code_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **General Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to find and exploit vulnerabilities within the Mongoose C/C++ codebase itself. Success can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or Information Disclosure.

    *   **Mitigation:** Code audits, fuzzing, memory sanitizers, secure coding practices, and staying updated with Mongoose security patches are crucial.

    *   **1.1.1 Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (C/C++ Specific)**

        *   **1.1.1.1 Buffer Overflow in Request Handling [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted HTTP requests with excessively long headers, URIs, or POST data designed to overflow fixed-size buffers in Mongoose's request parsing routines.
            *   **Exploitation Scenario:**  An attacker sends a request with a header like `X-Custom-Header: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...` (very long string). If Mongoose's header parsing code uses a fixed-size buffer and doesn't properly check the header length, it can write beyond the buffer's boundaries, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions. This can be used to overwrite return addresses or function pointers, leading to RCE.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust bounds checking in all memory operations, use safe string handling functions, and employ memory protection mechanisms. Fuzzing with long inputs is essential for detection.

        *   **1.1.1.2 Format String Vulnerabilities (if logging...) [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting format string specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`, `%n`) into user-controlled input that is used in logging or similar functions that utilize format strings.
            *   **Exploitation Scenario:** If Mongoose uses user-provided data (e.g., from a header or URI) directly in a logging function like `printf` without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject format string specifiers. For example, sending a request with a URI containing `%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%n`. The `%n` specifier can write to memory, potentially leading to RCE.
            *   **Mitigation:** Never use user-controlled input directly in format string functions. Use parameterized logging or sanitize user input before logging.

        *   **1.1.1.3 Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting memory management errors where memory is freed and then accessed again. This often involves race conditions or incorrect object lifecycle management.
            *   **Exploitation Scenario:**  Imagine a scenario where Mongoose handles a request and allocates memory for a request object. Due to a race condition in concurrent request handling or an error in cleanup routines, this memory is prematurely freed. If another part of the code still holds a pointer to this freed memory and attempts to access it, a use-after-free vulnerability occurs. This can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially RCE if the freed memory is reallocated and attacker-controlled data is placed there.
            *   **Mitigation:**  Careful memory management, use of smart pointers where appropriate, and rigorous testing for race conditions, especially in concurrent code paths. Memory sanitizers are crucial for detection.

        *   **1.1.1.4 Double-Free Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Causing memory to be freed twice. This is a memory corruption issue that can lead to crashes or exploitable conditions.
            *   **Exploitation Scenario:**  Errors in error handling or cleanup routines can lead to double-free vulnerabilities. For example, if an error occurs during request processing, and the error handling code incorrectly attempts to free the same memory block that was already freed in a previous cleanup step. Double-frees can corrupt memory management structures, leading to crashes and potentially exploitable scenarios.
            *   **Mitigation:**  Careful review of error handling and cleanup code paths. Ensure memory is freed exactly once and only when appropriate. Memory sanitizers are vital for detecting double-frees.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH RISK PATH - if enabled] 1.1.2 Logic Vulnerabilities in Request Handling](./attack_tree_paths/2___high_risk_path_-_if_enabled__1_1_2_logic_vulnerabilities_in_request_handling.md)

*   **General Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in how Mongoose handles HTTP requests, especially when features like static file serving, CGI, SSI, WebSockets, or MQTT are enabled.

    *   **Mitigation:** Disable unnecessary features, implement strong input validation and sanitization, and follow secure coding practices for feature-specific logic.

    *   **1.1.2.1 Path Traversal Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE - if static files/CGI/SSI used]**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating file paths in requests to access files outside the intended document root or web application directory.
            *   **Exploitation Scenario:** If Mongoose is configured to serve static files or handle CGI/SSI, an attacker might send a request like `/static/../../../../etc/passwd`. If path sanitization is weak or missing, Mongoose might incorrectly resolve this path and serve the `/etc/passwd` file, leading to information disclosure. In CGI, path traversal can be combined with command injection for RCE.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust path sanitization that prevents traversal beyond the intended directory. Use allow-listing instead of block-listing for allowed paths. Regularly review `document_root` and `aliases` configurations.

    *   **1.1.2.2 HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting [CRITICAL NODE - if vulnerable]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting HTTP requests in a way that causes discrepancies in how Mongoose and backend applications (if any) parse request boundaries.
        *   **Exploitation Scenario:**  If Mongoose has vulnerabilities in its HTTP request parsing, an attacker might be able to "smuggle" a second request within the body of the first request. This can lead to the second, smuggled request being processed out of context, potentially bypassing security controls, poisoning caches, or even leading to RCE in backend applications if they are vulnerable to processing unexpected requests.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Ensure Mongoose's HTTP parsing is robust and conforms to HTTP standards. Regularly update Mongoose to patch any parsing vulnerabilities. Thoroughly test request handling with various HTTP smuggling/splitting techniques.

    *   **1.1.2.6 CGI/SSI Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE - if CGI/SSI enabled]**
        *   **1.1.2.6.1 Command Injection via CGI parameters [CRITICAL NODE - if CGI enabled and vulnerable]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious commands into CGI parameters that are then executed by the server.
            *   **Exploitation Scenario:** If CGI is enabled and a CGI script uses user-provided parameters without proper sanitization in system commands (e.g., using `system()` or `exec()`), an attacker can inject commands. For example, a request like `/cgi-bin/script.cgi?param=; whoami;` might execute the `whoami` command on the server if the CGI script is vulnerable.
            *   **Mitigation:**  Disable CGI if not needed. If CGI is necessary, rigorously sanitize all CGI parameters before using them in system commands. Use safer alternatives to system commands if possible. Employ least privilege principles for CGI scripts.

        *   **1.1.2.6.2 Server-Side Include Injection (SSI) [CRITICAL NODE - if SSI enabled and vulnerable]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious SSI directives into requests that are then processed by the server, leading to execution of arbitrary code or information disclosure.
            *   **Exploitation Scenario:** If SSI is enabled, an attacker might send a request containing SSI directives like `<!--#exec cmd="whoami" -->`. If Mongoose processes SSI directives without proper sanitization, it might execute the `whoami` command on the server.
            *   **Mitigation:** Disable SSI if not needed. If SSI is required, sanitize SSI directives to prevent injection attacks. Consider using templating engines instead of SSI for dynamic content.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2 Exploit Mongoose Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3___high_risk_path__1_2_exploit_mongoose_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **General Attack Vector:** Exploiting misconfigurations in Mongoose's settings to gain unauthorized access, control, or information.

    *   **Mitigation:** Follow security best practices for configuration, regularly review configuration files, and use configuration management tools.

    *   **1.2.1.1 Weak or Default Credentials for Admin Interface [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Using default or easily guessable credentials to access the Mongoose admin interface (if enabled).
        *   **Exploitation Scenario:** If the `admin_uri` is enabled and the default `admin_user` and `admin_password` are not changed, an attacker can simply try these default credentials to log in to the admin interface. Once logged in, they can potentially reconfigure the server, upload malicious files, or gain further control.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Disable the admin interface if not essential. If enabled, immediately change default credentials to strong, unique passwords. Restrict access to the admin interface using `access_control_list`.

    *   **1.2.1.3 Unnecessary Features Enabled [CRITICAL NODE - if CGI/SSI/Directory Listing enabled]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in features like CGI, SSI, or directory listing that are enabled but not actually needed by the application.
        *   **Exploitation Scenario:** If CGI is enabled even though the application doesn't use CGI scripts, the attack surface is unnecessarily increased. An attacker might try to find and exploit vulnerabilities in Mongoose's CGI handling, even if the application itself doesn't rely on CGI. Similarly for SSI and directory listing.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Apply the principle of least privilege. Disable any Mongoose features that are not strictly required for the application's functionality (CGI, SSI, directory listing, admin interface, etc.).

    *   **1.2.1.4 Exposed Sensitive Files via Misconfigured `document_root` or `aliases` [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Misconfiguring `document_root` or `aliases` to expose sensitive files or directories to the web.
        *   **Exploitation Scenario:** If `document_root` is set to a directory that contains sensitive files (e.g., configuration files, database credentials, source code) or if `aliases` are misconfigured to point to sensitive locations, an attacker can directly request these files via the web server and gain access to sensitive information.
        *   **Mitigation:** Carefully review `document_root` and `aliases` configurations. Ensure `document_root` points only to the intended public directory. Avoid using `aliases` to expose sensitive directories. Regularly audit file access permissions within the `document_root`.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2.2 Improper Input Validation in Application Code [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4___high_risk_path__1_2_2_improper_input_validation_in_application_code__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Failing to properly validate user input in the application code that interacts with Mongoose, even if Mongoose provides some basic request handling.
*   **Exploitation Scenario:**  Even if Mongoose itself is secure, vulnerabilities can arise in the application logic built on top of Mongoose. If the application code doesn't properly validate user inputs received through Mongoose (e.g., parameters, headers, POST data), it can be vulnerable to various application-level attacks like SQL injection, command injection (in application code), cross-site scripting (XSS), etc.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation in the application code for all user-controlled data. Sanitize and validate data according to the expected data type and format. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Encode output to prevent XSS.
