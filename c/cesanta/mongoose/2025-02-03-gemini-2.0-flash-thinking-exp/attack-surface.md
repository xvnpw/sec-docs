# Attack Surface Analysis for cesanta/mongoose

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Exposure](./attack_surfaces/configuration_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive configuration details (credentials, paths, API keys) are unintentionally made accessible to attackers.
*   **Mongoose Contribution:** Mongoose relies on configuration files (e.g., `mongoose.yml`) or command-line arguments. Misconfiguration in deployment can expose these files or the configuration process itself, directly related to how Mongoose is set up.
*   **Example:** A developer leaves the `mongoose.yml` file in a publicly accessible directory within the web root, or includes sensitive API keys directly in command-line arguments visible in process listings, both scenarios directly involving Mongoose configuration practices.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to internal systems, data breaches, service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store configuration files outside the web root, a direct recommendation for Mongoose deployments.
    *   Use environment variables or secure configuration management systems to handle sensitive data, relevant to secure Mongoose configuration.
    *   Restrict access to configuration files using operating system permissions, a standard security practice applicable to Mongoose configuration files.
    *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in configuration files or command-line arguments, a best practice when configuring Mongoose.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can access files and directories outside the intended web root by manipulating file paths in HTTP requests.
*   **Mongoose Contribution:** If Mongoose is configured to serve static files, vulnerabilities in its path handling logic can allow traversal. Incorrect sanitization or validation of requested file paths *within Mongoose's code* is the root cause.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a request like `http://example.com/../../../../etc/passwd` to access the system's password file, bypassing intended directory restrictions if *Mongoose doesn't properly sanitize* the path during file serving.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive files, source code, configuration files, and potentially system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Mongoose is configured with a properly defined and restricted document root, a core Mongoose configuration setting.
    *   Disable directory listing if not explicitly required, a Mongoose configuration option to reduce risk.
    *   Regularly review and audit Mongoose's configuration related to file serving, focusing on Mongoose's file serving settings.
    *   Consider using a reverse proxy in front of Mongoose to further sanitize requests and enforce path restrictions, adding an external layer of security to Mongoose deployments.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection](./attack_surfaces/server-side_includes__ssi__injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into SSI directives within web pages, which is then executed by the server when processing the page.
*   **Mongoose Contribution:** If SSI is enabled in Mongoose, and user-controlled data is incorporated into SSI directives without proper sanitization, injection vulnerabilities arise. *Mongoose processes SSI directives*, making it directly responsible for secure handling if this feature is used.
*   **Example:** A website uses SSI to include a username in a greeting: `<!--#echo var="USERNAME" -->`. If the `USERNAME` variable is derived from user input and not sanitized, an attacker could inject SSI directives like `<!--#exec cmd="rm -rf /" -->` leading to command execution on the server, directly exploiting Mongoose's SSI processing.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, website defacement, data theft, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable SSI if not absolutely necessary, the most direct way to eliminate this Mongoose-related attack surface.
    *   If SSI is required, rigorously sanitize all user input before incorporating it into SSI directives, a crucial step when using Mongoose's SSI feature.
    *   Implement a strict whitelist of allowed SSI commands and variables, a security hardening measure for Mongoose SSI usage.
    *   Consider using templating engines that offer better security and input sanitization mechanisms instead of SSI, suggesting alternatives to Mongoose's SSI feature for improved security.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow in Request Parsing](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflow_in_request_parsing.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Mongoose parses HTTP requests, particularly headers or request lines, to cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.
*   **Mongoose Contribution:** As a C-based web server, Mongoose is susceptible to buffer overflows if memory management and bounds checking are not meticulously implemented in *its HTTP request parsing logic*. This is an inherent risk due to Mongoose's implementation.
*   **Example:** Sending an overly long HTTP header or request line that exceeds the allocated buffer size in *Mongoose's parsing routines*, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions and hijacking control flow, directly targeting Mongoose's parsing implementation.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, system instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Mongoose updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for buffer overflow vulnerabilities *within Mongoose*.
    *   Thoroughly test the application with fuzzing tools to identify potential buffer overflow issues in *Mongoose's request handling*.
    *   Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out potentially malicious requests that might trigger buffer overflows, adding a protective layer against attacks targeting Mongoose's parsing.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm the server with requests, consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory, connections), leading to service unavailability for legitimate users.
*   **Mongoose Contribution:** Mongoose, like any web server, can be targeted by DoS attacks.  Vulnerabilities in *its resource management, connection handling, or request processing* can make it more susceptible to these attacks. Mongoose's implementation directly influences its DoS resilience.
*   **Example:** A flood of HTTP requests from a botnet targeting a Mongoose server, exhausting connection limits, CPU, or memory, making the server unresponsive to legitimate users. Slowloris attacks exploiting slow connection handling *in Mongoose* are also a possibility, highlighting Mongoose's specific behavior.
*   **Impact:**  Service disruption, financial loss, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user, a common practice to protect Mongoose deployments.
    *   Configure connection timeouts and limits appropriately *in Mongoose*, directly adjusting Mongoose's settings for DoS protection.
    *   Use a reverse proxy or CDN with DoS protection capabilities, adding external defenses for Mongoose-based applications.
    *   Monitor server resource usage and implement alerting for unusual traffic patterns, essential for detecting DoS attempts against Mongoose servers.
    *   Consider using techniques like SYN cookies to mitigate SYN flood attacks, a general DoS mitigation technique applicable to Mongoose.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Mongoose Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_mongoose_version.md)

*   **Description:** Using an old, unpatched version of Mongoose that contains known security vulnerabilities.
*   **Mongoose Contribution:**  The vulnerability lies directly in the outdated *Mongoose codebase*.  Developers' failure to update Mongoose *itself* exposes their application to publicly known exploits.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered and patched in Mongoose version X.  Applications still running version X-1 are vulnerable and can be easily exploited by attackers using readily available exploit code, directly due to the outdated *Mongoose version*.
*   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from data breaches and remote code execution to denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update Mongoose to the latest stable version.** This is the most direct and crucial mitigation for this Mongoose-specific risk.
    *   Subscribe to security mailing lists or vulnerability databases to stay informed about *Mongoose security updates*.
    *   Implement a vulnerability scanning process to identify outdated libraries *including Mongoose* in your application.
    *   Establish a patch management process to quickly apply security updates, especially for *Mongoose*.
