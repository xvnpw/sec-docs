# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cesanta/mongoose

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Enabled Features](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_enabled_features.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review the `mongoose.c` file or your application's configuration settings for Mongoose.
    *   Step 2: Identify all enabled features, such as CGI, SSI, Lua, WebDAV, MQTT, WebSocket, and the admin interface.
    *   Step 3: For each enabled feature, evaluate if it is absolutely necessary for your application's functionality.
    *   Step 4: If a feature is not required, disable it by commenting out or removing the corresponding configuration options in `mongoose.c` or your configuration file. For example, to disable CGI, ensure `cgi_interpreter` is not defined or is commented out. To disable WebDAV, ensure `enable_webdav` is set to `no`.
    *   Step 5: Recompile Mongoose if you modified `mongoose.c` or restart your application if using a configuration file to apply the changes.
    *   Step 6: Test your application thoroughly after disabling features to ensure core functionality remains intact and no unintended side effects are introduced.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Increased Attack Surface (Severity: Medium): Unnecessary features introduce additional code paths that could contain vulnerabilities. Disabling them reduces the potential entry points for attackers.
    *   Exploitation of Feature-Specific Vulnerabilities (Severity: High to Critical, depending on the feature): Each feature has its own potential vulnerabilities. Disabling unused features eliminates the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities within those specific modules. For example, vulnerabilities in CGI handling would not be exploitable if CGI is disabled.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Increased Attack Surface: High risk reduction. By removing unnecessary code, the overall attack surface is significantly reduced.
    *   Exploitation of Feature-Specific Vulnerabilities: High risk reduction. Eliminates the risk associated with vulnerabilities in disabled features.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. CGI and SSI are currently disabled in the project's `mongoose.c` configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review and potential disabling of WebDAV, MQTT, and WebSocket features, as their usage is not fully confirmed and might be unnecessary for the core application functionality. Admin interface is currently enabled and needs review.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to Admin Interface](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_admin_interface.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Locate the `admin_uri` configuration option in `mongoose.c` or your configuration file.
    *   Step 2: Change the default `admin_uri` (if it's still the default) to a non-obvious, randomly generated path. This makes it harder for attackers to guess the admin interface location.
    *   Step 3: Implement strong authentication for the admin interface. Configure `authentication_domain`, `authentication_timeout`, and ensure a secure authentication mechanism is in place (e.g., using strong passwords or API keys). Avoid default credentials.
    *   Step 4: Consider restricting access to the admin interface based on IP addresses using the `protect` configuration option. Allow access only from trusted networks or specific administrator IPs.
    *   Step 5: In production environments where the admin interface is not actively used for monitoring or management, consider disabling it entirely by not defining `admin_uri` or setting it to an empty string.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Admin Interface (Severity: High): If the admin interface is easily accessible and lacks strong authentication, attackers can gain control over the server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and complete system compromise.
    *   Information Disclosure via Admin Interface (Severity: Medium): The admin interface might expose sensitive server configuration information, logs, or statistics that could be valuable to attackers for reconnaissance and further attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Admin Interface: High risk reduction. Strong authentication and access restrictions significantly reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access.
    *   Information Disclosure via Admin Interface: Medium risk reduction. Restricting access limits the exposure of sensitive information through the admin interface.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. The `admin_uri` has been changed from the default, but basic password authentication is still used.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implementation of IP-based access restrictions for the admin interface using `protect`.
    *   Consideration of disabling the admin interface in production environments.
    *   Strengthening authentication mechanism beyond basic password, potentially using API keys or multi-factor authentication if feasible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Directory Listing](./mitigation_strategies/disable_directory_listing.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Locate the `enable_directory_listing` configuration option in `mongoose.c` or your configuration file.
    *   Step 2: Ensure that `enable_directory_listing` is set to `no`.
    *   Step 3: Verify the configuration change by attempting to access a directory in your web application without an index file (e.g., `http://yourserver.com/images/`). You should receive a "403 Forbidden" error or a custom error page instead of a directory listing.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure via Directory Listing (Severity: Medium): Directory listing allows attackers to enumerate files and directories on the server, potentially revealing sensitive file names, application structure, and configuration details. This information can be used to plan further attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure via Directory Listing: Medium risk reduction. Prevents attackers from easily discovering files and directories, hindering reconnaissance efforts.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented. `enable_directory_listing` is set to `no` in the project's configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No missing implementation for this specific mitigation. Regularly verify this setting remains enabled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Access to Sensitive Directories](./mitigation_strategies/control_access_to_sensitive_directories.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify sensitive directories in your web application that should not be publicly accessible (e.g., configuration files, internal scripts, backup directories).
    *   Step 2: Use the `protect` configuration option in Mongoose to define access control rules for these sensitive directories.
    *   Step 3: Specify access restrictions based on IP addresses, requiring authentication, or both. For example, to restrict access to `/admin` directory to only IPs from `192.168.1.0/24` network, use `protect /admin=192.168.1.0/24`. To require authentication, use `protect /sensitive_data=user:password`.
    *   Step 4: Test the access control rules thoroughly to ensure that unauthorized users are denied access to sensitive directories and authorized users can access them as intended.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data (Severity: High): Without proper access controls, attackers could potentially access sensitive configuration files, application code, or data stored in protected directories, leading to data breaches and system compromise.
    *   Information Disclosure of Sensitive Files (Severity: High): Access to sensitive files can reveal critical information about the application, its vulnerabilities, and internal workings, aiding attackers in planning more sophisticated attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data: High risk reduction. Access control rules effectively prevent unauthorized access to protected directories.
    *   Information Disclosure of Sensitive Files: High risk reduction. Limits the exposure of sensitive files and reduces the risk of information leakage.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic protection is in place for the `/admin` directory, requiring authentication.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive review and implementation of `protect` rules for all sensitive directories, including configuration directories, backup locations, and internal application paths.
    *   Consideration of more granular access control mechanisms if needed, potentially at the application level in conjunction with Mongoose's basic protection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Mongoose Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep_mongoose_up-to-date.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Regularly monitor the official Mongoose GitHub repository ([https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose)) for new releases and security advisories.
    *   Step 2: Subscribe to security mailing lists or RSS feeds related to Mongoose or embedded web servers to receive notifications about security vulnerabilities.
    *   Step 3: When a new stable version of Mongoose is released, review the release notes and changelog for security fixes and improvements.
    *   Step 4: Download the latest stable version of Mongoose.
    *   Step 5: Integrate the updated Mongoose library into your project. This might involve recompiling your application with the new Mongoose source files or replacing the Mongoose library file if you are using a pre-compiled version.
    *   Step 6: Thoroughly test your application after updating Mongoose to ensure compatibility and that the update did not introduce any regressions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: High to Critical): Outdated software is susceptible to exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. Failing to update Mongoose leaves your application vulnerable to these exploits.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: High risk reduction. Regularly updating Mongoose ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not consistently implemented. Mongoose version used in the project is currently several versions behind the latest stable release.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a regular schedule for checking for Mongoose updates (e.g., monthly).
    *   Implement a process for quickly applying Mongoose updates and testing the application after updates.
    *   Set up automated notifications for new Mongoose releases or security advisories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Concurrent Connections](./mitigation_strategies/limit_concurrent_connections.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify the `max_threads` and `max_connections` configuration options in `mongoose.c` or your configuration file.
    *   Step 2: Set appropriate values for `max_threads` and `max_connections` based on your server's resources and expected traffic load. These values should be high enough to handle legitimate traffic but low enough to prevent resource exhaustion from excessive connections.
    *   Step 3: Monitor your server's resource usage (CPU, memory, network) under normal and peak load conditions to fine-tune these limits.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Connection Exhaustion (Severity: High): Attackers can flood the server with a large number of connection requests, exceeding the server's capacity and causing it to become unresponsive to legitimate users. Limiting concurrent connections prevents this type of DoS attack.
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium): Excessive connections can consume server resources (memory, CPU), leading to performance degradation and potentially crashing the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Connection Exhaustion: High risk reduction. Limits the server's vulnerability to connection-based DoS attacks.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium risk reduction. Helps prevent resource exhaustion and maintain server stability under load.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. `max_threads` and `max_connections` are set to default values, which might be too high for the available server resources.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Properly tune `max_threads` and `max_connections` based on server capacity and expected traffic.
    *   Implement monitoring of server resource usage to detect potential resource exhaustion issues.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Request Body Size](./mitigation_strategies/control_request_body_size.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Locate the `max_upload_size` configuration option in `mongoose.c` or your configuration file.
    *   Step 2: Set `max_upload_size` to a reasonable limit based on the maximum expected size of legitimate request bodies (e.g., file uploads, form data). Choose a value that is large enough for legitimate use cases but small enough to prevent excessively large requests.
    *   Step 3: If your application does not handle file uploads or large data submissions, consider setting a very low `max_upload_size` to further minimize the risk.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion via Large Requests (Severity: Medium): Attackers can send excessively large requests (e.g., huge file uploads) to consume server resources (bandwidth, disk space, processing time), leading to DoS. Limiting request body size mitigates this.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion via Large Requests: Medium risk reduction. Prevents resource exhaustion caused by oversized requests.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. `max_upload_size` is not explicitly set and defaults to a potentially large value.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Set `max_upload_size` to an appropriate limit in the Mongoose configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Connection Timeout](./mitigation_strategies/set_connection_timeout.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Locate the `linger_timeout` and `idle_timeout` configuration options in `mongoose.c` or your configuration file.
    *   Step 2: Set appropriate values for `linger_timeout` (time to wait for data to be sent after connection close) and `idle_timeout` (time to keep idle connections alive).
    *   Step 3: Shorter timeouts release server resources more quickly from slow or idle connections, preventing resource starvation. However, timeouts should be long enough to accommodate legitimate slow clients or network conditions.
    *   Step 4: Monitor connection behavior and adjust timeouts as needed to optimize resource utilization and responsiveness.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Slowloris and similar attacks (Severity: Medium): Setting timeouts helps mitigate slow-rate DoS attacks by closing connections that are intentionally kept open for extended periods without sending data.
    *   Resource Exhaustion due to Idle Connections (Severity: Medium): Long-lived idle connections consume server resources (memory, file descriptors). Timeouts help reclaim resources from inactive connections.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Slowloris and similar attacks: Medium risk reduction. Helps mitigate slow-rate DoS attacks by limiting connection duration.
    *   Resource Exhaustion due to Idle Connections: Medium risk reduction. Improves resource utilization and server stability by managing idle connections.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Default timeout values are used, which might be longer than optimal for the application's environment.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Tune `linger_timeout` and `idle_timeout` to more aggressive values suitable for the application's expected connection patterns and resource constraints.
