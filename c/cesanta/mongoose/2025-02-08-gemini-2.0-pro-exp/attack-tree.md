## Attack Tree Path: [1. High-Risk Path: Buffer Overflow Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/1__high-risk_path_buffer_overflow_exploitation.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** Exploit Buffer Overflow in Mongoose Parsing [CRITICAL]
    *   Description: Mongoose may have vulnerabilities in its HTTP request parsing logic (headers, URI, POST data) where it doesn't properly check input lengths before copying data into fixed-size buffers.
    *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
    *   Impact: High-Very High (RCE)
    *   Effort: Medium-High
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate-Advanced
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium-Hard

*   **Attack Step:** Crafted HTTP Request with Oversized Headers/URI
    *   Description: The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request containing excessively long headers or URI components.

*   **Attack Step:** Send Malicious HTTP Request
    *   Description: The attacker sends the crafted HTTP request to the server running the Mongoose-based application.

*   **Exploitation:** If Mongoose doesn't validate the size of the input before copying it into a buffer, the attacker can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially injecting malicious code and gaining control of the server (RCE).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. High-Risk Path: Format String Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/2__high-risk_path_format_string_exploitation.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** Exploit Format String Vulnerability in Mongoose [CRITICAL]
    *   Description: Mongoose (or the application using it) might incorrectly use `mg_printf` (or similar functions) with a user-controlled format string.
    *   Likelihood: Very Low-Low
    *   Impact: Very High (RCE)
    *   Effort: Low-Medium
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Very Easy-Easy

*   **Attack Step:** Crafted Input Triggering Format String Vulnerability
    *   Description: The attacker provides input containing format string specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%n`, `%s`).

*   **Attack Step:** Send Malicious Input
    *   Description: The attacker sends the crafted input to the server, where it will be processed by the vulnerable `mg_printf` function.

*   **Exploitation:** The format string specifiers allow the attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations. This can be used to overwrite critical data, such as function pointers, leading to RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. High-Risk Path: Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/3__high-risk_path_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** Exploit Resource Exhaustion/Leak in Mongoose
    *   Description: Mongoose might not properly limit resource usage (connections, memory, file handles), making it vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.
    *   Likelihood: Medium-High
    *   Impact: Medium-High (DoS)
    *   Effort: Very Low-Low
    *   Skill Level: Novice-Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Easy-Medium

*   **Attack Step:** High Volume of Requests
    *   Description: The attacker sends a large number of requests to the server, potentially overwhelming its capacity to handle them.

*   **Attack Step:** Send Many Requests Targeting Resource Limits
    *   Description: The attacker sends a flood of requests, opens numerous connections, or uploads large files (if allowed) to consume server resources.

*   **Exploitation:** The server becomes unresponsive or crashes due to lack of available resources (CPU, memory, connections), resulting in a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. High-Risk Path: Logic Flaws (Path Traversal)](./attack_tree_paths/4__high-risk_path_logic_flaws__path_traversal_.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** Exploit Logic Flaws in Mongoose Functionality (mg_send_file with path traversal) [CRITICAL]
    *   Description:  A vulnerability in the `mg_send_file` function (or similar file-serving functionality) allows an attacker to bypass intended directory restrictions and access arbitrary files on the server.
    *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
    *   Impact: Medium-Very High (Information Disclosure, Potential RCE)
    *   Effort: Medium-High
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate-Advanced
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium-Hard

*   **Attack Step:** Abuse of mg_* API Functions (specifically `mg_send_file` with path traversal)
    *   Description: The attacker crafts a request that includes path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the filename passed to `mg_send_file`.

*   **Exploitation:** If Mongoose (or the application's use of `mg_send_file`) doesn't properly sanitize the filename, the attacker can access files outside the intended web root. This could allow them to read sensitive configuration files, source code, or even system files, potentially leading to further compromise or RCE.
