Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the Slowloris attack threat targeting the Mongoose embedded web server.

## Deep Analysis: Slowloris Attack on Mongoose HTTP Parsing

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics of a Slowloris attack specifically targeting the Mongoose embedded web server's HTTP parsing and connection handling capabilities.  We aim to identify potential vulnerabilities within Mongoose's *internal* mechanisms that could be exploited by this attack, going beyond simply observing the application-level impact.  We will also evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies, focusing on those directly applicable to Mongoose's configuration and code.

**1.2 Scope:**

*   **Target:**  The Mongoose embedded web server (https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose), specifically its HTTP request parsing and connection management logic.
*   **Attack Vector:** Slowloris attack, characterized by slow, incomplete HTTP requests.
*   **Focus:**  Internal Mongoose behavior, not just the application's response.  We are concerned with how Mongoose buffers, times out, and manages connections when faced with slow clients.
*   **Exclusions:**  We will not deeply analyze the application logic *built on top of* Mongoose, except where it directly interacts with Mongoose's connection handling (e.g., setting custom timeouts *through* Mongoose's API).  We will briefly touch on reverse proxies as a defense-in-depth measure, but a detailed analysis of reverse proxy configurations is out of scope.

**1.3 Methodology:**

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  Examine relevant sections of the Mongoose source code (primarily `mongoose.c` and related header files) to understand:
    *   How HTTP requests are received and parsed.
    *   How connections are managed (e.g., connection pools, timeouts).
    *   How incomplete requests are buffered and handled.
    *   Any existing configuration options or compile-time defines related to timeouts or connection limits.
    *   Identify potential areas of concern where slow requests could lead to resource exhaustion.

2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Identify and document all Mongoose configuration options (e.g., those set via `mg_bind_opts`, `mg_set_option`, or compile-time defines) that could influence the server's vulnerability to Slowloris.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Optional, if feasible):**  If resources and time permit, set up a test environment with Mongoose and attempt to simulate a Slowloris attack.  This would involve:
    *   Using a tool like `slowhttptest` or a custom script to send slow, incomplete HTTP requests.
    *   Monitoring Mongoose's resource usage (connections, memory, CPU) during the attack.
    *   Observing how Mongoose handles the slow connections and when/if it becomes unresponsive.
    *   Testing the effectiveness of different Mongoose configuration settings in mitigating the attack.

4.  **Mitigation Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies, focusing on those directly related to Mongoose.  Consider:
    *   Feasibility of implementation.
    *   Potential performance impact.
    *   Completeness of protection.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1 Threat Mechanics (Mongoose-Specific):**

A Slowloris attack against Mongoose exploits the way the server handles incomplete HTTP requests.  The attacker's goal is to exhaust Mongoose's connection pool or other resources by:

1.  **Establishing Connections:** The attacker initiates multiple TCP connections to the Mongoose server.
2.  **Sending Partial Requests:**  Instead of sending a complete HTTP request (headers and body), the attacker sends only a *partial* request, very slowly.  For example, they might send one byte of a header every few seconds.
3.  **Maintaining Connections:** The attacker keeps these connections open, periodically sending small amounts of data to prevent the server from timing out the connection (if default timeouts are too lenient).
4.  **Resource Exhaustion:**  Mongoose, while waiting for the complete request, allocates resources (e.g., a connection slot, buffer space) for each of these incomplete requests.  If the attacker opens enough connections and sends data slowly enough, Mongoose's connection pool can become full, preventing legitimate clients from connecting.  Alternatively, excessive buffering of incomplete requests could lead to memory exhaustion.

**2.2 Mongoose Code Analysis (Hypothetical - Requires Access to Specific Code Version):**

This section would contain specific code snippets and analysis based on the Mongoose source code.  Since we don't have a specific version pinned down, we'll outline the *types* of things we'd look for:

*   **`mg_recv` and related functions:**  We'd examine how Mongoose reads data from sockets.  Key questions:
    *   Is there a timeout for reading data from a socket?  Is it configurable?
    *   How much data is buffered before processing the request?  Is there a limit?
    *   How are incomplete requests handled?  Are they stored in a queue or buffer?
    *   Is there a mechanism to detect and close connections that are sending data too slowly?

*   **Connection Management (e.g., `mg_mgr_poll`, `mg_accept`):**
    *   How does Mongoose manage its connection pool?  What is the maximum number of connections?
    *   Is there a mechanism to prioritize new connections over existing, slow connections?
    *   Are there any configuration options to limit the number of connections per IP address?

*   **HTTP Parsing (e.g., functions related to parsing headers):**
    *   How does Mongoose parse HTTP headers?  Does it wait for the entire header block before processing?
    *   Is there a timeout for receiving the complete set of headers?
    *   How are malformed or incomplete headers handled?

*   **Configuration Options:**
    *   Look for options like `MG_OPT_RECV_TIMEOUT`, `MG_OPT_MAX_CONNECTIONS`, `MG_OPT_RECV_BUFFER_SIZE`, or similar.  Document their purpose and default values.
    *   Identify any compile-time defines (e.g., `#define MG_...`) that control timeouts or connection limits.

**Example (Hypothetical Code Snippet):**

```c
// Hypothetical Mongoose code snippet
static void mg_recv_http_request(struct mg_connection *nc) {
  char buf[4096];
  int n = mg_recv(nc, buf, sizeof(buf)); // Read from the socket

  if (n > 0) {
    // Process the received data (parse headers, etc.)
    nc->recv_mbuf.len += n;
    // ... (parsing logic) ...

    if (/* headers are complete */) {
      // Process the request
    } else {
      // Wait for more data (potentially vulnerable)
    }
  } else if (n == 0 || (n < 0 && !mg_is_error(n))) {
    // Connection closed or error
    mg_close_conn(nc);
  }
}
```

**Analysis of Hypothetical Snippet:**

*   **Potential Vulnerability:**  If `mg_recv` has a long or no timeout, and the parsing logic waits indefinitely for complete headers, this code is vulnerable.  An attacker could send a few bytes, wait, send a few more, and keep the connection open indefinitely.
*   **Mitigation:**  A strict timeout on `mg_recv` is crucial.  The parsing logic should also have a timeout for receiving the complete headers.  If the headers are not received within the timeout, the connection should be closed.

**2.3 Mitigation Strategies (Mongoose-Specific):**

*   **Mongoose-Specific Timeouts:** This is the *most important* Mongoose-specific mitigation.  We need to identify and configure:
    *   **Receive Timeout:** A timeout for `mg_recv` (or equivalent function) to limit how long Mongoose waits for data on a socket.  This might be a global setting or per-connection.
    *   **Header Completion Timeout:** A timeout specifically for receiving the complete set of HTTP headers.  This might be a separate configuration option or part of the HTTP parsing logic.
    *   **Overall Request Timeout:**  A timeout for the entire request (headers and body).

*   **Review Mongoose Code:**  As described above, a thorough code review is essential to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure that timeouts are implemented correctly and comprehensively.

*   **Connection Limits:**  If Mongoose allows configuring the maximum number of simultaneous connections, setting a reasonable limit can help prevent complete exhaustion of the connection pool.  However, this is not a complete solution, as an attacker could still consume all allowed connections.

*   **Reverse Proxy (Defense in Depth):**  While not a direct Mongoose mitigation, using a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy is *highly recommended*.  These tools are specifically designed to handle Slowloris and other connection-based attacks.  They can be configured with:
    *   Aggressive timeouts for client connections.
    *   Connection limits per IP address.
    *   Request rate limiting.
    *   Other security features.

**2.4 Risk Severity and Impact:**

*   **Risk Severity:** High.  A successful Slowloris attack can completely disable the Mongoose-based service, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).  The service becomes unresponsive, potentially leading to:
    *   Loss of business or revenue.
    *   Reputational damage.
    *   Disruption of critical services (if the application is critical).

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

A Slowloris attack poses a significant threat to applications using the Mongoose embedded web server.  The key to mitigating this threat lies in understanding how Mongoose handles incomplete HTTP requests and configuring appropriate timeouts.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Prioritize Timeouts:**  Identify and configure all relevant timeout settings within Mongoose, including receive timeouts, header completion timeouts, and overall request timeouts.  These should be set to the *lowest practical values* to minimize the impact of slow clients.
2.  **Thorough Code Review:**  Conduct a detailed code review of Mongoose's HTTP parsing and connection handling logic to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities related to slow requests.
3.  **Implement Defense in Depth:**  Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, HAProxy) in front of Mongoose to provide a robust first line of defense against Slowloris and other attacks.
4.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Regularly review Mongoose's configuration and code, and stay updated with the latest security advisories and patches.
5. **Dynamic testing:** Perform dynamic testing with tools like slowhttptest.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of a successful Slowloris attack and ensure the availability and reliability of their Mongoose-based application.
