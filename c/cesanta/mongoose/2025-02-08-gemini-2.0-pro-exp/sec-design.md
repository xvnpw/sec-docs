# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a lightweight, easy-to-use, and versatile networking library suitable for embedded systems and other resource-constrained environments.
*   Offer a cross-platform solution that simplifies network programming for developers, reducing development time and effort.
*   Maintain a small footprint to ensure compatibility with systems having limited memory and processing power.
*   Provide a stable and reliable networking stack that can handle various network protocols and scenarios.
*   Support a wide range of applications, from simple IoT devices to more complex networked systems.
*   Foster an active open-source community to encourage contributions, feedback, and continuous improvement.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the library could expose users to attacks, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial-of-service. This is a critical risk given the library's use in embedded systems, which often control physical devices or handle sensitive data.
*   Instability or bugs in the library could lead to application crashes, malfunctions, or unpredictable behavior, impacting the reliability of systems that depend on it.
*   Lack of support for essential networking protocols or features could limit the library's applicability and adoption, hindering its growth and competitiveness.
*   Difficulty of use or integration could deter developers from choosing the library, impacting its market share and community engagement.
*   Licensing issues or unclear intellectual property rights could create legal risks for users and the project itself.
*   Inadequate documentation or support could lead to user frustration and hinder the library's adoption and effective use.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Regular code reviews and audits. (Mentioned on the GitHub page and implied by good development practices).
*   security control: Use of static analysis tools (implied, common practice for C/C++ projects).
*   security control: Fuzz testing (mentioned in documentation).
*   security control: Support for TLS/SSL encryption (mentioned in documentation and features).
*   security control: API designed to prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows (implied by design goals and documentation).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library is written in C, which is inherently memory-unsafe. While efforts are made to mitigate risks, memory safety vulnerabilities are always a possibility.
*   accepted risk: The library supports a wide range of platforms and configurations, increasing the attack surface and the potential for platform-specific vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: The library relies on third-party dependencies (e.g., for cryptography), which may introduce their own vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: The library is open-source, meaning the code is publicly available for scrutiny, but also for potential exploitation by attackers.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all dependencies and their versions, facilitating vulnerability management.
*   security control: Integrate dynamic analysis tools (e.g., sanitizers) into the build and testing process to detect runtime errors.
*   security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process to handle reported security issues promptly and effectively.
*   security control: Provide security hardening guides and best practices for developers using the library.
*   security control: Consider memory safe language for new features or modules.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The library should support secure authentication mechanisms for relevant protocols (e.g., HTTP, MQTT, WebSockets).
    *   Implementations should protect against common authentication attacks (e.g., brute-force, credential stuffing).
    *   Support for secure storage and management of credentials (e.g., API keys, certificates) should be provided where applicable.

*   Authorization:
    *   The library should provide mechanisms for enforcing access control policies, where applicable (e.g., URI-based authorization for HTTP).
    *   Authorization checks should be performed consistently and securely to prevent unauthorized access to resources.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All input received from the network should be strictly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
    *   Input validation should be performed based on a whitelist approach, accepting only known-good input.
    *   The library should provide helper functions or APIs for secure input handling.

*   Cryptography:
    *   The library should use strong, well-vetted cryptographic algorithms and libraries for encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
    *   Cryptographic keys should be managed securely, following best practices for key generation, storage, and rotation.
    *   The library should support up-to-date TLS/SSL versions and cipher suites, and provide options for configuring security parameters.
    *   Avoid using deprecated or weak cryptographic primitives.

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  The commit triggers a build process on a build server (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or a similar CI/CD system).
3.  The build server checks out the code from the repository.
4.  Static analysis tools (e.g., linters, code analyzers) are run on the code to identify potential vulnerabilities and coding errors. Results are reported back to the developer.
5.  Fuzzing tools are used to test the library with a wide range of inputs, including malformed or unexpected data, to identify potential crashes or vulnerabilities. Results are reported back to the developer.
6.  The compiler compiles the source code into object files.
7.  The linker links the object files together to create the Mongoose library (either a static or dynamic library, depending on the configuration).
8.  The resulting library artifact is stored in an artifact repository.
