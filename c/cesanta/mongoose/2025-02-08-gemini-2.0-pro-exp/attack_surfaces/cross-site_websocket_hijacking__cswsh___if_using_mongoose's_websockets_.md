# Deep Analysis: Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) in Mongoose Applications

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability within the context of a Mongoose-based application, identify specific attack vectors, assess the potential impact, and define robust, Mongoose-specific mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers to secure their applications against this threat.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the CSWSH attack surface as it pertains to applications using the Mongoose library for WebSocket communication.  It covers:

*   Mongoose's WebSocket implementation details relevant to CSWSH.
*   The interaction between Mongoose's event handling and origin validation.
*   The role of `wss://` (Secure WebSockets) in mitigating the attack.
*   Specific code examples and configuration recommendations for Mongoose.
*   Excludes: General WebSocket security concepts not directly related to Mongoose, other attack vectors unrelated to CSWSH, and client-side vulnerabilities.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Definition:**  Clearly define CSWSH and how it differs from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
2.  **Mongoose Internals Review:** Examine Mongoose's WebSocket handling code (primarily focusing on event handlers like `MG_EV_WEBSOCKET_HANDSHAKE_REQUEST`, `MG_EV_WEBSOCKET_FRAME`, and `MG_EV_CLOSE`) to understand how origin checks can be implemented.
3.  **Attack Vector Identification:**  Describe realistic scenarios where a malicious actor could exploit CSWSH in a Mongoose application.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Analyze the potential consequences of a successful CSWSH attack, including data breaches, unauthorized actions, and denial of service.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Provide detailed, Mongoose-specific instructions and code examples for implementing robust origin validation and using `wss://`.
6.  **Testing Recommendations:** Suggest methods for testing the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations.
7. **False Positive/Negative Analysis:** Discuss potential issues with overly strict or lenient origin validation.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1 Vulnerability Definition: CSWSH vs. CSRF

**Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)** is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to establish a WebSocket connection from a malicious origin (e.g., `attacker.com`) to a vulnerable server, bypassing the same-origin policy that normally restricts such cross-origin communication.  Unlike CSRF, which exploits *existing* authenticated sessions using HTTP requests, CSWSH establishes a *new*, persistent WebSocket connection.  The attacker doesn't need to steal a session cookie; they directly interact with the WebSocket endpoint.

### 4.2 Mongoose Internals and Origin Validation

Mongoose handles WebSockets through its event-driven architecture.  The key event for mitigating CSWSH is `MG_EV_WEBSOCKET_HANDSHAKE_REQUEST`.  This event is triggered when a client attempts to establish a WebSocket connection.  Within the event handler for this event, we have access to the HTTP headers, including the crucial `Origin` header.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant Mongoose events and their roles:

*   **`MG_EV_WEBSOCKET_HANDSHAKE_REQUEST`:**  The *critical* event.  This is where we MUST perform origin validation.  The `struct mg_http_message` (usually named `hm` in event handler examples) contains the request headers.
*   **`MG_EV_WEBSOCKET_HANDSHAKE_DONE`:**  Triggered after the handshake is complete (either successfully or unsuccessfully).  Less useful for CSWSH mitigation, as the connection is already established (or rejected).
*   **`MG_EV_WEBSOCKET_FRAME`:**  Triggered when a WebSocket frame is received.  Origin validation is *too late* at this point.
*   **`MG_EV_CLOSE`:**  Triggered when the connection is closed.  Not relevant for preventing CSWSH.
*   **`MG_EV_HTTP_REQUEST`:** Triggered for regular HTTP requests. Not directly relevant to WebSocket handshake, but important for serving static files or other HTTP endpoints.

### 4.3 Attack Vector Identification

1.  **Scenario:** A user is logged into a home automation system (e.g., `home.local`) that uses a Mongoose-based server for real-time control via WebSockets.  The server does *not* implement origin validation.

2.  **Attacker Action:** The attacker crafts a malicious website (`attacker.com`) containing JavaScript code that attempts to establish a WebSocket connection to `ws://home.local:8080/websocket` (or whatever the WebSocket endpoint is).

3.  **Exploitation:** The user visits `attacker.com`.  The malicious JavaScript executes in the user's browser.  Because the Mongoose server lacks origin checks, the WebSocket connection is successfully established.

4.  **Impact:** The attacker can now send WebSocket messages to the home automation system, potentially controlling lights, locks, or other devices.  They can also receive data from the system, potentially eavesdropping on sensor readings or other sensitive information.

### 4.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful CSWSH attack can be severe:

*   **Unauthorized Control:**  The attacker gains control over functionality exposed through the WebSocket interface.  This could range from minor annoyances (e.g., flickering lights) to serious security breaches (e.g., unlocking doors, disabling security systems).
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker can receive data sent over the WebSocket connection, potentially including sensitive information like sensor data, user credentials (if improperly handled), or internal system status.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker could flood the WebSocket connection with messages, potentially overwhelming the server and making it unresponsive to legitimate users.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can damage the reputation of the application and the organization responsible for it.

### 4.5 Mitigation Strategy Development

**1.  Strict Origin Validation (Mongoose-Specific):**

This is the *primary* and *most crucial* mitigation.  Within the `MG_EV_WEBSOCKET_HANDSHAKE_REQUEST` event handler, we *must* check the `Origin` header and compare it against a whitelist of allowed origins.

```c
#include "mongoose.h"
#include <string.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

// Whitelist of allowed origins.  MUST be kept up-to-date.
static const char *s_allowed_origins[] = {
    "http://localhost:8000",
    "http://127.0.0.1:8000",
    "https://my-app.example.com",
    NULL // Important: NULL-terminate the array!
};

// Function to check if an origin is allowed.
static bool is_origin_allowed(const char *origin) {
    if (origin == NULL) {
        return false; // No origin provided - deny.
    }

    for (int i = 0; s_allowed_origins[i] != NULL; i++) {
        if (strcmp(origin, s_allowed_origins[i]) == 0) {
            return true; // Origin found in whitelist.
        }
    }

    return false; // Origin not found in whitelist.
}

static void event_handler(struct mg_connection *c, int ev, void *ev_data, void *fn_data) {
  if (ev == MG_EV_WEBSOCKET_HANDSHAKE_REQUEST) {
    struct mg_http_message *hm = (struct mg_http_message *) ev_data;
    const char *origin = mg_http_get_header(hm, "Origin");

    if (!is_origin_allowed(origin)) {
      mg_http_reply(c, 403, "", "Forbidden: Invalid Origin\r\n");
      MG_INFO(("Rejected WebSocket connection from disallowed origin: %s", origin ? origin : "(null)"));
      return; // Important: Stop processing the event.
    }

    MG_INFO(("Accepted WebSocket connection from allowed origin: %s", origin));
    // Proceed with WebSocket handshake (mg_ws_upgrade is usually called here).

  } else if (ev == MG_EV_WEBSOCKET_FRAME) {
    // Handle WebSocket frames (data) here.
    struct mg_ws_message *wm = (struct mg_ws_message *) ev_data;
    MG_INFO(("Received WebSocket frame: %.*s", (int) wm->data.len, wm->data.ptr));
  }
  // ... other event handlers ...
}

int main(void) {
  struct mg_mgr mgr;
  mg_mgr_init(&mgr);
  mg_http_listen(&mgr, "ws://0.0.0.0:8080", event_handler, NULL); // Use "ws://" for testing, "wss://" for production

  for (;;) {
    mg_mgr_poll(&mgr, 1000);
  }
  mg_mgr_free(&mgr);
  return 0;
}
```

**Key Points:**

*   **`is_origin_allowed()` function:**  This function encapsulates the origin validation logic, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
*   **Whitelist:**  The `s_allowed_origins` array contains the *exact* list of allowed origins.  This is a *whitelist* approach, which is far more secure than a blacklist.
*   **`mg_http_get_header()`:**  This Mongoose function retrieves the value of the `Origin` header.
*   **`mg_http_reply(c, 403, "", ...)`:**  This sends an HTTP 403 Forbidden response to the client, rejecting the WebSocket connection.  It's crucial to send this *before* calling `mg_ws_upgrade()`.
*   **`MG_INFO()`:**  Use Mongoose's logging functions to record both successful and rejected connections, including the origin.  This is essential for debugging and security auditing.
*   **`NULL` Origin:** Handle the case where the `Origin` header is missing (it might be `NULL`).  The example code denies connections without an `Origin` header.  This is generally a good security practice.
*   **Exact Matching:** The `strcmp` function performs an *exact* string comparison.  This is important.  Do *not* use partial matching or regular expressions for origin validation unless you *fully* understand the security implications.  It's easy to introduce vulnerabilities with overly permissive matching.

**2.  Secure WebSockets (`wss://`):**

While origin validation is the primary defense, using `wss://` adds a crucial layer of security by encrypting the WebSocket communication.  This prevents attackers from eavesdropping on the data transmitted over the connection and protects against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

To use `wss://`, you need to:

*   **Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate:**  You can use a self-signed certificate for testing, but for production, you *must* use a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).  Let's Encrypt provides free certificates.
*   **Configure Mongoose to use the certificate:**  Use the `mg_http_listen()` function with the `wss://` scheme and provide the paths to your certificate and private key files.

```c
// Example (replace with your actual paths)
mg_http_listen(&mgr, "wss://0.0.0.0:8443?cert=cert.pem&key=key.pem", event_handler, NULL);
```

### 4.6 Testing Recommendations

*   **Manual Testing:** Use a browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect WebSocket connections.  Try connecting from different origins (including `file:///` URLs, which should be blocked).
*   **Automated Testing:** Write scripts (e.g., using Python with the `websocket-client` library) to attempt WebSocket connections from various origins and verify that only allowed origins succeed.
*   **Security Scanners:** Use web application security scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to test for CSWSH vulnerabilities.  These tools can often automatically detect missing or misconfigured origin checks.
*   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the code that handles WebSocket connections, paying close attention to the origin validation logic.

### 4.7 False Positive/Negative Analysis

*   **False Positives (Overly Strict):**  If the origin whitelist is too restrictive, legitimate clients might be blocked.  For example, if you forget to include a subdomain or a specific port number, users on those origins will be unable to connect.  Careful testing and monitoring are essential to avoid this.  Use logging to identify blocked origins and adjust the whitelist as needed.
*   **False Negatives (Overly Lenient):**  If the origin validation is too permissive (e.g., using wildcard matching incorrectly), attackers might be able to bypass the checks.  For example, if you allow `*.example.com`, an attacker could use `attacker.example.com` to connect.  *Always* use exact string matching unless you have a very specific and well-understood reason to do otherwise.

## 5. Conclusion

Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking is a serious vulnerability that can have significant consequences for applications using Mongoose's WebSocket functionality.  By implementing strict origin validation within the `MG_EV_WEBSOCKET_HANDSHAKE_REQUEST` event handler and using `wss://` to encrypt the connection, developers can effectively mitigate this threat and protect their applications from unauthorized access.  Regular testing and code reviews are crucial to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of these security measures.

This comprehensive analysis provides a strong foundation for understanding and mitigating CSWSH in Mongoose applications. Remember to adapt the code examples and configurations to your specific application's needs. The key takeaway is the importance of *strict* origin validation within the Mongoose event loop.
