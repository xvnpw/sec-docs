# Deep Analysis: Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion in Mongoose

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the Denial of Service (DoS) attack surface related to resource exhaustion in applications utilizing the Mongoose embedded web server.  This includes understanding how Mongoose's internal mechanisms can be exploited, identifying specific vulnerabilities, and proposing concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  We aim to provide the development team with the knowledge necessary to build a more resilient application.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on DoS attacks that target resource exhaustion within Mongoose itself.  It covers:

*   **Connection Handling:**  How Mongoose manages incoming connections, connection pools, and the limits associated with them.
*   **Request Processing:**  How Mongoose handles incoming requests, including header parsing, data processing, and response generation.
*   **Threading Model:**  Mongoose's threading model and how it impacts resource consumption.
*   **Configuration Options:**  Relevant Mongoose configuration options (`mg_set_option`) that can be used for mitigation.
*   **Event Handler Interactions:** How custom event handler code can *exacerbate* or *mitigate* DoS vulnerabilities.
*   **External Dependencies:** We will *briefly* touch on external factors (like operating system limits) but primarily focus on Mongoose-specific aspects.

This analysis *excludes*:

*   DoS attacks targeting application logic *outside* of Mongoose's direct control (e.g., a computationally expensive API endpoint).
*   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which are mitigated at a network level (firewalls, load balancers, etc.).  We focus on what can be done *within* the Mongoose application.
*   Other attack vectors (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) unrelated to resource exhaustion.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will be conducted using the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the Mongoose source code (available on GitHub) to understand its internal workings, particularly the connection handling, request processing, and threading logic.  This will identify potential bottlenecks and vulnerabilities.
2.  **Documentation Review:**  Thoroughly review the official Mongoose documentation to understand the intended usage of configuration options and best practices.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Search for known vulnerabilities and exploits related to Mongoose and resource exhaustion.
4.  **Experimentation (Controlled Environment):**  Set up a test environment to simulate various DoS attack scenarios (e.g., SYN flood, Slowloris) and observe Mongoose's behavior.  This will validate theoretical vulnerabilities and test the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.
5.  **Best Practices Analysis:**  Identify and recommend industry-standard best practices for mitigating DoS attacks in embedded systems.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Connection Handling

*   **Vulnerability:** Mongoose, by default, might accept a large number of connections, potentially exceeding the system's resources (file descriptors, memory).  An attacker can flood the server with SYN requests (SYN flood attack) to exhaust the connection queue.
*   **Mongoose Internals:** Mongoose uses a connection pool to manage active connections.  The size of this pool is indirectly influenced by `num_threads` (each thread can handle multiple connections) and potentially directly by `max_connections` (if available).  If the pool is full, new connection attempts are typically queued.  If the queue is also full, connections are dropped.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **`num_threads`:**  Set this to a reasonable value based on expected load and system resources.  Avoid excessively high values.  *Example:* `mg_set_option(nc->mgr, "num_threads", "4");`
    *   **`max_connections`:** If your Mongoose version supports it, use this to *directly* limit the maximum number of concurrent connections.  This is a more precise control than `num_threads`. *Example:* `mg_set_option(nc->mgr, "max_connections", "100");`
    *   **Operating System Limits:** Ensure that the operating system's file descriptor limits (ulimit on Linux) are appropriately configured to allow Mongoose to handle the desired number of connections.  This is *outside* Mongoose's direct control but crucial.

### 4.2. Request Processing

*   **Vulnerability:**  Slowloris attacks exploit the way servers handle HTTP requests.  An attacker sends HTTP headers very slowly, one byte at a time, keeping the connection open for an extended period.  This ties up a connection slot with minimal resource usage on the attacker's side.  Similar attacks can involve slowly sending the request body.
*   **Mongoose Internals:** Mongoose reads incoming request data incrementally.  Without timeouts, it will wait indefinitely for the complete request to arrive.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **`request_timeout_ms`:**  This is *critical*.  Set a reasonable timeout for the entire request to be received.  This will close connections that are too slow.  *Example:* `mg_set_option(nc->mgr, "request_timeout_ms", "5000");` (5-second timeout).  This is the *primary* defense against Slowloris.
    *   **`recv_timeout_ms`**: Set timeout for receiving data. *Example:* `mg_set_option(nc->mgr, "recv_timeout_ms", "5000");`
    *   **Header Size Limits:** While Mongoose doesn't have a direct option for limiting header size, you can implement checks *within your event handler* to reject requests with excessively large headers.  This mitigates attacks that send huge headers to consume memory.

### 4.3. Threading Model

*   **Vulnerability:**  If `num_threads` is set too high, excessive context switching and thread management overhead can degrade performance and contribute to resource exhaustion, even under moderate load.
*   **Mongoose Internals:** Mongoose uses a thread pool to handle requests.  Each thread can handle multiple connections, but creating and managing threads has a cost.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **`num_threads` (Revisited):**  As mentioned before, carefully choose a value for `num_threads` that balances concurrency and overhead.  Start with a low value and increase it only if necessary, monitoring performance.  Consider the number of CPU cores available.

### 4.4. Event Handler Interactions

*   **Vulnerability:**  Poorly written event handler code can significantly worsen DoS vulnerabilities.  For example, a handler that performs long-running operations *without* yielding control can block the Mongoose thread, preventing it from handling other requests.
*   **Mongoose Internals:**  Mongoose calls your event handler for various events (e.g., `MG_EV_HTTP_REQUEST`, `MG_EV_ACCEPT`).  The handler should be as efficient as possible.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Avoid Blocking Operations:**  Do not perform long-running or blocking operations (e.g., large file I/O, complex calculations, external API calls without timeouts) directly within the event handler.  If necessary, offload these tasks to a separate thread or use asynchronous operations.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Custom):** Implement rate limiting *within your event handler*.  This is a crucial Mongoose-specific defense.  Here's a simplified example (using a global variable for demonstration â€“ a more robust solution would use a dedicated data structure):

        ```c
        #include <time.h>
        #include <string.h>
        #include <stdio.h>

        // Very basic rate limiting (for demonstration only)
        #define MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND 5
        #define RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW 1 // seconds

        static void ev_handler(struct mg_connection *nc, int ev, void *ev_data) {
          if (ev == MG_EV_HTTP_REQUEST) {
            struct http_message *hm = (struct http_message *) ev_data;
            char addr[32];
            mg_sock_addr_to_str(&nc->sa, addr, sizeof(addr), MG_SOCK_STRINGIFY_IP);

            static time_t last_request_time = 0;
            static int request_count = 0;

            time_t now = time(NULL);

            if (now - last_request_time > RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW) {
              // Reset the counter if the time window has passed
              request_count = 0;
              last_request_time = now;
            }

            if (request_count >= MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND) {
              // Rate limit exceeded - send a 429 Too Many Requests response
              mg_http_reply(nc, 429, "Retry-After: 1\r\n", "Too Many Requests\n");
              return;
            }

            request_count++;

            // ... (rest of your event handler logic) ...
          }
        }
        ```

    *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate all input received from clients within the event handler.  Reject malformed or excessively large data.

### 4.5 Resource Monitoring
* **Vulnerability:** Lack of visibility into Mongoose's resource usage makes it difficult to detect and respond to DoS attacks.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Logging:** Implement detailed logging within your event handler to track key metrics like the number of active connections, request rates, and processing times.
    * **External Monitoring:** Use external monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to collect and visualize resource usage metrics from your application. This can help you identify anomalies and set up alerts.

## 5. Conclusion

Denial of Service attacks via resource exhaustion are a serious threat to applications using Mongoose.  By understanding Mongoose's internal mechanisms and implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly improve the resilience of their applications.  The key takeaways are:

*   **Strictly limit connections:** Use `max_connections` (if available) and `num_threads` appropriately.
*   **Enforce request timeouts:**  `request_timeout_ms` is *essential* to prevent Slowloris attacks.
*   **Implement custom rate limiting:**  Add rate limiting logic *within your Mongoose event handler*.
*   **Write efficient event handlers:** Avoid blocking operations and validate all input.
*   **Monitor resource usage:**  Implement logging and use external monitoring tools.

This deep analysis provides a strong foundation for building a more secure and robust application using Mongoose. Continuous monitoring and adaptation to new attack techniques are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
