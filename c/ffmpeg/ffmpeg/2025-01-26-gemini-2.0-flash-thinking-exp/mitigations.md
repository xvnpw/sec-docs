# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ffmpeg/ffmpeg

## Mitigation Strategy: [Format Probing with FFmpeg (`ffprobe`)](./mitigation_strategies/format_probing_with_ffmpeg___ffprobe__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Format Probing with FFmpeg (`ffprobe`)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `ffprobe`:** Before processing any media file with FFmpeg for tasks like transcoding or analysis, use the `ffprobe` utility (part of the FFmpeg suite) to inspect the file.
    2.  **Validate Format and Codecs:**  Use `ffprobe` to extract information about the file's container format, codecs used for audio and video streams, and other relevant metadata.
    3.  **Verify Against Expected Parameters:**  Compare the extracted information from `ffprobe` against a predefined set of allowed or expected formats and codecs. For example, check if the video codec is within an allowed list (e.g., `h264`, `vp9`) and the container is of an expected type (e.g., `mp4`, `webm`).
    4.  **Reject Invalid or Unexpected Files:** If `ffprobe` reveals that the file's format, codecs, or other properties do not match the expected criteria, reject the file and prevent further processing. Log the rejection for security auditing.
    5.  **Example `ffprobe` command:**  A basic example command to get format and codec information in JSON format: `ffprobe -v error -show_format -show_streams -print_format json input_file.mp4`  Parse the JSON output in your application to perform validation.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload (High Severity):** Prevents processing of files that are disguised as valid media but are actually malformed or contain exploits targeting specific format parsers or demuxers within FFmpeg.
    *   **Format String Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of format string vulnerabilities by ensuring that FFmpeg only processes files conforming to expected formats, limiting exposure to potentially vulnerable parsing logic for less common or unexpected formats.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Files (Medium Severity):** Helps prevent DoS attacks caused by uploading intentionally malformed files designed to crash or hang FFmpeg's demuxing or decoding processes. By pre-validating with `ffprobe`, you can reject files that are likely to cause issues before resource-intensive processing begins.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload:** High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by proactively identifying and blocking many types of malicious media files before they are fully processed by FFmpeg.
    *   **Format String Vulnerabilities:** Medium Reduction - Decreases the attack surface by limiting the variety of file formats processed.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Medium Reduction - Makes it harder to trigger DoS via simple file uploads by filtering out files likely to cause processing errors.
*   **Currently Implemented (Hypothetical Project):**
    *   `ffprobe` is *not* currently used for format probing before processing.
*   **Missing Implementation (Hypothetical Project):**
    *   Implement `ffprobe` integration into the file upload and processing pipeline.
    *   Define a clear set of acceptable media formats, codecs, and container types based on application requirements and security considerations.
    *   Develop logic to parse `ffprobe` output and validate against the defined acceptable parameters.
    *   Implement error handling and logging for `ffprobe` failures and file rejections.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization with FFmpeg (Re-encoding/Conversion)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_with_ffmpeg__re-encodingconversion_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Sanitization with FFmpeg (Re-encoding/Conversion)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Re-encode to Safe Format:**  After initial input validation (like file type whitelisting and ideally `ffprobe` format probing), use FFmpeg to re-encode the input media file to a known, simpler, and safer format and codec.
    2.  **Choose a Robust and Well-Tested Codec/Container:** Select a codec and container combination that is considered robust and less prone to vulnerabilities. Examples include re-encoding to `h264` video and `aac` audio within an `mp4` container, or `vp9` video and `opus` audio in a `webm` container.
    3.  **Use FFmpeg for Transcoding:** Employ FFmpeg's transcoding capabilities to convert the input file to the chosen safe format.  This process effectively rewrites the file, stripping out potentially malicious or complex elements that might be present in the original input.
    4.  **Process the Sanitized Output:**  Use the re-encoded (sanitized) file for further processing within your application instead of the original uploaded file.
    5.  **Example FFmpeg command for re-encoding:**  To re-encode to `h264` and `aac` in `mp4`: `ffmpeg -i input_file.ext -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -strict experimental output_file.mp4` (adjust codec options as needed for your desired quality and compatibility).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Embedded Exploits (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of embedded exploits within complex or less common media formats. Re-encoding to a simpler format can neutralize exploits that rely on specific vulnerabilities in parsers or decoders for the original format.
    *   **Malformed Media Files (Medium Severity):**  Sanitizes malformed media files by creating a new, well-formed version. This can prevent issues caused by unexpected or corrupted data within the original file that might trigger vulnerabilities or processing errors in FFmpeg.
    *   **Complex Codec/Container Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Mitigates risks associated with vulnerabilities in less common or more complex codecs and container formats by transcoding to simpler, more widely tested, and generally more secure alternatives.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Embedded Exploits:** High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of many types of embedded exploits by rewriting the file structure and codec data.
    *   **Malformed Media Files:** Medium Reduction - Improves robustness against malformed input by creating a standardized, well-formed output.
    *   **Complex Codec/Container Vulnerabilities:** Medium Reduction - Lowers the risk by limiting exposure to vulnerabilities in less common or complex formats.
*   **Currently Implemented (Hypothetical Project):**
    *   Input sanitization via re-encoding is *not* currently implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation (Hypothetical Project):**
    *   Implement re-encoding as a sanitization step after initial input validation and before further processing.
    *   Choose appropriate "safe" output formats and codecs based on application needs and security considerations.
    *   Configure FFmpeg transcoding commands to ensure secure and efficient re-encoding.
    *   Consider offering different sanitization levels (e.g., different output codecs or quality settings) if needed for performance or compatibility reasons.
