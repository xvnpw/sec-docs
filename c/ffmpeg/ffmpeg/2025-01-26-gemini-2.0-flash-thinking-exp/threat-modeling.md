# Threat Model Analysis for ffmpeg/ffmpeg

## Threat: [Malformed Media File Exploitation (Decoder Buffer Overflow)](./threats/malformed_media_file_exploitation__decoder_buffer_overflow_.md)

Description: A specially crafted media file is designed to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities within FFmpeg's media decoders. When FFmpeg attempts to decode this malicious file, the overflow occurs, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code on the system processing the file. This attack targets vulnerabilities inherent in FFmpeg's decoder implementations.
Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to gain control of the system running FFmpeg. This is a critical impact as it can lead to complete system compromise.
FFmpeg Component Affected: `libavcodec` - specific media decoders responsible for parsing and decoding various media formats (e.g., H.264 decoder, VP9 decoder, etc.). The vulnerable component is format-dependent.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Regular FFmpeg Updates:  Immediately apply security updates and upgrade to the latest stable version of FFmpeg. Security patches often address critical decoder vulnerabilities.
*   Sandboxing: Isolate FFmpeg processes within a sandboxed environment. This limits the damage an attacker can cause even if a decoder vulnerability is exploited, by restricting access to system resources and sensitive data. Consider using containerization or process isolation techniques.
*   Format Whitelisting:  Restrict the application to only support essential media formats. Reducing the number of supported formats minimizes the attack surface by limiting the number of decoders that could potentially contain vulnerabilities.
*   Memory Safety Tools (Development & Testing): During development and testing phases, utilize memory safety tools like AddressSanitizer and MemorySanitizer to proactively detect memory corruption issues within FFmpeg integrations and potentially within FFmpeg itself if you are compiling from source or modifying it.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Processing Logic](./threats/integer_overflow_in_processing_logic.md)

Description:  FFmpeg's internal processing logic, particularly in areas handling media data sizes, durations, or buffer allocations, might be susceptible to integer overflows. An attacker can craft input that triggers these overflows, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially memory corruption or buffer overflows during subsequent processing steps within FFmpeg. This exploits flaws in FFmpeg's numerical handling.
Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS). While DoS is more likely, exploitable memory corruption leading to RCE is possible depending on the overflow's context and the subsequent operations. We consider RCE as a potential high impact.
FFmpeg Component Affected: Core processing modules within `libavutil`, `libavcodec`, and potentially demuxing/muxing logic in `libavformat`. Integer overflows can occur in various functions involved in data manipulation and resource management.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Regular FFmpeg Updates:  Keep FFmpeg updated to benefit from bug fixes, including those addressing integer overflow vulnerabilities. The FFmpeg development team actively works on fixing such issues.
*   Resource Limits: Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, processing time) for FFmpeg processes. This can help mitigate potential DoS scenarios arising from processing errors caused by integer overflows, even if RCE is not directly achieved.
*   Fuzzing (Development & Testing): Employ fuzzing techniques to test FFmpeg with a wide range of inputs, specifically targeting edge cases and boundary conditions that might trigger integer overflows. This helps identify potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited in production.
*   Code Review (Development & Contribution): If you are developing custom integrations or contributing to FFmpeg, conduct thorough code reviews focusing on integer arithmetic and data size handling to identify and prevent potential integer overflow vulnerabilities.
