# Attack Surface Analysis for ffmpeg/ffmpeg

## Attack Surface: [Demuxer Buffer Overflow](./attack_surfaces/demuxer_buffer_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in ffmpeg's demuxers (format parsers) can lead to buffer overflows when processing malformed or specially crafted media files. This occurs when the demuxer writes data beyond allocated buffer boundaries due to parsing flaws.
*   **ffmpeg Contribution:** ffmpeg's core responsibility is parsing diverse and complex media container formats. Inherent complexity in demuxing logic can introduce buffer overflow vulnerabilities within ffmpeg's code.
*   **Example:** A crafted MP4 file with maliciously oversized metadata fields triggers a buffer overflow in ffmpeg's MP4 demuxer during parsing, corrupting memory.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, program crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow overwrites critical memory regions, leading to full system compromise in vulnerable scenarios.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep ffmpeg Updated:**  Immediately apply security updates for ffmpeg as they are released. Demuxer buffer overflows are common targets for patches.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run ffmpeg processes within a security sandbox to limit the potential damage if an exploit occurs.
    *   **Memory Safety Tools (Development):** Utilize memory safety tools like AddressSanitizer during ffmpeg integration development and testing to proactively detect buffer overflows.

## Attack Surface: [Codec Decoder Buffer Overflow](./attack_surfaces/codec_decoder_buffer_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in ffmpeg's codec decoders can result in buffer overflows when decoding maliciously crafted or malformed compressed media streams. Decoders handle intricate algorithms and are highly susceptible to memory safety errors.
*   **ffmpeg Contribution:** ffmpeg's extensive codec library, both internal and through external libraries, is a core component. Decoder vulnerabilities within ffmpeg's codebase or its linked libraries directly expose applications.
*   **Example:** A video file encoded with a crafted H.264 bitstream exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in ffmpeg's H.264 decoder during the decoding process.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, program crash, potential for arbitrary code execution, leading to severe security breaches in vulnerable environments.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prioritize ffmpeg Updates:**  Decoder vulnerabilities are frequently targeted. Maintaining the latest ffmpeg version is paramount for security.
    *   **Use Security-Focused Builds:** Consider using ffmpeg builds that prioritize security hardening and include backported security patches if immediate upgrades are not feasible.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate ffmpeg decoding processes within sandboxes to contain potential exploits and limit their impact.
    *   **Memory Safety Tools (Development):** Employ memory safety tools during development to identify and fix decoder-related buffer overflows early in the development cycle.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflow in Demuxing/Decoding](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflow_in_demuxingdecoding.md)

*   **Description:** Integer overflows during size calculations within ffmpeg's demuxers or decoders can lead to undersized buffer allocations. Subsequent data processing then overflows these insufficient buffers, causing memory corruption.
*   **ffmpeg Contribution:** ffmpeg's code involves numerous size calculations for buffer management in both demuxing and decoding stages. Integer overflow vulnerabilities in these calculations are inherent risks within ffmpeg's architecture.
*   **Example:** A crafted media file triggers an integer overflow in ffmpeg's demuxer when calculating buffer size for metadata. The resulting undersized buffer is then overflowed when metadata is processed.
*   **Impact:** Buffer overflows, memory corruption, program crash, potential for arbitrary code execution, similar to direct buffer overflows, posing significant security risks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular ffmpeg Updates:** Security updates often address integer overflow vulnerabilities. Keep ffmpeg updated.
    *   **Compiler-Based Overflow Detection (Development):** Compile ffmpeg and integration code with compiler flags that detect integer overflows (e.g., `-fsanitize=integer` for testing and development).
    *   **Code Auditing (Security Focus):** Conduct focused security audits of ffmpeg integration code and potentially ffmpeg source code, specifically looking for integer overflow vulnerabilities in size calculation logic.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Use sandboxing to limit the potential damage from integer overflow exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Codec Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_codec_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** ffmpeg relies heavily on external libraries for codec support (e.g., libx264, libx265, libvpx). Security vulnerabilities within these third-party libraries directly propagate into ffmpeg and applications using it.
*   **ffmpeg Contribution:** ffmpeg's modular design and reliance on external codec libraries mean it inherits the security posture of these dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these libraries become ffmpeg vulnerabilities in practice.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in libvpx (used for VP9 decoding). If an application uses ffmpeg built with a vulnerable libvpx, it becomes vulnerable to attacks exploiting the libvpx flaw when processing VP9 video.
*   **Impact:**  Impact mirrors decoder vulnerabilities: memory corruption, program crash, potential for arbitrary code execution, stemming from the vulnerable third-party library code executed within ffmpeg's context.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Aggressively Update Dependencies:**  Regularly update ffmpeg *and* all its external dependencies, including codec libraries. Monitor security advisories for these libraries.
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Management:** Implement dependency scanning tools to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in ffmpeg's dependencies. Use dependency management practices to ensure timely updates.
    *   **Choose Reputable and Maintained Libraries:** When selecting or configuring ffmpeg builds, prioritize using well-maintained and security-audited codec libraries.
    *   **Static Linking with Vigilance:** While static linking can offer dependency control, it requires diligent management of updates for statically linked libraries to avoid security regressions.
