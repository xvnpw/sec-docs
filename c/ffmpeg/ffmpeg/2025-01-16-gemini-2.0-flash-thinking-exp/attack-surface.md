# Attack Surface Analysis for ffmpeg/ffmpeg

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Input Files](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_input_files.md)

**Description:** Providing FFmpeg with specially crafted multimedia files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in its parsing logic.

**How FFmpeg Contributes:** FFmpeg's extensive support for numerous multimedia formats requires complex parsing logic, which can contain vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, integer overflows, or format string bugs.

**Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted MP4 file that, when parsed by FFmpeg, triggers a buffer overflow in the H.264 decoder, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, memory corruption, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep FFmpeg updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Sanitize and validate input file metadata and content before passing it to FFmpeg.
*   Consider using a sandboxed environment to isolate FFmpeg processes.
*   Implement resource limits for FFmpeg processes to mitigate denial of service.

## Attack Surface: [External Resource Inclusion via Input Files](./attack_surfaces/external_resource_inclusion_via_input_files.md)

**Description:**  Tricking FFmpeg into accessing unintended external resources through specially crafted input files that reference external URLs or paths.

**How FFmpeg Contributes:** Some multimedia formats allow embedding or referencing external resources. FFmpeg's handling of these references can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker provides a media file that includes a URL pointing to an internal server. When FFmpeg processes this file, it makes a request to the internal server, potentially exposing internal services or data (SSRF).

**Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), information disclosure, potential access to internal resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Disable or restrict FFmpeg's ability to access external resources if not strictly necessary.
*   Implement strict input validation to prevent or sanitize URLs and paths within input files.
*   Use network segmentation to limit the impact of potential SSRF attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection (via Command-Line Interface Usage)](./attack_surfaces/command_injection__via_command-line_interface_usage_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses FFmpeg's command-line interface and constructs commands using unsanitized user input, attackers can inject arbitrary commands.

**How FFmpeg Contributes:**  FFmpeg's command-line interface accepts various options and arguments. Improper handling of user-provided data when constructing these commands can lead to command injection.

**Example:** An application allows users to specify an output filename. An attacker provides an output filename like "; rm -rf /", which, if not properly sanitized, could be executed by the system.

**Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid constructing FFmpeg commands directly from user input.
*   Use libraries or APIs that provide safer ways to interact with FFmpeg, abstracting away direct command-line construction.
*   If command-line usage is unavoidable, implement strict input validation and sanitization, escaping shell metacharacters.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal (via Command-Line Interface File Paths)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal__via_command-line_interface_file_paths_.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to specify input or output file paths directly to the FFmpeg command-line interface without proper validation, attackers can access or write files outside the intended directories.

**How FFmpeg Contributes:** FFmpeg relies on the operating system's file system access based on the provided paths. Lack of validation allows manipulation of these paths.

**Example:** An application allows users to specify an output directory. An attacker provides a path like "../../sensitive_data/output.mp4", potentially writing the output file to a sensitive location.

**Impact:** Unauthorized file access, modification, or deletion.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid allowing users to directly specify file paths.
*   If necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of file paths, ensuring they remain within allowed directories.
*   Use absolute paths instead of relative paths where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Codecs and Filters](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_codecs_and_filters.md)

**Description:** Exploiting bugs or vulnerabilities within the specific audio/video codecs or filters used by FFmpeg.

**How FFmpeg Contributes:** FFmpeg relies on a vast number of external libraries and internal implementations for codecs and filters. Vulnerabilities in these components can be exploited through specific input or processing parameters.

**Example:** A vulnerability exists in a specific version of the libavcodec library used by FFmpeg for decoding a certain video format. An attacker provides a video file that triggers this vulnerability, leading to a crash or memory corruption.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, denial of service, potential code execution (depending on the vulnerability).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep FFmpeg and its underlying libraries (libavcodec, libavformat, etc.) updated.
*   If possible, limit the number of codecs and filters enabled in the FFmpeg build to reduce the attack surface.
