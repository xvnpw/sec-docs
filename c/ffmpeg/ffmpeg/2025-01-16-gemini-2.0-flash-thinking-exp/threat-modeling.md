# Threat Model Analysis for ffmpeg/ffmpeg

## Threat: [Malformed Container Exploitation](./threats/malformed_container_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious media file with a malformed container format (e.g., MP4, AVI, MKV). When FFmpeg attempts to demux (separate the audio and video streams) this file, the malformed structure triggers a vulnerability. This could involve providing unexpected or out-of-bounds values in the container metadata.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for memory corruption that could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server or client processing the file.
*   **Affected Component:** `libavformat` (demuxers for various container formats). Specific functions within demuxer implementations are vulnerable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep FFmpeg updated to the latest stable version, which includes fixes for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement robust input validation before passing files to FFmpeg. This might involve basic checks on file headers or using separate tools for preliminary validation.
    *   Run FFmpeg in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to restrict the impact of a successful exploit.

## Threat: [Codec Vulnerability Exploitation (Decoding)](./threats/codec_vulnerability_exploitation__decoding_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious media stream encoded with a specific codec (e.g., H.264, HEVC, VP9) that contains crafted data designed to exploit a vulnerability in FFmpeg's decoder for that codec. This could involve providing invalid or unexpected bitstream sequences.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, memory corruption leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** `libavcodec` (decoders for various codecs). Specific decoding functions for the targeted codec are vulnerable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep FFmpeg updated to the latest stable version.
    *   If possible, limit the supported codecs to only those strictly necessary for the application.
    *   Implement input validation to detect potentially malicious bitstreams before passing them to the decoder (though this is often difficult to achieve effectively).
    *   Sandbox FFmpeg processes.

## Threat: [Parser Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/parser_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the parsers within FFmpeg that handle specific data formats within a codec's bitstream. These parsers prepare the data for the actual decoding process. Malformed data can cause crashes or memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** `libavcodec` (parsers associated with specific codecs). Functions responsible for parsing the bitstream of a particular codec.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep FFmpeg updated.
    *   Input validation (though challenging at the bitstream level).
    *   Sandbox FFmpeg processes.

## Threat: [Insecure Command-Line Argument Injection](./threats/insecure_command-line_argument_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If the application constructs FFmpeg command-line arguments based on user input without proper sanitization, an attacker might be able to inject malicious options that could compromise the system (e.g., using `-exec` to execute arbitrary commands). While the vulnerability lies in how the application *uses* FFmpeg, the direct interaction with FFmpeg's command-line interface makes it a relevant threat.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server.
*   **Affected Component:**  The parsing logic within the FFmpeg executable that handles command-line arguments.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid constructing command-line arguments directly from user input.
    *   Use a safe API or a well-defined set of allowed options.
    *   Escape or sanitize any user-provided values used in command-line arguments.
