## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in ffmpeg Processing [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_ffmpeg_processing__critical_node_.md)

This node represents a broad category of attacks that target vulnerabilities within ffmpeg's core processing logic. Success here can lead to significant compromise as it directly exploits flaws in the underlying media processing engine.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Malicious Input Processing [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__malicious_input_processing__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical entry point for many attacks targeting ffmpeg. Attackers aim to provide crafted input that causes ffmpeg to behave in an unintended and harmful way.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Supply Malformed Media File [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__supply_malformed_media_file__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers craft media files that violate format specifications or contain unexpected data to trigger vulnerabilities in ffmpeg's handling of these files.

    * **Trigger Buffer Overflow [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Provide Oversized Input Data:**  The attacker provides media data exceeding the expected buffer size, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations.
        * **Target Vulnerable Codec/Demuxer/Parser:** The attacker focuses on specific components of ffmpeg known or suspected to have buffer overflow vulnerabilities and crafts input that exploits these weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Known CVE in ffmpeg [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_known_cve_in_ffmpeg__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in the specific version of ffmpeg being used by the application.

    * **Identify Vulnerable ffmpeg Version:** The attacker first determines the exact version of ffmpeg used by the target application.
    * **Provide Input Triggering the Vulnerability:**  The attacker crafts input that matches the specific requirements to trigger the identified CVE, often using publicly available exploit code or techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Application's Interaction with ffmpeg [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_application's_interaction_with_ffmpeg__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

This node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application uses and interacts with the ffmpeg executable. These vulnerabilities often stem from insecure practices in command construction or output handling.

    * **Command Injection via ffmpeg Arguments [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Control Input Used to Construct ffmpeg Command:** The attacker finds ways to influence the arguments passed to the ffmpeg command, often through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized.
        * **Inject Malicious Commands into ffmpeg Execution:** The attacker injects additional commands or modifies existing ones within the ffmpeg command string. When the application executes this modified command, the attacker's injected commands are also executed on the server, leading to arbitrary code execution.
