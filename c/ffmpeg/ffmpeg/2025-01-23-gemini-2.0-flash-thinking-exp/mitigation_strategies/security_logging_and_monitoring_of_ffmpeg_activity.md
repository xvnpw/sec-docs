This is the foundational element of the mitigation strategy.  Detailed logging provides the raw data necessary for monitoring, alerting, and analysis. The specified log details are crucial for security purposes:

*   **Input Filenames and Paths:**  Essential for identifying potentially malicious input files or paths that could be used for path traversal attacks or to inject malicious content. Logging the *paths* is particularly important as filenames alone might be misleading if the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate input paths.
*   **Full FFmpeg Commands:**  Capturing the exact commands executed is paramount for detecting command injection vulnerabilities. By logging the full command, including arguments and options, security teams can identify unexpected or malicious commands being executed. This is critical because vulnerabilities in how applications construct FFmpeg commands can be exploited.
*   **Start and End Timestamps:**  Timestamps are vital for correlating FFmpeg activity with other application events and for understanding the duration of processing tasks. This helps in performance analysis and incident timeline reconstruction.
*   **Resource Usage Metrics (CPU, Memory, Processing Time):** Monitoring resource consumption is crucial for detecting Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or resource exhaustion attempts.  Abnormal spikes in CPU or memory usage by FFmpeg processes can be indicators of malicious activity or inefficient processing. Processing time can also highlight performance bottlenecks or unusual delays.
*   **FFmpeg Error Messages, Warnings, and Output (stdout/stderr):**  FFmpeg's error messages and warnings are invaluable for diagnosing issues, including security vulnerabilities being triggered, format errors indicative of malicious files, or misconfigurations. Standard output and standard error can contain further diagnostic information, including verbose output if enabled in FFmpeg commands, which can be helpful for debugging and security analysis.
