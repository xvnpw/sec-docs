## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching, most critical goal. RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, granting them complete control.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation.
    *   Keep FFmpeg updated to the latest version.
    *   Run FFmpeg in a sandboxed environment.
    *   Use a whitelist of allowed codecs and formats.
    *   Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Parsers/Decoders [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_parsersdecoders__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** FFmpeg's numerous parsers and decoders for various media formats represent a large attack surface. Vulnerabilities in these components can be exploited to achieve RCE.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Strict* input validation: Validate file headers, metadata, and internal structures before processing.
    *   Use a whitelist of allowed codecs and container formats.
    *   Fuzz testing: Regularly test FFmpeg with malformed inputs to discover unknown vulnerabilities.
    *   Sandboxing: Isolate FFmpeg processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 CVE-XXXXX (Known Vulnerabilities) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_cve-xxxxx__known_vulnerabilities___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific FFmpeg versions. Exploits are often readily available.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if unpatched) / Low (if patched promptly)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Immediate Patching:* Apply security updates as soon as they are released.
    *   Vulnerability Scanning: Use SCA tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   IDS/EDR: Employ intrusion detection and endpoint detection systems (though they may not catch all exploits).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Crafted Media File (Zero-Day) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_crafted_media_file__zero-day___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers create specially designed media files to exploit *unknown* vulnerabilities in FFmpeg.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Defense in Depth:* Implement multiple layers of security.
    *   *Aggressive Input Validation:* Go beyond basic checks; validate the internal structure of media files.
    *   Sandboxing: Isolate FFmpeg to contain the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   Anomaly Detection: Monitor for unusual FFmpeg behavior (though this is not foolproof).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Abuse FFmpeg Features](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_abuse_ffmpeg_features.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 HLS/DASH Playlist Abuse [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_hlsdash_playlist_abuse__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious HLS (m3u8) or DASH (mpd) playlist files that point to attacker-controlled servers or contain harmful directives.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Playlist Validation:* Thoroughly validate the contents of playlist files, including URLs and directives.
    *   Limit Redirects: Restrict the number of allowed redirects and segments.
    *   Domain Whitelisting: Only allow URLs from trusted domains.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 SSRF via FFmpeg Protocols [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_ssrf_via_ffmpeg_protocols__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit FFmpeg's support for various protocols (e.g., `file://`, `http://`) to access local files or make requests to internal services (SSRF).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if protocols are not restricted) / Low (if protocols are whitelisted)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Protocol Whitelisting:* Use FFmpeg's `-protocol_whitelist` option to strictly limit allowed protocols (e.g., `http,https,tcp,tls`).
    *   *Disable `file://`:* Unless absolutely necessary, disable the `file://` protocol. If required, restrict access to a specific, sandboxed directory.
    *   Network Segmentation: Use a firewall to prevent FFmpeg from accessing internal services.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Leverage Configuration Issues [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_leverage_configuration_issues__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in FFmpeg or its integration with other components can create vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Enable only necessary features and codecs.
    *   Secure Defaults: Review and harden FFmpeg's configuration.
    *   Regular Audits: Check for misconfigurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Cause Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/2__cause_denial_of_service__dos_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Input Flooding](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_input_flooding.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1 Malicious FFmpeg Command Injection (if user input is passed directly) [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_malicious_ffmpeg_command_injection__if_user_input_is_passed_directly___hr___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to directly influence FFmpeg command-line arguments, attackers can inject malicious options to cause DoS or potentially RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if input is sanitized) / Very High (if not)
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if logs are monitored) / Very Easy (if input validation is implemented)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Never* allow direct user control over FFmpeg command-line arguments.
    *   Use a well-defined API to interact with FFmpeg.
    *   Sanitize and validate all inputs rigorously.
    *   Use a command builder pattern to construct FFmpeg commands safely.
