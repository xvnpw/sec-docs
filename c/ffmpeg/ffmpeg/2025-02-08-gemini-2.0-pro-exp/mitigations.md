# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ffmpeg/ffmpeg

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Protocol Whitelisting](./mitigation_strategies/strict_protocol_whitelisting.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** `Strict Protocol Whitelisting`

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Protocols:** Determine the absolute minimum set of protocols needed (e.g., `file`, `pipe`, `http`, `https`, `rtsp`, `tcp`).
    2.  **Use `-protocol_whitelist`:**  Use the `-protocol_whitelist` option followed by a comma-separated list of *only* the allowed protocols.  Example: `ffmpeg -protocol_whitelist file,pipe,http ...`
    3.  **Avoid Dangerous Protocols:**  Completely avoid `concat` (demuxer), `data`, and `glob` if user input is involved.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical):**  Exploits using vulnerable protocols.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High):**  Unauthorized access to internal or external resources.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):**  Leaking server information via protocols.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):**  DoS attacks targeting specific protocols.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:**  Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **SSRF:**  Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Risk reduced.
    *   **DoS:**  Risk partially reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Implemented in the `VideoProcessor` class, `process_video()` method. Whitelist from `config.ini`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Missing in the `AudioConverter` class (uses hardcoded command).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Components](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_components.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** `Disable Unnecessary Demuxers, Decoders, Encoders, Filters, and Bitstream Filters`

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Components:** Determine the *exact* demuxers, decoders, encoders, filters, and bitstream filters needed.
    2.  **Disable Unneeded Components:**
        *   **Codecs:** `-codec:v none`, `-codec:a none`, etc.  Force specific codecs: `-c:v libx264`.
        *   **Streams:** `-vn`, `-an`, `-sn`.
        *   **Formats:** `-f mp4 ... -f avi ...` (force input/output formats).
        *   **Filters:** Minimize filter graph complexity. Avoid user-controlled filter parameters *within the FFmpeg command*.
        *   **Bitstream Filters:** `-bsf:v none`, `-bsf:a none`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical):**  Vulnerabilities in specific components.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):**  DoS attacks targeting specific components.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low):**  Information leaks from specific components.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:**  Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **DoS:**  Risk partially reduced.
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Risk slightly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Partially. `-vn` used for audio-only files.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Full audit needed. Force specific codecs/encoders. Disable unused components via configuration. Review `ImageProcessor`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [FFmpeg-Specific Resource Limits](./mitigation_strategies/ffmpeg-specific_resource_limits.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** `FFmpeg-Specific Resource Limits`

*   **Description:**
    1. **Use FFmpeg Options:**
        *   `-re`: Read input at native frame rate (prevents excessive CPU usage in some cases).
        *   `-fs <size>`: Limit the output file size (e.g., `-fs 100M`).
        *   `-threads <number>`: Control the number of threads FFmpeg uses.  Start with a low number and increase only if necessary.
        *  `-max_muxing_queue_size <packets>`: Limit the size of the muxing queue. This can help prevent memory exhaustion issues, especially with complex streams.
    2. **Careful Codec/Option Selection:** Choose codecs and options that are known to be efficient and less prone to resource exhaustion issues. Avoid overly complex configurations.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):**  Prevents FFmpeg from consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium):**  Limits the impact of vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced (limits resource consumption).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `-re` is used in some cases, but other options are not consistently applied.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example:  `-fs`, `-threads`, and `-max_muxing_queue_size` should be considered and configured appropriately based on the application's needs and the expected input.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled FFmpeg Logging](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_ffmpeg_logging.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** `Controlled FFmpeg Logging`

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `-loglevel`:**  Use the `-loglevel` option to control the verbosity of FFmpeg's output.  
        *   For production, use `-loglevel warning` or `-loglevel error` to log only significant issues.
        *   For debugging, use `-loglevel debug` or `-loglevel verbose` (but *never* in production with user-supplied input).
    2. **Avoid Excessive Logging with Untrusted Input:** *Never* use high verbosity levels (debug, verbose) with untrusted input, as this could expose sensitive information or create vulnerabilities.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):**  Prevents sensitive information from being logged.
    *   **Log Injection (Low):** Reduces the risk of attackers injecting malicious data into logs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (limits what's logged).
    *   **Log Injection:** Risk slightly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example:  Basic FFmpeg output is logged, but `-loglevel` is not consistently used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example:  `-loglevel` should be set appropriately (warning/error in production, debug only for trusted testing).
