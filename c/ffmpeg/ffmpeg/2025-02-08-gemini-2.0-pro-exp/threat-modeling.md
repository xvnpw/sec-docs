# Threat Model Analysis for ffmpeg/ffmpeg

## Threat: [Codec Buffer Overflow Exploitation](./threats/codec_buffer_overflow_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious media file containing specially designed data that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in a specific codec's decoding process (e.g., a vulnerable H.264 decoder). The attacker sends this file to the application, triggering the overflow when FFmpeg attempts to decode it. This allows the attacker to overwrite memory beyond the allocated buffer.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to complete system compromise. The attacker could gain full control of the server, steal data, install malware, or use the server for further attacks.
    *   **Affected FFmpeg Component:** Specific codec decoders (e.g., `libavcodec/h264.c`, `libavcodec/mpegvideo.c`, or any vulnerable codec implementation). The vulnerability lies within the parsing and decoding logic of the affected codec.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Codec Whitelisting:** Only enable the *absolutely necessary* codecs. Disable all others. Prioritize modern, well-maintained codecs (e.g., VP9, AV1) over older, potentially less secure ones.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the input file's structure and headers *before* passing it to the decoder. Check for inconsistencies and anomalies that might indicate a malicious file.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Regularly fuzz the enabled codecs with a wide variety of malformed inputs to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
        *   **Memory Safety:** Compile FFmpeg with memory safety features enabled (e.g., AddressSanitizer, ASan) to detect and prevent buffer overflows at runtime.
        *   **Update Regularly:** Keep FFmpeg and all its dependent libraries up-to-date to the latest stable versions.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Demuxer](./threats/integer_overflow_in_demuxer.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a media file with manipulated metadata or stream parameters that cause an integer overflow within the demuxer (the component that separates the container format into individual streams). This overflow can lead to incorrect memory allocation or other logic errors.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) due to application crashes or hangs. In some cases, it might lead to out-of-bounds reads or writes, potentially enabling information disclosure or even limited code execution.
    *   **Affected FFmpeg Component:** Demuxers (e.g., `libavformat/matroskadec.c`, `libavformat/mov.c`, `libavformat/avi.c`). The vulnerability is in the code that parses the container format's metadata and stream information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate all metadata and stream parameters read from the container format. Check for unrealistic values and inconsistencies.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz the demuxers with malformed container files to identify and fix integer overflow vulnerabilities.
        *   **Integer Overflow Checks:** Use compiler features or libraries that provide integer overflow detection and prevention.
        *   **Update Regularly:** Keep FFmpeg and its dependencies updated.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Protocol Handlers](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_protocol_handlers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a URL or a specially crafted playlist file (e.g., an M3U playlist) that instructs FFmpeg to make requests to internal or unintended external servers using protocols like HTTP, FTP, or RTSP.  The attacker might try to access internal services, scan the internal network, or exfiltrate data.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal services, network reconnaissance, data exfiltration, potential for further attacks against internal systems.
    *   **Affected FFmpeg Component:** Protocol handlers (e.g., `libavformat/http.c`, `libavformat/rtsp.c`, `libavformat/file.c`). The vulnerability lies in how FFmpeg handles URLs and network requests.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Protocol Whitelisting:** Only allow *absolutely necessary* protocols. Disable protocols like `file://`, `http://`, `ftp://` unless strictly required. If network access is needed, restrict it to specific, trusted domains.
        *   **URL Validation:** If accepting URLs as input, strictly validate them. Use a robust URL parser and check against a whitelist of allowed domains and schemes. *Never* blindly trust user-provided URLs.
        *   **Network Isolation:** Run FFmpeg in a network-isolated environment (e.g., a container with limited network access) to prevent it from accessing internal services or the wider internet.
        *   **Disable `file://` Protocol:** Explicitly disable the `file://` protocol unless absolutely necessary for local file access, and then only with strict path validation.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Filter Arguments](./threats/command_injection_via_filter_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input to an FFmpeg filter that allows the execution of external commands (e.g., the `asyncts` filter with the `compensate` option, or custom filters). The attacker crafts the input to inject arbitrary shell commands.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected FFmpeg Component:** Filters that allow command execution (e.g., `libavfilter/af_asyncts.c`, or any custom filter with command execution capabilities). The vulnerability is in the filter's handling of user-provided arguments.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Command Execution:** *Completely disable* any filters that allow command execution unless they are *absolutely essential* for the application's functionality.
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** If command execution *must* be used, implement *extremely rigorous* input sanitization. Use a whitelist of allowed characters and escape any potentially dangerous characters. *Never* directly pass user input to a shell command.
        *   **Parameterization:** If possible, use parameterized commands instead of string concatenation to build commands. This helps prevent injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run FFmpeg with the least possible privileges. Avoid running it as root or with administrative rights.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free in a Custom or Third-Party Codec/Filter](./threats/use-after-free_in_a_custom_or_third-party_codecfilter.md)

* **Description:** A vulnerability exists in a custom-built codec or filter, or in a third-party library used by FFmpeg, where memory is accessed after it has been freed. An attacker crafts a media file that triggers this vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Unpredictable behavior, crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    * **Affected FFmpeg Component:** Custom or third-party codecs/filters integrated with FFmpeg, or vulnerable dependencies.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Code Audits:** Thoroughly audit the code of custom codecs/filters for memory management errors, including use-after-free vulnerabilities.
        * **Memory Safety Tools:** Use memory safety tools (e.g., Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) during development and testing to detect use-after-free errors.
        * **Fuzzing:** Fuzz the custom codec/filter with a wide range of inputs.
        * **Dependency Management:** Carefully manage dependencies and ensure they are up-to-date and from trusted sources.
        * **Sandboxing:** Isolate the custom codec/filter in a separate process or container to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
