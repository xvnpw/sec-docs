# Attack Surface Analysis for ffmpeg/ffmpeg

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Media File Processing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_media_file_processing.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in FFmpeg's parsers, decoders, and demuxers through crafted input files. This is the most common and dangerous attack vector, directly related to FFmpeg's core functionality.
    *   **How FFmpeg Contributes:** FFmpeg's core functionality is to process a wide variety of complex media formats.  The complexity of parsing and decoding these formats creates numerous opportunities for vulnerabilities within FFmpeg's code.
    *   **Example:**
        *   A specially crafted MP4 file with a malformed H.264 video stream that triggers a buffer overflow in FFmpeg's H.264 decoder.
        *   An AVI file with a corrupted index that causes an out-of-bounds read within FFmpeg's AVI demuxer.
        *   A WebM file designed to cause excessive memory allocation within FFmpeg, leading to a denial-of-service.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Complete control over the application and potentially the host system (directly through FFmpeg's vulnerabilities).
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Application crash or unresponsiveness (caused by FFmpeg's processing).
        *   Information Disclosure: Leakage of sensitive data (if FFmpeg has access to it).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation (Difficult but Essential):** Attempt to validate media file structure *before* FFmpeg processing.  This is extremely challenging.
        *   **Codec/Format Whitelisting:** *Strictly* limit supported codecs and container formats to the absolute minimum.  Disable all others within FFmpeg's configuration. This is the *most effective* mitigation.
        *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Run FFmpeg in a tightly controlled, isolated environment (e.g., Docker, seccomp, AppArmor). This limits the damage from a successful exploit *within FFmpeg*.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict limits on memory, CPU, processing time, and file size within FFmpeg's processing pipeline.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep FFmpeg and all its dependencies up-to-date. Automate this process.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Integrate regular fuzz testing of FFmpeg into your development pipeline.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Compile FFmpeg with only the necessary components.

## Attack Surface: [Network Protocol Exploitation (If Applicable)](./attack_surfaces/network_protocol_exploitation__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in FFmpeg's *own* network protocol implementations (e.g., RTSP, HTTP, RTP) when used for streaming or fetching remote media.
    *   **How FFmpeg Contributes:** FFmpeg includes built-in support for various network protocols, and these implementations *within FFmpeg* can have vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:**
        *   A malformed RTSP request triggers a buffer overflow in FFmpeg's RTSP client code.
        *   A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack where a user-supplied URL causes FFmpeg to make requests to internal services *due to a vulnerability in FFmpeg's handling of the URL*.
        *   A crafted HLS manifest causes FFmpeg to download excessively large segments, leading to a DoS *because of a flaw in FFmpeg's HLS implementation*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Possible, though less likely than file parsing, but still directly through FFmpeg.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Disruption of streaming (FFmpeg's responsibility).
        *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): Access to internal resources (initiated by FFmpeg).
        *   Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Network Protocols if Unnecessary:** If network streaming isn't needed, disable all network protocol support *within FFmpeg*.
        *   **Input Validation (URLs):** Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided URLs *before* passing them to FFmpeg.
        *   **Network Isolation:** Run FFmpeg in a network-isolated environment.
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Restrict FFmpeg's network access.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep FFmpeg updated.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** FFmpeg relies on external libraries (libavcodec, libavformat, etc.) that may contain vulnerabilities.
    * **How FFmpeg Contributes:** FFmpeg uses external libraries for various functionalities, and vulnerabilities in these libraries can affect FFmpeg.
    * **Example:**
        * A vulnerability in libavcodec's H.264 decoder could be exploited through FFmpeg.
    * **Impact:**
        * Remote Code Execution (RCE)
        * Denial of Service (DoS)
        * Information Disclosure
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regular Updates:** Keep FFmpeg and all its dependencies updated. Use a dependency management system to track and update libraries.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities in FFmpeg and its dependencies.
        * **Static Linking (with caution):** Consider statically linking FFmpeg with its dependencies to have more control over the versions used. However, this makes updating more complex.

## Attack Surface: [Filter Graph Injection (If Applicable)](./attack_surfaces/filter_graph_injection__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**  Injection of malicious FFmpeg filter commands through unsanitized user input used to construct filter graphs *within FFmpeg*.
    *   **How FFmpeg Contributes:**  FFmpeg's filtering system is vulnerable if user input is directly incorporated into filter graph definitions without proper escaping *within FFmpeg's processing*.
    *   **Example:**
        *   User input directly inserted into `drawtext=text='$(malicious_command)'` within FFmpeg's filter graph, leading to command execution.
        *   An attacker injects a filter causing excessive resource consumption (DoS) *within FFmpeg*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Possible, depending on the filter and environment, executed *by FFmpeg*.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Through resource exhaustion *within FFmpeg*.
        *   Data Manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** *Never* directly embed user input into filter graph strings. Use robust escaping or a templating system.
        *   **Parameterization:** Use parameterized filter options instead of constructing graphs from user input.
        *   **Whitelist of Allowed Filters:** Limit usable filters to a predefined, safe list *within FFmpeg's configuration*.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Sandboxing FFmpeg limits the impact.
