# Threat Model Analysis for ffmpeg/ffmpeg

## Threat: [Malicious Media File Exploitation (Buffer Overflow)](./threats/malicious_media_file_exploitation_(buffer_overflow).md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a media file with specific malformed data that, when processed by FFmpeg, causes a buffer overflow. This allows the attacker to overwrite adjacent memory regions within the FFmpeg process.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution within the context of the process running FFmpeg.
    *   **Affected FFmpeg Component:**  Primarily affects demuxers (e.g., MP4, AVI demuxer) and decoders (e.g., H.264, MPEG-4 decoder) responsible for parsing and processing the file's structure and data. Specific functions within these modules related to memory allocation and data copying are vulnerable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep FFmpeg updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Implement robust input validation *at the FFmpeg processing level* to reject files with suspicious headers or metadata that could trigger buffer overflows. This might involve using FFmpeg's own validation capabilities or pre-processing steps.
        *   Consider running FFmpeg in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
        *   Utilize Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) at the operating system level.
        *   Employ memory-safe programming practices if developing custom FFmpeg components or wrappers.

## Threat: [Malicious Media File Exploitation (Integer Overflow)](./threats/malicious_media_file_exploitation_(integer_overflow).md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a media file that causes an integer overflow during size calculations within FFmpeg. This can lead to undersized memory allocations, followed by buffer overflows when data is written by FFmpeg.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution within the context of the process running FFmpeg.
    *   **Affected FFmpeg Component:**  Affects demuxers and decoders where size calculations are performed, particularly when handling metadata or frame dimensions. Functions involved in memory allocation (e.g., `av_malloc`, `av_realloc`) within FFmpeg are directly affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep FFmpeg updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Implement checks *within the FFmpeg processing pipeline* for unusually large values in media file headers and metadata before performing size calculations.
        *   Utilize compiler flags that provide runtime checks for integer overflows when building FFmpeg or custom components.

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability](./threats/format_string_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a media file containing format string specifiers in metadata fields (e.g., title, artist). If this metadata is processed by FFmpeg using vulnerable functions, the attacker can read from or write to arbitrary memory locations within the FFmpeg process.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive memory within the FFmpeg process), application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution within the context of the process running FFmpeg.
    *   **Affected FFmpeg Component:**  Potentially affects demuxers that parse metadata and functions used for logging or displaying metadata *within FFmpeg itself*. Vulnerable functions would involve using user-controlled strings directly in format strings (e.g., `av_log` with unsanitized input).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that user-provided data processed *directly by FFmpeg* is never used as a format string argument.
        *   Keep FFmpeg updated, as older versions were more susceptible to these vulnerabilities, and modern versions have implemented safeguards.

## Threat: [External Library Vulnerabilities](./threats/external_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** FFmpeg relies on various external libraries (e.g., libvpx, x264). Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited indirectly through FFmpeg's usage of them.
    *   **Impact:**  Can range from application crashes and denial of service to arbitrary code execution within the context of the process running FFmpeg, depending on the specific vulnerability in the external library.
    *   **Affected FFmpeg Component:**  Indirectly affects FFmpeg components that utilize the vulnerable external library. For example, vulnerabilities in libvpx would affect the VP8/VP9 decoders/encoders within FFmpeg.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the specific vulnerability, but considered High for this list due to potential impact.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep FFmpeg and all its dependencies updated to the latest stable versions. This often involves rebuilding FFmpeg after updating system libraries.
        *   Regularly scan the FFmpeg build environment and dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security auditing tools.
        *   Consider using statically linked builds of FFmpeg to have more control over the included library versions and simplify dependency management.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Specific Codec Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_specific_codec_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Specific codecs within FFmpeg might have known vulnerabilities that can be triggered by crafting media files encoded with that specific codec.
    *   **Impact:**  Application crash, memory corruption within the FFmpeg process, potential for arbitrary code execution within the context of the process running FFmpeg.
    *   **Affected FFmpeg Component:**  The specific decoder or encoder module for the vulnerable codec (e.g., the `libavcodec/h264dec.c` file for H.264 vulnerabilities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the specific vulnerability, but considered High for this list due to potential impact.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep FFmpeg updated to the latest stable version, which includes fixes for known codec vulnerabilities.
        *   Limit the supported codecs to only those that are strictly necessary for the application.
        *   Consider using hardware acceleration where possible, as this may offload processing from vulnerable software codecs.
