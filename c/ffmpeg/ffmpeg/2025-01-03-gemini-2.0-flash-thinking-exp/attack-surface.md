# Attack Surface Analysis for ffmpeg/ffmpeg

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Media Files](./attack_surfaces/malformed_media_files.md)

*   **Description:**  FFmpeg processes user-provided media files. Maliciously crafted files can exploit vulnerabilities in FFmpeg's demuxers, decoders, and parsers.
    *   **How FFmpeg Contributes:** FFmpeg's core functionality is to interpret and process the structure and data within various media file formats. This parsing and decoding logic is where vulnerabilities can exist.
    *   **Example:** A video file with an invalid header or incorrect chunk sizes that triggers a buffer overflow in FFmpeg's MP4 demuxer.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to crashes, denial-of-service (DoS), information disclosure (e.g., memory leaks), or potentially remote code execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization before passing files to FFmpeg. Consider using a dedicated validation library or service before FFmpeg processing. Keep FFmpeg updated to the latest version with security patches. Run FFmpeg in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Codec Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_codec_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** FFmpeg supports a vast array of codecs. Vulnerabilities within specific codec implementations can be exploited through crafted media files using those codecs.
    *   **How FFmpeg Contributes:** FFmpeg integrates and utilizes numerous codec libraries (either its own or external). Vulnerabilities in these codecs directly become vulnerabilities within FFmpeg's processing.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted H.264 video stream that triggers a buffer overflow in FFmpeg's H.264 decoder.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to malformed files, can lead to crashes, DoS, information disclosure, or RCE.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep FFmpeg and its underlying codec libraries updated. Consider limiting the supported codecs to only those necessary for the application. Implement checks and fallbacks for decoding errors.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflows/Underflows in Processing](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflowsunderflows_in_processing.md)

*   **Description:** During media processing, FFmpeg performs numerous arithmetic operations. Integer overflows or underflows in these calculations can lead to unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows.
    *   **How FFmpeg Contributes:**  FFmpeg's internal algorithms involve arithmetic operations on media data. If not carefully handled, these operations can wrap around, leading to incorrect memory calculations.
    *   **Example:** An integer overflow during calculation of buffer size for a video frame, leading to a subsequent buffer overflow when the frame data is written.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially RCE.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Implement robust input validation to check for excessively large values before processing. Use data types that can accommodate the expected range of values. Employ safe arithmetic libraries or checks for potential overflows. Keep FFmpeg updated as such bugs are often fixed.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflows in Processing Stages](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflows_in_processing_stages.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities can exist in various stages of FFmpeg's processing pipeline where data is copied into fixed-size buffers.
    *   **How FFmpeg Contributes:** FFmpeg's decoding, encoding, and filtering processes involve copying data between buffers. If buffer sizes are not correctly managed, overflows can occur.
    *   **Example:**  A vulnerability in a specific filter implementation within FFmpeg that allows writing beyond the allocated buffer when processing certain video frames.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially RCE.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Thoroughly review and test FFmpeg integration, paying close attention to buffer management. Keep FFmpeg updated. Utilize memory safety tools during development.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Linked Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_linked_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** FFmpeg relies on various external libraries for codec support and other functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries directly impact the security of FFmpeg.
    *   **How FFmpeg Contributes:** FFmpeg links against and uses the functionality of external libraries. Vulnerabilities within these libraries become part of FFmpeg's attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the libvpx library (used for VP8/VP9 decoding) that is exploited through FFmpeg.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability in the linked library, but can range from crashes to RCE.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the vulnerability (including here as it can be critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Keep FFmpeg and all its linked libraries updated to the latest versions. Regularly check for security advisories related to these libraries.
