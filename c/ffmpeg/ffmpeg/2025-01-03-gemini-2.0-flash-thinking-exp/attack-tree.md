## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application Using ffmpeg (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1._compromise_application_using_ffmpeg_(critical_node).md)

*   This is the overarching goal of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved their objective of gaining unauthorized access, disrupting functionality, or executing code.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Input Handling (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/2._exploit_input_handling_(high-risk_path_start).md)

*   This represents a broad category of attacks that focus on manipulating the data provided to ffmpeg. This is a high-risk starting point because ffmpeg is designed to process external input, making it a natural target for malicious data.

    *   **Provide Malicious Input File (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   This critical node represents the attacker's ability to supply a crafted media file to the application for processing by ffmpeg. This is a crucial step as it allows the attacker to directly interact with ffmpeg's parsing and decoding logic, potentially triggering vulnerabilities.

        *   **Trigger ffmpeg Vulnerability in File Parsing/Decoding (HIGH-RISK PATH START):**
            *   This signifies the attacker's attempt to exploit weaknesses in how ffmpeg interprets and processes the structure and content of media files. This is a high-risk path due to the complexity of media formats and the potential for parsing errors.

            *   **Exploit Known Vulnerability (CVE) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
                *   This highly critical node represents the successful exploitation of a publicly known vulnerability in ffmpeg's file parsing or decoding routines. Attackers can leverage existing knowledge and tools to craft input files that trigger these specific vulnerabilities, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

    *   **Manipulate Input Parameters Passed to ffmpeg (HIGH-RISK PATH START):**
        *   This high-risk path involves the attacker influencing the command-line arguments or API parameters used to invoke ffmpeg. This can be achieved through various means, such as manipulating web form inputs or exploiting other application vulnerabilities.

        *   **Command Injection (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            *   This critical node represents a severe vulnerability where the application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input that is then used to construct ffmpeg commands. Attackers can inject malicious commands into these parameters, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server hosting the application. This allows the attacker to directly control the server and perform actions like accessing sensitive data, installing malware, or disrupting services.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit ffmpeg Internals (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/3._exploit_ffmpeg_internals_(high-risk_path_start).md)

*   This high-risk path focuses on directly exploiting vulnerabilities within the ffmpeg library itself, rather than through input manipulation.

    *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in ffmpeg Library (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   This critical node represents the attacker directly targeting known security flaws within the ffmpeg library's code. This often involves exploiting publicly disclosed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the ffmpeg process, which, depending on the application's setup, can compromise the entire application or server. Keeping the ffmpeg library updated is crucial to mitigate this risk.
