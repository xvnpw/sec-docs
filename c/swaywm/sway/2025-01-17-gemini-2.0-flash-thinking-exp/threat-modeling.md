# Threat Model Analysis for swaywm/sway

## Threat: [Malicious Keybinding Execution](./threats/malicious_keybinding_execution.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker, having gained control over the user's Sway configuration files, modifies the `config` file to associate malicious commands with specific key combinations. When the user unknowingly presses these key combinations while interacting with the application, the attacker's commands are executed.
*   **How:** The attacker could bind a key combination to execute arbitrary shell commands, potentially installing malware, exfiltrating data, or disrupting the system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   System compromise, data breach, denial of service, unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Affected Sway Component:**
    *   `config` file parsing and keybinding handling within the `sway` executable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Educate users about the risks of running untrusted Sway configurations and the importance of securing their configuration files.
    *   Implement mechanisms within the application to detect and potentially warn users about unusual system activity triggered by key presses.
    *   Consider using a read-only filesystem for the Sway configuration or implementing integrity checks.

## Threat: [Input Interception by Compromised Sway](./threats/input_interception_by_compromised_sway.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker who has compromised the `sway` process itself can intercept all input events before they reach individual applications.
*   **How:** The compromised Sway instance can log keystrokes, mouse movements, and other input data, potentially capturing sensitive information like passwords or API keys entered into the application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete compromise of user credentials and sensitive data, unauthorized access to accounts and resources.
*   **Affected Sway Component:**
    *   Core input handling mechanisms within the `sway` executable, including interaction with `libinput` and the Wayland compositor.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Sway is installed from trusted sources and kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Implement system-level security measures to prevent the compromise of the Sway process.
    *   Consider using hardware security keys for sensitive operations as an additional layer of protection.

## Threat: [Exploiting Sway IPC Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_sway_ipc_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability in Sway's IPC implementation to gain unauthorized control over the window manager or other applications connected to the IPC socket.
*   **How:** The attacker could send crafted messages to the IPC socket to trigger unexpected behavior, execute arbitrary code within the Sway process, or manipulate other connected applications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   System compromise, denial of service, unauthorized access to other applications, potential for privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Sway Component:**
    *   `swayipc` module and the underlying communication mechanisms within the `sway` executable.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with the latest Sway releases and security patches.
    *   Monitor Sway's development and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Sway Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_sway_dependencies.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in one of Sway's dependencies (e.g., Wayland, wlroots, or other libraries) to compromise Sway itself or applications running under it.
*   **How:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies could allow for arbitrary code execution within the Sway process or other unexpected behavior that can be leveraged to attack applications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   System compromise, denial of service, data breach, unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Affected Sway Component:**
    *   Various components within the `sway` executable that interact with the vulnerable dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Sway and its dependencies are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Sway and its dependencies.
