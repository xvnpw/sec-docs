            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Enables subsequent malicious configuration.
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Basic
            *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting an existing system vulnerability (e.g., file write).
            *   Likelihood: Low
            *   Impact: Enables subsequent malicious configuration.
            *   Effort: Medium to High

            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   **Inject Malicious Configuration:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Execute Arbitrary Commands on Startup [HIGH-RISK PATH END].
            *   Likelihood: Medium (if config access is gained).
            *   Impact: High (arbitrary command execution).
            *   Effort: Low.
            *   Skill Level: Basic.
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium.
