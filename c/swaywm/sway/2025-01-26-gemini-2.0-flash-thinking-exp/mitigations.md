# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for swaywm/sway

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate and Sanitize IPC Messages](./mitigation_strategies/validate_and_sanitize_ipc_messages.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sway IPC Message Handlers:**  Developers should pinpoint all code sections that receive and process messages *specifically from Sway via Wayland or Sway-specific IPC*.
    2.  **Define Expected Sway Message Structure:** For each *Sway IPC message type*, clearly define the expected data format, data types, and allowed values.
    3.  **Implement Input Validation for Sway IPC:**  Within each *Sway IPC message handler*, add validation steps:
        *   **Type Checking:** Verify that received data types from *Sway IPC* match the expected types.
        *   **Range Checks:** Ensure numerical values from *Sway IPC* are within acceptable ranges.
        *   **Format Validation:**  For strings from *Sway IPC*, validate encoding (UTF-8), length limits, and potentially use regular expressions to enforce specific formats if needed.
        *   **Sanitization:**  Escape or sanitize string inputs from *Sway IPC* to prevent injection attacks.
    4.  **Error Handling for Sway IPC:** Implement robust error handling for invalid *Sway IPC messages*. Log errors and potentially terminate functionality gracefully if critical *Sway IPC* messages are malformed.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **IPC Injection Attacks via Sway (Severity: High):** Malicious Sway processes or compromised Sway components could send crafted IPC messages to inject commands or manipulate application behavior *through the Sway IPC channel*.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Sway IPC Messages (Severity: Medium):**  Sending a flood of malformed *Sway IPC messages* could crash the application or consume excessive resources *through the Sway IPC interface*.
        *   **Information Disclosure via Sway IPC Manipulation (Severity: Medium):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in *Sway IPC* handling could allow unauthorized access to application data or internal state *via the Sway IPC channel*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   IPC Injection Attacks via Sway: High reduction - effectively prevents exploitation of *Sway IPC channels* for malicious command execution or control flow manipulation.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Sway IPC Messages: Medium reduction - significantly reduces crashes due to unexpected *Sway IPC data*.
        *   Information Disclosure via Sway IPC Manipulation: Medium reduction - limits attackers' ability to extract information by manipulating *Sway IPC interactions*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, partially implemented in the core IPC communication module of the application. Input validation is present for some critical *Sway IPC message types*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Missing comprehensive validation for all *Sway IPC message types*, especially for less frequently used or newly added *Sway IPC interactions*. Sanitization of string inputs from *Sway IPC* needs review. Error handling for invalid *Sway IPC messages* could be more robust.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for IPC Requests](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_ipc_requests.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Required Sway IPC Permissions:**  Analyze the application's functionality and identify the minimum set of Wayland protocols and *Sway-specific extensions* required for operation.
    2.  **Limit Sway IPC Requests:**  Refactor code to only request necessary information and permissions from *Sway via IPC*. Avoid requesting data or capabilities that are not directly used by the application *from Sway*.
    3.  **Granular Permission Management (Sway/Wayland):** If *Sway or Wayland* offers granular permission controls, utilize them to further restrict the application's access to *Sway functionalities*.
    4.  **Regularly Re-evaluate Sway IPC Permissions:** Periodically review the application's *Sway IPC permission requests* to ensure they remain minimal and justified.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation via Sway IPC (Severity: Medium):** If an application requests excessive permissions *from Sway*, a vulnerability in Sway or the application could be exploited to gain unintended access to system resources or *Sway functionalities*.
        *   **Reduced Attack Surface (Sway IPC) (Severity: Low to Medium):** Limiting requested permissions *from Sway* reduces the potential attack surface by minimizing the capabilities an attacker could leverage if the application or Sway were compromised.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Privilege Escalation via Sway IPC: Medium reduction - reduces privilege escalation by limiting initial permissions granted *by Sway*.
        *   Reduced Attack Surface (Sway IPC): Medium reduction - harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities by limiting attack vectors through *Sway IPC*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. The application generally requests only necessary Wayland protocols, but *Sway-specific extension* usage and permissions haven't been thoroughly reviewed for minimal requirements.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  A detailed audit of *Sway-specific extension requests* is needed to eliminate unnecessary permissions. Documentation should outline the rationale behind each *Sway IPC permission request*.

        *   **Unauthorized Sway Configuration Changes (Severity: Medium):**  Malicious actors could alter *Sway configurations* to weaken security.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Environment Drift and Sway Configuration Degradation: Medium reduction - helps maintain secure *Sway configuration* by detecting deviations.
        *   Unauthorized Sway Configuration Changes: Medium reduction - increases detection of unauthorized *Sway configuration changes*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** No.  No automated *Sway configuration* validation or auditing mechanisms.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Implementation of *Sway configuration* validation checks is needed. Start with validating key *Sway settings*. Consider scripts/tools for automated auditing and alerting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate and Sanitize Input Received via Sway](./mitigation_strategies/validate_and_sanitize_input_received_via_sway.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sway Input Handling Points:** Locate code sections that process user input events received *indirectly through Sway's input handling*.
    2.  **Define Expected Input Formats (Sway Input):**  For each input type *handled by Sway*, define expected data format, types, and allowed values.
    3.  **Implement Input Validation and Sanitization (Sway Input):** Within input handlers:
        *   **Type Checking:** Verify input data types *from Sway* (e.g., key codes, mouse coordinates).
        *   **Range Checks:** Ensure input values *from Sway* are within valid ranges.
        *   **Sanitization:**  Sanitize string inputs or commands derived from *Sway input events*.
    4.  **Error Handling (Sway Input):** Implement error handling for invalid or unexpected *Sway input events*.

        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Sway Input Manipulation (Severity: Medium):** Insufficient input sanitization of *Sway-derived input* could lead to XSS.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Sway Input Flooding (Severity: Medium):**  A flood of malicious *Sway input events* could overwhelm the application.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Input Injection Attacks via Sway Input: High reduction - prevents exploitation of *Sway input channels*.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Sway Input Manipulation: Medium reduction - reduces XSS risk from unsanitized *Sway input*.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Sway Input Flooding: Medium reduction - mitigates DoS from malicious *Sway input events*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, partially implemented. Basic input validation exists for some input types, but comprehensive validation and sanitization are lacking for all *Sway-handled input*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Review all input handling code for robust validation and sanitization of all *Sway input types*. Focus on sanitizing input used to construct commands or displayed as user content.
