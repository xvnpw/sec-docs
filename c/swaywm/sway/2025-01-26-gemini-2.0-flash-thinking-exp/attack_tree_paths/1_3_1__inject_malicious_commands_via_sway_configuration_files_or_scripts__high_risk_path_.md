### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.3.1. Inject Malicious Commands via Sway Configuration Files or Scripts

This attack path focuses on the ability of an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands by manipulating Sway's configuration files or scripts.  Successful exploitation of this path can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, and denial of service.

#### 4.1. Attack Vectors and Detailed Analysis

##### 4.1.1. Modifying Sway's Configuration File to Include Malicious Commands

*   **Elaboration:**
    *   Sway's configuration file (`config` by default, typically located in `~/.config/sway/config`) is parsed when Sway starts. This file allows users to customize various aspects of Sway, including keybindings, window rules, and startup applications.
    *   The `exec` command in Sway configuration is designed to execute external programs. An attacker who gains write access to the Sway configuration file can insert malicious `exec` commands. These commands will be executed with the privileges of the Sway process, which is typically the user's privileges.
    *   Beyond `exec`, other configuration directives like `bindsym` (keybindings) and `for_window` (window rules) can also be leveraged to execute commands, either directly or indirectly by triggering scripts. For example, a malicious `bindsym` could be set to execute a script containing malicious code when a specific key combination is pressed.
    *   Configuration files can also include other configuration files using the `include` directive. An attacker could potentially modify an included file or create a new malicious included file and modify the main config to include it.

*   **Technical Feasibility Assessment:**
    *   **High Feasibility:** If an attacker can gain write access to the user's Sway configuration directory (e.g., through malware, social engineering, or exploiting other vulnerabilities), modifying the configuration file is relatively straightforward.
    *   Requires user-level write access to the configuration directory. This could be achieved through various means, making it a realistic threat.

*   **Potential Impact Analysis:**
    *   **Complete System Compromise:**  Malicious commands executed via the configuration file run with the user's privileges. This allows the attacker to:
        *   Install backdoors and persistent malware.
        *   Steal sensitive data (files, credentials, browser history, etc.).
        *   Monitor user activity (keylogging, screen recording).
        *   Modify system settings and configurations.
        *   Launch further attacks on the local network or internet.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Malicious commands could intentionally crash Sway or consume system resources, leading to a denial of service for the user's graphical environment.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **File System Permissions:**
        *   **Restrict Write Access:** Ensure that only the user and root (for administrative purposes) have write access to the Sway configuration directory (`~/.config/sway/`).  Verify correct permissions are set on the directory and files within.
        *   **Regular Permission Audits:** Periodically audit file system permissions to detect and correct any unauthorized changes.
    *   **Configuration File Integrity Monitoring:**
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) Systems:** Implement FIM tools that monitor changes to the Sway configuration file and alert the user or administrator to unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Checksum Verification:**  Consider implementing a mechanism (potentially external to Sway itself) to periodically verify the checksum of the configuration file against a known good baseline.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Limited Applicability in Config Files):**
        *   While direct input validation of the *entire* config file content is complex, Sway developers should ensure that when parsing specific directives that *do* take user-provided strings as arguments (e.g., in `exec` commands), they are handled securely to prevent further injection vulnerabilities within the parsing process itself (see 4.1.3).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
        *   Run Sway with the least necessary privileges. While Sway generally runs under the user's privileges, ensure no unnecessary elevated privileges are granted to the Sway process itself.
    *   **User Awareness and Education:**
        *   Educate users about the risks of unauthorized configuration file modifications and the importance of protecting their user accounts.

##### 4.1.2. Injecting Malicious Commands into Sway Scripts

*   **Elaboration:**
    *   Sway's configuration can utilize scripts for more complex automation or configuration tasks.  These scripts are typically executed by Sway when triggered by configuration directives (e.g., `exec` calling a script, scripts invoked by keybindings).
    *   If Sway relies on or allows users to define and use scripts for configuration or automation, attackers could inject malicious commands into these scripts. This could be achieved by modifying existing scripts or creating new malicious scripts that are then invoked by Sway.
    *   Injection points in scripts could include:
        *   **Modifying existing script files:** Similar to config file modification, gaining write access to script files allows direct injection.
        *   **Environment Variables:** If scripts rely on environment variables, manipulating these variables could inject malicious commands if the script is not carefully written to handle them securely.
        *   **Command Line Arguments:** If scripts are invoked with command-line arguments, injecting malicious arguments could lead to command injection if the script improperly handles these arguments.
        *   **File Input:** If scripts read data from files, manipulating these input files could inject malicious commands if the script processes the input insecurely.

*   **Technical Feasibility Assessment:**
    *   **Medium to High Feasibility:**  Feasibility depends on how Sway and user configurations utilize scripts. If scripts are commonly used and easily modifiable, the feasibility is high. If scripts are less common or more tightly controlled, the feasibility is medium.
    *   Requires understanding of how Sway uses scripts and gaining write access to script files or control over script inputs.

*   **Potential Impact Analysis:**
    *   **Similar to Configuration File Modification:**  The impact is largely the same as modifying the configuration file, leading to system compromise, data theft, and denial of service, as scripts are executed with user privileges.
    *   **Potentially More Complex Attacks:** Scripts can enable more sophisticated and dynamic attacks compared to static configuration file modifications.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Scripting Practices:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Scripts should rigorously validate and sanitize all external inputs (environment variables, command-line arguments, file input) to prevent command injection.
        *   **Avoid `eval()` and similar dangerous constructs:**  Avoid using `eval()` or similar functions that execute arbitrary strings as code, as these are prime targets for injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege within Scripts:**  If scripts need to perform privileged operations, use mechanisms to temporarily elevate privileges only for those specific operations and drop privileges afterward.
    *   **Script Integrity Monitoring:**
        *   Similar to configuration files, implement FIM or checksum verification for critical scripts used by Sway.
    *   **Restrict Script Execution Locations:**
        *   If possible, limit the locations from which Sway will execute scripts to specific, protected directories.
    *   **Code Reviews and Security Audits of Scripts:**
        *   If Sway includes or recommends the use of specific scripts, conduct code reviews and security audits of these scripts to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **User Education on Secure Scripting:**
        *   If users are expected to write their own Sway scripts, provide guidance and best practices for secure scripting to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.

##### 4.1.3. Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Sway's Configuration Parsing and Interpretation

*   **Elaboration:**
    *   This attack vector focuses on potential vulnerabilities within Sway's code that parses and interprets the configuration file directives.
    *   Vulnerabilities could include:
        *   **Command Injection Vulnerabilities in Parsing `exec` and similar directives:**  If Sway's parser does not properly sanitize or escape arguments passed to `exec` or similar commands, an attacker could craft configuration entries that inject malicious commands. For example, if `exec command arg` is parsed by simply concatenating strings without proper quoting or escaping, an attacker could inject `exec command ; malicious_command` to execute `malicious_command`.
        *   **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities:**  If Sway's parser has buffer overflow vulnerabilities when handling long configuration lines or specific directives, an attacker could exploit these to overwrite memory and potentially gain control of the Sway process.
        *   **Format String Vulnerabilities:**  If Sway uses user-provided configuration data in format strings without proper sanitization, format string vulnerabilities could be exploited to read or write arbitrary memory locations.
        *   **Logic Errors in Configuration Handling:**  Unexpected behavior or logic errors in how Sway processes certain configuration directives could be exploited to achieve unintended command execution or other malicious outcomes.

*   **Technical Feasibility Assessment:**
    *   **Low to Medium Feasibility:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in configuration parsing requires finding specific weaknesses in Sway's codebase. This typically requires reverse engineering, code auditing, and potentially fuzzing.  Feasibility depends on the presence and severity of such vulnerabilities.
    *   Requires in-depth knowledge of Sway's codebase and potentially vulnerability research skills.

*   **Potential Impact Analysis:**
    *   **Command Execution:**  Direct command injection vulnerabilities in parsing can lead to immediate command execution with Sway's privileges.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Parsing vulnerabilities could cause Sway to crash or malfunction, leading to DoS.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Less Likely in this Context):** While less likely in the context of configuration parsing within user-level Sway, in more complex scenarios, parsing vulnerabilities could potentially be chained with other exploits to achieve privilege escalation.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**
        *   **Input Sanitization and Escaping:**  Implement robust input sanitization and escaping when parsing configuration directives, especially those that involve executing external commands.  Use safe command execution mechanisms that avoid shell interpretation where possible, or properly quote and escape arguments when shell execution is necessary.
        *   **Buffer Overflow Protection:**  Use safe string handling functions and techniques to prevent buffer overflows in configuration parsing code.
        *   **Format String Vulnerability Prevention:**  Avoid using user-provided data directly in format strings. Use parameterized logging and output functions instead.
    *   **Code Reviews and Security Audits:**
        *   Conduct regular code reviews and security audits of Sway's configuration parsing code to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider static and dynamic analysis tools to aid in vulnerability detection.
    *   **Fuzzing:**
        *   Employ fuzzing techniques to test Sway's configuration parser with a wide range of inputs, including malformed and malicious configuration entries, to uncover potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Security Updates and Patching:**
        *   Promptly address and patch any identified security vulnerabilities in Sway's configuration parsing logic. Encourage users to keep their Sway installations up to date.
