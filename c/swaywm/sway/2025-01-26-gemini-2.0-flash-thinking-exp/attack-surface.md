# Attack Surface Analysis for swaywm/sway

## Attack Surface: [Wayland Protocol Parsing Errors](./attack_surfaces/wayland_protocol_parsing_errors.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from errors in how Sway parses and processes Wayland protocol messages received from client applications.
*   **Sway Contribution:** Sway directly implements the Wayland protocol server-side. Bugs in its parsing logic can be exploited by malicious clients sending crafted Wayland messages.
*   **Example:** A client sends a specially crafted `wl_surface.attach` request with a malformed buffer descriptor, triggering a buffer overflow in Sway's parsing code. This could lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution within Sway.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (crash), potentially Code Execution on the compositor (Sway), potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Rigorous input validation and sanitization of all Wayland protocol messages.
        *   Use of safe parsing libraries and techniques to prevent buffer overflows and other memory safety issues.
        *   Fuzz testing of Wayland protocol parsing code with malformed and malicious messages.
        *   Regular security audits of the Wayland protocol implementation.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep Sway and `wlroots` updated to the latest versions to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Run applications from trusted sources to reduce the risk of malicious clients exploiting protocol vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Sway IPC Authentication/Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/sway_ipc_authenticationauthorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Sway's Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism that allow unauthorized processes to control Sway, bypassing intended authentication or authorization controls.
*   **Sway Contribution:** Sway provides an IPC interface for external control. Weaknesses in its authentication or authorization can be directly exploited to gain unauthorized control over Sway.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in Sway's IPC authentication allows a local, unprivileged process to connect to the IPC socket and send commands as if it were an authorized client. This could allow the attacker to manipulate windows, execute commands via Sway, or even potentially escalate privileges if Sway is running with elevated privileges (though less common).
*   **Impact:**  Full control over Sway compositor, potential system compromise, denial of service, information disclosure (depending on IPC commands accessible).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for Sway IPC.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege for IPC commands, limiting the capabilities accessible via IPC.
        *   Regular security audits of the Sway IPC implementation, focusing on authentication and authorization.
        *   Consider using secure IPC mechanisms and libraries if available.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Restrict access to the Sway IPC socket to trusted processes only (typically handled by system permissions, but be aware of potential misconfigurations).
        *   Avoid running untrusted applications that might attempt to connect to the Sway IPC.
        *   If possible, disable or restrict Sway IPC if it's not required for your use case (though this might limit functionality).

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (`wlroots`)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities___wlroots__.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in Sway's dependencies, particularly `wlroots`, which Sway relies on for core Wayland compositor functionalities.
*   **Sway Contribution:** Sway directly depends on `wlroots`. Vulnerabilities in `wlroots` directly become part of Sway's attack surface and can be exploited through Sway.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability is discovered in `wlroots`'s Wayland protocol handling code. Since Sway uses `wlroots`, this vulnerability is also present in Sway and can be exploited by sending crafted Wayland messages to Sway.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the specific `wlroots` vulnerability, including Denial of Service, Code Execution in Sway, Compositor compromise, and potentially system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific `wlroots` vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Sway and `wlroots`):**
        *   Vigilant monitoring of security advisories and vulnerability reports for `wlroots` and other dependencies.
        *   Promptly update `wlroots` and other dependencies to patched versions when vulnerabilities are discovered.
        *   Contribute to security testing and vulnerability discovery in `wlroots` and its dependencies.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep Sway and the entire system updated to receive security updates for `wlroots` and other dependencies.
        *   Subscribe to security mailing lists or advisories for Sway and `wlroots` to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
