# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for swaywm/sway

## Mitigation Strategy: [Clipboard Security Considerations (Sway Context)](./mitigation_strategies/clipboard_security_considerations__sway_context_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Treat clipboard data as potentially untrusted within Sway:** Recognize that Sway manages clipboard access between Wayland clients.  Applications running under Sway should treat clipboard data as potentially originating from any other application within the Sway session, including potentially malicious ones.
    2.  **Implement clipboard sanitization in Sway environment:** When pasting data from the clipboard within applications running on Sway, apply sanitization and validation. This is crucial because Sway facilitates clipboard sharing between applications, increasing the risk of clipboard poisoning.
    3.  **Context-aware pasting within Sway applications:** Design applications to be context-aware when pasting within Sway.  For example, if pasting into a text field, validate and sanitize as text, considering potential control characters or malicious formatting that could be interpreted by applications running under Sway.
    4.  **User awareness of clipboard sharing in Sway:**  Educate users about the shared clipboard environment in Sway and the potential risks of pasting sensitive data from unknown sources within their Sway session.
    5.  **Consider clipboard managers with security features for Sway:** Explore using clipboard managers that offer features like clipboard history clearing or content filtering, which can provide an additional layer of security within the Sway environment.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Clipboard Poisoning (Medium to High Severity):** Malicious data placed on the clipboard by another application running under Sway, designed to exploit vulnerabilities when pasted into your application within the same Sway session.
        *   **Data Exfiltration via Sway Clipboard (Medium Severity):** Sensitive data unintentionally or maliciously copied to the clipboard within Sway and potentially accessible to other applications running in the same Sway session.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Clipboard Poisoning:** Medium to High risk reduction. Sanitization and validation of clipboard data within Sway applications can significantly reduce this risk.
        *   **Data Exfiltration via Sway Clipboard:** Medium risk reduction. User awareness and potentially clipboard managers with security features can help reduce accidental data exfiltration within Sway.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic text pasting might be handled in applications, but specific clipboard sanitization and context-aware pasting *considering the Sway environment* are likely not fully implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Dedicated clipboard sanitization routines specifically for applications running under Sway.
        *   Context-aware pasting logic within Sway applications.
        *   User guidance or warnings related to clipboard pasting in the Sway environment, especially for sensitive data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sway IPC (Inter-Process Communication) Security](./mitigation_strategies/sway_ipc__inter-process_communication__security.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Sway IPC usage in applications:** Reduce the application's reliance on Sway IPC. Explore alternative methods for achieving desired functionality that do not involve inter-process communication with Sway, if feasible.
    2.  **Strictly validate IPC data received from Sway:** When receiving data from Sway IPC (e.g., using `swaymsg` or libraries interacting with the Sway IPC socket), rigorously validate *all* received data. Treat data from Sway IPC as untrusted input, as it could be influenced by other processes running under the same Sway session.
    3.  **Command whitelisting for IPC commands sent to Sway:** If the application sends commands to Sway via IPC, use a whitelist approach. Only allow sending a predefined set of safe commands. Avoid constructing commands dynamically based on user input or external data to prevent IPC command injection vulnerabilities targeting Sway.
    4.  **Principle of least privilege for Sway IPC access:** If possible, configure Sway or the application to restrict which processes can communicate with Sway IPC.  Consider if access control mechanisms within Sway or the operating system can limit IPC communication.
    5.  **Regularly audit application's Sway IPC usage:** Periodically review the application's use of Sway IPC to ensure it is still necessary, securely implemented, and adheres to the principle of least privilege in its interaction with Sway.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **IPC Command Injection targeting Sway (High Severity):** Malicious processes using Sway IPC to inject commands into Sway, potentially compromising the Sway session, manipulating window management, or even executing commands within the Sway environment.
        *   **Data Tampering via Sway IPC (Medium Severity):** Malicious processes manipulating data exchanged via Sway IPC to influence the application's behavior in unintended ways by exploiting the communication channel with Sway.
        *   **Information Disclosure via Sway IPC (Medium Severity):** Sensitive information inadvertently exposed through Sway IPC communication to potentially malicious processes that are also clients of the same Sway instance.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **IPC Command Injection targeting Sway:** High risk reduction. Command whitelisting and strict validation of IPC inputs are crucial to prevent this Sway-specific threat.
        *   **Data Tampering via Sway IPC:** Medium risk reduction. Input validation and minimizing Sway IPC usage reduce this risk.
        *   **Information Disclosure via Sway IPC:** Medium risk reduction. Minimizing Sway IPC usage and careful data handling reduce this risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Likely minimally implemented. If the application uses Sway IPC, basic communication might be functional, but security considerations *specific to Sway IPC* are probably not fully addressed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Input validation for data received from Sway IPC within the application.
        *   Command whitelisting for commands sent to Sway IPC by the application.
        *   Access control or privilege separation for Sway IPC communication for the application.
        *   Security audit specifically focused on Sway IPC usage within the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Least Privilege Principle for Sway Process](./mitigation_strategies/least_privilege_principle_for_sway_process.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Run Sway as a standard user:**  Crucially, avoid running the Sway compositor process as root unless absolutely necessary and after extremely careful security consideration. Run Sway as a dedicated standard user with minimal privileges. This is a fundamental security practice for any compositor, including Sway.
    2.  **Application user separation (in conjunction with Sway's user):** While the application itself should also follow least privilege, ensure that even if the application is compromised, the underlying Sway compositor is not running with elevated privileges that could be exploited.
    3.  **Restrict Sway's access to system resources:**  To the extent possible, limit the resources Sway itself can access. This might involve using features like cgroups or namespaces to further isolate the Sway process, although this is more advanced.
    4.  **Regularly review Sway's required privileges:** Periodically review the privileges required for Sway to function correctly and ensure it is not running with any unnecessary elevated privileges.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation via Sway Compromise (High Severity):** If the Sway compositor process itself is compromised (due to a vulnerability in Sway or its dependencies), running it with minimal privileges limits the attacker's ability to escalate privileges to root or gain broader system control.
        *   **System-wide Impact of Sway Compromise (High Severity):** If Sway is running with elevated privileges, a compromise could have a much wider impact on the entire system beyond just the Sway session.
        *   **Lateral Movement from Sway Compromise (Medium Severity):** Restricting Sway's privileges limits an attacker's ability to move laterally to other parts of the system after compromising the Sway compositor process.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation via Sway Compromise:** High risk reduction. Running Sway with least privilege is a fundamental security principle that significantly reduces the impact of a potential Sway compromise.
        *   **System-wide Impact of Sway Compromise:** High risk reduction. Limits the scope of damage from a successful attack on Sway itself.
        *   **Lateral Movement from Sway Compromise:** Medium risk reduction. Makes lateral movement more difficult if Sway is compromised.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Likely partially implemented by default, as Sway is generally designed to be run as a user process. However, explicit steps to *ensure* and *verify* least privilege for the Sway process might be missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formal verification that Sway is running with the absolute minimum necessary privileges.
        *   Documentation of the required privileges for Sway and justification for each.
        *   Potentially exploring further isolation techniques for the Sway process (e.g., cgroups, namespaces).
        *   Regular audits to confirm Sway is still running with least privilege.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Sway Configuration Baseline](./mitigation_strategies/secure_sway_configuration_baseline.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify security-relevant Sway configuration options:** Review Sway's configuration file (`~/.config/sway/config` or system-wide configuration) and documentation to identify settings that have security implications. This includes input method settings, potentially clipboard related options (though limited in Wayland), and any settings related to external commands or scripts executed by Sway.
    2.  **Define a secure baseline Sway configuration:** Create a secure default configuration for Sway that minimizes potential attack surfaces. This might involve:
        *   Disabling or restricting input methods in the Sway configuration if not strictly needed for the intended use case.
        *   Setting secure defaults for any configurable security-related options within Sway's configuration.
        *   Carefully reviewing and potentially restricting the use of `exec` commands or similar features in the Sway configuration that could execute external scripts.
    3.  **Document the secure Sway baseline configuration:** Document the secure Sway configuration baseline and provide it to system administrators or users deploying the application in a Sway environment.
    4.  **Automate deployment of secure Sway configuration:** If possible, automate the deployment of the secure Sway configuration to ensure consistency across all deployment environments where the application will be used with Sway.
    5.  **Regularly review and update the secure Sway baseline:** As Sway evolves, new configuration options are added, and new security threats emerge, regularly review and update the secure Sway configuration baseline to maintain its effectiveness.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of insecure Sway default configuration (Medium Severity):** Default Sway configurations might not be optimized for security and could leave unnecessary attack surfaces open through configuration options.
        *   **Misconfiguration vulnerabilities in Sway (Medium Severity):** Incorrect or insecure Sway configuration by users or administrators can introduce vulnerabilities by enabling insecure features or leaving security-relevant options in a weak state.
        *   **Unintended execution of commands via Sway configuration (Medium Severity):**  Malicious or compromised Sway configurations could be crafted to execute unintended commands or scripts, potentially leading to system compromise.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of insecure Sway default configuration:** Medium risk reduction. A secure baseline Sway configuration directly addresses this by providing secure defaults.
        *   **Misconfiguration vulnerabilities in Sway:** Medium risk reduction. Provides a secure starting point and reduces the likelihood of users or administrators introducing misconfigurations in Sway.
        *   **Unintended execution of commands via Sway configuration:** Medium risk reduction. Careful review and restriction of command execution features in Sway configuration mitigates this.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Likely no specific secure Sway configuration baseline is defined or deployed for application environments.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Definition of a secure Sway configuration baseline tailored for application deployments.
        *   Documentation of the secure Sway baseline configuration.
        *   Automated deployment mechanism for the secure Sway configuration.
        *   Process for regularly reviewing and updating the Sway configuration baseline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Minimize Sway Extensions and Customizations](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_minimize_sway_extensions_and_customizations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inventory Sway extensions and custom scripts:** Identify all Sway extensions, custom scripts, or user-specific configurations beyond the baseline that are used in the deployment environment. This includes any extensions installed via package managers or manually, and any custom scripts integrated with Sway.
    2.  **Assess security implications of Sway extensions:** For each Sway extension or customization, thoroughly assess its security implications. Consider:
        *   Source of the Sway extension/customization (trustworthiness and reputation of the developer/maintainer).
        *   Permissions and access the Sway extension requires within the Sway environment and potentially the system.
        *   Code quality and security practices of the Sway extension (if source code is available, review it).
        *   Maintenance and update status of the Sway extension (is it actively maintained and receiving security updates?).
    3.  **Minimize use of non-essential Sway extensions and customizations:** Remove or disable any Sway extensions or custom scripts that are not strictly necessary for the application's core functionality or the user's essential workflow. Reduce the attack surface by minimizing added components to Sway.
    4.  **Use trusted sources for Sway extensions:** Only use Sway extensions from trusted and reputable sources. Prefer extensions that are well-established, actively maintained, and ideally open-source for better scrutiny.
    5.  **Regularly update Sway extensions:** Keep necessary Sway extensions updated to their latest versions to patch any known security vulnerabilities that might be discovered in extensions.
    6.  **Security audit of custom Sway scripts:** If using custom scripts integrated with Sway, conduct thorough security audits of these scripts to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities before deployment.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Sway Extensions (Medium to High Severity):** Sway extensions, like any software, can contain vulnerabilities. Poorly written or unmaintained extensions can introduce security flaws that attackers could exploit within the Sway environment.
        *   **Malicious Sway Extensions (High Severity):** Malicious Sway extensions, if installed, could be designed to compromise the Sway session, monitor user activity, or even gain control over the system.
        *   **Increased Attack Surface of Sway Environment (Medium Severity):** Unnecessary Sway extensions increase the overall attack surface of the Sway environment, providing more potential entry points for attackers.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Sway Extensions:** Medium to High risk reduction. Minimizing the number of extensions and rigorously reviewing necessary ones reduces this risk.
        *   **Malicious Sway Extensions:** High risk reduction. Using trusted sources and carefully reviewing extensions before installation significantly mitigates the risk of malicious extensions.
        *   **Increased Attack Surface of Sway Environment:** Medium risk reduction. Minimizing extensions directly reduces the attack surface of the Sway environment.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Likely some basic awareness of extensions exists, but a formal process for security assessment, minimization, and ongoing management of Sway extensions is probably missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formal inventory process for Sway extensions and customizations in deployment environments.
        *   Security assessment process for evaluating Sway extensions before deployment.
        *   Defined policy for minimizing the use of Sway extensions and customizations.
        *   Process for regularly updating and auditing Sway extensions in use.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Wayland Protocol and Sway Compositor Security Awareness (for Developers)](./mitigation_strategies/wayland_protocol_and_sway_compositor_security_awareness__for_developers_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Educate developers on Wayland security model and Sway's implementation:** Provide targeted training and resources to developers specifically focused on the Wayland security model *as implemented by Sway*. Emphasize how Sway enforces Wayland's security principles and any Sway-specific nuances.
    2.  **Understand Sway's Wayland security features:** Specifically, educate developers on Sway's security features and mechanisms related to Wayland, such as how Sway handles client isolation, input handling, and clipboard management within the Wayland protocol context.
    3.  **Secure coding practices for Wayland applications on Sway:** Promote secure coding practices that are directly relevant to developing applications for Wayland and specifically for running under Sway. This includes:
        *   Proper handling of Wayland events *within the Sway environment*.
        *   Deep understanding of Wayland's client isolation principles *as enforced by Sway*.
        *   Awareness of Wayland's clipboard and drag-and-drop mechanisms *in the context of Sway's implementation*.
    4.  **Stay updated on Wayland and Sway security developments:**  Continuously monitor and keep developers informed about any new security developments, best practices, or vulnerabilities related to the Wayland protocol and specifically to the Sway compositor.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Misunderstanding of Wayland/Sway security model by developers (Medium Severity):** Lack of specific understanding of Sway's Wayland security implementation can lead to developers making security mistakes when designing and implementing applications intended to run on Sway.
        *   **Exploitation of Wayland protocol nuances in Sway (Medium Severity):** Attackers might attempt to exploit subtle aspects of the Wayland protocol or Sway's specific implementation if developers are not fully aware of these nuances when developing applications for Sway.
        *   **General security vulnerabilities in Sway applications due to lack of Wayland/Sway awareness (Medium Severity):** Developers might inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities in applications running on Sway if they are not adequately trained in secure coding practices within the Wayland/Sway environment.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Misunderstanding of Wayland/Sway security model:** Medium risk reduction. Targeted education and awareness programs directly address this knowledge gap.
        *   **Exploitation of Wayland protocol nuances in Sway:** Medium risk reduction. Increased developer awareness helps avoid potential pitfalls related to Sway's Wayland implementation.
        *   **General security vulnerabilities in Sway applications due to lack of Wayland/Sway awareness:** Medium risk reduction. Promotes better overall security practices specifically for developing applications in the Wayland/Sway context.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers likely have some general understanding of Wayland, but in-depth security awareness and specific training *focused on Sway's Wayland implementation and security implications* are likely missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formal, targeted training program on Wayland and *Sway-specific* security for developers.
        *   Creation of internal documentation outlining Wayland/Sway security best practices *relevant to application development for Sway*.
        *   Establishment of a process for regular updates and knowledge sharing on Wayland and Sway security developments within the development team.
