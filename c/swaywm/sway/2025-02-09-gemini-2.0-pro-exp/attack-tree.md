          [HIGH RISK]

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Sway Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_sway_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.2 wlroots Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on finding and exploiting vulnerabilities within the `wlroots` library, which Sway uses as its Wayland compositor backend. `wlroots` is a complex, low-level library responsible for handling display servers, input devices, and rendering.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  **Vulnerability Discovery:** The attacker researches `wlroots` source code, looking for security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, integer overflows, or logic flaws in protocol handling. This often involves using fuzzing tools, static analysis, and manual code review.
        2.  **Exploit Development:** Once a vulnerability is found, the attacker crafts a specific input or sequence of actions that triggers the vulnerability. This might involve sending specially crafted Wayland messages or manipulating input events.
        3.  **Exploit Delivery:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the exploit to the target system. This could be through a malicious website, a compromised application, or a physical attack if the attacker has local access.
        4.  **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):** Depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the system's configuration, the attacker might need to escalate privileges to gain full control.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete control over the Wayland session, effectively compromising the entire desktop environment.)
    *   **Effort:** Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Sway Configuration (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_sway_configuration__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **2.1 Malicious Config File (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** This attack vector involves gaining write access to the Sway configuration file (typically `~/.config/sway/config`) and modifying it to include malicious commands or settings.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  **Gaining Access:** The attacker needs to gain write access to the configuration file. This can be achieved through several methods:
            *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking the user into downloading and replacing their configuration file with a malicious one.
            *   **Exploiting Another Vulnerability:** Leveraging a separate vulnerability (e.g., a file system vulnerability or a vulnerability in another application) to gain write access to the file.
            *   **Misconfigured System:** Exploiting a system misconfiguration (e.g., overly permissive file permissions) that allows unauthorized access to the configuration file.
            *   **Physical Access:** If the attacker has physical access to the machine, they could directly modify the file.
        2.  **Injecting Malicious Content:** Once the attacker has write access, they can modify the configuration file to:
            *   Add `exec` commands to run arbitrary shell scripts or binaries.
            *   Change keybindings to execute malicious commands when specific keys are pressed.
            *   Modify output settings to redirect screen contents to a remote server.
            *   Disable security features or introduce other vulnerabilities.
        3.  **Triggering the Malicious Configuration:** The attacker needs to ensure that Sway reloads the modified configuration file. This might happen automatically (e.g., on restart), or the attacker might need to trigger a reload manually (e.g., by sending a signal to Sway).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Full control over Sway's behavior, including the ability to execute arbitrary code.)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Once access is gained, modifying the file is trivial.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if file integrity checks are in place; otherwise, Medium to Hard)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage Sway Features Maliciously (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_sway_features_maliciously__high-risk_path_.md)

*    **3.3 Exploit "exec" Command (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** Sway's `exec` command allows users to execute arbitrary shell commands. This attack vector involves finding ways to inject malicious commands into the `exec` command, either through configuration manipulation or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow command injection.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  **Injection Point:** The attacker needs to find a way to inject their malicious command into a context where Sway will execute it via the `exec` command. This could be:
            *   **Configuration File:** As described in 2.1, the attacker could modify the configuration file to include malicious `exec` commands.
            *   **IPC Vulnerability:** If a vulnerability exists in Sway's IPC handling that allows command injection, the attacker could send a malicious IPC message containing the command.
            *   **Compromised IPC Client:** If an attacker compromises an application that communicates with Sway via IPC, they could use that application to send an `exec` command.
            *   **Vulnerable Sway Feature:** If any Sway feature takes user input and passes it to `exec` without proper sanitization, the attacker could exploit that feature.
        2.  **Command Execution:** Once the malicious command is injected, Sway will execute it with the privileges of the Sway process.
        3.  **Post-Exploitation:** After successful command execution, the attacker can perform various actions, such as:
            *   Installing malware.
            *   Exfiltrating data.
            *   Establishing persistence.
            *   Manipulating the user's system.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Sway process.)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Once an injection point is found, executing the command is trivial.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Suspicious commands might be logged, but a sophisticated attacker could try to obfuscate their actions.)
