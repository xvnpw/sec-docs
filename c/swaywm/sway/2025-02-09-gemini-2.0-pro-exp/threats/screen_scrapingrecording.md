# Deep Analysis: Screen Scraping/Recording Threat in Sway

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Screen Scraping/Recording" threat within the Sway window manager.  This includes understanding the technical mechanisms that could be exploited, identifying specific vulnerable components, evaluating the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and proposing additional security enhancements.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to minimize the risk of unauthorized screen capture.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the Sway window manager (and its underlying wlroots library) running on Wayland.  It considers:

*   **Vulnerable Sway/wlroots Components:**  The `output` module, buffer management functions, and Wayland protocols related to screen capture (especially `wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1` and any potential future standardized protocols).  We will also examine how Sway handles client requests for screen capture.
*   **Exploitation Techniques:**  We will analyze how a malicious application, running either as a regular Wayland client or with elevated privileges, could attempt to bypass security controls and capture screen content.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  We will evaluate the effectiveness of the developer and user mitigations listed in the original threat model, and propose additional, more robust solutions.
*   **Interactions with Other Components:** We will consider how interactions with other Sway components (e.g., input handling, security policies) might influence the vulnerability or its mitigation.
* **Sandboxing Technologies:** We will consider how sandboxing technologies like Flatpak, Snap, or custom solutions could be used to isolate applications and restrict their access to screen capture capabilities.

This analysis *excludes* threats originating from:

*   Kernel-level exploits (e.g., a compromised kernel module directly accessing the framebuffer).  This is outside the scope of Sway's control.
*   Hardware-based screen capture devices (e.g., a physical device connected to the display output).
*   Social engineering attacks that trick the user into granting screen capture permissions.  While user education is important, this analysis focuses on technical controls.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the relevant source code of Sway and wlroots, focusing on the components identified in the scope.  This will involve searching for potential vulnerabilities, such as insufficient permission checks, insecure API usage, and logic errors.
2.  **Protocol Analysis:**  We will analyze the Wayland protocols related to screen capture (e.g., `wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1`) to understand their intended behavior, security assumptions, and potential weaknesses.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  While we won't perform live dynamic analysis in this document, we will *conceptually* describe how dynamic analysis techniques (e.g., using a debugger, tracing system calls) could be used to observe Sway's behavior and identify vulnerabilities.
4.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  We will refine the existing threat model by identifying specific attack vectors and proposing more concrete mitigation strategies.
5.  **Best Practices Review:**  We will compare Sway's implementation against industry best practices for secure screen capture management.
6.  **Sandboxing Technology Evaluation:** We will research and evaluate the effectiveness of different sandboxing technologies in preventing unauthorized screen capture.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Attack Vectors

A malicious application could attempt screen scraping/recording via several attack vectors:

1.  **Exploiting `wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1` (or similar protocols):**
    *   **Legitimate Request, Insufficient Authorization:** The application could request screen capture access through the protocol.  If Sway's authorization checks are weak or non-existent, the request might be granted without proper user consent.  This is the *primary* attack vector.
    *   **Protocol Manipulation:**  The application could attempt to send malformed or unexpected requests to the protocol implementation, hoping to trigger a bug or bypass security checks.  This is less likely but still possible.
    *   **Race Conditions:** If the protocol implementation or Sway's handling of it has race conditions, the application might be able to exploit timing windows to gain unauthorized access.

2.  **Direct Framebuffer Access (Unlikely without Elevated Privileges):**
    *   If the application gains elevated privileges (e.g., through a separate vulnerability), it might attempt to bypass Wayland entirely and directly access the graphics framebuffer.  This is *outside* Sway's direct control but highlights the importance of system-wide security.

3.  **Shared Memory Exploitation (Less Likely):**
    *   Wayland uses shared memory for efficient communication between clients and the compositor.  If there are vulnerabilities in how Sway manages shared memory regions used for screen buffers, a malicious application might be able to read data from those regions without proper authorization.

4.  **Input Injection + Screenshot Utility:**
    *   A malicious application could potentially inject input events to launch a legitimate screenshot utility (e.g., `grim`) and then attempt to retrieve the captured image. This relies on the ability to inject input and access the output of the utility, making it less direct but still a potential concern.

### 2.2. Vulnerable Components Analysis

*   **`output` module:** This module is responsible for managing display outputs and rendering.  It's a critical component for screen capture, as it handles the actual drawing of content to the screen.  Key areas to examine:
    *   Functions that handle buffer allocation and management.
    *   Interactions with the Wayland protocols for screen capture.
    *   Permission checks before granting access to screen buffers.
    *   Implementation of any "secure output" features.

*   **Wayland Protocol Implementations (e.g., `wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1`):**
    *   The implementation of these protocols in wlroots is crucial.  We need to examine:
        *   How the protocol handles client requests for screen capture.
        *   The authentication and authorization mechanisms used.
        *   Input validation and sanitization to prevent protocol manipulation.
        *   Error handling and robustness against unexpected input.

*   **Sway's Security Policy Enforcement:**
    *   Sway's overall security model and how it enforces permissions are relevant.  We need to understand:
        *   How Sway determines which applications are allowed to request screen capture.
        *   How user consent is obtained and verified.
        *   How Sway interacts with sandboxing technologies (if any).

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation and Enhancements

#### 2.3.1. Developer Mitigations (Original)

*   **"Implement *very* strict access controls on screen capture APIs. Require *explicit* user permission (e.g., a clear and unambiguous prompt) or strong application sandboxing. Do *not* allow silent screen capture by default."**
    *   **Evaluation:** This is the *most crucial* mitigation.  It's absolutely essential to prevent silent screen capture.  The "explicit user permission" part is key.
    *   **Enhancements:**
        *   **Granular Permissions:**  Instead of a simple "allow/deny" for screen capture, consider more granular permissions:
            *   Allow capturing the entire screen.
            *   Allow capturing a specific window.
            *   Allow capturing a specific region of the screen.
            *   Allow capturing only when a specific key combination is pressed (user-initiated).
        *   **Per-Application Permissions:**  Maintain a persistent list of per-application permissions, so the user doesn't have to grant access every time.  Include an easy way for the user to review and revoke these permissions.
        *   **One-Time Permissions:**  Offer an option for "allow once" permissions, which are automatically revoked after the capture is complete.
        *   **Contextual Prompts:**  The permission prompt should clearly indicate *which* application is requesting screen capture and *why*.  Avoid generic prompts.
        *   **Timeout:**  If the user doesn't respond to the permission prompt within a reasonable time, deny the request by default.
        *   **Auditing:** Log all screen capture requests, including the requesting application, the timestamp, and the user's response.

*   **"Provide a persistent and prominent visual indicator whenever screen capture is active, regardless of which application initiated it."**
    *   **Evaluation:**  Excellent mitigation.  This provides crucial feedback to the user.
    *   **Enhancements:**
        *   **Un-Hideable Indicator:**  The indicator should be impossible for a malicious application to hide or obscure.  It should be rendered by Sway itself, *not* by the client application.
        *   **Distinctive Indicator:**  Use a visually distinct indicator (e.g., a bright red border around the screen, a flashing icon) that is easily noticeable.
        *   **Informative Indicator:**  The indicator could potentially display the name of the application that is capturing the screen.

*   **"Consider implementing a 'secure output' mode where certain windows (e.g., those containing sensitive data) are explicitly excluded from screen capture, enforced by the compositor."**
    *   **Evaluation:**  This is a valuable feature for protecting sensitive data.
    *   **Enhancements:**
        *   **Application Opt-In:**  Allow applications to *opt-in* to being marked as "secure" and excluded from screen capture.  This could be done through a Wayland protocol extension or a Sway-specific configuration option.
        *   **User Override (with Caution):**  Consider allowing the user to *temporarily* override the "secure output" restriction for a specific window, but with a very strong warning and explicit confirmation.
        *   **Clear Visual Indication:**  Windows marked as "secure" should have a clear visual indication (e.g., a different border color) to inform the user.

#### 2.3.2. User Mitigations (Original)

*   **"Only install and run trusted applications."**
    *   **Evaluation:**  Good advice, but not always practical.  Users may need to run applications from various sources.
    *   **Enhancements:**  Promote the use of sandboxed application environments (see below).

*   **"Be *extremely* cautious about granting *any* application access to screen capture capabilities. Review Sway configuration carefully."**
    *   **Evaluation:**  Essential user education.
    *   **Enhancements:**  Provide clear and concise documentation to users about the risks of screen capture and how to manage permissions in Sway.

#### 2.3.3. Additional Mitigations (Sandboxing)

*   **Sandboxing (Flatpak, Snap, etc.):**
    *   **Evaluation:**  Sandboxing is a *critical* layer of defense.  It can significantly limit the damage a malicious application can do, even if it exploits a vulnerability in Sway.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Flatpak:**  Flatpak provides a robust sandboxing environment for applications.  Sway should integrate with Flatpak's permission system to control access to screen capture.  Flatpak applications should *not* be granted screen capture access by default.
        *   **Snap:** Similar to Flatpak, Snap provides sandboxing.  Sway should integrate with Snap's security model.
        *   **Custom Sandboxing:**  If neither Flatpak nor Snap are suitable, consider implementing a custom sandboxing solution using technologies like seccomp, namespaces, and cgroups.
        *   **Portal System:** Utilize a "portal" system (like xdg-desktop-portal) for screen capture.  This allows applications to request screen capture through a standardized interface, which the compositor (Sway) can mediate and control.  This is the *preferred* approach for modern Wayland desktops.

### 2.4. Code Review Focus Areas (Examples)

During a code review, specific attention should be paid to:

*   **wlroots `wlr_screencopy_v1.c` (or equivalent):**
    *   `handle_frame_copy`:  Examine how this function handles client requests.  Ensure there are robust checks to verify that the client is authorized to capture the requested output.
    *   `frame_copy_send_frame`:  Check how the captured frame data is sent to the client.  Ensure that shared memory is used correctly and that there are no potential information leaks.

*   **Sway `output.c` (or equivalent):**
    *   Functions related to rendering and buffer management.  Look for any potential vulnerabilities that could allow a client to access buffer data without authorization.
    *   Integration with the Wayland screen capture protocols.  Verify that Sway correctly implements the protocol's security requirements.
    *   Implementation of the permission system and visual indicator.

*   **Sway's configuration parsing:**
    *   Ensure that configuration options related to screen capture are handled securely and that there are no potential vulnerabilities that could allow a malicious configuration file to grant unauthorized access.

### 2.5 Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual)

Dynamic analysis could be used to:

*   **Trace System Calls:**  Use `strace` or a similar tool to monitor the system calls made by Sway and client applications during screen capture requests.  This can help identify potential vulnerabilities in how Sway handles permissions and interacts with the kernel.
*   **Debug with GDB:**  Use a debugger like GDB to step through the code execution path when a screen capture request is made.  This can help understand the flow of control and identify any potential logic errors.
*   **Fuzzing:**  Use a fuzzer to send malformed or unexpected input to the Wayland screen capture protocols.  This can help identify potential vulnerabilities in the protocol implementation.

## 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

The "Screen Scraping/Recording" threat is a serious concern for Sway, as it directly impacts user privacy and data confidentiality.  The most effective mitigation strategy is a combination of:

1.  **Strict, Granular, and User-Centric Permissions:**  Sway *must* require explicit user consent for screen capture, with granular options for controlling the scope of the capture.  A "deny by default" policy is essential.
2.  **Prominent and Un-Hideable Visual Indicator:**  Users *must* be clearly informed whenever screen capture is active.
3.  **Robust Sandboxing:**  Applications should be run in sandboxed environments (e.g., Flatpak, Snap) to limit their access to system resources, including screen capture capabilities.  Integration with a portal system like xdg-desktop-portal is strongly recommended.
4.  **Secure "Output Mode" (Optional but Recommended):**  Allowing applications to opt-out of screen capture provides an additional layer of protection for sensitive data.
5. **Thorough Code Review and Dynamic Analysis:** Regular security audits and testing are crucial to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

By implementing these recommendations, Sway can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized screen scraping/recording and provide a more secure environment for its users.
