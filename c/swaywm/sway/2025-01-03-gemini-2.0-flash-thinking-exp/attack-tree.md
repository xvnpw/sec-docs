## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit insecure file permissions on Sway config file](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_file_permissions_on_sway_config_file.md)

*   **Exploit insecure file permissions on Sway config file:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains write access to the Sway configuration file (typically `~/.config/sway/config`) due to overly permissive file permissions.
    *   **Mechanism:** This could be achieved through:
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in other software running with the same user privileges.
        *   Social engineering to trick the user into changing file permissions.
        *   Direct access to the system (if physical access or remote access is compromised).
    *   **Consequence:** Once the attacker can modify the configuration file, they can inject arbitrary commands that will be executed the next time Sway is started or reloaded. This often involves using the `exec` command within the Sway configuration to run malicious scripts or binaries.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session and potentially the entire system, allowing the attacker to control the application and access sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute arbitrary commands via 'exec' or similar commands (via IPC)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_commands_via_'exec'_or_similar_commands__via_ipc_.md)

*   **Execute arbitrary commands via 'exec' or similar commands (via IPC):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages the Sway IPC (i3-ipc) mechanism to send commands to Sway that result in the execution of arbitrary code.
    *   **Mechanism:** This requires the application or other processes to be listening on the Sway IPC socket. The attacker can then:
        *   Exploit a lack of authentication or weak authentication in the IPC communication to send commands as if they were a legitimate client.
        *   Craft malicious IPC messages that trigger the execution of commands like `exec` with attacker-controlled arguments.
    *   **Consequence:** Successful execution of arbitrary commands as the user running Sway.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session and potentially the entire system, allowing the attacker to control the application and access sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social engineering or other means to trick the user into installing a malicious extension](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_or_other_means_to_trick_the_user_into_installing_a_malicious_extension.md)

*   **Social engineering or other means to trick the user into installing a malicious extension:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates the user into installing a malicious Sway extension.
    *   **Mechanism:** This can be achieved through various social engineering tactics:
        *   Presenting the extension as a legitimate or useful tool.
        *   Hiding the malicious nature of the extension.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the extension installation process (if any).
        *   Compromising legitimate extension repositories or distribution channels.
    *   **Consequence:** Once installed, a malicious extension can have significant privileges within the Sway environment. It can:
        *   Monitor user input.
        *   Manipulate windows and applications.
        *   Execute arbitrary code within the Sway process.
        *   Potentially gain access to resources accessible by the Sway process.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session and potentially the entire system, allowing the attacker to control the application and access sensitive data.
