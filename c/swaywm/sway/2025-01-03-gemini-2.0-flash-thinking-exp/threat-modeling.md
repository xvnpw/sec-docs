# Threat Model Analysis for swaywm/sway

## Threat: [Keylogging by Other Applications](./threats/keylogging_by_other_applications.md)

**Description:** A malicious application, running within the same Sway session, exploits potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations **in Sway** or the underlying Wayland protocol to monitor or log keystrokes intended for other applications.

**Impact:** Sensitive information, such as passwords, personal data, or confidential communications, could be intercepted and stolen by the malicious application.

**Affected Component:** Sway's input event handling and the Wayland protocol's mechanisms for delivering input events to clients.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement proper input sanitization and validation within applications.
* Avoid running untrusted or unknown applications within the same Sway session as sensitive applications.
* Utilize Wayland protocols and extensions that provide stronger isolation between clients and prevent unauthorized access to input events.
* Consider using virtual keyboards for sensitive input where appropriate.

## Threat: [Clipboard Manipulation](./threats/clipboard_manipulation.md)

**Description:** A malicious application running under **Sway** monitors or modifies the clipboard contents without explicit user consent or interaction.

**Impact:**  Sensitive data copied to the clipboard could be stolen. Malicious content could be inserted into the clipboard, potentially leading to the user unknowingly pasting harmful data.

**Affected Component:** Sway's clipboard management functionality and the Wayland protocols related to clipboard sharing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement notifications to inform the user when the clipboard content is changed by an application.
* Consider using clipboard managers with history and auditing features.
* Avoid copying sensitive information to the clipboard when possible.

## Threat: [Window Spoofing/Overlay Attacks](./threats/window_spoofingoverlay_attacks.md)

**Description:** A malicious application draws deceptive overlays or manipulates window decorations using **Sway's** rendering capabilities to mimic the appearance of another legitimate application. This can trick the user into interacting with the malicious application, believing it to be the trusted one.

**Impact:**  Users could be tricked into entering credentials or sensitive information into the fake window, leading to data theft or unauthorized access.

**Affected Component:** Sway's rendering and window decoration mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement application-level checks to verify the integrity of the window and its decorations.
* Educate users to be cautious of unexpected or unusual window appearances.
* Consider using features or extensions that enhance window identification and security.

## Threat: [Abuse of Sway IPC](./threats/abuse_of_sway_ipc.md)

**Description:** A malicious application exploits vulnerabilities **in Sway's** inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms to send unauthorized commands to Sway or other applications, potentially disrupting their operation or gaining unauthorized access.

**Impact:**  Applications could be controlled remotely, settings could be changed without authorization, or sensitive information could be accessed.

**Affected Component:** Sway's IPC implementation and the specific APIs exposed for inter-process communication.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Secure Sway's IPC mechanisms by implementing proper authentication and authorization checks.
* Limit the exposure of sensitive IPC commands.
* Regularly audit and patch Sway for vulnerabilities in its IPC implementation.

## Threat: [Wayland Protocol Vulnerabilities](./threats/wayland_protocol_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  A vulnerability exists in the Wayland protocol itself or **in Sway's specific implementation** of the protocol, allowing a malicious application to exploit these weaknesses to compromise the system or other applications.

**Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Sway's implementation of the Wayland protocol.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Keep Sway and the underlying Wayland libraries updated to the latest versions with security patches.
* Follow security best practices when implementing and using the Wayland protocol.
* Participate in or monitor the Wayland security community for reported vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Compromised Sway Configuration File](./threats/compromised_sway_configuration_file.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to and modifies the **Sway** configuration file to inject malicious commands or alter settings to facilitate further attacks upon the next Sway restart or reload.

**Impact:**  The attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the user's privileges, disable security features, or configure Sway to act as a backdoor.

**Affected Component:** Sway's configuration loading and parsing mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Protect the Sway configuration file with appropriate file system permissions.
* Regularly back up the configuration file.
* Implement checks to verify the integrity of the configuration file.
* Consider using configuration management tools to manage and secure the Sway configuration.
