# Attack Surface Analysis for swaywm/sway

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input via Keyboard/Mouse](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_via_keyboardmouse.md)

*   **Description:** Sway directly processes keyboard and mouse events received from the kernel. If Sway's input handling logic contains vulnerabilities, crafted input sequences could cause crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within Sway's context.
    *   **How Sway Contributes to Attack Surface:** Sway's role as the compositor necessitates direct interaction with input devices. Any flaws in its parsing or handling of these raw events are directly attributable to Sway.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted sequence of key presses or mouse movements could trigger a buffer overflow in Sway's input processing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (crashing Sway), potential for arbitrary code execution within Sway's process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all keyboard and mouse events.
            *   Use memory-safe programming practices to prevent buffer overflows and other memory corruption issues.
            *   Regularly audit and test input handling code for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Keep Sway updated to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Sway's IPC Mechanisms](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_sway's_ipc_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:** Sway provides an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism (via a Unix socket) allowing other applications to control its behavior and query its state. If not properly secured, a malicious application could connect to this socket and send crafted commands to disrupt Sway, manipulate window layouts, or potentially execute arbitrary commands if vulnerabilities exist in the IPC command handling.
    *   **How Sway Contributes to Attack Surface:** Sway's design includes a powerful IPC interface for extensibility and control. The security of this interface is paramount.
    *   **Example:** A malicious application could send an IPC command to close all other windows, move a sensitive application off-screen, or execute a shell command if Sway's IPC handling is flawed.
    *   **Impact:** Manipulation of the user interface, denial of service, potential for arbitrary command execution within the user's session.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict authorization and authentication for IPC commands. Ensure only authorized processes can send specific commands.
            *   Carefully validate and sanitize all data received via the IPC socket to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing IPC commands. Avoid commands that offer excessive control.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Be cautious about running untrusted applications that might attempt to interact with Sway's IPC.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Sway Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_sway_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Sway's behavior is heavily influenced by its configuration file. If an attacker can modify this file (e.g., through a compromised user account), they could introduce malicious commands that are executed when Sway starts or when specific events occur (like binding malicious commands to keyboard shortcuts).
    *   **How Sway Contributes to Attack Surface:** Sway's reliance on a user-configurable text file for its core functionality introduces this risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could add a command to execute a reverse shell when a specific key combination is pressed, or on Sway startup.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution within the user's session, persistence of malicious activity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Provide clear warnings and documentation about the security implications of the Sway configuration file.
            *   Consider implementing features to detect and warn about potentially malicious commands in the configuration file.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Protect the Sway configuration file with appropriate file system permissions. Ensure only trusted users can modify it.
            *   Regularly review the Sway configuration file for any unexpected or suspicious commands.
            *   Be cautious about copying configuration snippets from untrusted sources.
