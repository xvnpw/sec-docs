* **Threat:** Malicious Container Format Exploitation
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a media file with a malformed or specifically designed container structure (e.g., MP4, MKV, AVI). When FFmpeg attempts to parse this container, it triggers a vulnerability such as a buffer overflow or an integer overflow. This could allow the attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on the server or cause a denial of service.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.
    * **Affected FFmpeg Component:** `libavformat` library, specifically the demuxer responsible for parsing the specific container format (e.g., the MP4 demuxer, the MKV demuxer).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep FFmpeg updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Implement robust input validation, although validating binary formats is complex.
        * Run FFmpeg in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
        * Consider using a dedicated media processing service that handles security aspects.

* **Threat:** Malicious Codec Exploitation
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a media file that exploits a vulnerability within a specific video or audio codec (e.g., H.264, HEVC, AAC, MP3) used by FFmpeg. This could involve triggering buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory corruption issues during the decoding process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.
    * **Affected FFmpeg Component:** `libavcodec` library, specifically the decoder for the vulnerable codec (e.g., the H.264 decoder, the AAC decoder).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep FFmpeg updated to the latest stable version to patch known codec vulnerabilities.
        * If possible, limit the supported codecs to only those that are necessary and well-vetted.
        * Run FFmpeg in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
        * Consider using hardware-accelerated decoding, which might offer some isolation.

* **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in FFmpeg Filters
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a media processing pipeline that utilizes a vulnerable FFmpeg filter. This could involve exploiting bugs in how filters process or transform media data, leading to memory corruption, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.
    * **Affected FFmpeg Component:** `libavfilter` library, specifically the vulnerable filter (e.g., a specific video or audio filter).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep FFmpeg updated to the latest stable version to patch known filter vulnerabilities.
        * Carefully review and control the filters used in the application's media processing pipeline.
        * Avoid using experimental or less mature filters in production environments.
        * Run FFmpeg in a sandboxed environment.
