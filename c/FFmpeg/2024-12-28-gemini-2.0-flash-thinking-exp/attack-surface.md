Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving FFmpeg, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Maliciously Crafted Media Files
    *   **Description:**  An attacker provides a specially crafted media file (video, audio, image) designed to exploit vulnerabilities in FFmpeg's decoders or demuxers.
    *   **How FFmpeg Contributes:** FFmpeg's core functionality involves parsing and decoding a wide variety of media formats. Vulnerabilities within the specific decoders for these formats can be triggered by malformed input.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a video file with a corrupted header that triggers a buffer overflow in the H.264 decoder within FFmpeg.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), application crash, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Implement strict validation of media file headers and metadata *before* passing them to FFmpeg.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run FFmpeg in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to contain potential damage.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep FFmpeg updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Input Stream Manipulation (e.g., Malicious URLs)
    *   **Description:** If the application allows users to provide URLs for FFmpeg to process (e.g., for downloading remote media), attackers can provide malicious URLs.
    *   **How FFmpeg Contributes:** FFmpeg supports various network protocols for fetching media. Vulnerabilities in these protocol implementations or the way FFmpeg handles redirects can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a URL that redirects to an internal service (SSRF) or triggers a vulnerability in FFmpeg's HTTP handling.
    *   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), information disclosure, access to internal resources, potential for further exploitation of internal services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **URL Whitelisting:**  Restrict the allowed protocols and domains for input URLs.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize URLs before passing them to FFmpeg.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Protocols:** Configure FFmpeg to disable protocols that are not required.

*   **Attack Surface:** Filename/Path Injection
    *   **Description:** If the application uses user-provided filenames or paths directly in FFmpeg commands without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands or access unintended files.
    *   **How FFmpeg Contributes:** FFmpeg commands often involve specifying input and output file paths. If these paths are not properly handled, it can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A user provides a filename like `; rm -rf /` which, if not sanitized, could be executed by the system when FFmpeg processes the command.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server, data loss, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid String Concatenation:**  Do not directly concatenate user input into FFmpeg command strings.
        *   **Use Parameterized Commands:** If possible, use libraries or methods that allow passing parameters to FFmpeg commands safely.
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate filenames and paths to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
