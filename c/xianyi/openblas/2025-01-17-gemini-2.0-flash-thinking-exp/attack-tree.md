## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via OpenBLAS [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_openblas__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within the OpenBLAS library to compromise the application using it.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_exploit_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This category of attacks is high-risk because memory corruption vulnerabilities in C/C++ code, like that of OpenBLAS, can directly lead to arbitrary code execution, which has the highest potential impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK Buffer Overflow in BLAS Routines (AND) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_buffer_overflow_in_blas_routines__and___critical_.md)

This attack vector involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) routines within OpenBLAS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite adjacent memory regions (e.g., return address, function pointers) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_adjacent_memory_regions__e_g___return_address__function_pointers___critical_.md)

A critical step in a buffer overflow where the attacker provides input larger than the allocated buffer, overwriting adjacent memory locations. This often targets the return address on the stack or function pointers, allowing the attacker to redirect the program's execution flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain control of execution flow [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_control_of_execution_flow__critical_.md)

The successful outcome of a buffer overflow where the attacker can now control the instructions the CPU executes, allowing them to run arbitrary code within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK Heap Overflow in Memory Allocation (AND) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_heap_overflow_in_memory_allocation__and___critical_.md)

This attack vector targets memory allocated on the heap by OpenBLAS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Corrupt heap metadata or adjacent objects [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/corrupt_heap_metadata_or_adjacent_objects__critical_.md)

By writing beyond the boundaries of an allocated heap buffer, the attacker can corrupt heap management structures or other data objects located nearby. This can lead to arbitrary write capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve arbitrary write capability [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_arbitrary_write_capability__critical_.md)

A powerful state where the attacker can write data to any memory location within the application's address space, enabling further exploitation like code injection or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Potentially overwrite with attacker-controlled data [CRITICAL] (Part of Use-After-Free)](./attack_tree_paths/potentially_overwrite_with_attacker-controlled_data__critical___part_of_use-after-free_.md)

While the entire Use-After-Free path isn't marked as high-risk in this filtered view, this specific node is critical. It represents the point where the attacker can write data to memory that has been prematurely freed, potentially corrupting data or control structures when that memory is later reallocated and used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve arbitrary read/write capability [CRITICAL] (Part of Use-After-Free)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_arbitrary_readwrite_capability__critical___part_of_use-after-free_.md)

The consequence of a successful Use-After-Free exploit, granting the attacker the ability to read and write to arbitrary memory locations, leading to potential information disclosure or further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Integer Overflow leading to Buffer Overflow (AND)](./attack_tree_paths/integer_overflow_leading_to_buffer_overflow__and_.md)

This attack vector involves exploiting integer overflow vulnerabilities in size calculations within OpenBLAS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite adjacent memory [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_adjacent_memory__critical_.md)

If an integer overflow leads to the allocation of a smaller-than-expected buffer, subsequent writes based on the original, larger size can cause a buffer overflow, overwriting adjacent memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain control of execution flow [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_control_of_execution_flow__critical_.md)

Similar to stack-based buffer overflows, this allows the attacker to control the program's execution path.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK Exploit Build or Supply Chain Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_exploit_build_or_supply_chain_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This category of attacks is high-risk because it doesn't rely on exploiting specific code vulnerabilities within the application's direct codebase but rather targets the process of building and distributing the OpenBLAS library itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK Compromised OpenBLAS Distribution (AND) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_compromised_openblas_distribution__and___critical_.md)

This specific attack vector involves compromising the official channels through which OpenBLAS is distributed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injects malicious code into the OpenBLAS source or binaries [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/injects_malicious_code_into_the_openblas_source_or_binaries__critical_.md)

The attacker gains access to the OpenBLAS repository or build infrastructure and inserts malicious code into the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application uses the compromised version [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/application_uses_the_compromised_version__critical_.md)

Developers unknowingly download and integrate the compromised version of OpenBLAS into their application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious code executes within the application's context [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_code_executes_within_the_application's_context__critical_.md)

When the application runs, the injected malicious code is executed with the same privileges as the application, leading to a complete compromise.
