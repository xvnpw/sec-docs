# Threat Model Analysis for davatorium/rofi

## Threat: [Command Injection via Rofi Input](./threats/command_injection_via_rofi_input.md)

Description: An attacker crafts malicious input that, when processed by the application and passed to `rofi` as part of a command, results in the execution of unintended commands on the system. The attacker might use special characters or command separators to inject their own commands alongside the intended ones.
Impact:  System compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, privilege escalation depending on the commands injected and the privileges of the user running `rofi`.
Rofi Component Affected: `rofi` command execution, specifically how `rofi` processes commands passed to it by the application.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Strict input sanitization and validation before passing user input to `rofi`.
    *   Parameterization of commands passed to `rofi` to separate commands from user-provided data.
    *   Command whitelisting to restrict the set of commands that can be executed via `rofi`.
    *   Running `rofi` with the principle of least privilege.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Rofi Output](./threats/information_disclosure_via_rofi_output.md)

Description: An attacker gains access to sensitive information displayed by `rofi` that was not intended to be exposed. This could happen if the application uses `rofi` to display unfiltered data or if `rofi` inadvertently reveals sensitive details through its output. The attacker might observe the `rofi` window or capture its output if possible.
Impact: Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data like file paths, process names, or application secrets.
Rofi Component Affected: `rofi` output display, specifically how `rofi` renders and presents information to the user.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Carefully filter and sanitize data before displaying it through `rofi`.
    *   Review `rofi` output to ensure no unintended information leakage.
    *   Apply the principle of least information, displaying only necessary data.
    *   Secure `rofi` configuration to prevent accidental information exposure through configuration settings.

## Threat: [Abuse of Rofi Features for Malicious Actions](./threats/abuse_of_rofi_features_for_malicious_actions.md)

Description: An attacker leverages `rofi`'s features (like custom scripts, window switching, application launching) in unintended or malicious ways through the application's integration. The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in how the application uses these features or inject malicious scripts if custom scripts are enabled.
Impact: Unauthorized actions on the system, privilege escalation, data manipulation, system compromise depending on the abused feature and attacker's capabilities.
Rofi Component Affected: `rofi` modules and features like script execution, window management, application launching, and how the application interfaces with these.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Restrict the `rofi` features exposed by the application to only necessary ones.
    *   Securely configure and use `rofi` features, especially custom scripts (sandboxing, code review).
    *   Regularly update `rofi` to patch vulnerabilities in its features.
    *   Implement strict authorization and validation for actions triggered via `rofi` features.
