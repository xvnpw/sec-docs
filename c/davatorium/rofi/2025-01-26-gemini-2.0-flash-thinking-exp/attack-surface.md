# Attack Surface Analysis for davatorium/rofi

## Attack Surface: [1. Configuration Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__configuration_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in `rofi`'s parsing of `config.rasi` files can lead to security breaches.
*   **Rofi Contribution:** `rofi`'s functionality relies on parsing `config.rasi` for customization. A vulnerable parser makes `rofi` susceptible to malicious configurations.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow in `rofi`'s `config.rasi` parser. A crafted `config.rasi` with an excessively long string for a theme setting could trigger a buffer overflow during parsing by `rofi`, potentially leading to denial of service or code execution within the `rofi` process.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, potentially Code Execution within `rofi` process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers & Users:**
        *   Ensure `rofi` is updated to the latest version to benefit from parser security fixes.
        *   Report any suspected parsing issues to the `rofi` developers.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Be cautious when using `config.rasi` files from untrusted sources. Stick to well-vetted themes and configurations.

## Attack Surface: [2. Command Injection via User Input in `dmenu` Mode and Custom Commands](./attack_surfaces/2__command_injection_via_user_input_in__dmenu__mode_and_custom_commands.md)

*   **Description:** Improper handling of user input when `rofi` executes commands, especially in `dmenu` mode or through custom commands, can enable command injection.
*   **Rofi Contribution:** `rofi`'s core purpose includes executing commands based on user selections. If `rofi` or its configuration allows user input to be directly incorporated into shell commands without proper sanitization, it becomes a direct vector for command injection.
*   **Example:** Using `rofi -dmenu` to select an action, where the selected text is directly used in a command. If a user can control the input to `rofi -dmenu` (e.g., via a script generating the menu items), they could inject malicious commands. For instance, if the menu items are generated from an external, untrusted source and one item is crafted as  `; rm -rf / #`, selecting this item in `rofi -dmenu` could lead to the execution of `rm -rf /` with the privileges of the user running `rofi`.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, System Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers & Users (Configuration/Scripts):**
        *   **Never directly use unsanitized user input in shell commands executed by `rofi`.**
        *   **When defining custom commands or actions in `rofi` configurations or scripts, ensure user input is properly escaped or validated before being used in shell commands.** Use safer alternatives to shell commands when possible.
        *   **If generating menu items for `rofi -dmenu` from external sources, sanitize the input to prevent injection attacks.**
    *   **Users (General):**
        *   Be extremely cautious when using `rofi` in scenarios where the menu items or actions are derived from untrusted sources.
        *   Understand the commands that `rofi` is configured to execute based on your selections.

## Attack Surface: [3. Unsafe Execution of External Scripts Triggered by Rofi](./attack_surfaces/3__unsafe_execution_of_external_scripts_triggered_by_rofi.md)

*   **Description:** If `rofi` is configured to execute external scripts based on user actions, vulnerabilities in how `rofi` triggers these scripts or in the scripts themselves can be exploited.
*   **Rofi Contribution:** `rofi`'s ability to trigger external scripts (e.g., through custom commands or actions associated with menu items) introduces an attack surface if this script execution is not handled securely by `rofi` or if the scripts are vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A `rofi` configuration defines a custom command that executes a shell script. If `rofi` does not properly handle the execution environment or if the script itself is vulnerable to command injection (even if the input to `rofi` is safe, the script might have its own vulnerabilities), this can be exploited. For example, if `rofi` executes a script with elevated privileges based on a user action, and that script has a vulnerability, it can be exploited to gain those elevated privileges.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, System Compromise (depending on the script's capabilities and vulnerabilities).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers & Users (Configuration/Scripts):**
        *   **Ensure that any scripts executed by `rofi` are written securely and follow secure coding practices, especially regarding input handling and command execution.**
        *   **Minimize the privileges required for scripts executed by `rofi`.** Run scripts with the least necessary privileges.
        *   **Carefully review and audit any scripts that `rofi` is configured to execute, especially if they are from untrusted sources.**
    *   **Users (General):**
        *   Be cautious about using `rofi` configurations that execute external scripts, especially if you are unsure of the script's origin and security.
        *   Understand what scripts `rofi` is configured to execute and what those scripts do.

## Attack Surface: [4. Path Traversal in Loading Configuration Files and Resources](./attack_surfaces/4__path_traversal_in_loading_configuration_files_and_resources.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper handling of file paths when `rofi` loads configuration files, themes, icons, or scripts can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   **Rofi Contribution:** `rofi` needs to load various resources from the file system. If `rofi` does not properly sanitize or validate paths used for loading these resources, it can be vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
*   **Example:** If `rofi` allows specifying a theme path via a command-line argument or environment variable, and it doesn't properly sanitize this path, an attacker could potentially provide a path like `/../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to load a file outside of the intended theme directory. While `rofi` might not directly display `/etc/passwd` as a theme, a path traversal vulnerability in resource loading could potentially be leveraged in more complex exploits or in custom extensions/scripts that rely on `rofi`'s resource loading mechanisms.  More realistically, a malicious theme file loaded via path traversal could overwrite legitimate configuration files if `rofi` or related scripts have write access to those locations due to misconfigurations.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (potentially, depending on what files can be accessed), Configuration Tampering, potentially Code Execution in more complex scenarios.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers & Users (Configuration):**
        *   Ensure `rofi` is updated to versions with path traversal vulnerability fixes.
        *   If modifying `rofi`'s code, use secure path handling functions and avoid manual string manipulation for path construction.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Be cautious when specifying custom paths for themes, configurations, or other resources, especially if the source of these paths is untrusted.
        *   Only use themes and configurations from trusted sources.
