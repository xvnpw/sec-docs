## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rofi Input Handling [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rofi_input_handling__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how Rofi processes user input and how the application handles Rofi's output. Input handling flaws are a common source of security issues.

*   **Specific Attack Vectors within this Path:**

    *   **Command Injection via User Input [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** This is a critical vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious commands into the system by manipulating user input that is processed by Rofi and subsequently executed by the application or the system itself.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   **User provides malicious input to Rofi:** The attacker crafts input designed to be interpreted as commands when processed.
            *   **Rofi executes command based on user input [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** The application uses Rofi in a way that leads to the execution of commands derived from user input, without proper sanitization.
        *   **Example Scenario:** An application uses Rofi to allow users to search for and open files. If the application uses Rofi's output (the selected file path) directly in a `system()` call without sanitization, an attacker could input a specially crafted filename like `; rm -rf / ;` to execute the `rm -rf /` command, potentially deleting all files on the system.

    *   **Application uses Rofi output without proper sanitization [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Even if Rofi itself doesn't directly execute commands from user input, if the application takes the output from Rofi (e.g., selected item, text input) and uses it in a security-sensitive operation without proper sanitization, it can lead to vulnerabilities like command injection or other forms of exploitation.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   **User provides input to Rofi:** The user interacts with Rofi, potentially providing malicious input.
            *   **Application uses Rofi output without proper sanitization [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** The application takes the output from Rofi and uses it in a command or security-sensitive operation without adequately cleaning or validating the input.
        *   **Example Scenario:** An application uses Rofi to get user input for a script name to execute. If the application takes the Rofi output and directly uses it in a shell command like `subprocess.call(rofi_output)`, without sanitizing `rofi_output`, an attacker could input a malicious script name like `script.sh; malicious_command` to execute `malicious_command` along with `script.sh`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rofi Configuration [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rofi_configuration__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities related to Rofi's configuration mechanisms. Rofi's configuration can control its behavior and even execute commands, making it a potential attack surface.

*   **Specific Attack Vectors within this Path:**

    *   **Malicious Configuration File Injection [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** If the application loads Rofi configuration files from untrusted sources (e.g., user-provided files, downloaded from the internet), an attacker can inject a malicious configuration file containing commands or settings that will be executed by Rofi, leading to application compromise.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   **Application loads Rofi configuration from untrusted source [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** The application is designed to load Rofi configuration files from locations that are not fully controlled or trusted by the application developer.
            *   **Attacker injects malicious commands or settings into config [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** The attacker crafts a malicious Rofi configuration file that includes commands or settings designed to execute arbitrary code or manipulate the application's behavior when Rofi is launched with this configuration.
        *   **Example Scenario:** An application allows users to customize Rofi themes by loading configuration files from a user-specified directory. If the application doesn't validate these configuration files, an attacker could place a malicious configuration file in that directory. This file could contain Rofi configuration options that trigger command execution when Rofi is used by the application.

    *   **Configuration File Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** If Rofi configuration files are writable by an attacker (due to insecure file permissions or other vulnerabilities), the attacker can directly modify the configuration to include malicious commands or settings that will be executed by Rofi when it is launched by the application.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   **Rofi configuration files are writable by attacker [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** The file system permissions or application design allow an attacker to modify Rofi's configuration files.
            *   **Attacker modifies config to execute malicious commands [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** The attacker edits the Rofi configuration files to insert malicious commands or settings that will be executed when Rofi is used by the application.
        *   **Example Scenario:** If the Rofi configuration directory (e.g., `~/.config/rofi`) is writable by a user who is not trusted, an attacker could modify the `config.rasi` file to include commands that execute malicious scripts when Rofi is invoked by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application is vulnerable to exploited Rofi weakness [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/application_is_vulnerable_to_exploited_rofi_weakness__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:** This path highlights that even if Rofi has a vulnerability, the application is only compromised if it is *vulnerable* to that specific weakness. This vulnerability often stems from how the application *uses* Rofi and its lack of sufficient security measures.

*   **Specific Factors Contributing to Application Vulnerability:**

    *   **Application relies on Rofi in a security-sensitive context [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** If the application uses Rofi for tasks that have security implications (e.g., executing commands, handling sensitive data, controlling access), then vulnerabilities in Rofi or its integration become more critical.
        *   **Impact:** Compromise of Rofi in such a context can directly lead to compromise of the application's security functions and potentially sensitive data.

    *   **Application does not implement sufficient security measures around Rofi usage [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:**  If the application developers assume Rofi is inherently secure or fail to implement security measures specifically around their Rofi integration (like input sanitization, output validation, least privilege), the application becomes vulnerable to Rofi-related exploits.
        *   **Impact:** Lack of security measures amplifies the impact of any Rofi vulnerability, making exploitation easier and more damaging.
