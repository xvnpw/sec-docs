## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Sanitization and Validation (Rofi Context)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_sanitization_and_validation__rofi_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Sanitization and Validation (Rofi Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Rofi Input Points:** Developers must pinpoint all instances where user input, intended for use *within* `rofi` commands, originates in the application. This includes input that populates `rofi` menus, search queries passed to `rofi`, or any text fields presented by `rofi` that the application processes.
    2.  **Define Rofi-Specific Whitelist:** Create a whitelist of allowed characters and patterns *specifically* for input that will be used in `rofi` commands. This whitelist should be tailored to the expected input types within `rofi` and should be as restrictive as possible. For example, if `rofi` is used to select application names, the whitelist should allow only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
    3.  **Validate Input Before Rofi Interaction:** Implement input validation routines in the application code *before* passing any user input to `rofi` or constructing commands that `rofi` will execute. This validation must check if the input conforms to the defined `rofi`-specific whitelist. Input that fails validation should be rejected *before* it reaches `rofi`, and an informative error message should be displayed to the user via the application (not necessarily via `rofi` itself).
    4.  **Escape Special Characters for Rofi Commands (Limited Use):** If dynamic input beyond a strict whitelist is absolutely necessary for `rofi` commands (which should be minimized), use proper escaping mechanisms *when constructing the command string that is passed to `rofi`*.  For example, when using shell commands with `rofi -dmenu -p ...`, ensure user input is properly quoted using shell quoting mechanisms (like `printf '%q'`) before being embedded in the command string.  *However, emphasize that escaping should be a last resort for `rofi` command construction, and whitelisting input before it even reaches `rofi` is the preferred approach.*
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection via Rofi (High Severity):** Malicious users could inject arbitrary shell commands by providing crafted input that bypasses sanitization and is then used in commands executed by `rofi`. This leads to unauthorized code execution initiated through `rofi`.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of Command Injection via `rofi`. By validating input *before* it interacts with `rofi` and carefully constructing commands passed to `rofi`, the likelihood of successful injection is drastically reduced.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Input sanitization is currently implemented in the Python backend for application name selection in the main menu (`main_menu.py`), using a basic alphanumeric whitelist *before* application names are presented in `rofi`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Input sanitization is missing in:
    *   The custom command execution feature in the `advanced_menu.sh` script. User-provided commands are not sanitized *before* being passed to `rofi` for execution.
    *   Any input fields in potential future features that might involve user-provided text used in commands executed by `rofi`.  Validation needs to be implemented *before* this input is used with `rofi`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterization and Command Construction Best Practices (Rofi Commands)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterization_and_command_construction_best_practices__rofi_commands_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterization and Command Construction Best Practices (Rofi Commands)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer Direct Binary Execution for Rofi Actions:** When designing actions triggered by `rofi` selections, prioritize directly executing binaries with arguments instead of relying on shell interpretation of complex command strings passed to `rofi`. This minimizes the shell's role and reduces the attack surface for injection vulnerabilities *within the commands that `rofi` executes*. For example, instead of using `rofi` to trigger a shell command like `rofi -dmenu -p "Action: " -input <(echo "script.sh arg1 arg2")`, if possible, have `rofi` directly trigger the execution of `script.sh` with arguments passed separately by the application.
    2.  **Minimize Shell Usage in Rofi Commands:** Reduce reliance on shell features like command substitution, pipes, and redirection *within the commands that `rofi` is instructed to execute*. If shell features are necessary in `rofi`-triggered actions, carefully construct the command strings and ensure user input is never directly embedded without strict sanitization and escaping (as described in strategy 1, applied *before* constructing the `rofi` command).
    3.  **Use Array-Based Command Construction for Rofi (Shell Scripts):** In shell scripts that construct commands for `rofi` to execute, use arrays to build commands instead of string concatenation. This helps prevent accidental misinterpretation of spaces and special characters *when constructing the command string for `rofi`*. For example, instead of `rofi_command="rofi -dmenu -p '$prompt' -input <(echo '$menu_items')"`, use `rofi_command_array=("rofi" "-dmenu" "-p" "$prompt" "-input" "<(echo '$menu_items')"); "${rofi_command_array[@]}"`.
    4.  **Avoid `eval` and similar dangerous constructs in Rofi-Triggered Actions:**  Never use `eval` or similar functions that execute arbitrary strings as code *within the actions triggered by `rofi` selections*, especially when user input is involved. This is a major command injection vulnerability that can be easily exploited through `rofi` if not carefully avoided.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection via Rofi (High Severity):** Reduces the likelihood of command injection by limiting the shell's ability to interpret user input as commands or shell metacharacters *within the commands executed by `rofi`*.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces the risk of Command Injection via `rofi`. While not a complete solution on its own, it significantly reduces the attack surface and makes exploitation harder, especially when combined with input sanitization applied *before* interacting with `rofi`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. For simple application launches in `main_menu.py`, direct binary execution is used where possible when `rofi` triggers application starts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The `advanced_menu.sh` script relies heavily on shell command construction and string manipulation *for actions triggered by `rofi`*, increasing the risk of injection. This script needs to be refactored to minimize shell usage in `rofi`-triggered actions and adopt safer command construction methods for `rofi`.
    *   Future features involving more complex actions triggered by `rofi` should prioritize direct binary execution and minimize shell interaction *in the commands that `rofi` executes*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Clear and Explicit Rofi Menu Design & Confirmation Prompts](./mitigation_strategies/clear_and_explicit_rofi_menu_design_&_confirmation_prompts.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Clear and Explicit Rofi Menu Design & Confirmation Prompts
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Descriptive Rofi Menu Items:**  Use clear, concise, and unambiguous labels for all menu items *presented in `rofi`*. Labels should accurately reflect the action that will be performed when the item is selected *via `rofi`*. Avoid vague or misleading labels in `rofi` menus.
    2.  **Contextual Information in Rofi Prompts:**  Provide sufficient contextual information in `rofi` menu prompts and item descriptions to help users understand the consequences of their choices *within the `rofi` interface*.
    3.  **Confirmation Prompts in Rofi for Destructive Actions:**  For actions triggered by `rofi` that are potentially destructive, irreversible, or have significant consequences (e.g., deleting files, executing system commands), implement confirmation prompts *within the `rofi` workflow*. These prompts should be displayed by `rofi` (or immediately after a `rofi` selection) and clearly state the action to be performed, requiring explicit user confirmation (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete file X? [Yes/No]" presented in a subsequent `rofi` prompt or a similar mechanism triggered by `rofi`).
    4.  **Visual Cues in Rofi Menus:** Use visual cues (e.g., different colors, icons) in `rofi` menus to differentiate between actions with varying levels of risk or impact *within the `rofi` interface*. This can help users quickly identify potentially sensitive or destructive options in `rofi`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Command Execution via Rofi (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of users accidentally triggering unintended actions *through `rofi`* due to unclear menu items or lack of confirmation in the `rofi` interface.
    *   **User Error leading to Data Loss or System Damage via Rofi (Medium Severity):** Confirmation prompts and clear descriptions in `rofi` help prevent accidental data loss or system damage caused by user mistakes made *while interacting with `rofi`*.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces the risk of Unintended Command Execution and User Error *when using `rofi`*. Confirmation prompts within the `rofi` workflow are particularly effective in preventing accidental destructive actions triggered through `rofi`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Main menu items in `main_menu.py` are generally descriptive *when presented in `rofi`*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Confirmation prompts are not implemented for any actions triggered by `rofi`, including potentially destructive actions in `advanced_menu.sh` or future features that use `rofi` to initiate actions. Confirmation prompts need to be integrated into the `rofi` interaction flow.
    *   Menu item descriptions could be improved in some areas to provide more context and clarity *within `rofi`*, especially in `advanced_menu.sh`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Sensitive Information Displayed in Rofi Interface](./mitigation_strategies/control_sensitive_information_displayed_in_rofi_interface.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Control Sensitive Information Displayed in Rofi Interface
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Information Displayed in Rofi:**  Carefully review all information displayed in `rofi` menus and prompts.  Avoid displaying sensitive data (passwords, API keys, personal information, internal system details) *directly within the `rofi` interface* unless absolutely necessary for the user to perform the intended task *using `rofi`*.
    2.  **Redact or Mask Sensitive Data in Rofi:** If sensitive information must be displayed *in `rofi`*, redact or mask portions of it to minimize exposure *within the `rofi` display*. For example, display only the last few digits of an ID or mask characters in a password field *presented in `rofi`*.
    3.  **Temporary Display and Clearing in Rofi (If Applicable):** If sensitive information is displayed temporarily *in `rofi`*, ensure it is cleared from the `rofi` display and application memory as soon as it is no longer needed. Consider how `rofi` handles display history and ensure sensitive information is not persistently stored or easily accessible in `rofi`'s history.
    4.  **Access Control for Sensitive Information in Rofi Context:** Implement access control mechanisms in the application to ensure that only authorized users can interact with `rofi` interfaces that might display sensitive information or trigger privileged actions *via `rofi`*. This control should be applied *before* information is presented in `rofi`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Rofi (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental or intentional disclosure of sensitive information *through the `rofi` display*.
    *   **Data Breach via Rofi Interface (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by limiting the exposure of sensitive data in the user interface presented by `rofi`.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces the risk of Information Disclosure and Data Breach *related to information presented in `rofi`*. The impact depends on the sensitivity of the information being controlled and displayed in `rofi`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  Currently, no highly sensitive information is directly displayed in `rofi` menus in the main application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   This strategy needs to be considered proactively for all future features and updates that involve displaying information *via `rofi`*.  Developers must be mindful of information disclosure risks when designing new `rofi` interfaces.
    *   A formal review process should be implemented to assess information disclosure risks before adding new features that display data in `rofi` menus or prompts.  This review should specifically consider what information is presented *in `rofi`*.
