## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Rofi Exploitation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rofi_exploitation_[critical].md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at any of the descendant critical nodes or high-risk paths can lead to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Attack Surface within Rofi Interaction [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_attack_surface_within_rofi_interaction_[critical].md)

*   This is a crucial initial step for the attacker. Understanding how the application uses Rofi (configuration, input, command execution) is necessary to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Discover Insecure Configuration Handling [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/discover_insecure_configuration_handling_[critical].md)

*   This critical node represents weaknesses in how the application manages Rofi's configuration. Exploiting these weaknesses allows the attacker to control Rofi's behavior.
    *   **Modify Config File (Insufficient Permissions) HIGH RISK:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application stores or generates Rofi configuration files with permissions that allow modification by unauthorized users.
        *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker gains write access to the configuration file and modifies it to execute malicious commands when Rofi is invoked. This could involve adding a custom mode or script that runs a reverse shell or other malicious payload.
    *   **Inject via Command-Line Arguments HIGH RISK:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application constructs Rofi command-line arguments dynamically based on internal logic or potentially user input without proper sanitization.
        *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker identifies how the command is constructed and injects malicious options or commands directly into the Rofi invocation. This could involve adding flags that execute arbitrary code or redirecting output to gain access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Config File (Insufficient Permissions) HIGH RISK](./attack_tree_paths/modify_config_file_(insufficient_permissions)_high_risk.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application stores or generates Rofi configuration files with permissions that allow modification by unauthorized users.
        *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker gains write access to the configuration file and modifies it to execute malicious commands when Rofi is invoked. This could involve adding a custom mode or script that runs a reverse shell or other malicious payload.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject via Command-Line Arguments HIGH RISK](./attack_tree_paths/inject_via_command-line_arguments_high_risk.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application constructs Rofi command-line arguments dynamically based on internal logic or potentially user input without proper sanitization.
        *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker identifies how the command is constructed and injects malicious options or commands directly into the Rofi invocation. This could involve adding flags that execute arbitrary code or redirecting output to gain access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Analyze Input Provided to Rofi [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/analyze_input_provided_to_rofi_[critical].md)

*   This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities related to the data the application feeds into Rofi for display and user selection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Input Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_input_injection_vulnerabilities_[critical].md)

*   This critical node highlights the risk of the application not properly sanitizing the input it provides to Rofi.
    *   **Inject Malicious Command in Input Item HIGH RISK:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application fails to sanitize the strings it presents to Rofi as selectable items.
        *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker manipulates the input source (e.g., through a connected database, API, or by influencing user-provided data) to inject malicious commands or shell escapes directly into the item names or descriptions displayed by Rofi. When a user selects this manipulated item, Rofi or the application processing the selection might execute the injected command.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Command in Input Item HIGH RISK](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_command_in_input_item_high_risk.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application fails to sanitize the strings it presents to Rofi as selectable items.
        *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker manipulates the input source (e.g., through a connected database, API, or by influencing user-provided data) to inject malicious commands or shell escapes directly into the item names or descriptions displayed by Rofi. When a user selects this manipulated item, Rofi or the application processing the selection might execute the injected command.

## Attack Tree Path: [Analyze Command Execution Logic [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/analyze_command_execution_logic_[critical].md)

*   This critical node focuses on how the application processes user selections from Rofi and executes commands based on those selections.

## Attack Tree Path: [Discover Command Injection Points [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/discover_command_injection_points_[critical].md)

*   This critical node represents vulnerabilities where the application constructs commands to be executed based on user selections without proper security measures.
    *   **Inject Malicious Command via Selection HIGH RISK:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application constructs the command to be executed based on the user's selection in Rofi by directly concatenating strings or using insecure templating mechanisms.
        *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker manipulates the application's state or input to influence the data used to construct the command after a Rofi selection. By carefully crafting the input or selection, the attacker can inject malicious commands that will be executed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Command via Selection HIGH RISK](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_command_via_selection_high_risk.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application constructs the command to be executed based on the user's selection in Rofi by directly concatenating strings or using insecure templating mechanisms.
        *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker manipulates the application's state or input to influence the data used to construct the command after a Rofi selection. By carefully crafting the input or selection, the attacker can inject malicious commands that will be executed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Identified Weakness [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_identified_weakness_[critical].md)

*   This critical node represents the final stage where the attacker leverages any of the vulnerabilities identified in the previous critical nodes or high-risk paths to achieve arbitrary code execution. The specific actions taken here depend on the nature of the exploited vulnerability.
