### 5.1. Data Flow Description

1. The user initiates an interaction by providing input through the keyboard or mouse.
2. The Input Event Handler captures and interprets these raw input events.
3. The Input Event Handler sends the processed input event to the Core Logic.
4. The Core Logic may request configuration settings from the Configuration Manager to determine how to handle the input.
5. The Configuration Manager provides the requested configuration data to the Core Logic.
6. The Core Logic often needs information about the current state of the system, such as the list of running applications and windows, which it queries from the Window Manager.
7. The Window Manager responds with the requested information.
8. Based on the input and system state, the Core Logic prepares the data that needs to be displayed in the Rofi interface.
9. The Core Logic sends this UI data to the Output Renderer.
10. The Output Renderer interacts with the Display Server to draw the Rofi window on the screen.
11. The Display Server updates the user's display to show the Rofi UI.
12. The user makes a selection within the Rofi interface (e.g., by pressing Enter).
13. The Input Event Handler captures this selection.
14. The Input Event Handler informs the Core Logic about the selected action.
15. Depending on the selected action, the Core Logic will:
    -   Execute a command to launch a new application using a system call.
    -   Request the Window Manager to switch focus to a different window.
    -   Execute a custom shell command using a system call.
    -   Trigger an action within a loaded plugin through the Plugin Interface.

## 6. Key Components and Their Responsibilities

-   **`rofi` (Main Executable):**
    -   Serves as the entry point and orchestrates the interaction between different components.
    -   Parses command-line arguments provided by the user.
    -   Initializes the Configuration Manager, Input Event Handler, Output Renderer, and Plugin Interface.
    -   Manages the main event loop, processing user input and system events.
-   **Configuration Subsystem (Implemented by Configuration Manager):**
    -   Loads configuration files from standard locations (e.g., `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi`).
    -   Parses the configuration syntax, likely a custom format (e.g., HOCON or a similar structure).
    -   Provides an API for other components to access configuration values.
    -   Handles command-line overrides of configuration settings, taking precedence over file-based configurations.
-   **Input Subsystem (Implemented by Input Event Handler):**
    -   Captures low-level keyboard and (potentially) mouse events from the operating system.
    -   Maps raw input events to higher-level actions based on defined keybindings and context.
    -   Provides mechanisms for handling text input, including character composition and input method support.
-   **Output Subsystem (Implemented by Output Renderer):**
    -   Interacts directly with the Display Server (X Server or Wayland compositor) using appropriate libraries.
    -   Renders the Rofi window and its contents, including text, icons, and other visual elements.
    -   Handles theming and visual customization based on configuration settings.
    -   Manages the positioning and focus of the Rofi window on the screen.
-   **Mode Handlers (Part of Core Logic):**
    -   Implement the specific logic for different Rofi operating modes (e.g., `drun` for application launching, `window` for window switching, `ssh` for connecting to SSH hosts, `combi` for combining modes).
    -   Each mode handler is responsible for fetching and processing data relevant to its function. For example, the `drun` mode handler retrieves a list of executable applications.
    -   Plugin modes extend this system, allowing plugins to introduce new functionalities.

## 7. Security Considerations (Detailed)

This section outlines specific security considerations relevant to Rofi's design, which will be crucial for threat modeling.

-   **Configuration File Parsing and Handling:**
    -   **Vulnerability:** Improper parsing of configuration files (e.g., `config.rasi`) could lead to vulnerabilities such as arbitrary code execution if the parser is susceptible to exploits or if insecure directives are allowed.
    -   **Mitigation:** Employ a robust and well-tested parsing library. Implement strict validation of configuration values. Avoid executing arbitrary code based on configuration file contents. Ensure proper file permissions to prevent unauthorized modification.
-   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    -   **Vulnerability:** Failure to sanitize and validate user input (especially when executing commands or scripts) can lead to command injection attacks.
    -   **Mitigation:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization techniques. Avoid directly passing user-provided strings to shell commands. Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives where possible.
-   **Execution of External Processes:**
    -   **Vulnerability:** Executing arbitrary commands or scripts based on user input or configuration introduces significant security risks, potentially allowing privilege escalation or system compromise.
    -   **Mitigation:** Minimize the need to execute external processes. If necessary, provide clear warnings to the user. Consider sandboxing or limiting the privileges of executed processes. Carefully validate the paths and arguments of executed commands.
-   **Plugin Architecture Security:**
    -   **Vulnerability:** Malicious or poorly written plugins can introduce vulnerabilities, potentially granting access to sensitive data or allowing arbitrary code execution within the Rofi process.
    -   **Mitigation:** Implement a secure plugin loading mechanism. Consider using code signing or sandboxing for plugins. Provide clear documentation and guidelines for plugin developers. Potentially implement a plugin permission system.
-   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Security (If Applicable):**
    -   **Vulnerability:** If Rofi uses IPC for communication, vulnerabilities in the IPC mechanism could be exploited to eavesdrop on communication or inject malicious messages.
    -   **Mitigation:** Use secure IPC mechanisms. Authenticate communication endpoints. Encrypt sensitive data transmitted over IPC.
-   **Memory Safety:**
    -   **Vulnerability:** Memory corruption bugs (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) in the C/C++ codebase can lead to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
    -   **Mitigation:** Employ memory-safe programming practices. Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to detect memory errors. Regularly audit the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
-   **Display Server Interaction:**
    -   **Vulnerability:** While less common, vulnerabilities in the interaction with the X11 or Wayland protocols could potentially be exploited.
    -   **Mitigation:** Adhere to best practices for interacting with the display server. Stay updated on security advisories related to X11 and Wayland.
-   **Default Configurations:**
    -   **Vulnerability:** Insecure default configurations could expose users to unnecessary risks.
    -   **Mitigation:** Ensure that default configurations are secure and follow the principle of least privilege. Provide clear documentation on how to configure Rofi securely.
