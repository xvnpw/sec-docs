# Attack Surface Analysis for davatorium/rofi

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via User Input in Rofi](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_user_input_in_rofi.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting malicious input that is processed by Rofi and subsequently executed by the application.
    *   **How Rofi Contributes:** Rofi acts as an intermediary, displaying and allowing selection of user-provided or application-generated data. If the application blindly executes actions based on the selected item without sanitization, Rofi becomes a conduit for injecting malicious commands.
    *   **Example:** An application displays a list of filenames using Rofi. A malicious user crafts a filename like `; rm -rf /`. If the application directly executes the selected filename using `os.system()` or a similar function, this command will be executed.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data loss, unauthorized access, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all user-provided data before passing it to Rofi and before executing any actions based on Rofi's output. Specifically, escape or remove shell metacharacters.
            *   **Avoid Direct Execution:**  Do not directly execute user-selected items as commands. Instead, use a safe mapping or lookup mechanism to associate user selections with predefined actions.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of successful command injection.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can modify Rofi's configuration file (`config.rasi`) to alter its behavior and potentially execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **How Rofi Contributes:** Rofi's functionality is heavily driven by its configuration file. Modifying this file can change keybindings, menu behavior, and even trigger external commands *within Rofi's context*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the user's `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi` and modifies a keybinding (e.g., pressing `Enter`) to execute `xterm -e "malicious_script.sh"`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution within the user's session, data exfiltration, persistence, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Secure Configuration Location:**  Ensure the default configuration location has appropriate permissions, preventing unauthorized modification.
            *   **Avoid Application-Level Configuration Overrides (if possible):** If your application allows overriding Rofi configuration, ensure this is done securely and validated.
        *   **Users:**
            *   **Restrict File System Permissions:** Ensure only the user has write access to their Rofi configuration directory (`~/.config/rofi`).
            *   **Regularly Review Configuration:** Periodically check the `config.rasi` file for unexpected or malicious entries.
