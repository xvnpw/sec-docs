# Attack Surface Analysis for davatorium/rofi

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input via Rofi's Prompt](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_via_rofi's_prompt.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious escape sequences or control characters into the text displayed by Rofi.
    *   **How Rofi Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Rofi renders the text provided to it, and if this text contains terminal control sequences, it can be interpreted by the terminal emulator where Rofi is running.
    *   **Example:** An application displays a filename provided by the user in Rofi. The user enters a filename like `$(rm -rf ~)`. If not properly sanitized, Rofi will display this, and the terminal might interpret `$(rm -rf ~)` as a command to execute.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary command execution on the user's system.
        *   Denial of Service by crashing the terminal.
        *   UI Spoofing to mislead the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Strictly sanitize any user-provided data before passing it to Rofi for display. Escape or remove potentially harmful characters and sequences. Use libraries specifically designed for sanitizing terminal output.
            *   Avoid displaying untrusted data directly in Rofi. If necessary, provide context that clearly separates user input from application-controlled elements.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies Rofi's configuration file (`config.rasi`) to execute arbitrary commands or alter its behavior.
    *   **How Rofi Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Rofi reads and applies settings from its configuration file. If this file is writable by an attacker, they can inject malicious configurations.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies `config.rasi` to include a custom command that executes `xterm -e "malicious_script.sh"` when a specific keybinding is pressed or a certain menu item is selected.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary command execution with the user's privileges.
        *   Modification of Rofi's behavior to disrupt application functionality.
        *   Information disclosure by configuring Rofi to log sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Ensure Rofi's configuration file is stored in a location with appropriate permissions, preventing unauthorized modification.
            *   If your application needs to modify Rofi's configuration, do so with caution and validate any changes. Consider using a dedicated configuration file for your application's integration.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Protect your user profile and ensure only trusted processes have write access to your Rofi configuration file.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Script Execution Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_script_execution_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in custom scripts executed by Rofi.
    *   **How Rofi Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Rofi allows the execution of custom scripts associated with menu items or actions. If these scripts are not secure, they can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A custom script used by Rofi to perform a system action has a vulnerability that allows command injection. An attacker crafts a malicious input that, when passed to the script via Rofi, executes arbitrary commands.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary command execution with the user's privileges.
        *   Data manipulation or exfiltration.
        *   System compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Thoroughly vet and audit any custom scripts used by Rofi for security vulnerabilities, including command injection, path traversal, and other common issues.
            *   Apply the principle of least privilege to custom scripts. Ensure they only have the necessary permissions to perform their intended tasks.
            *   Sanitize any input passed to custom scripts from Rofi.

## Attack Surface: [Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Issues](./attack_surfaces/inter-process_communication__ipc__issues.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how your application communicates with Rofi.
    *   **How Rofi Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Rofi interacts with your application through command-line arguments and standard input/output. Improper handling of these interactions can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Your application constructs the Rofi command based on user input without proper sanitization. An attacker provides input that injects additional commands into the Rofi execution, leading to arbitrary command execution. For instance, the application might construct a command like `rofi -dmenu -p "Enter command:" <<< "$user_input"`, and the user enters `; rm -rf ~`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary command execution with the user's privileges.
        *   Information disclosure.
        *   Denial of Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Avoid constructing Rofi commands directly from user input. Use parameterized commands or other secure methods to prevent command injection.
            *   Validate any data received from Rofi before using it in your application.
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege when executing Rofi.
