# Threat Model Analysis for davatorium/rofi

## Threat: [Malicious Command Execution via User Input](./threats/malicious_command_execution_via_user_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted input to the application that is then passed to `rofi` without proper sanitization. `rofi` interprets this input as a command and executes it with the privileges of the user running the application. The attacker might aim to execute arbitrary system commands, install malware, or gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's account and potentially the system, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.

**Affected Rofi Component:** Input processing, command execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly sanitize and validate all user input before passing it to `rofi`.
*   Avoid directly passing user-provided input to `rofi` for command execution.
*   If direct input is unavoidable, use whitelisting of allowed characters and commands.
*   Utilize `rofi`'s `-filter` option with a predefined and controlled list of entries.
*   Employ techniques like escaping shell metacharacters before passing input to `rofi`.

## Threat: [Malicious Command Execution via Configuration File Manipulation](./threats/malicious_command_execution_via_configuration_file_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the `rofi` configuration files used by the application. They modify these files to include malicious commands or scripts that are executed when `rofi` is launched by the application or when specific keybindings are triggered.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands with the user's privileges, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.

**Affected Rofi Component:** Configuration file parsing, command execution triggered by configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure `rofi` configuration files are stored in secure locations with restricted access permissions, preventing unauthorized modification.
*   If the application generates `rofi` configuration files, ensure the generation process is secure and doesn't introduce vulnerabilities.
*   Regularly audit `rofi` configuration files for unexpected or malicious entries.
*   Consider using immutable configuration files or checksum verification to detect tampering.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Custom Rofi Scripts/Plugins](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_custom_rofi_scriptsplugins.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes custom scripts or plugins for `rofi`, these extensions might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing malicious input or manipulating the application's interaction with these scripts, leading to command execution or other malicious actions.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands, data manipulation, or other impacts depending on the vulnerability in the script.

**Affected Rofi Component:** Script execution, plugin interface.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and audit all custom `rofi` scripts and plugins for security vulnerabilities.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to custom scripts, limiting their access to system resources.
*   Ensure proper input validation and sanitization within custom scripts.
*   Keep custom scripts updated with security patches.

## Threat: [Spoofing via Malicious Rofi Binary Replacement](./threats/spoofing_via_malicious_rofi_binary_replacement.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges on the system replaces the legitimate `rofi` binary with a malicious one. When the application attempts to execute `rofi`, the malicious binary is executed instead, potentially performing actions unintended by the application.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's session, execution of arbitrary code with the application's privileges, data theft.

**Affected Rofi Component:** Binary execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Verify the integrity of the `rofi` binary using checksums or digital signatures before execution.
*   Ensure the directory containing the `rofi` binary has appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized modification.
*   Consider using a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a potentially compromised `rofi` binary.

## Threat: [Abuse of Rofi's `-password` functionality](./threats/abuse_of_rofi's__-password__functionality.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `rofi` with the `-password` option to collect sensitive information (like passwords or API keys) and doesn't handle the output securely, an attacker might be able to intercept or access this information. This could happen if the output is logged, stored insecurely, or displayed without proper protection.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to other systems or data.

**Affected Rofi Component:** `-password` functionality, output handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using `rofi -password` for highly sensitive information if possible.
*   If `-password` is necessary, ensure the output is handled with extreme care and is not logged or stored insecurely.
*   Consider alternative, more secure methods for collecting sensitive information.
