## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Rofi -> Exploit Input Handling -> Command Injection via User Input -> Inject Malicious Commands via Rofi Prompt](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rofi_-_exploit_input_handling_-_command_injection_via_user_input_-_inject_656d9d3f.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker crafts malicious input containing shell metacharacters or commands that are executed by the system due to insufficient input sanitization when Rofi processes user input.
    * Critical Node: Inject Malicious Commands via Rofi Prompt - This is the point where the attacker successfully injects and executes arbitrary commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Rofi -> Exploit Input Handling -> Command Injection via Configuration -> Inject Malicious Commands in Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rofi_-_exploit_input_handling_-_command_injection_via_configuration_-_inj_42423cce.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker gains access to Rofi's configuration files and injects malicious commands that are executed when Rofi starts or performs specific actions.
    * Critical Node: Inject Malicious Commands in Configuration Files - This is the point where malicious commands are embedded within the configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Rofi -> Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Malicious Configuration File Injection -> Replace Legitimate Configuration with Malicious One](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rofi_-_exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_malicious_configuration_fi_653edd41.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker replaces the legitimate Rofi configuration file with a malicious one, allowing them to control Rofi's behavior and execute arbitrary commands.
    * Critical Node: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities - This is the broader category of weaknesses that allows for configuration manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Rofi -> Exploit Plugin/Script Vulnerabilities -> Malicious Plugin Installation -> Trick User into Installing Malicious Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rofi_-_exploit_pluginscript_vulnerabilities_-_malicious_plugin_installati_df9587de.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker uses social engineering or other methods to trick a user into installing a malicious Rofi plugin that can execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious actions.
    * Critical Node: Trick User into Installing Malicious Plugin - This is the critical step where the attacker gains access through a malicious plugin.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Rofi -> Exploit Plugin/Script Vulnerabilities -> Vulnerabilities in Existing Plugins/Scripts -> Exploit Bugs in Custom Scripts or Third-Party Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rofi_-_exploit_pluginscript_vulnerabilities_-_vulnerabilities_in_existing_c5157771.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker exploits existing vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, path traversal) within custom scripts or third-party plugins used by Rofi.
    * Critical Node: Exploit Bugs in Custom Scripts or Third-Party Plugins - This is the point where a vulnerability within a plugin is successfully exploited.
