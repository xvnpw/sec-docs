## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Application via Rofi -> Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Malicious Configuration File Injection -> Replace Legitimate Configuration with Malicious One

This document provides a deep analysis of a specific attack path targeting an application utilizing the Rofi application launcher (https://github.com/davatorium/rofi). The analysis focuses on the scenario where an attacker compromises the application by exploiting vulnerabilities related to Rofi's configuration.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this analysis is to thoroughly understand the attack path: **Compromise Application via Rofi -> Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Malicious Configuration File Injection -> Replace Legitimate Configuration with Malicious One**. This includes:

* **Identifying the specific vulnerabilities** that enable this attack path.
* **Analyzing the attacker's actions and motivations** at each stage.
* **Evaluating the potential impact** of a successful attack.
* **Developing effective mitigation strategies** to prevent this type of attack.

### 2. Scope

This analysis is specifically focused on the provided attack tree path. While other attack vectors targeting Rofi or the application using it may exist, they are outside the scope of this document. The analysis will consider:

6. **Documentation and Reporting:**  Presenting the findings in a clear and structured manner.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: An attacker replaces the legitimate Rofi configuration file with a malicious one, allowing them to control Rofi's behavior and execute arbitrary commands.

This attack vector hinges on the attacker's ability to modify the Rofi configuration file. Rofi, like many applications, relies on configuration files to customize its behavior, appearance, and even the actions it performs. If an attacker can replace the legitimate configuration with a malicious one, they gain significant control over Rofi's execution.

**Attacker Actions:**

1. **Locate the Rofi Configuration File:** The attacker needs to identify the location of the Rofi configuration file. This is typically located in `~/.config/rofi/config` or a similar path depending on the system and Rofi version.
2. **Create a Malicious Configuration File:** The attacker crafts a configuration file that includes malicious commands or actions. This could involve:
    * **Executing arbitrary shell commands:** Rofi allows binding actions to specific key presses or menu items. A malicious configuration can bind a seemingly innocuous action to a command that compromises the system.
    * **Modifying Rofi's behavior to steal information:**  The configuration could be altered to log user input or redirect actions to malicious scripts.
    * **Using Rofi to launch other malicious applications:** The configuration could be used to trigger the execution of malware already present on the system.
3. **Replace the Legitimate Configuration File:** The attacker needs to overwrite the legitimate configuration file with their malicious version. This requires write access to the directory containing the configuration file.

**Prerequisites for Success:**

* **Knowledge of the Rofi configuration file location.**
* **Ability to write to the directory containing the Rofi configuration file.** This is the crucial vulnerability that needs to be exploited.

#### 4.2. Critical Node: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities - This is the broader category of weaknesses that allows for configuration manipulation.

This critical node represents the underlying weaknesses that enable the malicious configuration file injection. Several potential vulnerabilities fall under this category:

* **Insecure File Permissions:** The most likely vulnerability is overly permissive file permissions on the Rofi configuration file or the directory containing it. If the configuration file or its parent directory is writable by users other than the legitimate owner (e.g., world-writable or group-writable to a group the attacker belongs to), an attacker can replace the file.
* **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Vulnerabilities:** While less likely in this specific scenario, a TOCTOU vulnerability could exist if the application checks the integrity of the configuration file but then uses it later without re-verification. An attacker could potentially replace the file between the check and the use.
* **Configuration File Injection via Other Means:**  While the primary attack vector is direct replacement, other vulnerabilities could lead to configuration manipulation:
    * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in scripts or applications that manage Rofi's configuration:** If other tools are used to modify the configuration, vulnerabilities in those tools could be exploited.
    * **Leveraging vulnerabilities in backup or synchronization mechanisms:** If configuration files are backed up or synchronized insecurely, an attacker might be able to inject malicious configurations through those channels.

#### 4.3. Malicious Configuration File Injection

This stage is the direct action of replacing the legitimate configuration file with the attacker's crafted malicious version. The success of this stage depends entirely on the presence of the "Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities" described above.

**Example of a Malicious Configuration:**

```
configuration {
  modi: "drun,run,ssh";
  display-drun: "Apps";
  display-run: "Run";
  display-ssh: "SSH";
  kb-custom-1: "Alt+p,exec:sh -c 'xmessage \"You have been hacked!\"'";
};
```

In this example, pressing `Alt+p` would execute the command `sh -c 'xmessage "You have been hacked!"'`. A more sophisticated attacker could execute commands to:

* **Establish a reverse shell:**  Gain remote access to the system.
* **Steal credentials:** Access sensitive information stored on the system.
* **Install malware:** Persistently compromise the system.

#### 4.4. Replace Legitimate Configuration with Malicious One

This is the final step in the attack path. The attacker, having identified the vulnerability and crafted the malicious configuration, executes the replacement. This could be done using standard command-line tools like `cp`, `mv`, or by writing to the file directly.

**Impact of Successful Attack:**

The impact of a successful attack through this path can be significant:

* **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running Rofi. This can lead to complete system compromise if Rofi is run with elevated privileges (which is generally discouraged).
* **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can use the executed commands to steal sensitive data from the system.
* **Malware Installation:** The attacker can install persistent malware, allowing for long-term control of the system.
* **Denial of Service:** The attacker could modify the configuration to make Rofi unusable, disrupting the user's workflow.
* **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While not a direct privilege escalation, the attacker can leverage the compromised user's privileges to perform actions they wouldn't normally be able to.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate this attack path, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Secure File Permissions:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the Rofi configuration file and its parent directory have the most restrictive permissions possible. Typically, the configuration file should be readable and writable only by the user who owns it. The parent directory should allow the user to create and modify files within it, but not be writable by other users.
    * **Regular Auditing:** Periodically audit file permissions to ensure they haven't been inadvertently changed.
* **Configuration File Integrity Monitoring:**
    * **File Integrity Monitoring Systems (FIM):** Implement FIM tools that monitor changes to critical configuration files, including Rofi's configuration. Alerts should be triggered upon unauthorized modifications.
    * **Digital Signatures (Less Common for Rofi):** While less common for individual application configurations like Rofi, consider using digital signatures for critical system-wide configurations.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization (Indirect):**
    * While Rofi's configuration is not directly user-provided input in the traditional sense, any tools or scripts that *generate* or *modify* the Rofi configuration should implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent injection vulnerabilities in those tools.
* **Principle of Least Privilege for Rofi Execution:**
    * Ensure Rofi is run with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running Rofi as root or with unnecessary elevated privileges. This limits the impact of any commands executed through a malicious configuration.
* **Regular Security Updates:**
    * Keep Rofi and the underlying operating system up-to-date with the latest security patches. This helps address any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain write access to the configuration files.
* **User Education:**
    * Educate users about the risks of running untrusted applications or scripts that might modify their Rofi configuration.
* **Consider Configuration Management Tools:**
    * For environments with multiple users or systems, consider using configuration management tools to centrally manage and enforce Rofi configurations, reducing the likelihood of individual users having insecure configurations.

### 6. Conclusion

The attack path involving the replacement of the legitimate Rofi configuration file with a malicious one highlights the importance of secure file permissions and configuration management. By understanding the attacker's motivations and the vulnerabilities they exploit, development teams can implement effective mitigation strategies to protect their applications and users. Focusing on the principle of least privilege for file permissions and implementing file integrity monitoring are crucial steps in preventing this type of attack.
