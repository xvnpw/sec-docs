Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Rofi, with high and critical risk severity:

* **Attack Surface: Command Injection via User Input**
    * **Description:**  The application passes user-provided input from Rofi selections directly to shell commands without proper sanitization.
    * **How Rofi Contributes:** Rofi acts as the intermediary, collecting user input and providing it to the application. If the application trusts this input implicitly, it becomes vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An application uses Rofi to select a file to open and then executes `xdg-open <selected_file>`. A malicious user could input `important.txt; rm -rf /` in Rofi. If not sanitized, the application would execute `xdg-open important.txt; rm -rf /`, potentially deleting system files.
    * **Impact:**  Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the application, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all input received from Rofi before using it in shell commands. Use allow-lists and escape special characters.
            * **Avoid Direct Shell Execution:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly executing shell commands with user-provided input. Use safer alternatives like dedicated libraries or APIs for specific tasks.
            * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

* **Attack Surface: Command Injection via Configuration Files**
    * **Description:** The application relies on a user-modifiable Rofi configuration file (`config.rasi`) for its functionality, allowing malicious users to inject commands.
    * **How Rofi Contributes:** Rofi's flexibility in configuration allows for defining custom commands and scripts. If the application depends on these configurations without validation, it becomes vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An application uses a custom Rofi command defined in `config.rasi` like `!run: echo "Hello $*"`. A malicious user could modify this to `!run: echo "Hello $*" && rm -rf /`. When the application triggers this command, the malicious code will execute.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the Rofi process (and potentially the parent application).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * **Configuration Validation:** If the application relies on Rofi's configuration, validate the relevant parts of the `config.rasi` file to ensure it doesn't contain malicious commands.
            * **Restrict Configuration Options:**  If possible, limit the configuration options the application relies on to reduce the attack surface.
            * **Use Application-Specific Configuration:**  Consider using application-specific configuration files instead of relying solely on the user's Rofi configuration.

* **Attack Surface: Command Injection via Custom Scripts**
    * **Description:** The application utilizes Rofi's ability to execute custom scripts based on user selections, and these scripts can be manipulated.
    * **How Rofi Contributes:** Rofi provides the mechanism to execute external scripts. If the application relies on user-provided or modifiable scripts without proper security measures, it introduces a vulnerability.
    * **Example:** An application uses Rofi to trigger a script that performs an action based on the selected item. A malicious user could replace the legitimate script with a malicious one that performs unintended actions when triggered by Rofi.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Rofi process and potentially the parent application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * **Script Validation:** If the application uses custom scripts with Rofi, validate the content and source of these scripts to ensure they are not malicious.
            * **Restrict Script Locations:**  Limit the locations from which Rofi can execute scripts and ensure these locations are protected.
            * **Code Review:** Regularly review the code of any custom scripts used with Rofi.
