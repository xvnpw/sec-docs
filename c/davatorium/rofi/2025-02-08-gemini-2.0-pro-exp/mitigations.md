# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for davatorium/rofi

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Whitelisting (within Rofi and its Scripts)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_whitelisting__within_rofi_and_its_scripts_.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Identify Rofi Input Points:** Pinpoint all locations where `rofi` receives user input. This includes the main input field, arguments passed to custom scripts via `rofi`, and any data read from files/pipes that are *directly* influenced by `rofi`'s user interaction.
2.  **Define Strict Whitelists:** For *each* `rofi` input point, create a rigorous whitelist of allowed characters or regular expression patterns.  Prioritize the most restrictive whitelist possible.
3.  **Implement Validation in Rofi Configuration and Scripts:**
    *   Within `rofi`'s configuration (e.g., `config.rasi`), if using features that process input (like `-dmenu`), ensure the commands receiving the input perform thorough validation.
    *   Within *every* custom script called by `rofi`, implement robust input validation *before* using the input in any shell command, file operation, or other potentially dangerous action. Use a dedicated parsing library if feasible.
4.  **Escape/Quote (Last Resort):** If shell metacharacters *must* be used after validation within a `rofi`-launched script, ensure they are meticulously escaped or quoted. This is a *fallback* to whitelisting, not a replacement.
5.  **Rofi Input Length Limits:** Utilize `rofi`'s built-in features (if available) or script-level checks to enforce reasonable maximum lengths on input fields to prevent excessively long inputs.
6. **Consistent Encoding:** Ensure that `rofi` and all associated scripts use a consistent character encoding (preferably UTF-8) to avoid encoding-related vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary shell commands through `rofi`'s input mechanisms.
    *   **Script Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents malicious code injection into scripts executed by `rofi`.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Relevant if `rofi`'s output is displayed in a web context (uncommon, but possible with custom scripts).
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Length limits and input validation mitigate some DoS attacks.
    *   **Path Traversal (Severity: High):** If `rofi` is used for file/directory selection, input validation prevents access outside intended directories.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** Risk reduced from Critical to Very Low.
    *   **Script Injection:** Risk reduced from Critical to Very Low.
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Low (context-dependent).
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Path Traversal:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Hypothetical Example:* Partially implemented. Basic length limits might exist in `rofi`'s configuration. Some custom scripts have basic validation, but it's inconsistent and not always whitelist-based.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Hypothetical Example:* Comprehensive whitelisting needs to be implemented across *all* `rofi` input points and within *every* custom script. A dedicated input validation library should be considered for scripts.  A thorough audit of all `rofi`-related scripts is required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Script Execution (Rofi-Launched Scripts)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_script_execution__rofi-launched_scripts_.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Principle of Least Privilege (within Scripts):** Ensure that *every* script executed by `rofi` operates with the *minimum* necessary privileges. Avoid running scripts as root.
2.  **Wrapper Scripts (for Rofi):** Create wrapper scripts that `rofi` calls *instead* of directly executing the target script. These wrappers can perform:
    *   **Additional Input Validation:** Reinforce input validation before passing data to the main script.
    *   **Integrity Checks:** Verify the target script's integrity (e.g., checksum) before execution.
    *   **Security Policy Enforcement:** Implement custom security checks.
    *   **Logging:** Log script execution details for auditing.
3.  **Secure Scripting Practices (within Rofi Scripts):**
    *   Always quote variables to prevent word splitting and globbing.
    *   Use `set -euo pipefail` in shell scripts for robustness.
    *   Avoid unsafe functions/commands.
    *   Handle errors meticulously.
    *   *Never* store sensitive data directly in scripts. Use environment variables or secure alternatives, and ensure `rofi` passes these securely (if needed).
4. **-no-exec Consideration:** Evaluate using `rofi`'s `-no-exec` option in specific scenarios. This forces `rofi` to use a shell, which, *combined with rigorous shell script validation*, can provide an extra (though not primary) layer of control.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: Critical):** Limits the potential for a compromised script to gain elevated privileges.
    *   **System Compromise (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the damage a compromised script can inflict.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Makes it harder for a script to access and exfiltrate sensitive data.
    *   **Malware Propagation (Severity: High):** Restricts a script's ability to spread malware.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from Critical to Medium.
    *   **System Compromise:** Risk reduced from Critical to Medium.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **Malware Propagation:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Hypothetical Example:* Partially implemented. Some scripts might avoid unnecessary root privileges, but there's no consistent use of wrapper scripts or comprehensive secure scripting practices.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Hypothetical Example:* Implement wrapper scripts for all `rofi`-launched scripts that handle user input or perform sensitive operations.  Conduct a thorough security review of *all* existing scripts, enforcing secure coding practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Rofi Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_rofi_configuration.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Restrict File Permissions (Rofi Config):** Ensure strict file permissions on `rofi`'s configuration file (e.g., `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi`) and any directories containing `rofi`-launched scripts. Only the user running `rofi` should have read-write access.
2.  **Avoid Sensitive Data in Rofi Config:** *Never* store passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information directly in `rofi`'s configuration file. Use environment variables or other secure mechanisms, and ensure `rofi` is configured to access them securely (if necessary).
3. **Review Rofi Configuration:** Regularly audit `rofi`'s configuration file for any potentially unsafe settings or commands.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Modification (Severity: Medium):** Prevents unauthorized changes to `rofi`'s behavior.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: High):** Protects sensitive data that might be (incorrectly) stored in the configuration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Modification:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from High to Low (if sensitive data is removed).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Hypothetical Example:* Partially implemented. File permissions are likely set correctly, but a review for sensitive data in the configuration is needed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Hypothetical Example:* Thoroughly review `rofi`'s configuration file to ensure no sensitive data is stored directly within it. Implement a secure method for managing any secrets that `rofi` needs to access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Wayland Preference for Rofi](./mitigation_strategies/wayland_preference_for_rofi.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Prioritize Wayland:** If the system supports both X11 and Wayland, configure the system and `rofi` to use Wayland. Wayland's architecture provides better isolation between applications, reducing the risk of `rofi` being affected by or affecting other applications. This is a *direct* choice impacting `rofi`'s security posture.
2. **Verify Rofi is using Wayland:** Use system tools to confirm that `rofi` is actually running under Wayland and not falling back to X11.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Input Sniffing (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of other applications eavesdropping on `rofi`'s input (a significant risk on X11).
    *   **Window Manipulation (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of other applications interfering with `rofi`'s windows (also more prevalent on X11).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Input Sniffing:** Risk reduced from High (X11) to Low (Wayland).
    *   **Window Manipulation:** Risk reduced from Medium (X11) to Low (Wayland).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Hypothetical Example:*  Potentially not implemented or inconsistently implemented. The system might default to X11, or `rofi` might not be explicitly configured to prefer Wayland.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Hypothetical Example:*  Configure the system and `rofi` to explicitly prefer Wayland. Verify that `rofi` is running under Wayland.
