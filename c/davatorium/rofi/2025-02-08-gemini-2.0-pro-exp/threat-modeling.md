# Threat Model Analysis for davatorium/rofi

## Threat: [Arbitrary Command Execution via `-modi run`](./threats/arbitrary_command_execution_via__-modi_run_.md)

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Command Execution via `-modi run`

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when passed to `rofi`'s `-modi run` functionality (or a custom script mode that uses shell execution), is interpreted as a shell command.  The attacker might use command substitution, semicolons, pipes, or other shell metacharacters to inject their commands.  This is a *direct* exploitation of `rofi`'s intended functionality when misused.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `rofi`. This could lead to data theft, data destruction, installation of malware, or use of the system for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Rofi Component:** `-modi run`, custom script modes that utilize shell execution (e.g., a custom mode defined in the configuration file). The core issue is the interaction between user input and the shell, *directly facilitated by rofi*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization (Primary):**  Implement *extremely* strict input validation and sanitization.  Whitelist only the specific characters and patterns expected for valid input.  Reject *any* input containing shell metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `&`, `$`, `(`, `)`, backticks, etc.).  Do *not* attempt to "escape" metacharacters; instead, reject the input entirely.
        *   **Avoid Shell Execution (Ideal):** If possible, redesign the application to avoid using `-modi run` or shell execution altogether.  Use direct API calls or library functions to achieve the desired functionality.
        *   **Parameterization (If Shell is Unavoidable):** If shell execution is absolutely necessary, use a language-specific mechanism to *parameterize* the command, preventing the input from being interpreted as part of the command itself.  For example, in Python, use `subprocess.run` with a list of arguments, *not* a single string.  Never construct the command string by concatenating user input.
        *   **Restricted Shell/Environment:** If shell execution is unavoidable, consider running the command in a restricted shell environment (e.g., `rbash`) or a container (e.g., Docker) to limit the potential damage.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure `rofi` is not running with elevated privileges (e.g., as root).

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering (Leading to Command Execution)](./threats/configuration_file_tampering__leading_to_command_execution_.md)

*   **Threat:** Configuration File Tampering (Leading to Command Execution)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to `rofi`'s configuration file (e.g., `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi`) or any custom script files *used by rofi*. They modify the configuration to add malicious commands to be executed *by rofi*, change the behavior of existing modes, or redirect actions to malicious scripts *that rofi will run*. This is a direct attack on how rofi is configured to operate.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution when `rofi` is launched or when specific actions are triggered *by the user interacting with the now-compromised rofi instance*. The attacker gains control over `rofi`'s behavior, potentially leading to the same consequences as direct command injection.
    *   **Affected Rofi Component:** Configuration files (`config.rasi`), custom script files *that are referenced and executed by rofi*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File Permissions:** Set strict file permissions on `rofi`'s configuration files and any associated script files.  Ensure that only the user who owns the files has write access.  Other users should have read-only access (or no access at all). Use `chmod` to set appropriate permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 config.rasi`).
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement a mechanism to monitor the integrity of the configuration files.  This could involve calculating checksums (e.g., using `sha256sum`) and periodically verifying them, or using a more sophisticated file integrity monitoring tool (e.g., AIDE, Tripwire).
        *   **Configuration Validation:** If the application dynamically generates or modifies `rofi`'s configuration, implement strict validation to ensure that the generated configuration is safe and does not contain any malicious elements.
        *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in Config:** Do not store sensitive information (passwords, API keys) directly in `rofi`'s configuration files.
