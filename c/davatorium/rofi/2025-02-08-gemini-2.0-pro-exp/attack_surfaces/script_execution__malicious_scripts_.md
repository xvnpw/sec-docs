Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Script Execution (Malicious Scripts)" attack surface for applications using `rofi`, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Rofi Script Execution Attack Surface

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the risks associated with `rofi`'s script execution capabilities, identify specific vulnerabilities, and propose comprehensive mitigation strategies to prevent malicious script execution.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for both developers integrating `rofi` into their applications and end-users configuring and using `rofi`.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack surface presented by `rofi`'s ability to execute external scripts, including:

*   Custom script modes.
*   The `-run-command` option.
*   Any other mechanism within `rofi` that allows the execution of user-defined or externally sourced scripts.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities within `rofi`'s core code itself (e.g., buffer overflows in its parsing logic).  We assume `rofi` itself is reasonably secure, focusing on how *applications using* `rofi` can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   Attacks that do not involve script execution (e.g., denial-of-service attacks against `rofi`).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis employs the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We identify potential attackers, their motivations, and the likely attack vectors they would use.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We examine how `rofi`'s features can be misused to execute malicious scripts.
3.  **Impact Assessment:** We evaluate the potential consequences of successful attacks.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:** We propose concrete steps to reduce or eliminate the identified risks, targeting both developers and users.
5.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):** While we don't have access to a specific application's codebase, we will consider hypothetical code snippets and configurations to illustrate potential vulnerabilities and mitigations.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1 Threat Modeling

*   **Attacker Profiles:**
    *   **Remote Attacker (Limited Access):**  An attacker who has gained limited, unprivileged access to the system (e.g., through a compromised web application or phishing).  They aim to escalate privileges or gain further access.
    *   **Local Attacker (Unprivileged User):**  A user on the system who wants to gain elevated privileges or access data they shouldn't have.
    *   **Malicious Script Provider:**  Someone who distributes malicious `rofi` scripts or configurations through seemingly legitimate channels (e.g., online forums, repositories).

*   **Motivations:**
    *   Data theft (credentials, personal information, etc.)
    *   System compromise (installing malware, creating backdoors)
    *   Privilege escalation
    *   Denial of service (by disrupting system functionality)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File System Manipulation:**  The most direct attack vector.  The attacker gains write access to a script file that `rofi` executes.  This could be achieved through:
        *   Exploiting another vulnerability in a different application.
        *   Social engineering (tricking the user into replacing the script).
        *   Leveraging misconfigured file permissions.
    *   **Environment Variable Manipulation:** If the application or `rofi` itself uses environment variables to determine script paths, an attacker might be able to modify these variables to point to a malicious script.
    *   **Configuration File Manipulation:** Similar to file system manipulation, but targeting `rofi`'s configuration files if they specify script paths.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (Less Likely):** If scripts are downloaded from a remote source without proper verification, an attacker could intercept the download and replace the script with a malicious one.

### 4.2 Vulnerability Analysis

The core vulnerability lies in `rofi`'s trust in the scripts it executes.  `rofi` itself doesn't inherently distinguish between "good" and "bad" scripts; it simply executes the code provided.  This creates several specific vulnerabilities:

*   **Unrestricted Script Location:** If the application allows `rofi` to execute scripts from user-writable locations (e.g., `~/.config/rofi`, `/tmp`), an attacker can easily replace or modify these scripts.
*   **Lack of Script Integrity Checks:**  If the application doesn't verify the integrity of the script before execution, an attacker can silently replace a legitimate script with a malicious one.
*   **Overly Permissive File Permissions:**  If script files have overly permissive permissions (e.g., world-writable), any user on the system can modify them.
*   **Dynamic Script Paths:** If the script path is determined dynamically (e.g., based on user input or environment variables), an attacker might be able to influence this path to point to a malicious script.
*   **Use of Untrusted Script Sources:** Downloading and executing scripts from untrusted sources without verification is inherently risky.

### 4.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful malicious script execution through `rofi` can be severe, ranging from minor inconvenience to complete system compromise:

*   **Data Exfiltration:** The malicious script could steal sensitive data, such as passwords, SSH keys, browser cookies, or personal files.
*   **Malware Installation:** The script could download and install malware, including ransomware, keyloggers, or remote access trojans (RATs).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The script could exploit local vulnerabilities to gain root access to the system.
*   **System Disruption:** The script could delete files, modify system settings, or otherwise disrupt the normal operation of the system.
*   **Persistence:** The script could establish persistence on the system, ensuring that it runs even after a reboot.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  The script could be used to attack other systems on the network.

### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies

#### 4.4.1 Developer Mitigations

These are the *most critical* mitigations, as they address the root cause of the vulnerability.

1.  **Secure Script Storage (Essential):**
    *   **Never** store executable scripts in user-writable directories like `~/.config/rofi` or `/tmp`.
    *   Store scripts in a system-wide directory that is only writable by root (e.g., `/usr/share/my-application/rofi-scripts/`).
    *   Use restrictive file permissions: `chmod 755` (owner: read/write/execute, group: read/execute, others: read/execute) is a good starting point.  Consider `750` or `700` if group or other access is not needed.
    *   **Example (Good):**
        ```bash
        # Store script in a system-wide directory
        sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/my-application/rofi-scripts/
        sudo cp my-script.sh /usr/share/my-application/rofi-scripts/
        sudo chown root:root /usr/share/my-application/rofi-scripts/my-script.sh
        sudo chmod 755 /usr/share/my-application/rofi-scripts/my-script.sh

        # In your application, call rofi like this:
        rofi -show run -run-command '/usr/share/my-application/rofi-scripts/my-script.sh {cmd}'
        ```
    *   **Example (Bad):**
        ```bash
        # Storing the script in the user's home directory is vulnerable
        cp my-script.sh ~/.config/rofi/
        chmod 755 ~/.config/rofi/my-script.sh

        # In your application:
        rofi -show run -run-command '~/.config/rofi/my-script.sh {cmd}'
        ```

2.  **Script Integrity Verification (Essential):**
    *   Implement a mechanism to verify that the script hasn't been tampered with before execution.
    *   **Checksums (SHA-256 recommended):**
        *   Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the script during development and store it securely (e.g., in a separate file, embedded in the application code).
        *   Before executing the script, recalculate its SHA-256 hash and compare it to the stored hash.  If they don't match, refuse to execute the script.
        *   **Example (Conceptual):**
            ```python
            import hashlib
            import subprocess

            def run_rofi_script(script_path, expected_hash):
                with open(script_path, "rb") as f:
                    script_content = f.read()
                    calculated_hash = hashlib.sha256(script_content).hexdigest()

                if calculated_hash != expected_hash:
                    print("Error: Script integrity check failed!")
                    return

                subprocess.run(["rofi", "-show", "run", "-run-command", script_path + " {cmd}"])

            # Example usage:
            script_path = "/usr/share/my-application/rofi-scripts/my-script.sh"
            expected_hash = "e5b7e998591597554771a570721745b799286789d1d24d20499d5e989a7e45b7"  # Replace with the actual hash
            run_rofi_script(script_path, expected_hash)
            ```
    *   **Digital Signatures (More Robust):**
        *   Use a code signing certificate to digitally sign the script.
        *   Before executing the script, verify the signature using the corresponding public key.  This provides stronger assurance of authenticity and integrity.
        *   This is more complex to implement but offers the best protection.

3.  **Avoid Custom Scripts When Possible (Highly Recommended):**
    *   Explore `rofi`'s built-in modes (e.g., `drun`, `run`, `window`) thoroughly.  These are generally safer than custom scripts.
    *   If a built-in mode almost meets your needs, consider contributing to `rofi` to enhance it rather than writing a custom script.

4.  **Minimize Script Functionality (Principle of Least Privilege):**
    *   Design scripts to perform only the *absolutely necessary* tasks.  Avoid giving scripts unnecessary permissions or access to sensitive data.
    *   If a script only needs to read a file, don't give it write access.

5.  **Sandboxing (Advanced):**
    *   Consider running `rofi` scripts within a sandboxed environment (e.g., using `firejail`, `bubblewrap`, or a container) to limit their access to the system.  This adds a significant layer of protection but increases complexity.

6.  **Avoid Dynamic Script Paths (Important):**
    *   Hardcode the script path whenever possible.
    *   If you *must* use a dynamic path, validate it thoroughly against a whitelist of allowed paths.  *Never* construct a script path directly from user input.
    *   **Example (Bad):**
        ```bash
        # Vulnerable: script_path is taken directly from user input
        rofi -show run -run-command "$script_path {cmd}"
        ```
    *   **Example (Better - Still Requires Careful Validation):**
        ```bash
        # Validate script_path against a whitelist
        allowed_paths = ["/usr/share/my-application/rofi-scripts/script1.sh", "/usr/share/my-application/rofi-scripts/script2.sh"]
        if script_path in allowed_paths:
            rofi -show run -run-command "$script_path {cmd}"
        else:
            print("Error: Invalid script path.")
        ```

7. **Audit and Logging:**
    * Implement logging to track when and how rofi scripts are executed. This can help with incident response and identifying potential attacks.

#### 4.4.2 User Mitigations

These mitigations are important for users who configure and use `rofi` directly, especially if they use custom scripts.

1.  **Protect Your Configuration Directory:**
    *   Ensure that your `~/.config/rofi` directory (and any other directories containing `rofi` scripts) has appropriate permissions.  Generally, only you should have write access to these directories.
    *   `chmod 700 ~/.config/rofi` (owner: read/write/execute, no access for group or others) is a good starting point.

2.  **Be Wary of Untrusted Scripts:**
    *   Only download and use `rofi` scripts from trusted sources.
    *   Carefully review the code of any script before using it.  If you don't understand the code, don't run it.
    *   Consider using a virtual machine or sandboxed environment to test scripts from untrusted sources.

3.  **Keep Rofi Updated:**
    *   Regularly update `rofi` to the latest version to benefit from any security fixes.

4.  **Use a Security-Focused Linux Distribution:**
    *   Consider using a Linux distribution that prioritizes security, such as Qubes OS, Whonix, or Tails. These distributions often have built-in security features that can help mitigate the risks of malicious script execution.

## 5. Conclusion

The ability of `rofi` to execute external scripts presents a significant attack surface.  By understanding the threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, developers and users can significantly reduce the risk of malicious script execution.  The most crucial steps are for developers to store scripts securely, implement integrity checks, and avoid custom scripts whenever possible.  Users should protect their configuration directories and be cautious about using scripts from untrusted sources.  By following these guidelines, the powerful functionality of `rofi` can be leveraged safely and securely.
