## Threat Model: Compromising Application via Lua-Nginx Module - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or execute arbitrary code on the application server by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Lua-Nginx Module.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Lua Code Execution Vulnerabilities**
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Inject Malicious Lua Code
        *   Via User-Controlled Input
            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Inject via Query Parameters (e.g., using `ngx.req.get_uri_args()`)
            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Inject via Request Headers (e.g., using `ngx.req.get_headers()`)
            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Inject via Request Body (e.g., using `ngx.req.get_body_data()`)
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Insecure Use of Lua Functions
            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Abuse `loadstring` or `load` with User-Controlled Input
            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit `os.execute` or similar system calls with unsanitized input
    *   **CRITICAL NODE:** Exploit Nginx Configuration Vulnerabilities Related to Lua
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Misconfigure `content_by_lua_block`, `access_by_lua_block`, etc.
            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Bypass Authentication/Authorization logic implemented in Lua

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Lua Code Execution Vulnerabilities:**
    *   This represents the overarching goal of an attacker seeking to execute arbitrary code within the application's Lua environment. Success here grants significant control over the application and potentially the underlying server.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Inject Malicious Lua Code:**
    *   This path involves injecting untrusted data that is then interpreted and executed as Lua code. This can be achieved through various means:
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Inject via Query Parameters (e.g., using `ngx.req.get_uri_args()`):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a URL with malicious Lua code embedded within the query parameters. If the application directly uses `ngx.req.get_uri_args()` without proper sanitization and then executes this data (e.g., using `loadstring`), the attacker's code will be executed on the server.
            *   **Consequences:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Inject via Request Headers (e.g., using `ngx.req.get_headers()`):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Similar to query parameter injection, but the malicious Lua code is placed within HTTP headers. If the application retrieves header values using `ngx.req.get_headers()` and then executes them without sanitization, the attacker gains code execution.
            *   **Consequences:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) with the same potential impacts as query parameter injection.
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Inject via Request Body (e.g., using `ngx.req.get_body_data()`):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The malicious Lua code is included in the request body (e.g., in a POST request). If the application processes the request body using `ngx.req.get_body_data()` and subsequently executes it without proper sanitization, the attacker's code will run.
            *   **Consequences:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) with the same potential impacts as other injection methods.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Insecure Use of Lua Functions:**
    *   This path focuses on the misuse of powerful Lua functions that can have dangerous consequences if not handled carefully:
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Abuse `loadstring` or `load` with User-Controlled Input:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The `loadstring` and `load` functions in Lua compile and execute strings as code. If an application uses these functions with user-provided input without strict sanitization or sandboxing, an attacker can inject arbitrary Lua code that will be executed.
            *   **Consequences:** Direct Remote Code Execution (RCE), granting the attacker full control over the application's execution environment.
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit `os.execute` or similar system calls with unsanitized input:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The `os.execute` function allows Lua code to execute system commands. If an application uses this function with user-provided input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands that will be executed by the server's operating system.
            *   **Consequences:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) at the operating system level, potentially leading to complete server compromise.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Nginx Configuration Vulnerabilities Related to Lua:**
    *   This node highlights vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations in Nginx that directly impact Lua execution.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Misconfigure `content_by_lua_block`, `access_by_lua_block`, etc.:**
    *   These Nginx directives are used to embed and execute Lua code within the Nginx request processing lifecycle. Misconfigurations can lead to security vulnerabilities:
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Bypass Authentication/Authorization logic implemented in Lua:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If authentication or authorization logic is implemented within a `access_by_lua_block` or similar directive, a misconfiguration in the Nginx configuration could allow requests to bypass this logic entirely. For example, incorrect `location` block matching or missing security checks could expose protected resources.
            *   **Consequences:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or other security violations.
