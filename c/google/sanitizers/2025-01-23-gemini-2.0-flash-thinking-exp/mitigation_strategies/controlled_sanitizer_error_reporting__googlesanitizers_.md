    *   **Message Design:**  Crafting user-friendly and helpful generic error messages that are informative without revealing sensitive details.
    *   **Integration with Error Handling:**  Seamlessly integrating generic error message display into the application's existing error handling framework.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Contextual Generic Messages:**  Consider using slightly more contextual generic messages where possible (e.g., "There was a problem processing your request" instead of just "An error occurred").
    *   **Provide Support Channels:**  Ensure users have clear channels to report issues (e.g., support email, help desk) if they encounter generic error messages.
    *   **Internal Error Correlation:**  Implement mechanisms to correlate generic user error messages with detailed internal logs for efficient debugging and issue resolution.

**4.1.4 Secure Log Access:**

*   **Description:** Restrict access to sanitizer logs to authorized personnel (developers, security team).

*   **Implementation Challenges:**
    *   **Access Control Mechanism Selection:**  Choosing appropriate access control mechanisms based on the environment and existing infrastructure.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Implementing RBAC to manage access based on roles and responsibilities.
    *   **Regular Access Review:**  Establishing processes for regularly reviewing and updating access controls to ensure they remain appropriate.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Implement RBAC:**  Utilize Role-Based Access Control to manage access to sanitizer logs based on job functions.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant access only to those individuals who absolutely need it and only for the necessary level of access.
    *   **Audit Logging of Log Access:**  Log access attempts to sanitizer logs for auditing and security monitoring purposes.

**4.1.5 Log Sanitization (Optional):**

*   **Description:** Consider sanitizing or redacting sensitive data from sanitizer logs before long-term storage.
*   **Functionality:**  Implement processes to automatically or manually redact or mask potentially sensitive data within sanitizer logs before they are stored for extended periods. This can involve techniques like regular expression-based redaction, tokenization, or data masking algorithms.
*   **Effectiveness:** **Medium to High** for mitigating Information Disclosure (depending on the effectiveness of sanitization). Reduces the risk of long-term information disclosure from archived logs. **Neutral** for mitigating DoS. Does not directly impact DoS.
