# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for google/sanitizers

## Mitigation Strategy: [Selective Sanitizer Deployment (google/sanitizers)](./mitigation_strategies/selective_sanitizer_deployment__googlesanitizers_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Selective Sanitizer Deployment (google/sanitizers)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Environment Differentiation:**  Establish distinct build configurations for different environments (development, testing/staging, production).
    2.  **Sanitizer Enablement Control:**  Configure build systems (e.g., CMake, Makefiles, build scripts) to enable sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` (like AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer) by default in development and testing/staging environments.
    3.  **Production Disablement (Default):**  Ensure production builds are configured to *not* include sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` by default due to performance overhead.
    4.  **On-Demand Production Enablement:**  Provide a mechanism (e.g., feature flags, environment variables, specific build profiles) to selectively enable sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` in production for targeted debugging, security audits, or performance profiling under controlled conditions.
    5.  **Documentation:** Clearly document the environment-specific sanitizer configurations and how to enable/disable sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` in production.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Performance Degradation in Production (High Severity):**  Unnecessary performance overhead from sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` in production can lead to slow response times, resource exhaustion, and poor user experience.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion in Production (High Severity):**  Increased memory and CPU usage by sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` in production can lead to application crashes or instability under heavy load.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Performance Degradation in Production:** High reduction.  Completely eliminates performance overhead in normal production operation by disabling sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers`.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion in Production:** High reduction. Prevents resource exhaustion due to sanitizer overhead in production by disabling sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, implemented in the project's CMake build system.
    *   Sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` are automatically enabled for Debug and Testing build types.
    *   Release build type disables sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` by default.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Mechanism for on-demand production enablement is currently missing.  Need to implement a feature flag or environment variable to allow enabling sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` in production for specific scenarios without requiring a full rebuild and redeployment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Sanitizer Testing in CI/CD (google/sanitizers)](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_sanitizer_testing_in_cicd__googlesanitizers_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Comprehensive Sanitizer Testing in CI/CD (google/sanitizers)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **CI Pipeline Integration:** Integrate builds using sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` into the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.
    2.  **Automated Testing with Sanitizers:**  Run all automated tests (unit, integration, system) against builds compiled with sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` enabled.
    3.  **Failure Reporting:** Configure the CI system to fail builds and alert developers immediately upon detection of sanitizer errors (e.g., memory leaks, use-after-free, undefined behavior) reported by sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers`.
    4.  **Dedicated Sanitizer Test Stage:**  Create a dedicated stage in the CI pipeline specifically for running tests with sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` to clearly separate sanitizer-related failures from other test failures.
    5.  **Regular Test Execution:** Ensure sanitizer-enabled tests are executed regularly (e.g., on every commit, nightly builds) to catch issues early in the development lifecycle using sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **False Negatives (Medium Severity):**  Failing to detect vulnerabilities detectable by sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` due to insufficient testing with them.
    *   **Delayed Vulnerability Discovery (Medium Severity):**  Discovering vulnerabilities detectable by sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` late in the development cycle, making them more costly and time-consuming to fix.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **False Negatives:** Medium reduction. Significantly increases the likelihood of detecting vulnerabilities that sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` are designed to find during automated testing.
    *   **Delayed Vulnerability Discovery:** High reduction. Catches vulnerabilities early in the development process using sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers`, reducing remediation costs and time.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, partially implemented.
    *   CI pipeline includes a "Sanitizer Tests" stage.
    *   Unit tests are executed with AddressSanitizer from `github.com/google/sanitizers` enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Integration and system tests are not yet run with sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` in the CI pipeline. Need to extend the "Sanitizer Tests" stage to include these test suites.
    *   MemorySanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer from `github.com/google/sanitizers` are not yet consistently used in CI. Need to incorporate these sanitizers into the CI testing matrix.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Sanitizer Error Reporting (google/sanitizers)](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_sanitizer_error_reporting__googlesanitizers_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Controlled Sanitizer Error Reporting (google/sanitizers)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Internal Logging:** Configure sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` to log detailed error reports to internal logging systems (e.g., log files, centralized logging server) instead of directly outputting to standard error in production.
    2.  **Error Interception:** Implement a mechanism to intercept sanitizer error messages from `github.com/google/sanitizers` before they reach standard output in production environments.
    3.  **Generic User Error Messages:**  In production, if a sanitizer error from `github.com/google/sanitizers` occurs that might lead to application instability, display a generic, user-friendly error message (e.g., "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.") to avoid exposing technical details from sanitizer output.
    4.  **Secure Log Access:**  Restrict access to sanitizer logs from `github.com/google/sanitizers` to authorized personnel (developers, security team) to prevent unauthorized information disclosure.
    5.  **Log Sanitization (Optional):**  Consider sanitizing or redacting sensitive data from sanitizer logs from `github.com/google/sanitizers` before long-term storage, if logs might contain potentially sensitive information.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through Error Messages (Medium Severity):**  Sanitizer error messages from `github.com/google/sanitizers` can reveal internal application details, memory layout, or code paths to attackers if exposed in production.
    *   **Denial of Service through Verbose Error Output (Low Severity):**  Excessive sanitizer error output from `github.com/google/sanitizers` to standard error in production could potentially contribute to denial of service in extreme cases, although less likely.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through Error Messages:** Medium reduction. Prevents direct exposure of detailed sanitizer error messages from `github.com/google/sanitizers` to end-users, reducing information leakage.
    *   **Denial of Service through Verbose Error Output:** Low reduction. Minimally reduces the risk of DoS from error output, primarily by redirecting output away from standard error for sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, partially implemented.
    *   Application uses a logging library that can redirect output to files.
    *   Sanitizer output from `github.com/google/sanitizers` is currently still directed to standard error in production.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to configure the logging system to capture sanitizer output from `github.com/google/sanitizers` and redirect it to log files in production.
    *   Implement error interception to prevent sanitizer messages from `github.com/google/sanitizers` reaching standard error in production.
    *   Develop a generic error page to display to users in case of critical sanitizer-related errors from `github.com/google/sanitizers` in production.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, partially implemented.
    *   Project uses CMake which specifies compiler versions (implicitly affecting system sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers`).
    *   No explicit version pinning or regular update process for sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement explicit version tracking for system sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` (e.g., document required compiler/OS versions).
    *   Establish a regular schedule (e.g., quarterly) to review and update sanitizer versions from `github.com/google/sanitizers`.
    *   Integrate regression testing into the sanitizer update process to validate updates of sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitizer Configuration Management (google/sanitizers)](./mitigation_strategies/sanitizer_configuration_management__googlesanitizers_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy:  Sanitizer Configuration Management (google/sanitizers)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Centralized Configuration:** Manage sanitizer configurations (flags, options, suppression lists) for sanitizers from `github.com/google/sanitizers` in dedicated configuration files or scripts, rather than scattering them throughout the build system or code.
