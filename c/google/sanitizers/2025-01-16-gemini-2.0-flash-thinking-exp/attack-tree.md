## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Sanitizer Exploitation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_sanitizer_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application by exploiting weaknesses related to the sanitizers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sanitizer Logic/Implementation Flaws (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sanitizer_logicimplementation_flaws__critical_node_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks that directly target the internal workings of the sanitizers or the code they are monitoring. Success here bypasses the intended security benefits of the sanitizers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Memory Corruption Detected by Sanitizer (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_memory_corruption_detected_by_sanitizer__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This path involves providing malicious input that causes memory errors (like buffer overflows or use-after-free) which are detected by the sanitizer. While the sanitizer detects the error, the underlying vulnerability in the application code is what the attacker aims to exploit, potentially leading to code execution before the sanitizer terminates the process or if the vulnerability can be exploited despite the detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Malicious Input to Trigger Heap-Buffer-Overflow (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/provide_malicious_input_to_trigger_heap-buffer-overflow__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: The attacker crafts input that, when processed by the application code, writes data beyond the allocated boundaries of a buffer on the heap.
    *   Potential Impact: This can overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially corrupting data structures, altering program execution flow, or leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Input Exceeding Buffer Boundaries](./attack_tree_paths/craft_input_exceeding_buffer_boundaries.md)

Attack Vector: This is the specific action of creating the malicious input that causes the heap-buffer-overflow. It requires understanding the expected input format and buffer sizes.
    *   Potential Impact: Directly leads to the heap-buffer-overflow, with the potential impacts described above.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Malicious Input to Trigger Use-After-Free (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/provide_malicious_input_to_trigger_use-after-free__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: The attacker manipulates the application's state to deallocate a memory region and then attempts to access that memory again.
    *   Potential Impact: This can lead to unpredictable behavior, information leaks, or, more critically, the ability to execute arbitrary code if the freed memory is reallocated with attacker-controlled data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Deallocation and Subsequent Access](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_deallocation_and_subsequent_access.md)

Attack Vector: This is the specific sequence of actions that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability. It requires understanding the application's memory management and object lifecycle.
    *   Potential Impact: Directly leads to the use-after-free condition, with the potential impacts described above.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Malicious Input to Trigger Stack-Buffer-Overflow (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/provide_malicious_input_to_trigger_stack-buffer-overflow__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Similar to heap-buffer-overflow, but the attacker targets buffers allocated on the stack.
    *   Potential Impact: Stack-based buffer overflows are often easier to exploit for arbitrary code execution due to the predictable nature of the stack and the presence of return addresses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Input Exceeding Stack Buffer Boundaries](./attack_tree_paths/craft_input_exceeding_stack_buffer_boundaries.md)

Attack Vector: This is the specific action of creating the malicious input that causes the stack-buffer-overflow. It requires understanding the function's stack frame and local variable sizes.
    *   Potential Impact: Directly leads to the stack-buffer-overflow, with the potential for overwriting return addresses and gaining control of program execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Sanitizer's Internal Data Structures (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_sanitizer's_internal_data_structures__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vector: This involves identifying and exploiting bugs or weaknesses within the sanitizer's own code or data structures.
    *   Potential Impact: If successful, this can completely undermine the effectiveness of the sanitizer, allowing memory corruption or other vulnerabilities to go undetected. This could lead to a full compromise of the application as the primary defense mechanism is bypassed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Input to Corrupt Sanitizer's State](./attack_tree_paths/craft_input_to_corrupt_sanitizer's_state.md)

Attack Vector: This is the specific action of crafting input that targets the sanitizer's internal data structures, aiming to corrupt its state and disable or manipulate its functionality.
    *   Potential Impact: Directly leads to the corruption of the sanitizer's state, potentially allowing vulnerabilities to be exploited without detection.
