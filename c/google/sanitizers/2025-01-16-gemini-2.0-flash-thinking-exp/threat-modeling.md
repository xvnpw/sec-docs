# Threat Model Analysis for google/sanitizers

## Threat: [Exploiting Performance Overhead for Denial of Service](./threats/exploiting_performance_overhead_for_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Performance Overhead for Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker might intentionally trigger code paths heavily instrumented by sanitizers (e.g., frequent memory allocations/deallocations under ASan, data races under TSan) to significantly slow down the application, making it unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users. They could achieve this by sending specific input or triggering certain application functionalities.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), impacting application availability and potentially leading to financial losses or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:**  All sanitizers contribute to performance overhead, but AddressSanitizer (ASan) and ThreadSanitizer (TSan) are particularly susceptible due to their extensive instrumentation. The specific functions and modules heavily used by the application will be most affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully profile application performance with sanitizers enabled in testing environments to identify performance bottlenecks.
        *   Implement rate limiting and input validation to prevent attackers from easily triggering expensive code paths.
        *   Monitor application performance in production and have alerting mechanisms for unusual slowdowns.
        *   Consider using sanitizers only in development and testing environments, or selectively enabling them for specific modules in production if absolutely necessary and with thorough performance evaluation.

## Threat: [Relying on Sanitizers for Security in Production (False Sense of Security)](./threats/relying_on_sanitizers_for_security_in_production__false_sense_of_security_.md)

*   **Threat:** Relying on Sanitizers for Security in Production (False Sense of Security)
    *   **Description:** Developers or security teams might mistakenly believe that the presence of sanitizers in production provides sufficient protection against memory safety issues or concurrency bugs. Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities that the sanitizers might miss or have limited effectiveness against in a production environment due to performance considerations or configuration.
    *   **Impact:**  Real vulnerabilities remain unaddressed, leading to potential exploitation and security breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** The overall effectiveness and coverage of each sanitizer. This is a conceptual threat related to the *misuse* of the tools rather than a specific component failure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Clearly understand the limitations of each sanitizer and the types of bugs they can and cannot detect.
        *   Employ a layered security approach, including secure coding practices, static analysis, and other security testing methodologies, in addition to using sanitizers in development.
        *   Avoid relying solely on sanitizers for security in production environments.
        *   If sanitizers are used in production, carefully evaluate the performance impact and ensure they are configured optimally without compromising their effectiveness.

## Threat: [Integration Issues Leading to Sanitizer Failure](./threats/integration_issues_leading_to_sanitizer_failure.md)

*   **Threat:** Integration Issues Leading to Sanitizer Failure
    *   **Description:** Incorrect integration of the sanitizers into the build process or runtime environment could lead to them not functioning correctly or being bypassed entirely. An attacker might exploit this by triggering vulnerabilities that the sanitizer would normally detect but is not active.
    *   **Impact:**  Vulnerabilities remain undetected, leading to potential exploitation.
    *   **Affected Component:** The build system integration (compiler flags, linker settings) and the runtime environment setup required for the sanitizers to function correctly.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the official documentation and best practices for integrating the sanitizers into the build process.
        *   Implement thorough testing to verify that the sanitizers are active and functioning as expected in all relevant environments.
        *   Use consistent build processes and configurations across development, testing, and production environments (if sanitizers are used in production).
        *   Monitor for any errors or warnings during the build or runtime that might indicate a problem with sanitizer integration.
