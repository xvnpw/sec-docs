**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit False Negatives**

*   **Description:** Sanitizers, while effective, are not perfect and can sometimes fail to detect memory errors or race conditions. This path focuses on exploiting these "false negatives" to compromise the application.
*   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker carefully crafts input or triggers specific execution sequences designed to cause memory corruption or data races that the sanitizer misses. This could involve subtle timing issues, complex memory allocation patterns, or exploiting edge cases in the sanitizer's logic.

    *   **Critical Node: Trigger Undetected Memory Corruption**
        *   **Description:** The core of this high-risk path. If memory corruption goes undetected by the sanitizer, it opens the door for further exploitation.
        *   **Attack Scenario:** The attacker aims to introduce errors like buffer overflows, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or heap overflows without triggering the sanitizer's detection mechanisms.

            *   **High-Risk Path: Overflow Buffer Leading to Code Execution (Critical Node)**
                *   **Description:** A classic memory corruption vulnerability where data written beyond the allocated buffer overwrites adjacent memory, potentially including return addresses or function pointers, leading to arbitrary code execution.
                *   **Attack Scenario:** The attacker provides input to the application that exceeds the intended buffer size, overwriting critical memory regions to redirect program control to malicious code.

            *   **High-Risk Path: Use-After-Free Leading to Code Execution (Critical Node)**
                *   **Description:** Occurs when memory is freed, but a pointer to that memory is still used. Accessing the freed memory can lead to unexpected behavior, including the potential for arbitrary code execution if the freed memory is reallocated with attacker-controlled data.
                *   **Attack Scenario:** The attacker triggers a sequence of operations where an object is freed, and then a dangling pointer to that object is dereferenced. If the memory has been reallocated, the attacker might be able to control the contents of that memory, leading to code execution.

**High-Risk Path: Bypass or Disable Sanitizer Functionality (Critical Node)**

*   **Description:** This path focuses on directly undermining the protection offered by the sanitizers by disabling or bypassing them entirely. If successful, the application becomes vulnerable to all the memory safety issues the sanitizers are designed to prevent.
*   **Attack Scenario:** The attacker attempts to prevent the sanitizers from running or to execute code in a context where the sanitizers are not active.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Manipulate Configuration to Disable Sanitizers (Critical Node)**
        *   **Description:** Sanitizers are often configured through environment variables or command-line arguments. If these configurations can be modified by an attacker, they can disable the sanitizers.
        *   **Attack Scenario:**
            *   **Modify Environment Variables:** The attacker gains access to the environment where the application is running and modifies environment variables (e.g., `ASAN_OPTIONS`, `MSAN_OPTIONS`, `TSAN_OPTIONS`) to disable the sanitizer or its key features.
            *   **Modify Command-Line Arguments:** If the attacker can influence how the application is launched, they can add or modify command-line arguments that disable the sanitizer. This might occur through exploiting vulnerabilities in process management or deployment scripts.
