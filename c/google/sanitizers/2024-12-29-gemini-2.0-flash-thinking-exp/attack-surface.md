* **Information Disclosure via Detailed Error Messages:**
    * **Description:** Sanitizers, when detecting errors like memory leaks or data races, often output detailed information including file paths, line numbers, function names, and even stack traces.
    * **How Sanitizers Contribute:** The core function of sanitizers is to provide this detailed diagnostic information. While invaluable for debugging, this information can be sensitive.
    * **Example:** An AddressSanitizer report in a production log reveals the exact location of a use-after-free vulnerability in a specific source file and function. An attacker gaining access to these logs can pinpoint the vulnerable code.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can gain deep insights into the application's internal structure, code organization, and potential vulnerabilities, making targeted exploitation easier.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Disable detailed sanitizer output in production environments. Configure sanitizers to only log essential error information or use a separate build configuration without verbose output.
        * Securely manage and restrict access to sanitizer logs. Ensure only authorized personnel can access these logs.
        * Filter sensitive information from sanitizer output before logging in production. Implement mechanisms to redact file paths or other potentially revealing details.

* **Configuration and Deployment Errors Leading to Information Exposure:**
    * **Description:** Incorrect configuration or deployment of sanitizers can inadvertently expose sensitive information.
    * **How Sanitizers Contribute:** The configuration determines where and how sanitizer reports are generated and handled.
    * **Example:** Accidentally enabling verbose AddressSanitizer output in a production environment and directing the output to publicly accessible web server logs.
    * **Impact:**  Exposure of internal application details, potential vulnerability locations, and other sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use separate build configurations for development/testing and production. Ensure sanitizers are configured appropriately for each environment.
        * Implement robust configuration management for sanitizer settings.
        * Thoroughly review deployment procedures to ensure sanitizer output is handled securely.
