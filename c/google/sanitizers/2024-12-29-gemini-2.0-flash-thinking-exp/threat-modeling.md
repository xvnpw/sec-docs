*   **Threat:** Exploitable Performance Degradation (Denial of Service)
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a high volume of requests or crafted inputs that specifically trigger the sanitizer's overhead. This exploits the inherent performance cost of runtime checks performed by the sanitizers (e.g., AddressSanitizer's memory access checks, MemorySanitizer's uninitialized memory checks), leading to resource exhaustion and making the application unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application unavailability, financial loss, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Runtime instrumentation of all enabled sanitizers (e.g., AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure sanitizers are strictly disabled in production builds.
        *   Implement robust rate limiting and input validation to mitigate the impact of potentially expensive operations.
        *   Monitor application performance and resource usage to detect unexpected overhead.
        *   Conduct performance testing with and without sanitizers to understand the performance impact.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Sanitizer Output in Logs/Errors
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to error logs or debugging information that contains detailed output directly from the sanitizers. This output, generated by components like AddressSanitizer or MemorySanitizer, can reveal internal memory addresses, stack traces, and potentially even snippets of code related to memory corruption or undefined behavior, aiding in understanding the application's structure and identifying vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive internal information, facilitating further attacks, reverse engineering of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Error reporting mechanisms directly interacting with sanitizer output (e.g., ASan's error reporting, MSan's error reporting).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control access to error logs and debugging information.
        *   Implement secure logging practices that filter out detailed sanitizer output in production environments.
        *   Avoid enabling sanitizers in production where error logs might be accessible to unauthorized parties.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting False Negatives Leading to Undetected Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a memory safety or concurrency vulnerability that is not detected by the enabled sanitizers. The attacker relies on the inherent limitations of the sanitizer's detection capabilities (e.g., AddressSanitizer might miss certain types of out-of-bounds writes, ThreadSanitizer might miss subtle race conditions) to successfully exploit the flaw.
    *   **Impact:** Full range of application vulnerabilities, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** The detection logic within specific sanitizers (e.g., AddressSanitizer's heap and stack overflow detection, ThreadSanitizer's data race detection).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Do not rely solely on sanitizers for vulnerability detection.
        *   Combine sanitizers with other security testing methodologies like static analysis, fuzzing, and manual code reviews to cover a broader range of potential issues.
        *   Stay updated with the latest research on sanitizer limitations and bypass techniques.

*   **Threat:** Build System Compromise via Malicious Sanitizer Dependencies
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the build system or dependency management mechanism to introduce a malicious or backdoored version of the sanitizer library (e.g., a modified version of the AddressSanitizer runtime). This malicious sanitizer could then inject vulnerabilities into the built application by altering memory safety checks or exfiltrate sensitive information during the build process by monitoring memory access patterns.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised application integrity, introduction of vulnerabilities that bypass normal sanitizer checks, potential data breaches during the build process.
    *   **Affected Component:** The sanitizer library itself (e.g., libclang_rt.asan, libclang_rt.msan) and its integration into the build process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong security measures for the build system and dependency management infrastructure.
        *   Use checksum verification and signing for sanitizer dependencies.
        *   Regularly audit build dependencies for known vulnerabilities and unexpected changes.

*   **Threat:** Accidental Inclusion of Sanitizers in Production Builds
    *   **Description:** Due to misconfiguration or errors in the build process, the application is deployed to production with the full sanitizer runtime libraries (e.g., AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) unintentionally enabled. This directly exposes the application to the performance degradation risks inherent in the sanitizer's runtime checks and the potential for information disclosure through sanitizer error reporting.
    *   **Impact:** Performance degradation leading to denial of service, potential information disclosure through error logs.
    *   **Affected Component:** Build scripts, build configuration files that control the linking and inclusion of sanitizer runtime libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement clear and enforced build configurations that explicitly disable sanitizers for production builds.
        *   Automate the build and deployment process to reduce manual errors.
        *   Implement checks in the deployment pipeline to verify that sanitizer runtime libraries are not included in production builds.
        *   Use separate build profiles for development/testing and production.
