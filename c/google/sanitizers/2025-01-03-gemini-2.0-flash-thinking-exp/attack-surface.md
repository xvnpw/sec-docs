# Attack Surface Analysis for google/sanitizers

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Sanitizer Output](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_sanitizer_output.md)

* **Description:** Sanitizers, when triggered, output detailed diagnostic information including memory addresses, stack traces, and potentially source code paths. If this output is exposed to unauthorized parties, it can reveal sensitive internal details of the application.
    * **How Sanitizers Contribute:** Sanitizers are the source of this detailed diagnostic output. Their purpose is to provide developers with information for debugging, but this information can be valuable to attackers.
    * **Example:** A production application crashes due to a memory error detected by AddressSanitizer. The error log, accessible via a public web interface or insufficiently protected file system, contains the memory address of the vulnerability and a stack trace revealing the vulnerable function.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can gain insights into the application's memory layout, identify vulnerable code sections, and understand the call flow leading to errors, facilitating the development of targeted exploits.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure error logs containing sanitizer output are strictly controlled and only accessible to authorized personnel.
        * Implement mechanisms to filter or redact sensitive information (memory addresses, file paths) from sanitizer output in production environments.
        * Avoid displaying raw sanitizer output directly to users or in publicly accessible locations.
        * Utilize dedicated error reporting systems that allow for secure and controlled access to diagnostic information.

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Sanitizer Checks](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_sanitizer_checks.md)

* **Description:** While robust, sanitizers are not infallible. Attackers might discover specific coding patterns or edge cases that allow them to trigger memory corruption or undefined behavior without the sanitizer detecting it.
    * **How Sanitizers Contribute:** The complexity of the sanitizer's logic can sometimes lead to blind spots or situations where vulnerabilities are not detected.
    * **Example:** An attacker identifies a specific sequence of memory operations that, due to the internal logic of AddressSanitizer, is not flagged as a heap-use-after-free, even though it is a genuine vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can exploit memory corruption or undefined behavior vulnerabilities, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or data breaches, despite the presence of sanitizers.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Employ multiple layers of security, including static analysis tools and manual code reviews, in addition to sanitizers.
        * Stay updated with the latest versions of the sanitizer libraries, as updates often include fixes for known bypasses.
        * Conduct thorough penetration testing and fuzzing to identify potential bypasses in the application's specific context.
        * Educate developers on common pitfalls and coding patterns that might lead to sanitizer bypasses.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities within Sanitizer Libraries](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_within_sanitizer_libraries.md)

* **Description:** Like any software, the sanitizer libraries themselves might contain vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could compromise the application.
    * **How Sanitizers Contribute:** The inclusion of sanitizer libraries introduces a new dependency that could have its own security flaws.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in the AddressSanitizer library that allows an attacker to trigger a buffer overflow within the sanitizer's internal data structures, leading to arbitrary code execution within the application's process.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or remote code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep the sanitizer libraries updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to the specific sanitizer versions being used.
        * Consider using a dependency management system that includes security scanning capabilities to identify vulnerable dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks on Sanitizer Distribution](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_on_sanitizer_distribution.md)

* **Description:** If the distribution mechanism for the sanitizer libraries is compromised, attackers could inject malicious versions of the sanitizers into the application's build process.
    * **How Sanitizers Contribute:** The reliance on external libraries for sanitization introduces a dependency on the security of the distribution channel.
    * **Example:** An attacker compromises the repository or CDN from which the sanitizer libraries are downloaded during the build process, replacing the legitimate libraries with a modified version that disables security checks or introduces backdoors.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can gain complete control over the application's execution, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or remote code execution. The application might appear secure due to the presence of the compromised sanitizer.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use trusted and verified sources for obtaining sanitizer libraries.
        * Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksum verification) for downloaded sanitizer libraries.
        * Employ secure build pipelines and artifact repositories with access controls.
        * Regularly audit the dependencies included in the application's build process.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Configuration or Deployment](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_configuration_or_deployment.md)

* **Description:** Misconfiguring sanitizers or deploying applications with sanitizers enabled in production without proper error handling can create security risks.
    * **How Sanitizers Contribute:** Improper usage of sanitizers can expose sensitive information.
    * **Example:** AddressSanitizer is enabled in a production environment, but the error reporting mechanism is configured to write detailed error logs to a publicly accessible directory.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring error reporting mechanisms for sanitizers in production.
        * Clearly document the intended usage and configuration of sanitizers for all environments.
        * Implement automated checks to verify the correct configuration of sanitizers in deployed applications.
