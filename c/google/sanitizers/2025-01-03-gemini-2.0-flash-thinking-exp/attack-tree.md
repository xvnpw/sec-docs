## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Sanitizer Weakness](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_sanitizer_weakness.md)

* **CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Application via Sanitizer Weakness:**
    * This is the root goal and inherently critical. Success means the attacker has achieved their objective by exploiting weaknesses related to the sanitizers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Sanitizer Detection](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_sanitizer_detection.md)

* **CRITICAL NODE: Bypass Sanitizer Detection:**
    * If an attacker can bypass the sanitizers, the application loses its primary runtime defense against memory errors and other issues. This opens the door for exploiting underlying vulnerabilities that the sanitizers are designed to catch.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Incomplete Coverage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_incomplete_coverage.md)

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Incomplete Coverage:**
    * **Attack Vector: Trigger Errors in Uninstrumented Code (e.g., external libraries not compiled with sanitizers):**
        - **Likelihood:** Medium
        - **Impact:** High
        - **Effort:** Low
        - **Skill Level:** Medium
        - **Detection Difficulty:** Low
        - **Description:** Attackers can target vulnerabilities within external libraries or code sections that were not compiled with sanitizers. Since the sanitizer isn't monitoring these areas, memory errors and other issues can occur undetected and be exploited. This is a common scenario, especially in applications that rely on numerous third-party dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses.md)

* **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Configuration Weaknesses:**
    * This node is critical because it represents a common and often easily exploitable weakness. Incorrect configurations can directly undermine the effectiveness of the sanitizers.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Configuration Weaknesses:**
    * **Attack Vector: Disable Sanitizers in Production (Accidentally or Intentionally):**
        - **Likelihood:** Low (Accidental), Medium (Intentional Insider)
        - **Impact:** High
        - **Effort:** Low
        - **Skill Level:** Low (Accidental), Medium (Intentional)
        - **Detection Difficulty:** Low (if monitored)
        - **Description:** Disabling sanitizers in a production environment, whether accidental due to misconfiguration or intentional by a malicious insider, completely removes the runtime protection offered by the sanitizers. This immediately exposes the application to any underlying memory safety or concurrency issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Data Races to Introduce Unintended State Changes](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_data_races_to_introduce_unintended_state_changes.md)

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Trigger Data Races to Introduce Unintended State Changes:**
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium/High
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (TSan might detect, but exploitation could be subtle)
    * **Description:** While ThreadSanitizer (TSan) is designed to detect data races, the occurrence of a data race itself can lead to unpredictable and potentially exploitable application states. Attackers can manipulate timing or concurrency to reliably trigger data races in critical sections, leading to data corruption or unexpected behavior that can be further exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Interfere with Sanitizer Operation](./attack_tree_paths/interfere_with_sanitizer_operation.md)

* **CRITICAL NODE: Interfere with Sanitizer Operation:**
    * This node is critical because successfully interfering with the sanitizer's operation effectively neutralizes its protective capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Prevent Sanitizer Initialization or Loading](./attack_tree_paths/prevent_sanitizer_initialization_or_loading.md)

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Prevent Sanitizer Initialization or Loading:**
    * **Attack Vector: Tamper with Environment Variables or System Configuration:**
        - **Likelihood:** Low (External), Medium (Internal)
        - **Impact:** High
        - **Effort:** Medium
        - **Skill Level:** Medium
        - **Detection Difficulty:** Low (if monitored)
        - **Description:** Attackers, especially those with some level of access to the system, can modify environment variables or system configuration settings to prevent the sanitizer libraries from being loaded or initialized when the application starts. This leaves the application running without the intended runtime protections.
