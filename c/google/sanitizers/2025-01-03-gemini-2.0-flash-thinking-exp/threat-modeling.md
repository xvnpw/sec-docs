# Threat Model Analysis for google/sanitizers

## Threat: [Accidental Deployment with Sanitizers Enabled](./threats/accidental_deployment_with_sanitizers_enabled.md)

**Description:** An attacker doesn't directly interact with the sanitizers, but the development team mistakenly deploys a production build with sanitizers (like ASan, MSan, TSan, or UBSan) still active. This significantly slows down the application and increases resource consumption. An attacker could exploit the severely degraded performance to launch denial-of-service attacks more effectively, as the application will be more susceptible to resource exhaustion. They might also be able to glean internal application details from verbose sanitizer output if it's not properly handled.

**Impact:** Severe performance degradation, potential application unavailability, increased attack surface for denial-of-service, potential exposure of internal application details through sanitizer output.

**Affected Component:** Entire application runtime, specifically the sanitizer instrumentation injected into the compiled code.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust build pipelines that strictly separate debug/development builds from release/production builds.
* Utilize compiler flags and build system configurations to ensure sanitizers are only enabled for development and testing.
* Implement automated checks in the deployment process to verify that sanitizer libraries are not present in production builds.
* Educate developers on the risks of deploying with sanitizers enabled.

## Threat: [Information Leakage via Sanitizer Error Reports](./threats/information_leakage_via_sanitizer_error_reports.md)

**Description:** When a sanitizer detects an error (e.g., memory leak, use-after-free), it generates a detailed report that might include memory addresses, stack traces, and potentially even snippets of data. If these reports are logged to insecure locations or exposed through error pages in production (due to the accidental deployment mentioned above or misconfigured logging), an attacker could gain valuable insights into the application's memory layout, internal workings, and potential vulnerabilities. This information can be used to craft more targeted attacks.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive memory addresses, code structure, and potentially data values, facilitating reverse engineering and vulnerability exploitation.

**Affected Component:** Error reporting mechanisms of ASan, MSan, TSan, and UBSan.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure sanitizer error reports are only logged to secure, internal logging systems during development and testing.
* Never expose raw sanitizer error reports in production environments.
* Implement mechanisms to sanitize or redact sensitive information from error logs even in development environments where appropriate.
* Regularly review logging configurations to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.

## Threat: [Exploiting Debug Symbols in Production Builds](./threats/exploiting_debug_symbols_in_production_builds.md)

**Description:** Sanitizers often rely on debug symbols to provide detailed error information. If production builds inadvertently include debug symbols, an attacker who gains access to the application binaries (e.g., through a data breach or by analyzing publicly accessible deployments) can use these symbols to reverse engineer the code more easily, understand memory layouts, and identify potential vulnerabilities that sanitizers might have flagged during development.

**Impact:** Simplified reverse engineering of the application, aiding in the discovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Build process and compiler/linker configurations (directly impacting the usefulness of sanitizer output during development).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure build systems to explicitly strip debug symbols from production builds.
* Implement automated checks to verify the absence of debug symbols in final production artifacts.
* Securely manage and control access to build artifacts and deployment environments.
