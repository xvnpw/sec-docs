# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for alibaba/tengine

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Module Auditing](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_module_auditing.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Rigorous Module Auditing

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inventory:** Create a comprehensive list of all Tengine *modules* used, including version numbers and source (official, third-party, custom).
    2.  **Source Code Review:** For each *Tengine module*, obtain the source code.  A dedicated security team or experienced developers familiar with C/C++ and web server security should perform a manual code review.  Focus on:
        *   **Input Validation:**  Ensure all inputs from requests (headers, body, URI) processed by the *module* are properly validated and sanitized.
        *   **Memory Management:**  Check for potential buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, and memory leaks within the *module's* code.  Look for unsafe functions like `strcpy`, `strcat`, `sprintf` (without proper bounds checking).
        *   **Error Handling:**  Verify that errors within the *module* are handled gracefully and do not reveal sensitive information or lead to unexpected states.
        *   **Authentication/Authorization:** If the *module* handles authentication or authorization, ensure it follows secure practices and avoids common vulnerabilities (e.g., weak cryptography, improper session management).
    3.  **Static Analysis:** Use automated static analysis tools (e.g., Clang Static Analyzer, Coverity, SonarQube) to scan the *module* source code for potential vulnerabilities.  Configure the tools with rules specific to C/C++ and web server security.  Address all reported issues.
    4.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):** Employ fuzzing tools (e.g., AFL++, libFuzzer) to send malformed or unexpected inputs to the *module* and observe its behavior.  This helps identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by static analysis or manual code review.  Create custom fuzzing harnesses that target the *module's* specific API and input handling.
    5.  **Documentation:** Document all findings, including identified vulnerabilities, remediation steps, and any remaining risks related to each *module*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Buffer Overflows (Severity: Critical):**  Exploitable buffer overflows within a *Tengine module* can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: High to Critical):**  Flaws in the *module's* logic can lead to unexpected behavior, bypass of security controls, or denial-of-service.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium to High):**  *Modules* might inadvertently leak sensitive information.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Severity: High):**  Vulnerabilities in *modules* can be exploited to cause Tengine to crash.
    *   **Improper Handling of HTTP Requests (Severity: High):** Vulnerabilities in *modules* can lead to incorrect processing of HTTP requests.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Buffer Overflows:** Risk reduction: High (if vulnerabilities are found and fixed).
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduction: Medium to High (depending on the nature of the errors).
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: Medium.
    *   **Denial-of-Service:** Risk reduction: Medium to High.
    *   **Improper Handling of HTTP Requests:** Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic static analysis is performed on custom modules using SonarQube.
    *   No fuzzing is currently implemented.
    *   No formal code review process is in place for third-party modules.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive code reviews for all modules (especially third-party).
    *   Dynamic analysis (fuzzing) for all modules.
    *   Formal documentation of the auditing process and findings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Module Minimization](./mitigation_strategies/module_minimization.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Module Minimization

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Essential Modules:** Analyze the application's functionality and determine the *absolute minimum* set of Tengine *modules* required.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Modules:**  In the Tengine configuration (`nginx.conf`), comment out or remove the directives that load any *modules* not identified as essential.
    3.  **Rebuild (if necessary):** If Tengine was compiled with statically linked *modules*, you may need to recompile Tengine with only the required *modules* enabled.  This provides the strongest form of minimization.
    4.  **Regular Review:**  Periodically (e.g., every 3-6 months) review the enabled *modules* and re-evaluate their necessity.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All vulnerabilities in disabled modules (Severity: Varies):** By disabling a *Tengine module*, you completely eliminate the risk of any vulnerabilities within that *module* being exploited.
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface (Severity: General improvement):**  Minimizing the number of *modules* reduces the overall attack surface.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All vulnerabilities in disabled modules:** Risk reduction: Complete (for those specific modules).
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface:** Risk reduction: Medium (general improvement in security posture).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A basic list of required modules was created during initial setup.
    *   Unused modules were commented out in the `nginx.conf` file.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Regular, scheduled reviews of enabled modules.
    *   Consideration of recompiling Tengine with only essential modules (for statically linked builds).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Hardening (Tengine-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_hardening__tengine-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configuration Hardening (Tengine-Specific)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Official Documentation:** Thoroughly review the official *Tengine* documentation for all configuration directives used.  Pay special attention to security-related directives and *Tengine-specific* options.
    2.  **Least Privilege:** Ensure *Tengine* runs as a non-root user with minimal permissions.
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  Disable any *Tengine* features or options that are not required (e.g., specific HTTP methods, server tokens).
    4.  **Request Limits:** Configure limits on request size, body size, number of connections, and request rate using *Tengine's* `limit_req` and `limit_conn` modules (or equivalent *Tengine-specific* features).
    5.  **Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts for client connections, request processing, and upstream server communication using *Tengine's* configuration options.
    6.  **Header Handling:**  Configure *Tengine* to properly handle HTTP headers, including security-related headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP, X-XSS-Protection).
    7.  **Error Pages:** Customize error pages served by *Tengine* to avoid revealing sensitive information.
    8.  **Regular Audits:**  Periodically review the *Tengine* configuration.
    9.  **Version Control:** Use Git to manage *Tengine* configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Severity: High):**  Request limits and timeouts configured within *Tengine* help prevent attacks.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):**  CSP and `X-XSS-Protection` headers set via *Tengine* help mitigate XSS.
    *   **Clickjacking (Severity: Medium):**  The `X-Frame-Options` header set via *Tengine* prevents clickjacking.
    *   **MIME-Sniffing (Severity: Medium):**  The `X-Content-Type-Options` header set via *Tengine* prevents MIME-sniffing.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):**  Custom error pages and disabling server tokens in *Tengine* prevent information leakage.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Severity: High):** HSTS configured in *Tengine* helps prevent MitM attacks.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Severity: High):** Incorrect *Tengine* configuration can lead to vulnerabilities.
