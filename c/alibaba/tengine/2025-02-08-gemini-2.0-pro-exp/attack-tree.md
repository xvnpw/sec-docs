## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Tengine Core (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_tengine_core__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path focuses on exploiting fundamental vulnerabilities within the core code of the Tengine web server itself. These are often the most difficult to find and exploit, but they offer the highest reward (RCE).

   *   **Buffer Overflow (High-Risk Path):**
      *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities where an attacker can send more data than a buffer can hold, overwriting adjacent memory.
      *   **[[Stack-based Buffer Overflow]] (Critical Node):**
          *   **Description:** Overwriting the return address on the stack to redirect execution to attacker-controlled code (shellcode).
          *   **Likelihood:** Low
          *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
          *   **Effort:** High
          *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
          *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
      *   **[[Heap-based Buffer Overflow]] (Critical Node):**
          *   **Description:** Overwriting function pointers or other critical data structures on the heap, leading to indirect control of program execution.
          *   **Likelihood:** Low
          *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
          *   **Effort:** High
          *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
          *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

   *   **Logic Errors (High-Risk Path):**
      * **Description:** Exploiting flaws in program logic.
      *   **[[Use-After-Free]] (Critical Node):**
          *   **Description:** Accessing memory after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes, and potentially RCE.
          *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
          *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
          *   **Effort:** High
          *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
          *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
      *   **[[Double Free]] (Critical Node):**
          *   **Description:** Freeing the same memory region twice, corrupting the heap and potentially leading to RCE.
          *   **Likelihood:** Low
          *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
          *   **Effort:** High
          *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
          *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Tengine Modules (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_tengine_modules__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path targets vulnerabilities within Tengine's loadable modules. Modules extend Tengine's functionality, but they can also introduce new security risks.

   *   **[[Dynamic Module Loading (Loading Vuln. .so)]] (Critical Node):**
      *   **Description:** An attacker uploads or replaces a legitimate module with a malicious one, gaining RCE.
      *   **Likelihood:** Low
      *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
      *   **Effort:** High
      *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
      *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations Specific to Tengine (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_specific_to_tengine__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path leverages common misconfigurations in Tengine deployments.  It's considered high-risk due to the *combined* likelihood of various misconfigurations and the relative ease of exploitation.  While a single misconfiguration might not *always* lead to RCE, the cumulative effect can be devastating.
    *   **Specific Examples (Not exhaustive, but illustrative of the high-risk nature):**
        *   **Insecure Defaults:**  Using default configurations without changing security-sensitive settings.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Variable (Low to High)
            *   Effort: Very Low
            *   Skill Level: Novice
            *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
        *   **Weak Crypto:**  Using outdated or weak ciphers and TLS versions.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High (Traffic Interception)
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate
            *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
        *   **Missing Security Headers:**  Not setting appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`).
            *   Likelihood: Medium to High
            *   Impact: Variable (Low to High)
            *   Effort: Low to Medium
            *   Skill Level: Novice to Intermediate
            *   Detection Difficulty: Easy to Medium
