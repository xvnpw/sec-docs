# Attack Surface Analysis for alibaba/tengine

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Modules](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Tengine's modular architecture allows enabling/disabling features via modules. Incorrectly configured or unnecessary modules expand the attack surface *specific to Tengine's implementation*.
    *   **Tengine Contribution:** Tengine's modularity is the direct contributor.  The risk stems from how Tengine handles module loading, configuration parsing, and inter-module communication.
    *   **Example:** A custom-compiled Tengine module (or a third-party module not properly vetted) contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be triggered by a specially crafted HTTP request. This is distinct from a general web application vulnerability because it's within Tengine's module code.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to files, potential *remote code execution within the Tengine process*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Unused Modules:**  Only enable essential Tengine modules.  This directly reduces the Tengine-specific attack surface.
        *   **Strict Module Configuration Audits:**  Focus on Tengine-specific directives within each module's configuration.  Understand the security implications of each setting.
        *   **Secure Custom Module Development:** If building custom modules, follow rigorous secure coding practices *specifically for Tengine module development*. Use memory-safe languages if possible.
        *   **Third-Party Module Vetting:**  Thoroughly vet any third-party Tengine modules before deploying them.  Examine the source code if available.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/http2_and_http3_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities specific to Tengine's implementation of the HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 protocols.
    *   **Tengine Contribution:** Tengine's *specific implementation* of these protocols is the attack surface.  This is not a general web server issue; it's about how Tengine handles the complexities of these protocols.
    *   **Example:** A flaw in Tengine's handling of HTTP/2 stream multiplexing allows an attacker to cause a denial-of-service by exhausting server resources dedicated to managing HTTP/2 connections. This is specific to Tengine's connection management logic.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, *potential Tengine process crashes*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prioritize Tengine Updates:**  Focus on updates specifically addressing HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 vulnerabilities in Tengine's changelog.
        *   **Tengine-Specific Configuration:**  Use Tengine's directives to limit HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 resource usage (e.g., `http2_max_concurrent_streams`, `http3_max_concurrent_streams`). These are Tengine-specific controls.
        *   **Disable if Unnecessary:** If these protocols are not *essential*, disable them in Tengine's configuration to eliminate this Tengine-specific attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Lua Scripting (ngx_lua) Risks (When used within Tengine)](./attack_surfaces/lua_scripting__ngx_lua__risks__when_used_within_tengine_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within Lua scripts *embedded within Tengine's configuration* using the `ngx_lua` module.
    *   **Tengine Contribution:** The `ngx_lua` module, *a part of Tengine*, provides the mechanism for embedding and executing Lua code.  The risk is directly tied to Tengine's integration with Lua.
    *   **Example:** A Lua script within Tengine, intended to modify response headers, contains a code injection vulnerability allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary Lua code *within the Tengine process*.
    *   **Impact:** Code injection *within Tengine*, data breaches, *Tengine process compromise*, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Lua Coding for Tengine:**  Apply secure coding practices *specifically within the context of Tengine's Lua environment*. Understand how Lua interacts with Tengine's request processing.
        *   **Tengine-Specific Sandboxing (if available):** Explore any Tengine-provided mechanisms for sandboxing or restricting Lua script execution.
        *   **Minimize Lua Usage:**  If possible, reduce the reliance on complex Lua scripting within Tengine to minimize this Tengine-specific attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Tengine's Codebase](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_tengine's_codebase.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known or unknown (zero-day) vulnerabilities in Tengine's *core code or its built-in modules*.
    *   **Tengine Contribution:** This is *entirely* about Tengine's code.  The vulnerability exists within Tengine itself.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in Tengine's handling of HTTP request headers allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code *within the Tengine worker process*.
    *   **Impact:** *Complete Tengine server compromise*, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediate Tengine Updates:**  Prioritize applying security updates for Tengine *as soon as they are released*. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Monitor Tengine Security Advisories:**  Actively monitor Tengine's official security channels for vulnerability announcements.
        *   **Consider Tengine-Specific Hardening Guides:** Look for hardening guides specifically tailored to Tengine, focusing on mitigating potential code-level vulnerabilities.
