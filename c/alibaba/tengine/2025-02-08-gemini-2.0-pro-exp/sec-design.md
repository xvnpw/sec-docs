Okay, let's create a design document for the Tengine project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Tengine is a web server originated by Taobao, the large online marketplace of Alibaba Group.  It's based on Nginx and has been enhanced with many advanced features.  Given its origin and purpose, the following business priorities and goals are likely:

*   Priorities:
    *   High Availability and Reliability:  Tengine likely powers critical e-commerce infrastructure, so uptime and resilience to failures are paramount.  Downtime directly translates to lost revenue and customer dissatisfaction.
    *   Performance and Scalability:  The system must handle massive traffic loads, especially during peak shopping periods (e.g., Singles' Day).  Low latency and high throughput are essential.
    *   Security:  Protecting user data, financial transactions, and the integrity of the platform is crucial.  This includes preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks.
    *   Maintainability and Extensibility:  The system needs to be easily maintained and updated to adapt to changing business needs and security threats.  The ability to add new features and modules is important.
    *   Operational Efficiency:  Minimizing operational costs (e.g., server resources, energy consumption) while maintaining performance is a key consideration.

*   Goals:
    *   Provide a robust and performant web server platform for Alibaba's e-commerce services.
    *   Enhance Nginx with features tailored to Alibaba's specific needs.
    *   Offer a stable and secure platform for web applications.
    *   Support a large number of concurrent connections and high traffic volumes.

*   Business Risks:
    *   Service Outages:  Any disruption to Tengine's service can significantly impact Alibaba's revenue and reputation.
    *   Data Breaches:  Exposure of sensitive user data (e.g., personal information, credit card details) would have severe legal and financial consequences.
    *   Performance Degradation:  Slow response times or inability to handle peak loads can lead to lost sales and customer churn.
    *   Compromised System Integrity:  Attackers gaining control of Tengine servers could manipulate website content, steal data, or launch further attacks.
    *   Vulnerability Exploitation:  Unpatched vulnerabilities in Tengine or its dependencies could be exploited by attackers.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Based on the GitHub repository and general knowledge of web servers, the following security controls and accepted risks are likely present:

*   security control:  Inherits Nginx's security features: Tengine benefits from the security features built into Nginx, such as its event-driven architecture, which is less vulnerable to certain types of attacks compared to traditional thread-based servers. Described in Nginx documentation.
*   security control:  Input validation:  Like Nginx, Tengine likely performs some level of input validation to prevent common web attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. Described in Nginx documentation and Tengine specific modules.
*   security control:  Access controls:  Configuration options to restrict access to specific resources and IP addresses. Described in Nginx documentation and Tengine specific modules.
*   security control:  SSL/TLS support:  Capability to encrypt communication between the server and clients, protecting sensitive data in transit. Described in Nginx documentation and Tengine specific modules.
*   security control:  Module system:  The ability to extend functionality through modules allows for the addition of custom security features. Described in Tengine documentation.
*   accepted risk:  Complexity of configuration:  Like Nginx, Tengine's configuration can be complex, increasing the risk of misconfiguration that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk:  Dependency on third-party modules:  The use of third-party modules introduces the risk of vulnerabilities in those modules.
*   accepted risk:  Potential for zero-day vulnerabilities:  As with any software, there's always the risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

*   Recommended Security Controls:

    *   Web Application Firewall (WAF):  Implement a WAF (either as a Tengine module or a separate component) to provide more robust protection against web application attacks.
    *   Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:  Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.
    *   Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):  Deploy an IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic and detect/prevent malicious activity.
    *   Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Integrate DAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in the running application.
    *   Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP): Consider using RASP technology to provide runtime protection against attacks.
    *   Supply Chain Security: Implement robust measures to secure the software supply chain, including verifying the integrity of third-party modules and dependencies.

*   Security Requirements:

    *   Authentication:
        *   Strong authentication mechanisms for administrative access to Tengine configuration.
        *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access.
        *   Secure handling of session tokens and cookies.

    *   Authorization:
        *   Fine-grained access control to restrict access to resources based on user roles and permissions.
        *   Principle of least privilege: Users and processes should only have the minimum necessary access rights.

    *   Input Validation:
        *   Strict input validation for all user-supplied data to prevent common web attacks (XSS, SQL injection, etc.).
        *   Output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

    *   Cryptography:
        *   Use of strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3).
        *   Secure key management practices.
        *   Protection of sensitive data at rest using encryption.
        *   Regular review and update of cryptographic configurations.

## BUILD

The Tengine build process likely involves the following steps:

1.  **Development:** Developers write code and configuration files.
2.  **Source Code Management:** Code is stored in a version control system (e.g., Git).
3.  **Build Automation:** A build system (e.g., Make, CMake) compiles the source code and creates build artifacts.
4.  **Testing:** Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) are run to verify the code's functionality.
5.  **Packaging:** The build artifacts are packaged into a distributable format (e.g., a tarball, a Docker image).
6.  **Deployment:** The package is deployed to the target environment.
