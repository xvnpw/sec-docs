# Deep Analysis: Tengine HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Attack Surface

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, assess, and propose mitigation strategies for vulnerabilities related to Tengine's specific implementation of the HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 protocols.  This goes beyond general HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 concerns and focuses on how Tengine *itself* handles these protocols.  We aim to minimize the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and potential Tengine process crashes stemming from these vulnerabilities.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Tengine's Implementation:**  Vulnerabilities arising from Tengine's specific code and configuration options related to HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.  Generic HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 vulnerabilities are only relevant if Tengine's implementation exacerbates them or fails to implement standard mitigations.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attacks that aim to make the Tengine server unavailable to legitimate users by exploiting HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 weaknesses.
*   **Tengine Process Crashes:**  Vulnerabilities that could lead to the termination of Tengine worker processes due to malformed requests or protocol-specific exploits.
*   **Configuration Directives:** Tengine-specific configuration settings that influence HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 behavior and can be used for mitigation.
* **Tengine version:** Analysis is relevant to all Tengine versions, but specific vulnerabilities and mitigations may be version-dependent. We will assume the latest stable version unless otherwise noted.

This analysis *excludes* the following:

*   Vulnerabilities in underlying libraries (e.g., OpenSSL) unless Tengine's usage of those libraries introduces a new vulnerability.
*   Attacks targeting application logic *above* the HTTP protocol layer (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
*   Network-level attacks (e.g., SYN floods) that are not specific to Tengine's HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 implementation.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review (where possible):**  Examine the publicly available Tengine source code (from the GitHub repository) related to HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 processing.  This includes modules responsible for connection management, stream handling, header parsing, and request routing.  Focus will be on areas known to be complex or prone to errors in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 implementations.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Thoroughly review Tengine's documentation for all configuration directives related to HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.  Identify directives that can be used to limit resource consumption, control protocol behavior, or disable features.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Investigate known HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) and assess their applicability to Tengine.  Determine if Tengine's implementation is susceptible to these vulnerabilities or if it includes specific mitigations.
4.  **Fuzzing (Conceptual):** Describe how fuzzing techniques could be applied to Tengine's HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 implementation to discover new vulnerabilities.  This will include identifying potential input vectors and fuzzing targets.  (Actual fuzzing is outside the scope of this document, but the methodology is important.)
5.  **Threat Modeling:**  Develop threat models to identify potential attack scenarios and their impact on Tengine.  This will help prioritize mitigation efforts.
6.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  For each identified vulnerability or risk, propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies, prioritizing Tengine-specific configurations and updates.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

This section details the specific attack vectors and vulnerabilities related to Tengine's HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 implementation.

### 4.1. HTTP/2 Specific Vulnerabilities

*   **4.1.1. Stream Multiplexing Issues:**

    *   **Vulnerability:**  Flaws in Tengine's handling of HTTP/2 stream multiplexing, particularly in its connection management logic.  This could involve errors in stream ID allocation, stream prioritization, or resource allocation per stream.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker could send a large number of concurrent HTTP/2 streams, potentially with malformed headers or data, to exhaust server resources (CPU, memory) dedicated to managing these streams.  This could lead to a denial-of-service.  Specific attacks include:
        *   **Rapid Reset Attacks:**  Continuously opening and resetting streams to consume resources without completing requests.
        *   **Stream Prioritization Manipulation:**  Exploiting weaknesses in Tengine's stream prioritization to starve legitimate requests.
        *   **HPACK Bomb:** Sending highly compressed headers that expand to consume excessive memory.
    *   **Tengine-Specific Concerns:**  The efficiency and correctness of Tengine's stream management algorithms are critical.  Any inefficiencies or bugs in these algorithms could be exploited.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **`http2_max_concurrent_streams`:**  Strictly limit the maximum number of concurrent streams per connection.  This is a *crucial* Tengine-specific setting.  Start with a low value (e.g., 100) and monitor performance.
        *   **`http2_max_requests`:** Limit the total number of requests that can be served over a single HTTP/2 connection.
        *   **`http2_recv_buffer_size` and `http2_send_buffer_size`:** Carefully tune these buffer sizes to prevent excessive memory allocation.
        *   **Monitor Tengine's Error Logs:**  Look for errors related to HTTP/2 stream handling, which could indicate an attack or a configuration issue.
        *   **Regularly update Tengine:** Prioritize updates that mention HTTP/2 fixes in the changelog.

*   **4.1.2. HPACK Implementation Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **Vulnerability:**  Tengine's HPACK (header compression for HTTP/2) implementation might be vulnerable to decompression bombs or other attacks that exploit weaknesses in the compression/decompression logic.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker sends crafted HTTP/2 headers that, when decompressed, consume excessive memory or CPU resources, leading to a DoS.
    *   **Tengine-Specific Concerns:**  The security and efficiency of Tengine's HPACK implementation are paramount.  Any vulnerabilities in this area could be easily exploited.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **`http2_max_header_size`:**  Limit the maximum size of HTTP/2 headers to prevent excessively large headers from being processed. This is a Tengine-specific setting.
        *   **Monitor Memory Usage:**  Closely monitor Tengine's memory usage to detect potential HPACK bomb attacks.
        *   **Tengine Updates:**  Prioritize updates that address HPACK vulnerabilities.

*   **4.1.3. Flow Control Issues:**

    *   **Vulnerability:**  Errors in Tengine's implementation of HTTP/2 flow control could lead to resource exhaustion or deadlocks.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker could manipulate flow control windows to prevent the server from sending or receiving data, leading to a DoS.
    *   **Tengine-Specific Concerns:**  The correctness of Tengine's flow control implementation is crucial for preventing resource exhaustion and ensuring fair resource allocation.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **`http2_initial_window_size` and `http2_max_frame_size`:**  Configure these settings appropriately to control the flow of data.
        *   **Monitor Connection States:**  Monitor Tengine's connection states to detect potential flow control issues.
        *   **Tengine Updates:**  Prioritize updates that address flow control vulnerabilities.

### 4.2. HTTP/3 Specific Vulnerabilities

*   **4.2.1. QUIC Protocol Implementation:**

    *   **Vulnerability:**  Since HTTP/3 relies on QUIC, vulnerabilities in Tengine's QUIC implementation are directly relevant.  This includes connection establishment, stream management, congestion control, and flow control.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers could exploit QUIC vulnerabilities to cause DoS, connection hijacking, or other issues.  Examples include:
        *   **Amplification Attacks:**  Using Tengine as a reflector in a UDP-based amplification attack.
        *   **Connection ID Spoofing:**  Forging connection IDs to disrupt connections.
        *   **Packet Flooding:**  Sending a large number of QUIC packets to overwhelm the server.
    *   **Tengine-Specific Concerns:**  The maturity and security of Tengine's QUIC implementation are critical, as QUIC is a relatively new protocol.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **`http3_max_concurrent_streams`:**  Limit the maximum number of concurrent streams per HTTP/3 connection.
        *   **`http3_initial_max_data`, `http3_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local`, etc.:** Carefully configure these QUIC-related settings to control resource usage.
        *   **Disable QUIC if not needed:** If HTTP/3 is not essential, disable it to reduce the attack surface.
        *   **Firewall Rules:**  Implement strict firewall rules to limit UDP traffic to only necessary ports and sources.  This is *crucial* for mitigating amplification attacks.
        *   **Tengine Updates:**  Prioritize updates that address QUIC and HTTP/3 vulnerabilities.

*   **4.2.2. QPACK Implementation Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **Vulnerability:** Similar to HPACK in HTTP/2, QPACK is the header compression mechanism for HTTP/3. Vulnerabilities in Tengine's QPACK implementation could lead to DoS attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers could send crafted QPACK headers that cause excessive resource consumption during decompression.
    *   **Tengine-Specific Concerns:** The security and efficiency of Tengine's QPACK implementation are crucial.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **`http3_max_table_capacity` and `http3_blocked_streams`:** Configure these settings to limit the resources used by QPACK.
        *   **Monitor Memory and CPU Usage:** Closely monitor Tengine's resource usage to detect potential QPACK bomb attacks.
        *   **Tengine Updates:** Prioritize updates that address QPACK vulnerabilities.

### 4.3. General Mitigation Strategies (Applicable to both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3)

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF in front of Tengine to filter malicious HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 traffic.  The WAF should be configured to recognize and mitigate known HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 attack patterns.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):**  Use an IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity related to HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting at the network or application level to prevent attackers from overwhelming Tengine with requests.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of Tengine's configuration and code to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in Tengine's defenses.
*   **Keep Tengine and Dependencies Updated:** This is the *most important* general mitigation.  Regularly update Tengine and all its dependencies (including OpenSSL, nghttp2, nghttp3, etc.) to the latest stable versions.  Pay close attention to security advisories and changelogs.
* **Disable Unnecessary Modules:** If certain Tengine modules related to HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 are not required, disable them to reduce the attack surface.

## 5. Fuzzing (Conceptual)

Fuzzing is a crucial technique for discovering vulnerabilities in protocol implementations.  Here's how fuzzing could be applied to Tengine's HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 implementation:

*   **Targets:**
    *   **Tengine's HTTP/2 Parser:**  Fuzz the code that parses HTTP/2 frames and headers.
    *   **Tengine's HPACK Implementation:**  Fuzz the HPACK encoder and decoder.
    *   **Tengine's HTTP/3 Parser:**  Fuzz the code that parses QUIC packets and HTTP/3 frames.
    *   **Tengine's QPACK Implementation:**  Fuzz the QPACK encoder and decoder.
    *   **Tengine's Stream Management Logic:**  Fuzz the code that handles stream creation, prioritization, and termination.
    *   **Tengine's Flow Control Logic:** Fuzz the code that implements HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 flow control.

*   **Input Vectors:**
    *   **Malformed HTTP/2 Frames:**  Generate invalid or unexpected HTTP/2 frame types, flags, and payloads.
    *   **Malformed HPACK Headers:**  Generate invalid or oversized HPACK headers.
    *   **Malformed QUIC Packets:**  Generate invalid or unexpected QUIC packet types, flags, and payloads.
    *   **Malformed QPACK Headers:**  Generate invalid or oversized QPACK headers.
    *   **Edge Cases:**  Test boundary conditions, such as maximum stream IDs, maximum header sizes, and zero-length payloads.
    *   **Rapid Stream Creation/Destruction:**  Generate a large number of streams and rapidly reset them.

*   **Tools:**
    *   **AFL (American Fuzzy Lop):**  A popular general-purpose fuzzer.
    *   **libFuzzer:**  A coverage-guided fuzzer that can be integrated with Tengine.
    *   **Custom Fuzzers:**  Develop custom fuzzers specifically tailored to Tengine's HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 implementation.
    * **QUIC fuzzer:** Use specialized fuzzer for QUIC protocol.

*   **Process:**
    1.  **Build Tengine with instrumentation:**  Compile Tengine with appropriate flags for the chosen fuzzer (e.g., `-fsanitize=address,fuzzer` for libFuzzer).
    2.  **Create a corpus of valid inputs:**  Provide the fuzzer with a set of valid HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 requests to use as a starting point.
    3.  **Run the fuzzer:**  Run the fuzzer against the instrumented Tengine build.
    4.  **Monitor for crashes and hangs:**  Monitor Tengine for crashes, hangs, or other unexpected behavior.
    5.  **Analyze crashes:**  Analyze any crashes to identify the root cause and develop a fix.

## 6. Conclusion
