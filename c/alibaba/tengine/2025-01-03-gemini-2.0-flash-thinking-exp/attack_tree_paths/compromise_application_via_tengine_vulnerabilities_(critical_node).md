* **Mitigation:**
    * **Secure Configuration Hardening:**  Implement a comprehensive configuration hardening checklist based on security best practices.
    * **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong and unique passwords for all administrative accounts.
    * **Restrict Access to Administrative Interfaces:**  Limit access to administrative interfaces to specific trusted networks or IP addresses.
    * **Proper TLS/SSL Configuration:**  Use strong ciphers, the latest TLS protocol versions, and implement proper certificate management.
    * **Disable Directory Listing:**  Prevent the listing of directory contents to avoid information disclosure.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only necessary permissions to Tengine processes and users.

**3. Vulnerabilities in Tengine Modules and Extensions:**

* **Description:** Tengine's modular architecture allows for the inclusion of various modules and extensions. These modules, whether built-in or third-party, can contain their own vulnerabilities.
* **Examples:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in Lua Modules:**  Exploiting flaws in Lua scripts or the LuaJIT runtime if Tengine is configured with Lua support.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Dynamic Modules:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom or third-party modules loaded into Tengine.
    * **Bugs in Specific Directives:**  Discovering unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities when using specific Tengine directives in unusual or malicious ways.
* **Attacker Methodology:**
    * **Reconnaissance:** Identifying the specific modules enabled in the Tengine configuration.
    * **Exploitation:**  Targeting known vulnerabilities in specific modules or crafting requests to trigger unexpected behavior in module processing.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Regularly Update Modules:** Keep all Tengine modules and extensions up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * **Secure Coding Practices for Custom Modules:** If developing custom modules, adhere to secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
    * **Thoroughly Test Modules:**  Conduct thorough testing of all modules before deployment, including security testing.
    * **Minimize Module Usage:**  Only enable necessary modules to reduce the attack surface.
