# Attack Tree Analysis for alibaba/tengine

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized access to the application or its underlying infrastructure by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Tengine web server.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* **Compromise Application via Tengine Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **Exploit Tengine Configuration Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)**

            * **Misconfigured `alias` or `root` directives exposing sensitive files (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)**
        * **Exposed Configuration Files**
            * **Accessing `.tengine.conf` or included files due to misconfiguration (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Tengine Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_tengine_vulnerabilities_(critical_node).md)

**Description:** This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies a complete breach of the application's security due to vulnerabilities within the Tengine web server.
**Why Critical:** Achieving this goal allows the attacker to perform various malicious actions, including data theft, service disruption, or gaining control over the underlying infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Tengine Configuration Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_tengine_configuration_vulnerabilities_(high-risk_path).md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses arising from the misconfiguration of Tengine's settings. Configuration errors are common and often easily exploitable.
**Why High-Risk:** Misconfigurations are frequently overlooked and can create significant security loopholes. They often require minimal skill to exploit once discovered.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure `proxy_pass` configuration leading to SSRF (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_`proxy_pass`_configuration_leading_to_ssrf_(high-risk_path,_critical_node).md)

**Description:** When the `proxy_pass` directive is not properly secured, attackers can manipulate the target URL, forcing Tengine to make requests to internal or external resources on their behalf. This is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.
**Why High-Risk:**
    * **Likelihood:** Misconfiguring `proxy_pass` is a common mistake, especially when dynamic values are used without proper sanitization.
    * **Impact:** SSRF can have a significant impact, allowing attackers to:
        * Access internal services not exposed to the internet.
        * Read sensitive data from internal resources.
        * Potentially execute arbitrary code on internal systems.
**Why Critical:** Successful SSRF can provide a significant foothold within the internal network, enabling further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured `alias` or `root` directives exposing sensitive files (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_`alias`_or_`root`_directives_exposing_sensitive_files_(high-risk_path,_critical_node).md)

**Description:** The `alias` and `root` directives define the mapping between URLs and the file system. Incorrectly configured, these directives can allow attackers to bypass intended access controls and directly access sensitive files.
**Why High-Risk:**
    * **Likelihood:** Simple configuration errors in these directives are relatively common.
    * **Impact:** Exposing sensitive files can lead to:
        * Disclosure of source code, revealing application logic and potential vulnerabilities.
        * Exposure of configuration files containing credentials or other sensitive information.
        * Access to user data or other confidential information.
**Why Critical:** Exposure of configuration files is particularly critical as it can provide attackers with the keys to the kingdom.

## Attack Tree Path: [Accessing `.tengine.conf` or included files due to misconfiguration (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/accessing_`.tengine.conf`_or_included_files_due_to_misconfiguration_(high-risk_path,_critical_node).md)

**Description:** This attack vector involves directly accessing Tengine's main configuration file (`.tengine.conf`) or any files included within it. This is usually due to incorrect placement of configuration files within the web root or misconfigured access controls.
**Why High-Risk:**
    * **Likelihood:** While ideally these files should be strictly protected, misconfigurations can inadvertently expose them.
    * **Impact:** Access to Tengine's configuration files has a critical impact as it can reveal:
        * Credentials for backend services.
        * Internal network configurations.
        * Details about the application's architecture.
        * Security settings and potential weaknesses.
**Why Critical:** Gaining access to the main configuration file provides attackers with a wealth of information that can be used to launch further, more targeted attacks and achieve complete system compromise.
