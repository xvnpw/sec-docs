# Threat Model Analysis for alibaba/tengine

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Tengine-Specific Modules](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_tengine-specific_modules.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a security flaw within a module developed specifically for Tengine (not present in upstream Nginx). This could involve sending crafted requests or manipulating data in a way that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution on the server, denial of service, information disclosure (e.g., leaking sensitive data from memory), or privilege escalation within the Tengine process.
*   **Affected Component:**  Specific Tengine module (e.g., a custom header filter module, a dynamic module implementation).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Tengine to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Thoroughly audit and security test all Tengine-specific modules during development.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within custom modules.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing Tengine modules.

## Threat: [Access Control Bypass due to Interaction Issues Between Tengine Modules and Core Nginx](./threats/access_control_bypass_due_to_interaction_issues_between_tengine_modules_and_core_nginx.md)

*   **Description:**  A vulnerability arises from the way a Tengine-specific module interacts with the core Nginx functionality. An attacker could exploit this interaction to bypass intended access controls, gaining access to restricted resources or functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to manipulate application behavior, potential for further exploitation.
*   **Affected Component:**  The specific Tengine module and the Nginx core components it interacts with (e.g., request processing, authentication modules).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design and test the interfaces between Tengine modules and the Nginx core.
    *   Implement comprehensive integration testing, including security testing, for all module interactions.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege in module design and configuration.

## Threat: [Malicious Module Loading via Misconfigured Tengine Directives](./threats/malicious_module_loading_via_misconfigured_tengine_directives.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfiguration in Tengine-specific directives related to dynamic module loading. This could allow them to load malicious or compromised modules into the Tengine process.
*   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the Tengine server, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or the server being used for malicious purposes.
*   **Affected Component:**  Tengine's dynamic module loading mechanism and related configuration directives.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly control access to Tengine configuration files.
    *   Implement secure defaults for dynamic module loading directives.
    *   Regularly review and audit Tengine configuration for any insecure settings.
    *   Consider disabling dynamic module loading if not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption Vulnerability Due to Code Divergence from Upstream Nginx](./threats/memory_corruption_vulnerability_due_to_code_divergence_from_upstream_nginx.md)

*   **Description:**  As Tengine's codebase diverges from the upstream Nginx, unique memory management flaws or buffer overflows might be introduced. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause crashes, denial of service, or potentially achieve remote code execution.
*   **Impact:**  Service disruption, potential for complete server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:**  Tengine-specific code sections where memory management differs from upstream Nginx.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits of Tengine-specific code changes.
    *   Utilize memory safety tools and techniques during Tengine development.
    *   Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes from exploitable memory issues.
