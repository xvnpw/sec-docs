# Attack Surface Analysis for alibaba/tengine

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Tengine-Specific Modules](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_tengine-specific_modules.md)

* **Description:** Tengine includes modules not found in standard Nginx or has significantly modified existing ones. These new or altered codebases can contain vulnerabilities.
    * **How Tengine Contributes:** By adding or modifying modules, Tengine introduces new code that hasn't been as widely scrutinized as the core Nginx codebase, potentially harboring bugs or security flaws.
    * **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the `ngx_http_concat_module` (a Tengine-specific module) could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted request.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Conduct regular security audits and code reviews specifically targeting Tengine-specific modules.
        * Apply security patches released by the Tengine project promptly.
        * Disable or remove Tengine-specific modules that are not actively used.
        * Implement input validation and sanitization within the logic of Tengine-specific modules.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Dynamically Loaded Modules (Specific to Tengine's Enhanced Dynamic Module Support)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_dynamically_loaded_modules__specific_to_tengine's_enhanced_dynamic_module_support_f06f9d46.md)

* **Description:** Tengine often has enhanced support for dynamic modules. If this mechanism or the loaded modules themselves have vulnerabilities, it expands the attack surface.
    * **How Tengine Contributes:** While Nginx supports dynamic modules, Tengine's implementation or the ecosystem of modules built for Tengine might introduce unique vulnerabilities in the loading process or within the modules themselves.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in Tengine's dynamic module loading mechanism could allow an attacker to load a malicious module without proper authentication or verification.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict controls over the source and integrity of dynamically loaded modules.
        * Verify the authenticity and integrity of module files before loading.
        * Regularly update dynamically loaded modules to their latest secure versions.
        * Limit the privileges of the Tengine worker processes to minimize the impact of a compromised module.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Tengine-Specific Features (e.g., Session Persistence, Load Balancing Enhancements)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_tengine-specific_features__e_g___session_persistence__load_balancing_enhancements_7642c78c.md)

* **Description:** Tengine often includes enhanced features for session persistence, load balancing, and other areas. Bugs or design flaws in these specific features can be exploited.
    * **How Tengine Contributes:** These features are additions to the standard Nginx functionality and represent new code that could contain vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A flaw in Tengine's session persistence mechanism could allow an attacker to hijack user sessions or gain unauthorized access.
    * **Impact:** Account compromise, unauthorized access, data manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review the security implications of using Tengine-specific features.
        * Apply security patches related to these features promptly.
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms in conjunction with these features.
