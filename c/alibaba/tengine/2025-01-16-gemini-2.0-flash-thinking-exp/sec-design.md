## 4. Detailed Design

This section provides a deeper look into the key components and their functionalities within the Tengine architecture, with a focus on aspects relevant to security.

### 4.1. Core Components

*   **Master Process:**
    *   Reads and validates the main configuration file (`tengine.conf`).
    *   Creates and manages worker processes, ensuring process isolation.
    *   Performs privileged operations, such as binding to listening ports, requiring careful security considerations.
    *   Monitors worker processes and restarts them in case of unexpected termination, enhancing resilience.
*   **Worker Processes:**
    *   Accept and handle incoming client connections in a non-blocking manner.
    *   Process HTTP requests and generate responses based on the configuration and request details.
    *   Execute configured modules, extending Tengine's functionality.
    *   Operate independently, minimizing the impact of a failure in one process.
*   **Cache Manager Process (Optional):**
    *   Manages the on-disk cache, including storing and retrieving cached content.
    *   Implements cache eviction policies to manage storage space.
    *   Coordinates with worker processes for cache updates and retrievals.
*   **Cache Loader Process (Optional):**
    *   Pre-loads cached data into memory during startup, improving performance after restarts.
    *   Requires secure access to the cache storage.

### 4.2. Key Modules

*   **HTTP Core Module (`ngx_http_core_module`):**
    *   Parses HTTP request headers and bodies, a critical point for input validation.
    *   Constructs HTTP response headers and bodies, requiring careful output encoding to prevent XSS.
    *   Manages HTTP connection states (keep-alive), which can be a target for DoS attacks.
*   **Server Block Module (`ngx_http_server_module`):**
    *   Defines virtual hosts based on server names or IP addresses, controlling access to different applications.
    *   Allows for distinct security configurations for different virtual hosts.
*   **Location Block Module (`ngx_http_location_module`):**
    *   Defines how requests matching specific URIs are handled, enabling granular access control.
    *   Can specify different authentication methods and authorization rules.
*   **Upstream Module (`ngx_http_upstream_module`):**
    *   Defines groups of backend servers, managing connections and load distribution.
    *   Implements health checks to ensure only healthy servers receive traffic.
    *   Load balancing algorithms can impact performance and resilience.
*   **Proxy Module (`ngx_http_proxy_module`):**
    *   Forwards client requests to backend servers, potentially exposing backend services.
    *   Handles responses from backend servers, requiring careful handling of backend errors.
    *   Can modify request and response headers, which can be a security concern if not done properly.
*   **Cache Module (`ngx_http_cache_module`):**
    *   Caches responses to reduce backend load and improve performance.
    *   Requires careful configuration to prevent caching of sensitive data.
    *   Cache invalidation mechanisms are important for data consistency.
*   **SSL/TLS Module (`ngx_ssl_module` using OpenSSL or BoringSSL):**
    *   Handles secure connections using SSL/TLS protocols, crucial for data confidentiality and integrity.
    *   Manages SSL certificates and private keys, requiring secure storage and rotation.
    *   Configuration of ciphers and protocols impacts security strength.
*   **Rewrite Module (`ngx_http_rewrite_module`):**
    *   Allows modifying the requested URI, which can be used for security purposes (e.g., redirecting insecure requests).
    *   Complex rewrite rules can introduce vulnerabilities if not carefully implemented.
*   **Access Control Modules (`ngx_http_access_module`, `ngx_http_auth_basic_module`, etc.):**
    *   Controls access based on IP addresses, user credentials, and other criteria.
    *   Proper configuration is essential to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   Authentication mechanisms should be robust and secure.
*   **Log Module (`ngx_http_log_module`):**
    *   Writes access logs and error logs, providing valuable data for security auditing and incident response.
    *   Log formats should be carefully configured to include relevant information without exposing sensitive data.
*   **Mail Proxy Module (Optional):**
    *   Provides proxy functionality for mail protocols. Security considerations for mail protocols are different from HTTP.
*   **Stream Module (Optional):**
    *   Provides proxy functionality for TCP and UDP streams. Security considerations for generic TCP/UDP proxying are important.

### 4.3. Configuration

*   Tengine's behavior is defined by its configuration file (`tengine.conf`), a critical security artifact.
*   The configuration uses a hierarchical structure with directives organized into blocks (`http`, `server`, `location`, `upstream`).
*   Directives specify parameters like listening ports, server names, file paths, caching behavior, and security policies.
*   Secure storage and access control for the configuration file are paramount.
*   Changes to the configuration typically require a reload or restart, which should be handled securely.

## 5. Data Flow

The following describes the typical flow of an HTTP request through Tengine, highlighting security-relevant steps:

1. **Client sends an HTTP request to the Tengine server.**
2. **The Master process listens on configured ports.** Binding to privileged ports requires appropriate permissions.
3. **A Worker process accepts the incoming connection.** Connection limits and timeouts can help mitigate DoS attacks.
4. **The Worker process reads the request headers and body.** This is the first point of input validation.
5. **The HTTP Core module parses the request.**  Vulnerabilities in the parser can lead to exploits.
6. **Tengine determines the appropriate Server block based on the Host header or IP address.** This step is crucial for virtual hosting security.
7. **Within the Server block, Tengine matches the request URI against configured Location blocks.** Access control rules are applied here.
8. **Based on the matching Location block, Tengine executes the configured modules.**
    *   **If caching is enabled and the content is in the cache, the cached response is served directly.** Ensure the cache doesn't contain sensitive information for unauthorized users.
    *   **If the request needs to be proxied, the Upstream module selects a backend server.** Secure communication with backend servers is important.
    *   **The Proxy module forwards the request to the selected backend server.**  Careful handling of headers and data is required.
9. **The backend server processes the request and sends a response back to Tengine.**
10. **The Proxy module receives the response from the backend server.** Response headers should be inspected for potential security issues.
11. **Tengine may cache the response based on configured caching directives.**  Ensure sensitive data is not cached inappropriately.
12. **Tengine constructs the HTTP response and sends it back to the client.** Output encoding is crucial to prevent XSS.
13. **The Log module records the transaction details.** Logs should be secured to prevent tampering.
