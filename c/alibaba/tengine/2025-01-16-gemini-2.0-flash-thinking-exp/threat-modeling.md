# Threat Model Analysis for alibaba/tengine

## Threat: [Misconfigured `proxy_pass` leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./threats/misconfigured__proxy_pass__leading_to_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the Tengine configuration of the `proxy_pass` directive to force the Tengine server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources. This is achieved by crafting specific URLs or headers that Tengine then uses as the destination for its proxy request.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially access internal services not exposed to the internet, read sensitive data from these services, or even perform actions on their behalf. This can lead to significant data breaches, internal network compromise, or denial of service against internal resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ngx_http_proxy_module` (specifically the `proxy_pass` directive).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on any data that influences the `proxy_pass` destination.
        *   Use allow lists for permitted backend destinations in `proxy_pass` instead of relying on block lists.
        *   Consider using internal DNS resolution or IP addresses for backend services to limit the scope of potential SSRF.
        *   Regularly review and audit Tengine configurations for potential SSRF vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom Tengine modules](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_tengine_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Tengine includes custom modules not found in standard Nginx. These modules might contain security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection flaws, or authentication bypasses within their code. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted requests or data that target the vulnerable module's functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the specific vulnerability, an attacker could achieve remote code execution on the server running Tengine, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data handled by the module, cause a denial of service by crashing the module or the entire Tengine process, or bypass security controls implemented by the module.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific custom Tengine modules (e.g., `ngx_http_concat_module`, `ngx_http_trim_filter_module`, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the nature and impact of the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Tengine updated to the latest version, as updates often include security patches for module vulnerabilities.
        *   Thoroughly review the source code of custom modules for potential security flaws.
        *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting Tengine's custom modules.
        *   Disable or remove any custom modules that are not actively used to reduce the attack surface.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through resource exhaustion via Tengine](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion_via_tengine.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could send a large volume of requests or specially crafted requests designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, connections) within the Tengine server itself. This could exploit inefficiencies in Tengine's request handling or overwhelm its capacity to process requests.
    *   **Impact:** The Tengine server becomes unresponsive or crashes, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. This leads to business disruption, financial losses, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core Tengine process, `ngx_http_core_module` (connection handling, request processing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure appropriate `limit_req` and `limit_conn` directives to restrict the rate of requests and connections from individual clients.
        *   Implement connection timeouts and keep-alive settings to prevent resource hoarding.
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious traffic patterns and protect against common DoS attacks.
        *   Consider using load balancing and auto-scaling to distribute traffic and handle spikes in demand.

## Threat: [HTTP Request Smuggling due to Tengine's handling of chunked encoding and content length](./threats/http_request_smuggling_due_to_tengine's_handling_of_chunked_encoding_and_content_length.md)

*   **Description:** Discrepancies or vulnerabilities in how Tengine parses and handles HTTP chunked encoding and Content-Length headers can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious requests that are interpreted differently by Tengine and backend servers. This allows attackers to bypass Tengine's security checks and send requests directly to the backend.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can bypass security controls implemented at the Tengine level, potentially execute arbitrary commands on the backend server, access sensitive data residing on the backend, or manipulate application logic.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ngx_http_core_module` (HTTP request parsing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that Tengine and backend servers have consistent and strict configurations for handling chunked encoding and Content-Length headers.
        *   Consider using a single web server to handle both frontend and backend requests if possible to avoid discrepancies.
        *   Implement strict validation of HTTP headers on both Tengine and backend servers.
        *   Keep Tengine updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for HTTP parsing vulnerabilities.
