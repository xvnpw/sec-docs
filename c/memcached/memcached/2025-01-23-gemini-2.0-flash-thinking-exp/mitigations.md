# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for memcached/memcached

## Mitigation Strategy: [Bind Memcached to a Non-Public Interface](./mitigation_strategies/bind_memcached_to_a_non-public_interface.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Access the Memcached server configuration file.** This file is typically named `memcached.conf` or `memcached.conf.d/` and its location varies depending on the operating system and installation method (e.g., `/etc/memcached.conf`, `/usr/local/etc/memcached.conf`).
        2.  **Locate the `-l` option (listen address).** If it's not present, you'll need to add it. If it's set to `0.0.0.0` or a public IP address, modify it.
        3.  **Change the `-l` option value to `127.0.0.1` to bind to localhost only.** This restricts access to processes on the same server. Alternatively, set it to the private IP address of the server (e.g., `10.0.0.10`) if other servers within a private network need to access Memcached.
        4.  **Save the configuration file.**
        5.  **Restart the Memcached service.** Use the appropriate command for your system (e.g., `sudo systemctl restart memcached`, `sudo service memcached restart`).
        6.  **Verify the change.** Use `netstat -tulnp | grep memcached` or `ss -tulnp | grep memcached` to confirm that Memcached is now listening on the intended IP address (e.g., `127.0.0.1:11211` or `<private_ip>:11211`).

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized External Access (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from directly connecting to Memcached from outside the intended network.
        *   **Data Exfiltration (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized access to cached data if the network perimeter is breached.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via External Exploitation (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder for external attackers to overwhelm Memcached with requests.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized External Access:** High reduction. Effectively eliminates direct external access if correctly configured.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Medium reduction. Reduces risk significantly but doesn't eliminate it if internal network is compromised.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via External Exploitation:** Medium reduction. Makes external DoS harder but doesn't protect against internal DoS or application-level DoS.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented on production and staging servers. Configuration managed by Ansible playbook in `ansible/roles/memcached/tasks/main.yml`.  `-l 127.0.0.1` is set for all environments except for specific internal testing environments where a private IP is used and firewall rules are in place.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  N/A - Currently implemented across all relevant environments.  Should be continuously monitored during infrastructure changes to ensure it remains in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable UDP Protocol if Not Required](./mitigation_strategies/disable_udp_protocol_if_not_required.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Access the Memcached server configuration file.** (See location details in "Bind to Non-Public Interface" description).
        2.  **Locate the `-U` option (UDP port).**
        3.  **If `-U` is present and set to a port number (e.g., `-U 11211`), change it to `-U 0` to disable UDP.** If `-U` is not present, add the line `-U 0`.
        4.  **Save the configuration file.**
        5.  **Restart the Memcached service.** (See restart commands in "Bind to Non-Public Interface" description).
        6.  **Verify UDP is disabled.** Use `netstat -tulnp | grep memcached` or `ss -tulnp | grep memcached`.  Ensure that Memcached is only listening on TCP port 11211 and not UDP.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **UDP Amplification Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Prevents Memcached from being used as a reflector in UDP amplification DDoS attacks.
        *   **Accidental UDP Exposure (Low Severity):**  Reduces the attack surface by disabling an unnecessary protocol if TCP is sufficient.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **UDP Amplification Attacks:** Medium reduction. Eliminates Memcached as a UDP amplification vector.
        *   **Accidental UDP Exposure:** Low reduction.  Minor reduction in attack surface.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented on all Memcached servers. Configuration managed by Ansible playbook in `ansible/roles/memcached/tasks/main.yml`. `-U 0` is explicitly set.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Implemented across all environments. Should be maintained in configuration management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Memory Allocation](./mitigation_strategies/limit_memory_allocation.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Access the Memcached server configuration file.** (See location details in "Bind to Non-Public Interface" description).
        2.  **Locate the `-m` option (maximum memory).**
        3.  **Set the `-m` option to an appropriate value in megabytes (MB) based on your application's caching needs and available server resources.**  Analyze your application's memory usage patterns to determine a suitable limit.  Start with a reasonable estimate and monitor memory usage.
        4.  **Save the configuration file.**
        5.  **Restart the Memcached service.** (See restart commands in "Bind to Non-Public Interface" description).
        6.  **Monitor Memcached memory usage.** Use monitoring tools (e.g., `memcached-tool`, Prometheus exporters, cloud monitoring dashboards) to track memory consumption and adjust the `-m` value if needed.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion DoS (Medium Severity):** Prevents Memcached from consuming excessive memory and starving other processes on the server.
        *   **Unpredictable Performance Degradation (Low Severity):**  Helps maintain predictable performance by preventing uncontrolled memory growth.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion DoS:** Medium reduction.  Significantly reduces the risk of Memcached-induced resource exhaustion.
        *   **Unpredictable Performance Degradation:** Low reduction. Improves system stability and predictability.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented on all Memcached servers. Memory limit is set based on server size and application requirements in our Ansible playbook `ansible/roles/memcached/vars/main.yml` and applied in `ansible/roles/memcached/tasks/main.yml`.  Currently set to 2GB for standard Memcached instances.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Implemented in all environments. Memory limits should be reviewed and adjusted periodically based on application growth and performance monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consider SASL Authentication (If Supported and Feasible)](./mitigation_strategies/consider_sasl_authentication__if_supported_and_feasible_.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Check if your Memcached version supports SASL authentication.**  Standard Memcached from `github.com/memcached/memcached` *does not* have built-in SASL support in its core.  SASL support is typically found in forks or patched versions. You would need to compile Memcached with SASL support enabled during the build process.
        2.  **If SASL is supported, install necessary SASL libraries and configure Memcached to use SASL.** This involves modifying the Memcached configuration file to enable SASL and specify authentication mechanisms.  Consult your Memcached version's documentation for specific configuration options.
        3.  **Configure your Memcached client libraries to authenticate using SASL credentials.** This will require changes in your application code to provide usernames and passwords or other authentication details when connecting to Memcached.
        4.  **Securely manage SASL credentials.**  Do not hardcode credentials in application code or configuration files. Use secure credential storage and retrieval mechanisms.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access from Internal Network (Medium Severity):**  Adds an authentication layer to control access even from within the internal network, mitigating risks from compromised internal systems or insider threats.
        *   **Data Exfiltration by Internal Attackers (Medium Severity):**  Makes it harder for internal attackers to access cached data without proper authentication.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access from Internal Network:** Medium reduction. Adds a significant layer of security within the trusted network zone.
        *   **Data Exfiltration by Internal Attackers:** Medium reduction.  Increases the difficulty of unauthorized data access by internal actors.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** No, *not implemented*.  Standard Memcached version from `github.com/memcached/memcached` is used, which does not have built-in SASL support.  Implementing SASL would require switching to a fork or patched version and significant application-level changes.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** SASL authentication is a missing implementation.  Evaluate the feasibility and benefits of switching to a SASL-enabled Memcached version and implementing authentication in the application. This would be a significant undertaking and should be considered based on a risk assessment of internal threats and data sensitivity.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Audits and Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_audits_and_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Establish a schedule for regular security audits of your Memcached deployment.**  This should include:
            *   Reviewing Memcached configuration files.
            *   Verifying access control mechanisms within Memcached configuration (like SASL if implemented).
            *   Assessing the application's Memcached usage patterns and security practices related to Memcached configuration.
        2.  **Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Memcached.** (e.g., GitHub repository watch, security mailing lists).
        3.  **Keep Memcached software up to date with the latest stable version and security patches.**  Implement a patch management process for Memcached servers.
        4.  **Document all security configurations and audit findings.** Track remediation efforts.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Protects against exploitation of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Memcached.
        *   **Misconfigurations and Security Drift (Medium Severity):**  Identifies and corrects security weaknesses introduced by misconfigurations or gradual deviations from secure configurations over time.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Low Severity):**  While not directly preventing zero-days, a proactive security posture and regular updates reduce the window of opportunity for exploitation.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** High reduction.  Effectively eliminates risks from patched vulnerabilities.
        *   **Misconfigurations and Security Drift:** Medium reduction.  Improves overall security posture and reduces accumulated risks.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Low reduction.  Provides a general improvement in security readiness.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have a monthly security review process that includes infrastructure components, but *specific* Memcached configuration audits are not explicitly scheduled. We subscribe to general security advisories but not specifically Memcached-focused ones.  Patch management is in place for OS-level packages, including Memcached, but version upgrades are not proactively scheduled.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish a dedicated schedule for Memcached configuration security audits as part of our monthly security review.  Specifically subscribe to Memcached security-related information sources.  Implement a process for proactively planning and executing Memcached version upgrades to benefit from security enhancements and bug fixes in Memcached itself.
