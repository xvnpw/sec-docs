# Threat Model Analysis for memcached/memcached

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access](./threats/unauthorized_data_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Memcached server, potentially by exploiting misconfigurations (like insecure bind address) or lack of network security. Once connected, they can retrieve any data stored in the cache using commands like `get`.

**Impact:**  Sensitive data stored in the cache can be directly accessed and potentially misused. This can have severe consequences depending on the nature of the cached data.

**Affected Component:** Memcached server process, specifically the command processing logic for data retrieval.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure Memcached to bind to specific, non-public interfaces (e.g., localhost or a private network IP).
* Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to the Memcached port (default 11211) to only authorized application servers.
* Avoid exposing the Memcached port directly to the internet.

## Threat: [Data Manipulation/Corruption](./threats/data_manipulationcorruption.md)

**Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access to the Memcached server can use commands like `set` or `delete` to modify or remove cached data. This can disrupt the application's functionality or lead to incorrect data being served to users.

**Impact:** Application behavior can become unpredictable, leading to errors, incorrect information displayed to users, or even security vulnerabilities if the application relies on the integrity of the cached data.

**Affected Component:** Memcached server process, specifically the command processing logic for data storage and deletion.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong network security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the Memcached server.
* Ensure the application logic handles potential cache misses or unexpected data gracefully.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attack](./threats/denial_of_service_(dos)_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the Memcached server with a large number of requests, overwhelming its resources and making it unresponsive. This can prevent legitimate applications from accessing the cache.

**Impact:** Application performance degrades significantly, or the application becomes completely unavailable if it heavily relies on Memcached.

**Affected Component:** Memcached server process, specifically its network request handling and memory management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Consider configuring Memcached's `-m` option to limit memory usage and `-c` option to limit concurrent connections.
* Use network infrastructure defenses (e.g., firewalls, intrusion prevention systems) to filter malicious traffic.

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning](./threats/cache_poisoning.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to Memcached injects malicious or incorrect data into the cache. When the application retrieves this poisoned data, it can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** The application might serve incorrect information, execute unintended actions, or become vulnerable to further attacks if the poisoned data is used in a security-sensitive context.

**Affected Component:** Memcached server process, specifically the command processing logic for data storage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls to prevent unauthorized write access to Memcached.

## Threat: [Exploiting Memcached Protocol Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_memcached_protocol_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities might exist in the Memcached protocol implementation itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted commands to the server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other severe consequences.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Memcached server and potentially the application server it resides on.

**Affected Component:** Memcached server process, specifically the code responsible for parsing and processing Memcached commands.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the Memcached server software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Follow security best practices for deploying and configuring Memcached.
