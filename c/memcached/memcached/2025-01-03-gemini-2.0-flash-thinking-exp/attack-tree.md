## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Memcached - Exploit Lack of Authentication/Authorization - Directly Connect to Memcached Port (Default: 11211)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_memcached_-_exploit_lack_of_authenticationauthorization_-_directly_connect_to_memcached_port_(default_11211).md)

**Critical Node: Gain Unauthorized Access to Memcached**

*   **Exploit Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** Memcached, by default, lacks built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms. This makes it inherently vulnerable if network access is not strictly controlled.
    *   **Directly Connect to Memcached Port (Default: 11211) ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
        *   An attacker can directly connect to the Memcached port (default 11211) if it's exposed on the network.
        *   This requires minimal effort and skill, often using basic networking tools like `telnet` or `nc`.
        *   Successful connection grants the attacker full access to issue Memcached commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data in Memcached - Data Injection/Poisoning - Insert Malicious Data into Cache](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_in_memcached_-_data_injectionpoisoning_-_insert_malicious_data_into_cache.md)

**Critical Node: Manipulate Data in Memcached**

*   **Data Injection/Poisoning ***CRITICAL NODE***:** Once unauthorized access is gained, an attacker can manipulate the data stored in Memcached.
    *   **Insert Malicious Data into Cache ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
        *   **Overwrite legitimate data with attacker-controlled content:** The attacker can use the `set` command to replace existing cached data with malicious content. When the application retrieves this poisoned data, it can lead to various issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data in Memcached - Data Injection/Poisoning - Inject Data with Exploitable Payloads](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_in_memcached_-_data_injectionpoisoning_-_inject_data_with_exploitable_payloads.md)

**Critical Node: Manipulate Data in Memcached**

*   **Data Injection/Poisoning ***CRITICAL NODE***:** Once unauthorized access is gained, an attacker can manipulate the data stored in Memcached.
        *   **Inject Data with Exploitable Payloads ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
            *   **Introduce data that, when retrieved by the application, triggers a vulnerability:** This involves injecting data that, when processed by the application, exploits a flaw. Examples include:
                *   **Deserialization vulnerabilities:** Injecting malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized by the application, lead to remote code execution.
                *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts that, when rendered by the application in a web page, execute in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Memcached Service - Resource Exhaustion - Memory Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_memcached_service_-_resource_exhaustion_-_memory_exhaustion.md)

**High-Risk Path: Disrupt Memcached Service - Memory Exhaustion**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Attackers can attempt to overwhelm the Memcached server, making it unavailable.
    *   **Memory Exhaustion ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
        *   **Send a large number of set commands with unique keys and large values:** An attacker can flood the Memcached server with data, rapidly consuming its available memory.
        *   This can lead to the server evicting legitimate data, slowing down operations, or even crashing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Memcached Service - Command Abuse - Flush All Data](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_memcached_service_-_command_abuse_-_flush_all_data.md)

**High-Risk Path: Disrupt Memcached Service - Flush All Data**

*   **Command Abuse:** Exploiting administrative commands for malicious purposes.
    *   **Flush All Data ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
        *   **Execute the `flush_all` command, invalidating the entire cache:** If the attacker gains unauthorized access, they can execute the `flush_all` command, which clears the entire Memcached cache.
        *   This can cause a significant performance impact on the application as it needs to retrieve data from the slower persistent storage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Information Disclosure - Retrieve Cached Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_information_disclosure_-_retrieve_cached_sensitive_data.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Information Disclosure - Retrieve Cached Sensitive Data**

*   **Exploit Information Disclosure:** Gaining access to information stored in Memcached that is not intended for the attacker.
    *   **Retrieve Cached Sensitive Data ***HIGH-RISK PATH***:**
        *   **Access data not intended for the attacker's view:** If sensitive information is cached in Memcached and an attacker gains unauthorized access, they can directly retrieve this data using commands like `get`.
        *   This can lead to data breaches and compromise user privacy.
