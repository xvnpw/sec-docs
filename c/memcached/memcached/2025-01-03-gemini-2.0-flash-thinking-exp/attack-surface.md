# Attack Surface Analysis for memcached/memcached

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access.md)

*   **Description:** Memcached, by default, does not require any authentication for clients to connect and execute commands.
*   **How Memcached Contributes:** Memcached's design prioritizes speed and simplicity, omitting built-in authentication mechanisms by default.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as the Memcached server can connect and use commands like `get`, `set`, `delete`, or `flush_all`.
*   **Impact:** Data can be read, modified, or deleted. The entire cache can be flushed, leading to application downtime and data loss.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Memcached server on a private network inaccessible from the public internet.
    *   **Bind to Specific Interfaces:** Configure Memcached to only listen on specific internal network interfaces.
    *   **Consider SASL (if supported and necessary):** While not default, explore if your Memcached version and client libraries support SASL for authentication.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to allow connections only from authorized application servers.

## Attack Surface: [UDP Amplification and Reflection Attacks](./attack_surfaces/udp_amplification_and_reflection_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** If UDP is enabled, attackers can send small, spoofed requests to the Memcached server, causing it to send much larger responses to a victim's IP address.
*   **How Memcached Contributes:** Memcached's stateless nature with UDP and its ability to generate responses based on simple requests make it vulnerable to amplification.
*   **Example:** An attacker spoofs the source IP address of a target and sends a small `stats` or `get` request to the Memcached server via UDP. The server sends a larger response to the spoofed target.
*   **Impact:** Significant denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against the targeted victim, potentially overwhelming their network infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable UDP:** If UDP is not required for your application, disable it by using the `-U 0` option when starting Memcached.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the network to restrict the number of requests from a single source.
    *   **Ingress Filtering:** Implement ingress filtering on network devices to drop packets with spoofed source IP addresses.

## Attack Surface: [Data Leakage through Unsecured Access](./attack_surfaces/data_leakage_through_unsecured_access.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data stored in Memcached can be accessed by unauthorized parties due to the lack of authentication.
*   **How Memcached Contributes:** Memcached stores data in plain text in memory, making it directly accessible to anyone who can connect.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Memcached port and uses the `get` command to retrieve sensitive user credentials or API keys stored in the cache.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential information, leading to potential account compromise, data breaches, and reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Storing Highly Sensitive Data:** If possible, avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in Memcached.
    *   **Encrypt Data Before Caching:** If sensitive data must be cached, encrypt it at the application layer before storing it in Memcached.
    *   **Secure Network Access:** Implement network segmentation and firewall rules as mentioned above to restrict access.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Memcached Itself](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption_vulnerabilities_in_memcached_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Memcached codebase (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **How Memcached Contributes:** As software written in C, Memcached is susceptible to memory management errors if not carefully implemented.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted command or data packet that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in Memcached, allowing them to execute shell commands on the server.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Memcached server, potentially leading to data breaches, system takeover, and further attacks on the infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Memcached Updated:** Regularly update Memcached to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Follow Security Best Practices:** Ensure Memcached is compiled and deployed following security best practices.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
