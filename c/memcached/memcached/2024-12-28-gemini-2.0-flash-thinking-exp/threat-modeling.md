* **Threat:** Plaintext Data Transmission
    * **Description:** An attacker eavesdrops on network traffic between the application and the Memcached server. Due to the default plaintext protocol, the attacker can intercept and read sensitive data being transmitted, such as user credentials, session IDs, or other confidential information stored in the cache.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive user data, potential for account takeover or further attacks using the exposed information.
    * **Affected Component:** Network Protocol
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Deploy Memcached on a trusted and isolated network segment.
        * Utilize network-level encryption technologies like IPsec or VPN to encrypt traffic between the application and Memcached.
        * Consider using a secure tunnel (e.g., SSH tunnel) for communication, although this adds complexity.

* **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access/Modification
    * **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized network access to the Memcached port (e.g., due to misconfigured firewall rules or network exposure). They can then directly connect to the Memcached server and execute commands to read, modify, or delete cached data.
    * **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, potential for application malfunction due to modified data, denial of service by deleting critical cached items, or injection of malicious content.
    * **Affected Component:** Core Server Process, Network Listener
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to the Memcached port only to authorized application servers.
        * Ensure Memcached is not exposed to the public internet.
        * Regularly audit and review firewall configurations.

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion
    * **Description:** An attacker floods the Memcached server with a large number of requests, consuming its memory or processing resources. This can lead to performance degradation or complete unavailability of the Memcached service.
    * **Impact:** Application performance degradation, application unavailability, impacting user experience and potentially leading to financial losses.
    * **Affected Component:** Core Server Process, Memory Management
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rate limiting on connections and requests to Memcached.
        * Configure appropriate memory limits for Memcached to prevent it from consuming excessive resources.
        * Monitor Memcached resource usage (CPU, memory, network) and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        * Consider deploying Memcached in a high-availability configuration with replication or clustering.

* **Threat:** Lack of Built-in Authentication and Authorization
    * **Description:** Standard Memcached deployments lack built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms. Any client that can connect to the Memcached port can potentially access and manipulate data. An attacker gaining access to the network can exploit this lack of security.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to cached data, potential for data breaches, data modification, or denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:** Core Server Process (Lack of Authentication Module)
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Rely heavily on network-level security (firewalls, private networks) to restrict access to Memcached.
        * Consider using SASL authentication if your Memcached version supports it and the client library allows it.
        * Implement application-level authorization checks before accessing or modifying data in Memcached.

* **Threat:** Memory Exhaustion leading to DoS
    * **Description:** An attacker can exploit the way Memcached manages memory by sending requests that cause it to allocate excessive amounts of memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service. This could involve setting very large keys or values, or rapidly setting many unique keys.
    * **Impact:** Memcached service becomes unresponsive, leading to application unavailability.
    * **Affected Component:** Memory Management
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Configure appropriate memory limits for Memcached.
        * Implement checks in the application to prevent excessively large keys or values from being stored in the cache.
        * Monitor Memcached memory usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes.
