# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for memcached/memcached

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable UDP Protocol](./mitigation_strategies/disable_udp_protocol.md)

### Description:

1.  **Access Memcached server configuration:** Locate the Memcached server configuration file or startup script.
2.  **Add or modify startup options:**  Add the `-u` option to the Memcached startup command. Alternatively, ensure `-U 0` is present and explicitly bind to TCP using `-p <port>`.
3.  **Restart Memcached service:**  Restart the Memcached service for the changes to take effect.
4.  **Verify UDP is disabled:** Use network tools like `netstat` or `ss` to confirm that Memcached is no longer listening on UDP port 11211.

### Threats Mitigated:

*   **UDP Amplification DoS Attack (High Severity):**  Exploits the connectionless nature of UDP to amplify attack traffic, overwhelming a victim with responses from Memcached servers.

### Impact:

*   **UDP Amplification DoS Attack:** High risk reduction. Eliminates the primary vector for UDP amplification attacks via Memcached.

### Currently Implemented:

Implemented in the production environment Memcached servers, configured via Ansible playbook during server provisioning. Verified in production firewall rules and server configurations.

### Missing Implementation:

Not applicable, implemented across all environments where Memcached is used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Bind to Specific Network Interface](./mitigation_strategies/bind_to_specific_network_interface.md)

### Description:

1.  **Access Memcached server configuration:** Locate the Memcached server configuration file or startup script.
2.  **Modify bind address:** Find the `-l` option in the startup command. If it's set to `0.0.0.0` (or not present, which defaults to binding to all interfaces), change it to `127.0.0.1` for local access only, or to the private IP address of the Memcached server (e.g., `10.0.1.10`).
3.  **Restart Memcached service:** Restart the Memcached service for the changes to take effect.
4.  **Verify binding:** Use `netstat` or `ss` to confirm Memcached is listening on the specified IP address.

### Threats Mitigated:

*   **Unauthorized Access from Public Internet (High Severity):** Prevents direct access to Memcached from the internet if the server is inadvertently exposed.
*   **Internal Network Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):** Limits access from other potentially compromised systems within the internal network if bound to a more restrictive private IP.

### Impact:

*   **Unauthorized Access from Public Internet:** High risk reduction. Makes Memcached inaccessible from outside the intended network.
*   **Internal Network Lateral Movement:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the attack surface within the internal network.

### Currently Implemented:

Implemented in all environments (development, staging, production). Configuration managed by infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) ensuring consistent binding to private network interfaces.

### Missing Implementation:

No missing implementation. Configuration is consistently applied across all Memcached instances.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Network Segmentation and Firewall Rules](./mitigation_strategies/implement_network_segmentation_and_firewall_rules.md)

### Description:

1.  **Network Segmentation:** Place Memcached servers in a dedicated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) subnet or VLAN, isolated from public-facing application servers and other less trusted network segments.
2.  **Firewall Configuration (Network Level):** Configure network firewalls (e.g., AWS Security Groups, iptables) to allow inbound TCP connections to Memcached port (default 11211) *only* from the IP addresses or CIDR blocks of authorized application servers. Deny all other inbound traffic to the Memcached subnet.
3.  **Firewall Configuration (Host Level - Optional):**  Optionally, configure host-based firewalls (e.g., `ufw`, `firewalld`) on the Memcached servers themselves to further restrict access to the Memcached port, mirroring the network firewall rules for defense in depth.
4.  **Regularly Review Firewall Rules:** Periodically review and audit firewall rules to ensure they remain accurate and effective.

### Threats Mitigated:

*   **Unauthorized Access from Public Internet (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access from the internet even if binding is misconfigured or bypassed.
*   **Internal Network Lateral Movement (High Severity):** Significantly restricts lateral movement within the internal network to Memcached servers.
*   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by limiting access to the cached data.
*   **DoS Attacks (Medium Severity):** Mitigates some forms of DoS attacks by limiting the sources that can connect to Memcached.

### Impact:

*   **Unauthorized Access from Public Internet:** High risk reduction. Provides a strong barrier against external access.
*   **Internal Network Lateral Movement:** High risk reduction. Limits the impact of compromised systems within the network.
*   **Data Breaches:** High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the attack surface for data exfiltration.
*   **DoS Attacks:** Medium risk reduction. Less effective against distributed DoS but helps against targeted attacks from specific networks.

### Currently Implemented:

Implemented in production and staging environments. Memcached servers are in a dedicated VPC subnet with strict Security Group rules allowing access only from application server subnets. Network ACLs are also in place for additional security layer.

### Missing Implementation:

Host-based firewalls are not currently implemented on Memcached servers. This could be added as an additional layer of defense in depth.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_configuration.md)

### Description:

1.  **Access Memcached server configuration:** Locate the Memcached server configuration file or startup script.
2.  **Set memory limit:** Add or modify the `-m <megabytes>` option to specify the maximum memory Memcached can use.
3.  **Set connection limit:** Add or modify the `-c <connections>` option to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections.
4.  **Set file descriptor limit (optional):** Add the `-r` option to limit open files per connection if needed.
5.  **Set thread count (optional):** Adjust the `-t <threads>` option based on server CPU cores and workload characteristics.
6.  **Restart Memcached service:** Restart Memcached for the changes to take effect.
7.  **Monitor resource usage:** Monitor Memcached memory usage, connection count, and other relevant metrics to ensure limits are appropriately configured.

### Threats Mitigated:

*   **Memory Exhaustion DoS (High Severity):** Prevents attackers or unexpected application behavior from consuming all server memory, leading to crashes or performance degradation.
*   **Connection Flooding DoS (Medium Severity):** Limits the impact of connection flooding attacks by restricting the number of concurrent connections.
*   **Resource Starvation for Other Services (Medium Severity):** Prevents Memcached from consuming excessive resources that could impact other services running on the same server (if applicable).

### Impact:

*   **Memory Exhaustion DoS:** High risk reduction. Prevents a critical DoS vector.
*   **Connection Flooding DoS:** Medium risk reduction. Mitigates but doesn't completely eliminate connection flooding.
*   **Resource Starvation for Other Services:** Medium risk reduction. Improves overall system stability in shared environments.

### Currently Implemented:

Memory limit (`-m`) and connection limit (`-c`) are configured in production and staging environments via Ansible. Values are based on server size and expected application load.

### Missing Implementation:

File descriptor limit (`-r`) and thread count (`-t`) are not explicitly configured. These could be reviewed and potentially implemented for further resource control and optimization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Run Memcached as a Dedicated User with Minimal Privileges](./mitigation_strategies/run_memcached_as_a_dedicated_user_with_minimal_privileges.md)

### Description:

1.  **Create a dedicated user:** Create a new system user specifically for running Memcached (e.g., `memcacheduser`). Do not grant this user root or administrator privileges.
2.  **Change ownership of Memcached files:** Ensure the Memcached executable, configuration files, and any related directories are owned by the dedicated user and group.
3.  **Configure service to run as dedicated user:** Modify the Memcached service configuration (e.g., systemd service file) to specify the `User=` and `Group=` directives to run the Memcached process under the newly created user account.
4.  **Restrict file system permissions:**  Ensure the dedicated user has only the necessary permissions to read configuration files, write log files (if enabled), and access any other required resources.
5.  **Restart Memcached service:** Restart the Memcached service for the changes to take effect.

### Threats Mitigated:

*   **Privilege Escalation after Compromise (High Severity):** Limits the impact of a potential vulnerability in Memcached or misconfiguration. If compromised, the attacker gains only the privileges of the dedicated user, not root.
*   **System-Wide Damage from Malicious Code (High Severity):** Reduces the potential for malicious code running within Memcached to cause widespread damage to the system.

### Impact:

*   **Privilege Escalation after Compromise:** High risk reduction. Significantly limits the potential damage from a successful exploit.
*   **System-Wide Damage from Malicious Code:** High risk reduction. Reduces the blast radius of a security incident.

### Currently Implemented:

Implemented in production and staging environments. Memcached service is configured to run as a dedicated `memcached` user created during server provisioning.

### Missing Implementation:

Not implemented in development environments for ease of local setup. This should be considered for development environments as well to maintain consistent security practices across all environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Memcached](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_memcached.md)

### Description:

1.  **Establish update process:** Define a process for regularly checking for and applying Memcached updates.
2.  **Test updates in non-production:** Before applying updates to production, thoroughly test them in a staging or development environment.
3.  **Apply updates promptly:** Once updates are tested and validated, apply them to production Memcached servers in a timely manner, especially security patches.
4.  **Automate updates (where possible):** Consider automating the update process using configuration management tools.

### Threats Mitigated:

*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Protects against attacks that exploit publicly known security vulnerabilities in older versions of Memcached.

### Impact:

*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Prevents exploitation of known weaknesses.

### Currently Implemented:

Partially implemented. We have a process for monitoring security advisories, but updates are currently applied manually during maintenance windows.

### Missing Implementation:

Automation of Memcached updates is missing. Implementing automated updates via Ansible would improve the timeliness and consistency of patching.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring and Logging Memcached Activity](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring_and_logging_memcached_activity.md)

### Description:

1.  **Enable Memcached logging:** Configure Memcached to log relevant events, such as connection attempts and errors. Configure log rotation and retention policies.
2.  **Implement monitoring system:** Set up a monitoring system to collect and visualize Memcached metrics, including hit rate, miss rate, connection count, and memory usage.
3.  **Set up alerts:** Configure alerts in the monitoring system to notify administrators of unusual activity or performance degradation.
4.  **Regularly review logs and monitoring data:** Periodically review Memcached logs and monitoring dashboards.

### Threats Mitigated:

*   **Security Incident Detection (Medium Severity):** Improves detection of security incidents related to Memcached.
*   **Performance Degradation Detection (Medium Severity):** Enables early detection of performance issues related to Memcached.
*   **Operational Issues Detection (Medium Severity):** Helps identify operational problems with Memcached servers.

### Impact:

*   **Security Incident Detection:** Medium risk reduction. Improves incident response capabilities.
*   **Performance Degradation Detection:** Medium risk reduction. Improves application availability and performance.
*   **Operational Issues Detection:** Medium risk reduction. Improves system stability and maintainability.

### Currently Implemented:

Memcached metrics are collected and visualized using Prometheus and Grafana in production and staging environments. Basic alerts are configured for high CPU and memory usage.

### Missing Implementation:

More comprehensive logging of Memcached activity (beyond basic errors) is not enabled. Alerting could be expanded to include more Memcached-specific metrics like hit rate and eviction rate.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consider SASL Authentication (If Supported and Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/consider_sasl_authentication__if_supported_and_applicable_.md)

### Description:

1.  **Check Memcached version and client library support:** Verify if your Memcached server version and client libraries support SASL authentication.
2.  **Enable SASL in Memcached configuration:** Configure Memcached to enable SASL authentication.
3.  **Configure client libraries for SASL:** Modify your application code to use client libraries configured to authenticate with Memcached using SASL credentials.
4.  **Manage SASL credentials securely:** Implement secure storage and management of SASL usernames and passwords.
5.  **Test SASL authentication:** Thoroughly test SASL authentication in a non-production environment.

### Threats Mitigated:

*   **Unauthorized Access within Trusted Network (Medium Severity):** Adds an authentication layer to Memcached, preventing unauthorized access even from within the trusted network.

### Impact:

*   **Unauthorized Access within Trusted Network:** Medium risk reduction. Adds an extra layer of security in environments with higher security requirements.

### Currently Implemented:

Not implemented. SASL authentication is not currently used for Memcached in any environment.

### Missing Implementation:

SASL authentication is not implemented.  This could be considered for future implementation if security requirements increase and network-level security is deemed insufficient.
