# Threat Model Analysis for memcached/memcached

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Unencrypted Network Communication](./threats/data_leakage_through_unencrypted_network_communication.md)

Description: Memcached, by default, transmits data in plain text over TCP. An attacker performing network sniffing on the network segment where Memcached traffic flows can intercept and read sensitive data being exchanged between the application and the Memcached server. This is possible if the network is not properly secured, for example, if Memcached is on a shared network or if the attacker has compromised a machine on the same network.
Impact: Confidentiality breach, disclosure of sensitive data cached in Memcached. This can include user credentials, session tokens, personal information, or business-critical data, leading to identity theft, unauthorized access, financial loss, and reputational damage.
Memcached Component Affected: Network Communication (TCP protocol)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement Network Segmentation to isolate the Memcached server within a dedicated private network, restricting network access only to authorized application servers.
    * Utilize IP Address Binding to configure Memcached to listen only on specific internal IP addresses, further limiting network exposure.
    * Encrypt sensitive data at the application level *before* storing it in Memcached. Decrypt it after retrieval from the cache.
    * If your Memcached version and client library support it, or via a proxy, investigate and implement TLS encryption for network communication.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks.md)

Description: An attacker can flood the Memcached server with a large volume of requests, overwhelming its processing capacity, memory, and network bandwidth. This can lead to performance degradation, service disruption, or complete unavailability of the Memcached service, impacting the application's performance and potentially causing downtime. Attackers might exploit the lack of strong authentication in default Memcached configurations to amplify the attack.
Impact: Availability compromise, application slowdown, service disruption, and potential application downtime. Degraded user experience and potential business disruption.
Memcached Component Affected: Memcached Service (Server resource exhaustion, request processing)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Configure Rate Limiting and Connection Limits within Memcached to restrict the number of requests and connections from individual clients or IP addresses.
    * Deploy Network Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to filter malicious traffic and block DoS attacks before they reach the Memcached server.
    * Implement Resource Monitoring and Alerting for the Memcached server to detect potential DoS attacks or resource exhaustion in real-time.
    * For high-availability applications, consider using a distributed Memcached cluster to improve resilience against DoS attacks and single-server failures.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Memcached Service](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_memcached_service.md)

Description: By default, Memcached typically lacks strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. If the Memcached port (default 11211) is exposed on a network, especially the public internet, anyone who can reach this port can potentially connect and interact with the Memcached service. This allows unauthorized users to read, modify, or delete cached data, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
Impact: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability compromise. Data breaches due to unauthorized data access, data manipulation leading to application malfunction, and denial of service through malicious data operations or server overload.
Memcached Component Affected: Access Control (Lack of strong default authentication and authorization)
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * **Crucially:** Never expose the Memcached port directly to the public internet. Ensure Memcached is only accessible from trusted internal networks.
    * Implement Network Segmentation and Firewalls to strictly control network access to the Memcached server, allowing connections only from authorized application servers.
    * Utilize IP Address Binding to configure Memcached to listen only on specific internal IP addresses, further restricting access.
    * If your Memcached version and client library support it, implement SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) authentication to control access to the Memcached service and require authentication for connections.
    * Implement Application-Level Authorization to control which parts of the application or which users are allowed to access or modify specific cached data, adding an additional layer of access control.
