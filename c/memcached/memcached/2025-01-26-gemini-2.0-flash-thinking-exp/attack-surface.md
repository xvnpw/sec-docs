# Attack Surface Analysis for memcached/memcached

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Network Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_network_exposure.md)

Description: Memcached is accessible from untrusted networks due to improper network configuration, allowing unauthorized connections.

Memcached Contribution: By default, Memcached listens on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), making it inherently exposed if not explicitly restricted by network controls.

Example: A Memcached instance deployed in a cloud environment has its port `11211` open to the public internet due to misconfigured security group rules.

Impact: Complete unauthorized access to Memcached. Attackers can read, write, and delete any data in the cache, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service. In severe cases, exploitation of potential vulnerabilities in Memcached itself could lead to server compromise.

Risk Severity: Critical

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Network Segmentation: Deploy Memcached within a private network segment, isolated from public networks.
*   Strict Firewall Rules: Implement and enforce firewall rules (network and host-based) to restrict access to Memcached port `11211` exclusively from trusted application servers.
*   Bind to Loopback/Internal Interface: Configure Memcached to listen only on `127.0.0.1` (loopback) if accessed only locally or a specific private network interface.

## Attack Surface: [Missing or Weak Authentication/Authorization](./attack_surfaces/missing_or_weak_authenticationauthorization.md)

Description: Lack of proper authentication mechanisms allows any network-accessible client to interact with Memcached without verification.

Memcached Contribution: Historically, Memcached lacked built-in authentication. While SASL support is available in newer versions, it's often not enabled by default or may be misconfigured. Older, vulnerable versions might still be in use.

Example: A Memcached instance is running with default settings (no authentication). An attacker who gains network access (even within an internal network if segmentation is weak) can connect and execute arbitrary Memcached commands, including reading sensitive cached data or injecting malicious data.

Impact: Complete unauthorized data access and manipulation. Attackers can read sensitive information, poison the cache with malicious data, or perform denial of service by flushing or overloading the cache. This can lead to significant application compromise and data breaches.

Risk Severity: High to Critical (Critical if sensitive data is cached and accessible)

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Enable SASL Authentication (if supported by Memcached version):  Utilize SASL authentication mechanisms like `PLAIN` or `CRAM-MD5` to require clients to authenticate before accessing Memcached.
*   Strong Credentials Management: If using SASL, enforce strong, unique passwords or credentials and manage them securely.
*   Upgrade to Secure Version: Upgrade to the latest stable Memcached version that includes security enhancements and SASL support.
*   Principle of Least Privilege (Application Level): Implement application-level authorization to control access to specific cached data based on user roles or permissions, even if Memcached authentication is in place, for finer-grained control.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

Description: Attackers can intentionally exhaust Memcached server resources (memory, connections) to disrupt service availability for legitimate users and applications.

Memcached Contribution: Memcached, by design, relies on available system resources. Without proper configuration and protection, it can be vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks.

Example: An attacker floods the Memcached server with a large number of `set` commands with extremely large data values, rapidly consuming all available memory and causing the server to become unresponsive or crash. Alternatively, a connection flood attack can exhaust connection limits.

Impact: Service disruption and application downtime. Applications relying on Memcached will experience performance degradation or complete failure, impacting users and business operations.

Risk Severity: High (can be Critical depending on application dependency and business impact of downtime)

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Resource Limits Configuration:  Carefully configure Memcached resource limits, including `-m` (memory limit), `-c` (connection limit), and other relevant parameters to prevent excessive resource consumption.
*   Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting mechanisms at the application level or using network devices to restrict the number of requests to Memcached from a single source within a given timeframe, mitigating flood attacks.
*   Connection Limits (Application Side):  Limit the number of connections the application opens to Memcached to prevent accidental or malicious connection exhaustion.
*   Monitoring and Alerting:  Continuously monitor Memcached resource usage (memory, connections, CPU) and set up alerts to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks proactively.

## Attack Surface: [Cache Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/cache_poisoning.md)

Description: Attackers with write access (due to lack of authentication or compromised access) inject malicious or incorrect data into the cache, corrupting data integrity and potentially leading to application vulnerabilities.

Memcached Contribution: Memcached's design allows clients with write access to overwrite existing cache entries. If access control is weak, this can be exploited for cache poisoning.

Example: An attacker gains unauthorized write access to Memcached. They inject malicious JavaScript code into a cached HTML fragment. When the application retrieves and serves this poisoned fragment to users, it results in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in user browsers.

Impact: Data integrity compromise, application malfunction, serving incorrect or malicious content to users, potential security vulnerabilities in applications relying on cached data (e.g., XSS, business logic flaws).

Risk Severity: High (can be Critical depending on the sensitivity of cached data and the impact of data corruption on the application)

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Strong Access Control: Implement robust access control to Memcached, ensuring only authorized and trusted application components have write access. This is primarily achieved through authentication and network segmentation.
*   Input Validation and Sanitization (Before Caching):  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data *before* it is stored in Memcached to prevent injection of malicious content.
*   Data Integrity Checks (Post-Retrieval): Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of cached data after retrieval, such as checksums or digital signatures, to detect and reject potentially poisoned entries.
*   Secure Cache Invalidation Strategies:  Use appropriate cache invalidation strategies to ensure that cached data is regularly refreshed from trusted and validated sources, reducing the window of opportunity for poisoned data to persist.
