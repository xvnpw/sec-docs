## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Access Memcached Server](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__access_memcached_server.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker's initial goal is to gain access to the Memcached server. This is a critical node because without access, most other attacks are not possible.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting lack of authentication (see below).
    *   Compromising a machine on the same network and using it to access Memcached.
    *   Network sniffing (less likely if binary protocol or encryption is used).
*   **Impact:**  Successful access allows the attacker to read, modify, and delete cached data, and potentially perform DoS attacks.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Implement strong access controls (network restrictions, authentication if feasible).
    *   Network segmentation to limit access from untrusted networks.
    *   Regular security audits to ensure access controls are in place and effective.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Lack of Authentication [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_lack_of_authentication__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Memcached, by default, does not have built-in authentication. This is a major vulnerability if not properly mitigated. This path is high-risk because it's a common misconfiguration and easy to exploit.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Publicly Accessible Memcached Instance [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** If Memcached is exposed to the internet or an untrusted network without access controls, anyone can connect.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Direct Access from Internet [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  The most direct and dangerous scenario. An attacker can directly connect to the publicly accessible Memcached instance.
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Simply connecting to the Memcached port (default 11211) from the internet using `telnet`, `nc`, or Memcached client libraries.
            *   **Impact:** Full, unauthenticated access to Memcached.  Complete control over cached data, potential for data manipulation, information disclosure, and DoS.
            *   **Mitigation: [CRITICAL NODE] Bind Memcached to localhost or private network interface, use firewall rules to restrict access.** This is the **most critical mitigation**. Ensure Memcached only listens on localhost (127.0.0.1) or a private network interface and use firewalls to restrict access to only authorized machines.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Manipulate Cached Data](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__manipulate_cached_data.md)

*   **Description:** Once access to Memcached is gained, manipulating the cached data is a primary attack goal. This is a critical node because it directly impacts the application's functionality and data integrity.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Data Injection/Poisoning [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Overwriting legitimate cached data with malicious content. This path is high-risk because it can directly lead to application compromise.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Using Memcached `set` commands to inject attacker-controlled data.
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Set commands to overwrite legitimate cached data with attacker-controlled content. [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** The attacker uses `set` commands with known or guessed keys to replace valid cached data.
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Using Memcached client libraries or command-line tools to send `set` commands with crafted keys and malicious values.
                *   **Impact:**
                    *   **Application logic manipulation:**  If the application relies on cached data for logic or decisions, poisoning the cache can alter application behavior.
                    *   **Potential XSS:** If cached data is rendered in web pages without proper output encoding, injected malicious scripts can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
                    *   **Session hijacking:** If session IDs or session data are cached, poisoning can lead to session hijacking.
                    *   **Bypass security checks:** If cached data is used for authorization or security checks, poisoning can bypass these checks.
                *   **Mitigation: [CRITICAL NODE] Input validation on data stored in Memcached (at application level), data integrity checks, use appropriate data serialization/deserialization, consider data signing/HMAC for critical cached data.**  Application-level input validation and data integrity checks are crucial to prevent data poisoning.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Buffer Overflow/Memory Corruption](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__buffer_overflowmemory_corruption.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Memcached's code itself, such as buffer overflows or memory corruption bugs. While less common in mature software, these are critical due to their potential severity.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in Memcached parsing or processing logic.
    *   Crafting specific Memcached commands or data payloads to trigger vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Crashing the Memcached server.
    *   **Potential Code Execution:** In some cases, memory corruption vulnerabilities can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on the Memcached server.
*   **Mitigation: [CRITICAL NODE] Keep Memcached updated to latest stable version, monitor security advisories, use memory-safe programming practices in Memcached development (if contributing).**  Regularly updating Memcached is essential to patch known vulnerabilities.
