# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for memcached/memcached

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Binding (Direct Memcached Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/network_binding__direct_memcached_configuration_.md)

*   **1. Network Binding (Direct Memcached Configuration)**

    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Network Access via Binding.

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Bind to Specific IP:** Modify the Memcached startup configuration (e.g., `/etc/memcached.conf` or command-line arguments) to bind *only* to the internal IP address(es) of the application servers that need access.  Use the `-l` option.  Example: `memcached -l 192.168.1.10`.  *Never* use `0.0.0.0` in production. This is a direct configuration change within Memcached.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from directly connecting to and interacting with the Memcached server from unauthorized locations.
        *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: Critical):**  Reduces the risk of attackers stealing cached data.
        *   **Data Modification/Deletion (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from altering or deleting cached data.
        *   **Reconnaissance (Severity: High):** Makes it harder for attackers to discover the Memcached server.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low* (in conjunction with firewall rules).
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low*.
        *   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low*.
        *   **Reconnaissance:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Binding to specific IP: Implemented on server `memcached-01` (192.168.1.10).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Binding to specific IP: *Missing* on server `memcached-02` (currently bound to 0.0.0.0).  **URGENT ACTION REQUIRED.**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication (SASL - Direct Memcached Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/authentication__sasl_-_direct_memcached_configuration_.md)

*   **2. Authentication (SASL - Direct Memcached Configuration)**

    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable SASL Authentication.

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Compile with SASL:** Ensure Memcached was compiled with SASL support (`--enable-sasl`).  If not, recompile.
        2.  **SASL Configuration:** Create a SASL configuration file (e.g., `sasl.conf`).  Choose a mechanism (CRAM-MD5 is recommended over PLAIN unless TLS is used via a proxy).  Define users and passwords.
        3.  **Start with `-S`:** Start Memcached with the `-S` command-line option to enable SASL authentication. This is a direct configuration change within Memcached.
        4.  **(Client-side, but required):** Update application code to use SASL credentials.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):**  Requires authentication.
        *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: Critical):**  Protects cached data.
        *   **Data Modification/Deletion (Severity: Critical):**  Prevents unauthorized changes.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low*.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low*.
        *   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   SASL is *completely missing*.  *High priority*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [UDP Protocol Disablement (Direct Memcached Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/udp_protocol_disablement__direct_memcached_configuration_.md)

*   **3. UDP Protocol Disablement (Direct Memcached Configuration)**

    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable UDP if Not Required.

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Assess UDP Necessity:** Determine if UDP is *actually* required.
        2.  **Start with `-U 0`:** If UDP is *not* needed, start Memcached with the `-U 0` command-line option.  This completely disables the UDP listener. This is a direct configuration change within Memcached.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Amplification Attacks (DRDoS) (Severity: High):**  Eliminates the primary vector.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Amplification Attacks:** Risk reduced from *High* to *None* (if UDP is unused).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Implemented on `memcached-01`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   *Missing* on `memcached-02`.  **URGENT ACTION REQUIRED.**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates and Patching (Directly Affects Memcached)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_and_patching__directly_affects_memcached_.md)

*   **4. Regular Updates and Patching (Directly Affects Memcached)**

    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Keep Memcached Updated.

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check for new releases.
        2.  **Test Updates:** Test in a staging environment before production.
        3.  **Apply Updates:**  Apply security updates and bug fixes promptly. This directly involves updating the Memcached software itself.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable, potentially Critical):**  Addresses vulnerabilities in Memcached.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced significantly.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Manual update process in place.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automated update process is not yet implemented.
