## Attack Tree Path: [1. Unauthorized Data Access/Modification](./attack_tree_paths/1__unauthorized_data_accessmodification.md)

*   **1.1 Cache Poisoning**

    *   **1.1.1 CRLF Injection [CRITICAL] (Conditional - High Risk if input validation is weak):**
        *   **Description:** The attacker injects carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`) into Memcached input to craft multiple commands within a single request. This allows them to inject `set` commands, overwriting existing keys with malicious data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on input validation).
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (arbitrary data modification).
        *   **Effort:** Low.
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.
    *   **1.1.2 Unsafe Deserialization [CRITICAL] (Conditional - if used):**
        *    **Description:** If the application stores serialized objects in Memcached and uses an unsafe deserialization method (e.g., Python's `pickle` without validation), an attacker can craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
        *    **Likelihood:** Low (requires specific vulnerable configuration) to Very Low (if secure serialization is used).
        *    **Impact:** Very High (Remote Code Execution).
        *    **Effort:** Medium to High.
        *    **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert.
        *    **Detection Difficulty:** Hard.

*   **1.2 Data Tampering**

    *   **1.2.1 Direct Access (No Authentication/Authorization) [CRITICAL] (High Risk if no authentication):**
        *   **Description:** If Memcached is exposed without authentication or with default credentials, an attacker can directly connect and use commands like `set`, `replace`, and `delete` to modify or delete data.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if no authentication) to Very Low (if authentication is enforced).
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (full control over cached data).
        *   **Effort:** Very Low.
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with network monitoring) to Medium (with Memcached logs).

    *   **1.2.2 Lack of Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL] (High Risk if weak authorization):**
        *   **Description:** Even with authentication, if authorization controls are not properly implemented (e.g., all authenticated users have full access), an attacker with *any* valid credentials can tamper with data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if authentication is present but authorization is weak).
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High.
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **2.1 Resource Exhaustion**

    *   **2.1.2 Connection Exhaustion [CRITICAL] (High Risk):**
        *   **Description:** The attacker opens a large number of connections to the Memcached server, exhausting the server's connection limit and preventing legitimate clients from connecting.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on network configuration and rate limiting).
        *   **Impact:** High (service unavailability).
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (network monitoring will show a spike in connections).
