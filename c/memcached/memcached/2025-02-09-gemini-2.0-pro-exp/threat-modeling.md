# Threat Model Analysis for memcached/memcached

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access](./threats/unauthorized_data_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains network access to the Memcached server (e.g., through a compromised application server, network misconfiguration, or direct attack if exposed publicly) and issues commands to retrieve all cached data. The attacker uses standard Memcached commands like `get`, `gets`, or tools like `memcached-tool` to dump the cache contents.  This is a *direct* attack on Memcached itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive data stored in the cache (session tokens, user data, API keys, etc.).
    *   Potential for account takeover, data breaches, and privacy violations.
    *   Loss of confidentiality.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Core Memcached server process.
    *   Network interface.
    *   Data storage (slabs).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if sensitive data is cached without encryption) or High (if only non-sensitive data is cached, but still accessible without authentication).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Memcached on a private network, accessible only to authorized application servers. Use strict firewall rules.
    *   **SASL Authentication:** Implement SASL authentication with strong, unique credentials. Rotate credentials regularly.
    *   **Data Encryption (at rest and in transit):** Encrypt sensitive data *before* storing it in the cache. Use TLS for encrypted communication between the application and Memcached.
    *   **Short TTLs:** Use short Time-To-Live values for sensitive data.

## Threat: [Memcached Amplification DDoS Attack](./threats/memcached_amplification_ddos_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends small, spoofed UDP requests to a publicly exposed Memcached server. The server responds with much larger responses directed at the victim's IP address, amplifying the attack traffic and overwhelming the victim's network. This is a *direct* attack leveraging a Memcached feature (UDP response).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of service for the victim of the amplified attack.
    *   Potential network congestion and disruption for other services.
    *   Loss of availability.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Memcached UDP listener (if enabled).
    *   Network interface.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (for publicly exposed, UDP-enabled servers).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable UDP:** If UDP is not needed, disable it in the Memcached configuration (`-U 0`). This is the *primary* mitigation.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** *Never* expose Memcached to the public internet.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Network Level):** Implement rate limiting at the network level.
    *   **Source IP Verification:** Drop packets with spoofed source IP addresses.
    *   **Update Memcached:** Use a recent version with built-in mitigations.

## Threat: [Use of Default/Weak Credentials](./threats/use_of_defaultweak_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** If SASL authentication is enabled, but default or easily guessable credentials are used, an attacker can easily authenticate to the Memcached server and gain full access to the cached data. This is a *direct* attack on the Memcached authentication mechanism.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized data access.
    *   Potential for data breaches and privacy violations.
    *   Loss of confidentiality.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   SASL authentication module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong, Unique Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for Memcached SASL authentication.
    *   **Password Rotation:** Regularly rotate credentials.

## Threat: [Running an Outdated Memcached Version](./threats/running_an_outdated_memcached_version.md)

*   **Description:** Older versions of Memcached may contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities *directly* against the Memcached service to gain unauthorized access, cause a denial of service, or potentially execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Varies depending on the specific vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Potentially any part of the Memcached codebase, depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Memcached up-to-date with the latest security patches. Subscribe to security advisories.
