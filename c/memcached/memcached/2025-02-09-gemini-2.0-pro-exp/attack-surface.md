# Attack Surface Analysis for memcached/memcached

## Attack Surface: [Network Exposure and Unauthorized Access](./attack_surfaces/network_exposure_and_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** Direct access to the `memcached` service from untrusted networks allows attackers to interact with the service directly.
*   **Memcached Contribution:** `memcached`'s default configuration (especially in older versions) does not include authentication, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access if exposed. It listens on a well-known port (11211).
*   **Example:** An attacker scans for open port 11211 on the internet and finds an exposed `memcached` instance. They connect and issue commands to read, write, or delete data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data leakage (sensitive information stored in the cache).
    *   Data modification/deletion (disruption of service, data loss).
    *   Cache poisoning (leading to further attacks on application users).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Bind `memcached` to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) or a private network interface *only* accessible to the application servers.  Never bind to 0.0.0.0 without strong additional security.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Use strict firewall rules (e.g., `iptables`, cloud provider firewalls) to allow access to port 11211 *only* from authorized IP addresses/ranges.
    *   **VPN/Private Network:** Utilize a VPN or private network (e.g., VPC peering) to isolate `memcached` and application servers.
    *   **SASL Authentication:** *Always* enable SASL authentication (available in `memcached` 1.4.3 and later). Configure strong, unique usernames and passwords. Ensure the client library also uses SASL.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Store `memcached` credentials in a secure secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

## Attack Surface: [Data Leakage](./attack_surfaces/data_leakage.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data stored in `memcached` can be read by attackers who gain access to the service.
*   **Memcached Contribution:** `memcached` itself does not encrypt data at rest.  It stores data in plain text in memory.
*   **Example:** An application stores session tokens in `memcached`. An attacker gains access and retrieves these tokens, allowing them to impersonate users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise of user accounts.
    *   Exposure of sensitive business data.
    *   Violation of privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Application-Level Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data *before* storing it in `memcached` and decrypt it *after* retrieval.  The application is responsible for encryption/decryption.
    *   **Robust Key Management:** Use a secure key management system for the encryption keys. Never hardcode keys.

## Attack Surface: [Data Modification and Deletion](./attack_surfaces/data_modification_and_deletion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can modify or delete data stored in `memcached`, disrupting application functionality or causing data loss.
*   **Memcached Contribution:** `memcached` provides commands to modify and delete data (e.g., `set`, `replace`, `delete`). Without authentication, these commands are available to anyone who can connect.
*   **Example:** An attacker deletes all keys in `memcached`, causing the application to lose cached data and potentially experience performance degradation or errors.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of service (application becomes unavailable or slow).
    *   Data loss (if `memcached` is used as a primary data store, which is *not* recommended).
    *   Application errors and instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **SASL Authentication:** (As described above) is the primary defense against unauthorized modification/deletion.

## Attack Surface: [Software Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_surfaces/software_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

*   **Description:** `memcached` itself, like any software, can have vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
*   **Memcached Contribution:** The vulnerability exists within the `memcached` codebase itself.
*   **Example:** A CVE is discovered that allows remote code execution in a specific version of `memcached`. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the server running `memcached`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote code execution (complete system compromise).
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Other severe consequences depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific CVE)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay Updated:** *Always* run the latest stable version of `memcached`.  Subscribe to security mailing lists and apply patches promptly.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan your systems for known vulnerabilities, including those related to `memcached`.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run `memcached` as a non-root user with limited privileges.
