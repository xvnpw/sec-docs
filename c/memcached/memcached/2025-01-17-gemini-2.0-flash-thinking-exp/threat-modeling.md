# Threat Model Analysis for memcached/memcached

## Threat: [Unauthorized Network Access](./threats/unauthorized_network_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains network connectivity to the Memcached instance without proper authorization. They might scan for open ports and attempt to connect to the default Memcached port (11211). This is a direct consequence of Memcached's default behavior of listening on all interfaces without built-in authentication.

**Impact:**
* **Data Breach:** The attacker can retrieve all data stored in the cache.
* **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete cached data, leading to application inconsistencies or denial of service.
* **Resource Exhaustion:** The attacker can flood the Memcached instance with requests, causing performance degradation or crashes.

**Affected Component:** Network Listener (the component responsible for accepting incoming connections).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement firewall rules to restrict access to the Memcached port (11211) to only authorized servers.
* Bind Memcached to a non-public interface (e.g., localhost or a private network IP).
* Utilize network segmentation to isolate the Memcached server within a secure network zone.

## Threat: [Data Breach via Unencrypted Communication](./threats/data_breach_via_unencrypted_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the Memcached server. Memcached, by default, transmits data in plain text over TCP.

**Impact:**
* **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive data stored in the cache is exposed to the attacker.

**Affected Component:** Network Communication (the process of sending and receiving data over the network).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize network-level encryption technologies like IPsec or VPNs to secure communication between the application and Memcached.
* Consider using a Memcached proxy that supports encryption (though this adds complexity).
* Avoid storing highly sensitive data in Memcached if end-to-end encryption is not feasible.

## Threat: [Data Manipulation (Cache Poisoning)](./threats/data_manipulation__cache_poisoning_.md)

**Description:** An attacker with network access to Memcached can directly set or modify cached values. This is due to the lack of built-in authentication and authorization in Memcached.

**Impact:**
* **Application Logic Compromise:** The application might make incorrect decisions based on the poisoned data.
* **User Impact:** Users might receive incorrect information or experience application malfunctions.
* **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Maliciously crafted cached data could be used to bypass security checks in the application.

**Affected Component:** Data Storage and Retrieval (the core functionality of setting and getting cached values).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly control network access to the Memcached instance (see "Unauthorized Network Access").
* Implement application-level validation of data retrieved from the cache to ensure its integrity.
* Consider using a more robust caching solution with built-in authentication and authorization if data integrity is paramount.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the Memcached server with a large number of requests, overwhelming its resources and making it unresponsive. Memcached's relatively simple request processing can make it susceptible to this.

**Impact:**
* **Application Unavailability:** The application's performance degrades significantly or becomes unavailable due to its reliance on Memcached.
* **Resource Exhaustion:** The Memcached server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) are consumed, potentially impacting other services on the same machine.

**Affected Component:** Request Processing (the component responsible for handling incoming client requests).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on the application side to restrict the number of requests sent to Memcached.
* Utilize network-level traffic shaping or filtering to mitigate large-scale DoS attacks.
* Ensure the Memcached server has sufficient resources to handle expected traffic spikes.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Memcached Software Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_memcached_software_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit known security vulnerabilities in the Memcached software itself. This could involve sending specially crafted requests to trigger bugs or security flaws within Memcached's code.

**Impact:**
* **Remote Code Execution:** In severe cases, attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the Memcached server.
* **Denial of Service:** Vulnerabilities could be exploited to crash the Memcached instance.
* **Data Manipulation:** Vulnerabilities could allow attackers to bypass access controls and manipulate cached data.

**Affected Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., parsing logic, command processing).

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the Memcached software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Subscribe to security advisories related to Memcached to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
