## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memcached Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memcached_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This is a critical area as it represents directly attacking weaknesses in the Memcached software itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Memcached Bugs [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_memcached_bugs__critical_.md)

This focuses on leveraging publicly documented flaws in specific Memcached versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Vulnerable Memcached Version](./attack_tree_paths/identify_vulnerable_memcached_version.md)

Attackers first need to determine the Memcached version to target known exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Publicly Available Exploit [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_publicly_available_exploit__critical_.md)

This is the action of using existing exploit code to take advantage of a vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow (e.g., in command parsing)](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow__e_g___in_command_parsing_.md)

A specific type of vulnerability where sending more data than a buffer can hold overwrites adjacent memory, potentially leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__critical_.md)

The highly critical outcome of a successful buffer overflow or similar exploit, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses__critical_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting insecure settings of the Memcached instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Memcached Running with Default Configuration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/memcached_running_with_default_configuration__critical_.md)

A common misconfiguration where Memcached is used with its default settings, often lacking security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [No Authentication Enabled [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/no_authentication_enabled__critical_.md)

A critical security flaw where Memcached does not require any credentials to access it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly Access Memcached Port [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/directly_access_memcached_port__critical_.md)

With no authentication, attackers can directly connect to the Memcached port (typically 11211) if it's exposed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Retrieve Cached Data](./attack_tree_paths/retrieve_cached_data.md)

Once connected, attackers can use commands to read the data stored in the cache.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Cached Data [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_cached_data__critical_.md)

A highly impactful action where attackers can inject or change the data stored in the cache, potentially manipulating application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Cached Data](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_cached_data.md)

This broad category involves altering the contents of the cache to influence the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cache Poisoning [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/cache_poisoning__critical_.md)

The technique of inserting malicious data into the cache to cause the application to behave incorrectly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Cache [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_cache__critical_.md)

The direct action of writing harmful data into the Memcached instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite Legitimate Data with Malicious Content [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_legitimate_data_with_malicious_content__critical_.md)

Replacing valid cached data with attacker-controlled information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Serves Malicious Content to Users [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/application_serves_malicious_content_to_users__critical_.md)

The severe consequence of successful cache poisoning, where users receive harmful data from the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Logic Incorrectly Uses Malicious Data [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/application_logic_incorrectly_uses_malicious_data__critical_.md)

When the application trusts and processes the poisoned data, leading to unintended and potentially harmful actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__attacks.md)

Actions aimed at making the Memcached service unavailable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion.md)

Overwhelming the Memcached server with requests or data to consume its resources.
