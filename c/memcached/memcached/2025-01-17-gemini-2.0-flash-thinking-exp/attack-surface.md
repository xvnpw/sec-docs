# Attack Surface Analysis for memcached/memcached

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Network Communication](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_network_communication.md)

**Description:** Data transmitted between the application and the Memcached server is not encrypted by default.

**How Memcached Contributes:** Memcached's standard protocol operates over plain TCP, lacking built-in encryption.

**Example:** An attacker on the same network as the application and Memcached server uses a network sniffer to capture sensitive data being exchanged, such as user credentials or session information stored in the cache.

**Impact:** Data breach, exposure of confidential information.

**Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is cached).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use SSH tunneling or a VPN to encrypt the communication channel between the application and Memcached.
*   Consider using Memcached extensions or wrappers that provide encryption capabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Memcached Port to Untrusted Networks](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_memcached_port_to_untrusted_networks.md)

**Description:** The Memcached port (default 11211) is accessible from networks that should not have access.

**How Memcached Contributes:** Memcached listens on a specific port, and if not properly firewalled, it can be reached from anywhere.

**Example:** An attacker from the public internet connects to the Memcached port and attempts to read or write data, potentially accessing or manipulating cached information.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential for denial-of-service attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure firewalls to restrict access to the Memcached port only to trusted application servers.
*   Bind Memcached to specific network interfaces that are not publicly accessible.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Built-in Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_built-in_authentication_and_authorization.md)

**Description:** Standard Memcached does not provide built-in mechanisms to authenticate clients or authorize access to specific data.

**How Memcached Contributes:** This is a fundamental design choice of standard Memcached, prioritizing simplicity and performance over security features.

**Example:** A rogue application or a compromised server on the same network as the Memcached server can connect and access or modify cached data without any authentication.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential for malicious data injection.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Rely on network-level security (firewalls, network segmentation) to restrict access to the Memcached server.
*   Consider using Memcached forks or extensions that offer authentication features if the application requires it.

## Attack Surface: [Storage of Sensitive Data in Plain Text](./attack_surfaces/storage_of_sensitive_data_in_plain_text.md)

**Description:** The application stores sensitive information in Memcached without encryption at the application layer.

**How Memcached Contributes:** Memcached stores data exactly as it is provided by the application.

**Example:** The application caches user credentials or personally identifiable information (PII) in Memcached without encrypting it first. If the Memcached server is compromised or network traffic is intercepted, this sensitive data is exposed.

**Impact:** Data breach, exposure of confidential information, regulatory compliance violations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Encrypt sensitive data at the application layer before storing it in Memcached.
*   Avoid caching highly sensitive data in Memcached if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Data Corruption or Manipulation by Unauthorized Write Access](./attack_surfaces/data_corruption_or_manipulation_by_unauthorized_write_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains write access to the Memcached server and modifies or corrupts cached data.

**How Memcached Contributes:** Memcached allows write operations to anyone with network access by default, if not properly secured.

**Example:** An attacker with unauthorized access to the Memcached port modifies cached user roles or product prices, leading to application malfunction or financial loss.

**Impact:** Application malfunction, serving incorrect data to users, potential for business logic flaws exploitation.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly control network access to the Memcached server using firewalls and network segmentation.
