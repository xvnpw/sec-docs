### High and Critical SQLite Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the SQLite library:

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code into input fields that are not properly sanitized or parameterized. This allows them to execute unintended SQL commands *within the SQLite database*. They might read sensitive data, modify existing data, delete data, or even potentially execute operating system commands if SQLite extensions are enabled and vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality loss), data manipulation (integrity loss), data destruction (availability loss), potential for remote code execution (if extensions are misused).
    *   **Affected Component:** SQLite Core - SQL Parser and Execution Engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all SQL interactions involving user-supplied data.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-supplied data *before* incorporating it into SQL queries.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for database access *within the application's SQLite interactions*.
        *   Regularly review and audit SQL queries for potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Database File Corruption
    *   **Description:** Unexpected system behavior (e.g., power outage during a write operation) or bugs within SQLite's transaction management or file I/O can lead to corruption of the SQLite database file. This can result in data loss, application crashes, or unpredictable behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss (availability and integrity loss), application downtime, potential for data inconsistencies.
    *   **Affected Component:** SQLite Core - Database File Format, Transaction Management, and File I/O operations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize SQLite's Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode for improved resilience against corruption.
        *   Ensure proper error handling for database operations, especially write operations.
        *   Implement regular database backups and have a recovery plan in place.
        *   Ensure the underlying storage medium is reliable.

*   **Threat:** Loading Malicious Extensions
    *   **Description:** SQLite supports loading extensions (dynamically linked libraries) to add functionality. If the application allows loading extensions from untrusted sources or doesn't properly validate them, an attacker could load a malicious extension that executes arbitrary code within the process hosting SQLite, bypasses security restrictions enforced by the application, or directly compromises the database.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution within the application's process, privilege escalation within the application's context, data breach, complete compromise of the application's data.
    *   **Affected Component:** SQLite Core - Extension Loading Mechanism (`sqlite3_load_extension`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable the ability to load extensions if they are not strictly necessary.
        *   If extensions are required, only load them from trusted and verified sources.
        *   Implement strict validation and sandboxing for loaded extensions if possible.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the application's execution environment.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the SQLite Library
    *   **Description:** Like any software, SQLite itself might contain security vulnerabilities. If the application uses an outdated version of SQLite with known vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit these flaws *within the SQLite library* to compromise the application or the underlying system.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution within the application's process.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various components within the SQLite library depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the SQLite library to the latest stable version.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for SQLite.
        *   Implement a process for patching and updating dependencies promptly.

*   **Threat:** Compromised SQLite Distribution
    *   **Description:** Although highly unlikely for the official SQLite distribution, if the application uses a compromised or tampered version of the SQLite library, it could introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious code *directly within the SQLite library*.
    *   **Impact:** Can be severe, potentially leading to remote code execution within the application's process, data breaches, and complete compromise of the application's data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Entire SQLite library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (due to potential impact, though likelihood is low for official distributions).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Obtain the SQLite library from trusted and official sources (e.g., the official SQLite website, reputable package managers).
        *   Verify the integrity of the downloaded library using checksums or digital signatures.
        *   Implement security scanning of dependencies.
