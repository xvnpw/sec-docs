# Attack Surface Analysis for sqlite/sqlite

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application queries, leading to unauthorized database access or manipulation.

**How SQLite Contributes:** SQLite executes the dynamically constructed SQL queries provided by the application. If the application doesn't sanitize user input, SQLite will interpret and execute the injected malicious code.

**Example:** An application constructs a query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '"+ userInput +"'`. If `userInput` is `' OR '1'='1'`, the query becomes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'`, bypassing authentication.

**Impact:** Data breaches (reading sensitive data), data modification or deletion, potential execution of arbitrary SQL commands within the database context.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This ensures user input is treated as data, not executable code.
*   **Developers:** Implement input validation and sanitization to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before using them in queries (though parameterization is the primary defense).

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Database Files](./attack_surfaces/malformed_database_files.md)

**Description:** Attackers provide specially crafted, invalid, or malicious SQLite database files to the application.

**How SQLite Contributes:** SQLite's parsing engine processes the provided database file. Vulnerabilities in this parsing logic can be triggered by malformed files, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.

**Example:** An attacker provides a database file with a corrupted header or invalid schema information, causing SQLite to crash or behave unpredictably when the application attempts to open or interact with it.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash), potential for exploitation of vulnerabilities in the parsing engine (though less common for RCE).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Validate the integrity and structure of database files before using them. This might involve checksums or schema validation.
*   **Developers:** Ensure database files are sourced from trusted locations and are not directly modifiable by untrusted users.
*   **Users:** Be cautious about opening database files from unknown or untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in SQLite Extensions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_sqlite_extensions.md)

**Description:** If the application uses loadable SQLite extensions, vulnerabilities within those extensions can be exploited.

**How SQLite Contributes:** SQLite allows loading of external code modules (extensions) that can extend its functionality. If these extensions contain security flaws, they become part of the application's attack surface.

**Example:** A vulnerable extension might have a buffer overflow that can be triggered by providing specific input, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (if the extension is vulnerable), data breaches, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical if RCE is possible)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Only load extensions from trusted and reputable sources.
*   **Developers:** Thoroughly vet and audit the source code of any loaded extensions.
*   **Developers:** Consider using sandboxing or isolation techniques for extensions if possible.
*   **Users:** Be aware of the extensions loaded by the application and their potential risks.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Specific SQLite Versions](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_specific_sqlite_versions.md)

**Description:** Older versions of SQLite may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

**How SQLite Contributes:** The specific implementation of SQLite in a given version might have bugs or security flaws that can be triggered by specific inputs or actions.

**Example:** An older version of SQLite might have a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be triggered by a specially crafted SQL query, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Can range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution, depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Keep the SQLite library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
*   **Developers:** Regularly monitor security advisories for SQLite and update accordingly.
*   **Users:** Ensure the applications they use are based on up-to-date versions of SQLite.
