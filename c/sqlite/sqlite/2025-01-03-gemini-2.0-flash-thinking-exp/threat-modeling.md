# Threat Model Analysis for sqlite/sqlite

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries by injecting code into input fields or other data sources that are used to construct SQL statements executed by SQLite. This allows the attacker to bypass intended application logic and execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (reading sensitive data), data modification or deletion, potential for privilege escalation within the database, and in some cases, even operating system command execution if SQLite extensions are enabled and vulnerable.
    *   **Affected Component:** SQL Parser, Query Execution Engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements)** to separate SQL code from user-provided data.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization to filter out potentially malicious characters and patterns before using data in SQL queries.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to database users, limiting their access to only the necessary data and operations.
        *   Regularly update the SQLite library to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Loaded SQLite Extensions](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_loaded_sqlite_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** If the application loads external SQLite extensions, vulnerabilities within those extensions could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise, data breaches, depending on the privileges of the process running the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Extension Loading Mechanism, Specific Extension Code
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only load trusted and well-vetted SQLite extensions.
        *   Keep all loaded extensions updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the application process, limiting the potential impact of a compromised extension.
        *   Consider disabling the ability to load extensions in production environments if it's not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [SQL Injection Leading to Operating System Command Execution (if `load_extension()` is enabled)](./threats/sql_injection_leading_to_operating_system_command_execution__if__load_extension____is_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If the `load_extension()` function is enabled in SQLite and accessible through SQL injection vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially load and execute arbitrary code on the server by loading a malicious shared library.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** `load_extension()` Function
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable the `load_extension()` function in production environments unless absolutely necessary and its usage is strictly controlled.**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection, which is the primary vector for exploiting this vulnerability.
        *   Implement strong access controls to restrict who can execute arbitrary SQL commands.
