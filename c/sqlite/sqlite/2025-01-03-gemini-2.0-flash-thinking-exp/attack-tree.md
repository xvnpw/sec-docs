## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH START]:**
    *   Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application queries to manipulate the database.

    *   **Inject Malicious SQL via User Input [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities where user-supplied data is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
            *   **Exploit Unsanitized Input in Queries [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Craft SQL Payload to Extract Sensitive Data [HIGH RISK]:**  Injecting SQL to retrieve confidential information from the database.
                *   **Craft SQL Payload to Modify Data [HIGH RISK]:** Injecting SQL to alter or delete data within the database.
                *   **Craft SQL Payload to Execute Arbitrary Code (via features like `LOAD_EXTENSION` if enabled and accessible) [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE if LOAD_EXTENSION is enabled]:** Injecting SQL to load and execute malicious code on the server if the `LOAD_EXTENSION` feature is enabled and accessible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQLite File Access Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sqlite_file_access_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Exploit SQLite File Access Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH START]:**
    *   Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the application handles file paths to access or manipulate the SQLite database file and potentially other files.

    *   **Achieve Arbitrary File Read [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Gaining the ability to read any file on the server that the application has access to.
            *   **Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:** Manipulating file paths to access files outside the intended directories.
                *   **Read Sensitive Data from the SQLite Database File [HIGH RISK]:** Using path traversal to directly read the SQLite database file, bypassing application access controls.

    *   **Achieve Arbitrary File Write [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Gaining the ability to write to any file on the server that the application has access to.
            *   **Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:** Manipulating file paths to write to arbitrary locations.
                *   **Overwrite the SQLite Database File with Malicious Data [HIGH RISK]:** Replacing the legitimate database file with a compromised one.
                *   **Overwrite Application Configuration Files [HIGH RISK]:** Modifying configuration files to alter application behavior or inject malicious settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQLite Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sqlite_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Exploit SQLite Library Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Attackers leverage bugs or weaknesses within the SQLite library itself.

    *   **Trigger Memory Corruption Bugs:**
        *   Exploiting flaws in memory management within the SQLite library.
            *   **Exploit Buffer Overflows in SQLite Parsing Logic [HIGH RISK PATH START if vulnerable version]:** Sending specially crafted SQL statements or data that exceed buffer limits, potentially leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in SQLite Extensions (if used)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_sqlite_extensions__if_used_.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in SQLite Extensions (if used) [HIGH RISK PATH START if extensions are used]:**
    *   Attackers target vulnerabilities within any loaded SQLite extensions.

    *   **Leverage Extension Functionality for Malicious Purposes [HIGH RISK]:** Abusing the intended functionality of an extension to achieve malicious goals.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Specific SQLite Features for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_specific_sqlite_features_for_malicious_purposes.md)

*   **Abuse Specific SQLite Features for Malicious Purposes:**
    *   Attackers misuse built-in SQLite features to compromise the application.

    *   **Exploit `LOAD EXTENSION` Functionality (if enabled) [HIGH RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE if enabled]:**
        *   Leveraging the `LOAD EXTENSION` feature to load and execute external code.
            *   **Load a Malicious Dynamic Library [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE if enabled]:** Loading a specially crafted dynamic library containing malicious code.
                *   **Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE if enabled]:**  Achieving the ability to run any code on the server.

    *   **Attach a Maliciously Crafted Database:**
        *   Using the `ATTACH DATABASE` command to connect a malicious database to the application's current connection.
            *   **Execute Malicious SQL from the Attached Database [HIGH RISK]:** Running malicious SQL code contained within the attached database.
            *   **Overwrite Data in the Main Database [HIGH RISK]:** Using the attached database to modify data in the application's primary database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQLite's Type System Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sqlite's_type_system_weaknesses.md)

*   **Exploit SQLite's Type System Weaknesses:**
    *   Attackers exploit the flexible type system of SQLite to bypass security checks or cause unexpected behavior.

    *   **Leverage Type Confusion Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Providing data of an unexpected type to trigger errors or bypass security measures.
            *   **Bypass Security Checks Based on Type Assumptions [HIGH RISK]:**  Subverting security checks that rely on specific data types being enforced.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Application Compromise via SQLite Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_application_compromise_via_sqlite_exploitation.md)

*   **Achieve Application Compromise via SQLite Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has gained unauthorized access or control over the application.
