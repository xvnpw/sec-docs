Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving SQLite, focusing on high and critical severity:

*   **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Improperly sanitized user input is directly incorporated into SQL queries, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   **How SQLite Contributes:** SQLite's query execution engine processes these malicious commands, leading to unintended actions on the database. The lack of inherent input sanitization within SQLite itself necessitates careful handling by the application.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a username from user input and constructs a query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '` + userInput + `'`. If `userInput` is `' OR '1'='1`, the query becomes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'`, bypassing authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (accessing sensitive data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), authentication bypass, and potentially remote code execution (depending on SQLite extensions or application logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection by treating user input as data, not executable code.
        *   **Implement Strict Input Validation:** Validate the type, format, and length of user input before using it in SQL queries.
        *   **Employ Output Encoding:** Encode data retrieved from the database before displaying it to prevent secondary injection vulnerabilities in other parts of the application.

*   **Malicious Database Files**
    *   **Description:** The application loads or interacts with a database file provided by an untrusted source, which contains malicious SQL code or schema modifications.
    *   **How SQLite Contributes:** SQLite executes the SQL code embedded within the malicious database file when the application connects to it or performs operations. This can include triggers that execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a database file with a trigger defined on a table. When the application performs an operation on that table (e.g., an INSERT), the trigger executes malicious code, potentially gaining access to the server's file system or other resources.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service, and compromise of the application's integrity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Load Database Files from Untrusted Sources:** Only use database files that are created and managed by the application itself or come from explicitly trusted sources.
        *   **Implement Integrity Checks:** If loading external database files is necessary, implement mechanisms to verify their integrity and authenticity (e.g., using cryptographic signatures).
        *   **Run SQLite with Restricted Permissions:** Ensure the application and the SQLite process have the minimum necessary file system permissions to prevent malicious database files from causing widespread damage.

*   **Loading Malicious Extensions**
    *   **Description:** The application allows loading SQLite extensions from untrusted sources or doesn't properly validate them, leading to the execution of arbitrary code within the application's process.
    *   **How SQLite Contributes:** SQLite's `sqlite3_load_extension` function allows loading shared libraries that can extend its functionality. If a malicious library is loaded, it gains the same privileges as the application.
    *   **Example:** An attacker convinces the application to load a malicious extension disguised as a legitimate one. This extension could contain code to open network connections, read files, or execute system commands.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Extension Loading if Not Required:** If the application doesn't need to load extensions, disable this functionality entirely.
        *   **Only Load Extensions from Trusted Sources:**  Maintain a whitelist of trusted extension paths or names and only allow loading from these locations.
        *   **Implement Strict Validation of Extensions:** If dynamic loading is necessary, implement rigorous checks on the extension files before loading them (e.g., verifying digital signatures).

*   **Abuse of PRAGMA Statements for File Operations**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit the ability to execute `PRAGMA` statements to perform unauthorized file system operations if the application doesn't restrict their execution.
    *   **How SQLite Contributes:** Certain `PRAGMA` statements, like those related to attaching databases or vacuuming, can interact with the file system. If an attacker can control these statements, they might be able to manipulate files.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a `PRAGMA database_list;` statement to discover the paths of attached databases, potentially revealing sensitive information about the application's structure. In more severe cases, depending on application logic, they might try to manipulate attached databases.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential data manipulation in attached databases, and in some scenarios, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict the Execution of PRAGMA Statements:**  Limit the ability of users or external input to directly execute `PRAGMA` statements. Only allow the application to execute necessary `PRAGMA` commands internally.
        *   **Sanitize Input for PRAGMA Statements:** If allowing some control over `PRAGMA` statements is unavoidable, strictly sanitize any input used to construct them to prevent malicious manipulation of file paths or other parameters.
        *   **Run SQLite with Restricted File System Permissions:** Limit the file system access of the application and the SQLite process to minimize the impact of potential file system manipulation.
