# Threat Model Analysis for sqlite/sqlite

## Threat: [Direct File System Access to SQLite Database File](./threats/direct_file_system_access_to_sqlite_database_file.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the server's file system. They can then directly download, modify, or delete the SQLite database file, bypassing application access controls.
**Impact:** Data breach (sensitive information exposed), data modification/corruption (application malfunction), denial of service (database deletion or locking).
**Affected SQLite Component:** Database File (Storage Layer)
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong file system access controls (Principle of Least Privilege).
* Store database files in non-publicly accessible directories.
* Regularly audit file permissions.
* Consider encrypting the database file at rest.

## Threat: [Path Traversal to Access SQLite Database File](./threats/path_traversal_to_access_sqlite_database_file.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a path traversal vulnerability in the application code to access SQLite database files located outside the intended application directory. They can then download, modify, or delete the database file.
**Impact:** Data breach, data modification/corruption, denial of service.
**Affected SQLite Component:** Database File (Storage Layer), Application Code (Interaction with File System)
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities in application code.
* Avoid constructing file paths using user-supplied input directly.
* Use secure file path handling functions provided by the programming language/framework.

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of SQLite Database File](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_sqlite_database_file.md)

**Description:** Misconfiguration of web servers or cloud storage services makes the SQLite database file publicly accessible via the internet. An attacker can directly download the database file.
**Impact:** Data breach.
**Affected SQLite Component:** Database File (Storage Layer), Web Server/Cloud Storage Configuration
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Properly configure web servers and cloud storage to prevent direct access to database files.
* Ensure database files are not placed in publicly accessible web directories.
* Regularly audit web server and cloud storage configurations.

## Threat: [SQLite Specific SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/sqlite_specific_sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits SQL injection vulnerabilities in the application code, leveraging SQLite-specific features like dynamic typing, `ATTACH DATABASE`, or loadable extensions to execute malicious SQL queries. This can be achieved by injecting malicious input into application input fields or URLs.
**Impact:** Data breach, data modification, denial of service, potentially code execution (in specific scenarios with extensions).
**Affected SQLite Component:** SQL Engine (Query Processing), Extensions (if used), Application Code (Query Construction)
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements.**
* Sanitize and validate all user inputs before using them in SQL queries.
* Disable or restrict the use of loadable extensions if not strictly necessary.
* Carefully review and sanitize input used in `ATTACH DATABASE` commands if required.
* Be aware of SQLite's dynamic typing and handle type conversions carefully in application code.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in SQLite Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_sqlite_library_itself.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities present in the SQLite library version used by the application. This could be achieved by triggering specific conditions that expose the vulnerability.
**Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, denial of service, potentially code execution.
**Affected SQLite Component:** Core SQLite Library (Various Modules depending on the vulnerability)
**Risk Severity:** Varies (Critical to High depending on the vulnerability)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regularly update the SQLite library to the latest stable version.**
* Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to SQLite.
* Implement a vulnerability management process to track and patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Use of Untrusted or Malicious SQLite Extensions](./threats/use_of_untrusted_or_malicious_sqlite_extensions.md)

**Description:** An attacker loads or tricks the application into loading untrusted or malicious SQLite extensions. This could be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in extension loading mechanisms or through social engineering. Malicious extensions can execute arbitrary code within the application process.
**Impact:** Code execution, data breach, denial of service.
**Affected SQLite Component:** Extension Loading Mechanism, Extensions
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Disable extension loading if not strictly necessary.**
* Only load extensions from trusted and verified sources.
* Implement strict controls over which extensions can be loaded and by whom.
* Regularly audit loaded extensions for security vulnerabilities.
* Use operating system level security features to restrict extension loading paths.
