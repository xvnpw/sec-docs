# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sqlite/sqlite

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements) - *SQLite Specific SQL Injection Prevention*](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries__prepared_statements__-_sqlite_specific_sql_injection_prevention.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all SQL queries in your application that interact with your SQLite database and incorporate user-provided input.
    2.  Utilize parameterized queries, a feature supported by SQLite and its client libraries, instead of constructing SQL queries by directly embedding user input strings.
    3.  Employ the placeholder syntax (e.g., `?`, `:name`, `@name`) provided by your chosen SQLite library within your SQL query strings.
    4.  Pass user-supplied values as separate parameters to the SQLite execution function. The SQLite library then handles proper escaping and binding of these parameters, ensuring they are treated as data, not executable SQL code.
    5.  Verify that your ORM or data access layer is configured to leverage parameterized queries when interacting with SQLite.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity): Specifically mitigates SQL injection vulnerabilities within your SQLite database interactions. Attackers cannot inject malicious SQL code through user input to manipulate your SQLite database structure or data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Risk Reduction - Effectively eliminates SQL injection risks when interacting with SQLite, assuming correct implementation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Data Access Layer for User Authentication and Profile Management uses parameterized queries for all database interactions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Reporting Module, which currently uses string formatting for some filter parameters in SQLite queries, needs to be refactored to use parameterized queries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict File System Permissions for SQLite Database File - *SQLite File Security*](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_file_system_permissions_for_sqlite_database_file_-_sqlite_file_security.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Determine the specific user and group accounts under which your application process runs that accesses the SQLite database file.
    2.  Configure file system permissions on the SQLite database file to grant read and write access *only* to the identified application user and group.
    3.  Remove all read, write, and execute permissions for other users and groups on the system.
    4.  Ensure the directory containing the SQLite database file also has appropriately restricted permissions to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of the database file itself or its containing directory.
    5.  Regularly audit and maintain these file permissions, especially after system updates or changes in application deployment configurations that might affect user/group assignments.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access (Medium Severity): Prevents unauthorized local users or processes from directly accessing and reading the SQLite database file, protecting sensitive data stored within SQLite.
    *   Data Tampering/Modification (Medium Severity): Prevents unauthorized local users or processes from directly modifying or deleting the SQLite database file, ensuring the integrity and availability of your SQLite data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access: Medium Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to the SQLite database from within the local system.
    *   Data Tampering/Modification: Medium Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized modification or deletion of the SQLite database from within the local system.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Deployment scripts include steps to set specific file permissions on the SQLite database file during application setup.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Automated integration tests to verify that the correct file permissions are applied to the SQLite database file after deployment in different environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure SQLite Database File Location (Outside Web Root) - *Preventing Direct Web Access to SQLite File*](./mitigation_strategies/secure_sqlite_database_file_location__outside_web_root__-_preventing_direct_web_access_to_sqlite_fil_d76bb667.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Choose a storage location for your SQLite database file that is situated *outside* of the web server's document root directory and any other publicly accessible directories served by your web server.
    2.  Configure your application to access the SQLite database file from this secure, non-public location using a file path that is not directly resolvable or accessible via web URLs.
    3.  Double-check your web server configurations (e.g., Apache, Nginx, IIS) to ensure they do not inadvertently serve files from the directory where your SQLite database is stored. Explicitly deny web access to this directory if necessary.
    4.  Avoid placing the SQLite database file in common web-accessible directories such as `public`, `www`, `html`, `htdocs`, or any directory directly mapped to a URL path.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Direct Database Download/Exposure (High Severity): Prevents attackers from directly requesting and downloading the SQLite database file via web requests. If the database file were accessible via the web, it could lead to a complete data breach.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Direct Database Download/Exposure: High Risk Reduction - Eliminates the risk of direct web-based download and exposure of the SQLite database file.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - The SQLite database file is stored in a dedicated `app-data` directory located outside the web application's root directory. Application configuration settings point to this secure location.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Web server configuration review to explicitly deny web access to the `app-data` directory and its subdirectories as a defense-in-depth measure, even though it's already outside the web root.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Query Complexity Limits and Timeouts - *SQLite DoS Prevention via Query Control*](./mitigation_strategies/implement_query_complexity_limits_and_timeouts_-_sqlite_dos_prevention_via_query_control.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Analyze typical and expected query patterns within your application's interaction with SQLite to understand normal query complexity and execution times.
    2.  Implement application-level logic to monitor and potentially reject or terminate SQLite queries that are deemed excessively complex or long-running, especially those originating from user-controlled inputs.
    3.  Set appropriate timeouts for SQLite database queries at the application level. This prevents queries from consuming excessive resources indefinitely if they become stuck, inefficient, or are part of a deliberate Denial of Service (DoS) attempt targeting SQLite.
    4.  Consider using query analysis tools or techniques (if available within your development environment or SQLite library) to assess query complexity *before* execution, allowing for proactive prevention of resource-intensive queries.
    5.  Log and monitor instances where query limits or timeouts are triggered to help identify potential DoS attacks or areas where application queries might be inefficient and need optimization.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries (Medium Severity): Mitigates resource exhaustion attacks against your application's SQLite database by limiting the impact of intentionally crafted, overly complex, or inefficient queries designed to overload SQLite.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the impact of DoS attacks that rely on overwhelming SQLite with resource-intensive queries, but may not prevent all types of DoS attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - A default database connection timeout is configured within the application's database settings.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Application-level logic to dynamically analyze query complexity or set query execution time limits based on query type, user roles, or other contextual factors.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Loadable Extensions (If Not Required) - *Reduce SQLite Attack Surface*](./mitigation_strategies/disable_loadable_extensions__if_not_required__-_reduce_sqlite_attack_surface.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Carefully evaluate whether your application genuinely requires the use of SQLite extensions for any of its core functionalities.
    2.  If SQLite extensions are not essential, disable the capability to load extensions at runtime. This can often be achieved through compile-time options when building SQLite or by using runtime configuration settings provided by your SQLite library or wrapper.
    3.  Consult the documentation specific to your SQLite library and build process for detailed instructions on how to disable loadable extension support.
    4.  When using pre-compiled SQLite binaries, if possible, opt for versions that are built without extension loading enabled. If not, configure your SQLite library to prevent the loading of extensions at runtime.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious Extension Loading (Medium to High Severity): Prevents attackers from potentially loading and executing malicious SQLite extensions. If extension loading is enabled and exploitable, attackers could use this to bypass security measures, execute arbitrary code within the application's context, or gain unauthorized access to the system.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Extension Loading: High Risk Reduction - Eliminates the risk of malicious extension loading if extensions are not needed. If extensions are required, this mitigation is not applicable, and other extension security measures become crucial.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project -  The current SQLite build process and library configuration are not explicitly set to disable loadable extensions. The default behavior is assumed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hypothetical Project -  Explicitly configure the SQLite build process or runtime settings to disable loadable extensions. Verify the current build configuration and update it to disable extensions if they are not actively used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation for Data Types and Formats - *SQLite Data Integrity and Type Handling*](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_for_data_types_and_formats_-_sqlite_data_integrity_and_type_handling.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Clearly define and document the expected data types and formats for all user inputs that will be used in interactions with your SQLite database.
    2.  Implement robust input validation routines within your application code to rigorously check if user-provided input conforms to these predefined data type and format expectations *before* the data is used in SQLite queries or database operations.
    3.  Validate data types (e.g., ensure input intended as an integer is indeed an integer), formats (e.g., verify email addresses conform to expected patterns, dates are in the correct format), and ranges (e.g., check if numerical inputs fall within acceptable minimum and maximum values).
    4.  Reject any input that fails validation and provide informative error messages to the user, guiding them to correct their input.
    5.  Leverage strong typing features of your programming language wherever feasible to further enforce data type constraints and reduce the likelihood of type-related errors when interacting with SQLite.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity): Prevents the insertion of unexpected or malformed data into the SQLite database due to incorrect input types or formats. This helps maintain data consistency and prevents application errors or unexpected behavior arising from invalid data within SQLite.
    *   Exploitation of Type Coercion (Low to Medium Severity): Reduces the potential for attackers to exploit SQLite's flexible type coercion behavior for malicious purposes. While parameterized queries are the primary defense against SQL injection, robust input validation adds a secondary layer of defense against type-related vulnerabilities that might arise from unexpected data types being processed by SQLite.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Integrity Issues: Medium Risk Reduction - Significantly improves the quality and consistency of data stored in SQLite, leading to more stable and predictable application behavior.
    *   Exploitation of Type Coercion: Low to Medium Risk Reduction - Provides an additional layer of defense against potential vulnerabilities related to SQLite's type system, complementing parameterized queries.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Basic client-side input validation using JavaScript on web forms and server-side framework validation for common input fields like email and required fields.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hypothetical Project -  More comprehensive and database-schema-aware server-side validation. Validation logic needs to be expanded to cover all input fields that interact with the SQLite database, ensuring data types and formats strictly match database schema expectations. Review and strengthen validation, especially for less common or complex input fields.
