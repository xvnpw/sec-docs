## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via SQLite Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_sqlite_exploitation.md)

*   This is the root goal and represents the overall objective of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved some level of compromise within the application by exploiting SQLite related vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[AND] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit SQLite Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_and___critical_node__exploit_sqlite_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This branch focuses on directly exploiting vulnerabilities within the SQLite library itself. While less common than application-level misconfigurations, successful exploitation here can be severe.

    *   **[OR] [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Abuse SQLite-specific functions or features for malicious purposes (e.g., `load_extension` if enabled and accessible):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the application enables SQLite features like `load_extension` and an attacker can control or influence SQL queries, they might be able to load malicious shared libraries into the application process. `load_extension` allows loading SQLite extensions from files, and if this function is accessible and not properly controlled, it becomes a direct path to code execution.
        *   **Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution within the application's process, leading to full system compromise, data breach, and complete control over the application and potentially the underlying server.
        *   **Mitigation:** Disable `load_extension` if it is not absolutely necessary for the application's functionality. If required, strictly control the sources and paths from which extensions can be loaded and implement robust input validation to prevent attackers from injecting malicious paths or extension names into SQL queries.

    *   **[OR] [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Insecure extension loading mechanism:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Even if `load_extension` itself is not directly abused via SQL injection, vulnerabilities can arise from how the application handles extension loading. If the application allows loading extensions from untrusted sources (e.g., user-provided paths, network locations without proper verification), an attacker can provide a malicious extension.
        *   **Impact:** Critical. Loading a malicious extension is equivalent to code execution. The attacker gains control over the application process, leading to full system compromise, data breach, and complete control.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Never load SQLite extensions from untrusted sources. If extensions are needed, bundle them with the application or load them from a secure, controlled location. Implement strict verification and integrity checks for any loaded extensions.

    *   **[OR] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Denial of Service (DoS) via SQLite:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers can craft SQL queries designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) or cause database locking, leading to a Denial of Service. This can be achieved by sending complex queries, queries that return massive result sets, or queries that intentionally cause long-lasting locks.
        *   **Impact:** Medium. A successful DoS attack can make the application temporarily unavailable or significantly slow down its performance, disrupting services for legitimate users.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement resource limits for SQLite (e.g., query execution time limits, memory limits). Implement query complexity analysis and rejection of overly complex queries. Implement rate limiting on requests that interact with the database. Monitor database resource usage and set up alerts for anomalies.

## Attack Tree Path: [[AND] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Application's Insecure Use of SQLite](./attack_tree_paths/_and___critical_node__exploit_application's_insecure_use_of_sqlite.md)

*   This branch focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application *uses* SQLite, rather than bugs within SQLite itself. These are often due to misconfigurations or insecure development practices.

    *   **[OR] [CRITICAL NODE] Insecure Database File Handling:**
        *   This category encompasses vulnerabilities related to how the application manages the SQLite database file itself.

            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] World-Readable/Writable Database File:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** If the SQLite database file has overly permissive file permissions (e.g., world-readable or world-writable), anyone with access to the server's file system (including local users or attackers who have gained some level of access) can directly read or modify the database file.
                *   **Impact:** Critical. Direct access to the database file allows attackers to read all data, modify data, or even replace the database file entirely, leading to data breaches, data corruption, and complete application compromise.
                *   **Mitigation:**  Set strict file permissions on the SQLite database file. Ensure that only the application process has read and write access.  Typically, permissions should be set to restrict access to the application's user and group only.

            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Database File Stored in Web-Accessible Directory:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** If the SQLite database file is accidentally placed within a directory that is accessible via the web server (e.g., within the web root), an attacker can directly download the database file by simply requesting its URL in a web browser.
                *   **Impact:** Critical. Downloading the database file allows attackers to obtain a complete copy of all data stored in the database, leading to a complete data breach.
                *   **Mitigation:**  Never store the SQLite database file in a web-accessible directory. Store it in a secure location outside the web root, where it cannot be directly accessed via HTTP requests.

            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Lack of Encryption for Sensitive Data in Database:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** If sensitive data is stored unencrypted within the SQLite database, and an attacker gains access to the database file (through any of the file handling vulnerabilities or other means), the sensitive data is immediately exposed.
                *   **Impact:** Critical. Exposure of sensitive data can lead to severe consequences, including privacy violations, financial losses, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.
                *   **Mitigation:** Encrypt sensitive data *within* the database. This can be done at the application level before storing data in SQLite, or by using SQLite extensions that provide encryption capabilities.  Database file encryption (like full disk encryption) can provide an additional layer of security, but encryption at the data level within the database is crucial for protecting data even if the file is accessed.

    *   **[OR] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Application Logic Flaws Exacerbated by SQLite:**
        *   This category covers vulnerabilities where flaws in the application's logic, when interacting with SQLite, create security issues.

            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Information Disclosure via Error Messages:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** If the application exposes detailed SQLite error messages to users (e.g., in web page responses), these error messages can reveal sensitive information about the database structure, table names, column names, query syntax, or internal application logic. This information can be valuable for attackers in planning further attacks.
                *   **Impact:** Medium. Information disclosure can aid reconnaissance and make other attacks easier to execute. It can also directly leak sensitive data in some cases if error messages contain data excerpts.
                *   **Mitigation:** Implement generic error handling in the application. Avoid displaying detailed SQLite error messages to users in production environments. Log detailed error messages for debugging purposes, but ensure these logs are stored securely and not publicly accessible.

            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Business Logic Bypass via SQL Manipulation:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  If the application's business logic relies on assumptions about data or query results that can be manipulated through SQL queries (even without classic SQL injection vulnerabilities), an attacker can bypass intended business rules and perform unauthorized actions. This can involve crafting queries that exploit application logic flaws to modify data in unintended ways, access restricted resources, or manipulate business processes.
                *   **Impact:** Medium-High. Business logic bypass can lead to unauthorized actions, data manipulation, financial fraud, and disruption of business processes.
                *   **Mitigation:** Carefully design and implement application logic that interacts with the database. Validate all inputs thoroughly at the application level. Avoid relying solely on database constraints for security. Implement robust authorization and access control mechanisms within the application logic, independent of database-level permissions.  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and reduce the risk of unintended SQL manipulation.
