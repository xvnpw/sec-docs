# Attack Surface Analysis for sqlite/sqlite

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (SQLite Specific Nuances)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__sqlite_specific_nuances_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious SQL code into queries, manipulating database operations to gain unauthorized access, modify data, or execute arbitrary commands.
*   **SQLite Contribution:** SQLite's dynamic typing, `LIKE`, `GLOB`, `MATCH` operators, and `printf()` function within SQL queries can create specific injection vectors if input is not properly handled. Implicit type conversions can bypass intended type checks, increasing the attack surface compared to strictly typed SQL databases in certain scenarios.
*   **Example:** An application uses user input directly in a `LIKE` clause without escaping wildcards: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE 'user_input'`. An attacker inputs `%'; DROP TABLE users; --` leading to `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%; DROP TABLE users; --'`. This could delete the `users` table.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, potential denial of service, and in rare cases, potentially code execution (via `printf()` format string vulnerabilities, though less common in typical SQLite usage).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  This is the primary and most effective defense against SQL injection.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize user input to conform to expected formats and escape special characters relevant to SQL operators (especially for `LIKE`, `GLOB`, `MATCH`), even when using parameterized queries as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Surface: [Loading Malicious SQLite Extensions](./attack_surfaces/loading_malicious_sqlite_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers load malicious SQLite extensions into the application's SQLite instance to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access.
*   **SQLite Contribution:** SQLite's extensibility through loadable modules allows for adding custom functionality, but this directly introduces the risk of loading untrusted or malicious extensions that can execute code within the SQLite process, inheriting the application's privileges.
*   **Example:** An application, due to misconfiguration or vulnerability, allows loading extensions from user-controlled paths. An attacker places a malicious extension in a known location and triggers the application to load it, leading to code execution within the application process.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, privilege escalation, data breach, complete system compromise depending on the extension's capabilities and application privileges.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Extension Loading:** If extension loading is not strictly necessary for the application's functionality, disable it entirely in SQLite configuration. This is the most secure approach if extensions are not required.
    *   **Restrict Extension Loading Paths:** If extension loading is required, strictly control the paths from which extensions can be loaded. Use a whitelist of allowed, secure extension paths. Avoid loading from user-provided or world-writable directories.
    *   **Extension Whitelisting:**  Explicitly whitelist only trusted and necessary extensions. Do not load extensions dynamically based on user input or external configuration without rigorous security checks.
    *   **Code Signing and Verification (Advanced):** If possible, implement code signing and verification mechanisms for extensions to ensure their integrity and origin before loading. This is a more complex mitigation but provides stronger assurance.
