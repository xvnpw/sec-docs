# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sqlite/sqlite

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries__prepared_statements_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify SQLite queries:** Review application code to find all locations where SQL queries are executed against the SQLite database.
    2.  **Use parameter placeholders:** Replace direct string concatenation of user input into SQL queries with parameter placeholders (e.g., `?` in SQLite).
    3.  **Execute prepared statements:** Utilize the prepared statement functionality of your SQLite library (e.g., `sqlite3` in Python). Pass user-supplied data as separate parameters during query execution. The SQLite library handles escaping, preventing SQL injection.
    4.  **Test SQLite interactions:** Verify all database interactions use parameterized queries to eliminate SQLite-specific SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity) - Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into SQLite queries, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or DoS. This is a direct threat to SQLite database integrity and confidentiality.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Risk Reduction - Parameterized queries are the most effective method to prevent SQL injection in SQLite. Correct implementation virtually eliminates this threat.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in user authentication modules for SQLite queries related to login and registration. Parameterized queries are used for querying user credentials and inserting new user data into SQLite. (Located in `auth.py` and `user_management.py`).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in the data reporting module where dynamic SQLite queries are built based on user filters. String concatenation is used to construct filter conditions for SQLite queries. (Needs implementation in `reporting.py` file).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Database Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/database_size_limits.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Database Size Limits
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine SQLite database size limits:** Analyze application needs and define a maximum acceptable size for the SQLite database file to prevent unbounded growth.
    2.  **Monitor SQLite file size:** Implement monitoring to track the size of the SQLite database file.
    3.  **Enforce size limits for SQLite:** When the SQLite database size approaches the limit, implement actions to prevent further growth, such as data archiving within SQLite, data pruning from SQLite, or rejecting new data insertions into SQLite.
    4.  **Alert on SQLite size limits:** Configure alerts to notify administrators when the SQLite database size nears its limit.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to Disk Exhaustion (High Severity) - Uncontrolled growth of the SQLite database file can exhaust disk space, leading to application failure and DoS. This is a direct consequence of SQLite's file-based storage.
*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS due to Disk Exhaustion: High Risk Reduction - Enforcing size limits directly prevents DoS caused by uncontrolled SQLite database growth.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not currently implemented. No monitoring or limits are in place for the SQLite database file size.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Needs implementation in background tasks or monitoring modules to check the SQLite database file size and trigger alerts or data management actions when limits are approached. (Needs implementation in a new `database_monitoring.py` module or integrated into existing background tasks).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Resource Usage within SQLite (Pragmas)](./mitigation_strategies/control_resource_usage_within_sqlite__pragmas_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Control Resource Usage within SQLite (Pragmas)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify resource-intensive SQLite operations:** Analyze application's SQLite usage to find operations that might consume significant resources (e.g., large SQLite transactions, complex SQLite queries).
    2.  **Utilize SQLite pragmas for resource control:** Research and use relevant SQLite pragmas to limit resource consumption. Examples include `PRAGMA journal_size_limit`, `PRAGMA cache_size`, and `PRAGMA temp_store`.
    3.  **Configure SQLite pragmas:** Set pragma values during SQLite database connection initialization to restrict resource usage. Choose values that balance performance and resource constraints specific to SQLite.
    4.  **Test and monitor SQLite resource usage:** Test application performance with configured pragmas and monitor SQLite resource consumption in production to fine-tune pragma settings.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity) - Excessive resource consumption by SQLite (memory, disk I/O) can lead to DoS. Controlling SQLite's resource usage mitigates this.
    *   Performance Degradation (Medium Severity) - Uncontrolled SQLite resource usage can degrade application performance. Pragmas help maintain SQLite performance within acceptable limits.
*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS due to Resource Exhaustion: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the likelihood of resource-based DoS related to SQLite, but might not eliminate it entirely.
    *   Performance Degradation: High Risk Reduction - Effectively controls SQLite's resource usage, helping maintain application performance and stability related to SQLite operations.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. `PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;` is set during SQLite database initialization to improve write performance, but other resource-limiting pragmas are not configured. (Located in `database_init.py`).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing configuration of `PRAGMA journal_size_limit` and `PRAGMA cache_size` to explicitly limit SQLite journal file and cache sizes. These should be added to the SQLite database initialization process. (Needs implementation in `database_init.py`).

    2.  **Choose non-guessable path for SQLite file:** Select a database file location that is not easily guessable or predictable, making direct access to the SQLite file harder.
    3.  **Store SQLite file outside application root:** Ideally, store the SQLite database file outside of the application's root directory to further reduce discoverability and access from web-facing components.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of accidental or intentional direct access to the SQLite database file via web browsers or easily guessable paths. This is specific to the file-based nature of SQLite.
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity) - Prevents unintended disclosure of SQLite database contents if the file is accidentally exposed through a public web directory.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access: Medium Risk Reduction - Makes it harder for attackers to directly access the SQLite database file, but does not prevent access if they compromise the application or server.
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of accidental data leaks of the SQLite database through public web directories.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented. The SQLite database file is stored in a directory outside the web application's root directory, with a non-obvious path. (Deployment configuration and application file structure).
