## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit SQLite Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_sqlite_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Memory Corruption (e.g., Buffer Overflow):**
        *   **Maliciously Crafted SQL Input:** An attacker crafts specific SQL queries designed to overflow buffers within SQLite's parsing or execution engine. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. This often targets known vulnerabilities in specific SQLite versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Abuse SQLite Features in Unintended Ways](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_abuse_sqlite_features_in_unintended_ways.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit SQLite Extensions:**
        *   **Enabled Extension Loading:** The application enables the loading of external SQLite extensions, often using functions like `sqlite3_enable_load_extension`.
        *   **Loading Malicious Extensions:** An attacker, having gained some level of access to the server's filesystem or by exploiting a vulnerability allowing file uploads, places a malicious SQLite extension (`.so` or `.dll` file) on the server. The attacker then uses SQL commands (e.g., `SELECT load_extension('/path/to/malicious.so');`) to load and execute this malicious code within the SQLite process, achieving arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Abuse SQLite Triggers:**
        *   **Insecure Trigger Definitions:** The application defines SQLite triggers that perform actions based on user-controlled data without proper sanitization or validation.
        *   **Malicious Trigger Execution:** An attacker performs actions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) that trigger these insecurely defined triggers. The trigger's logic then executes malicious actions, such as modifying sensitive data, escalating privileges within the database, or even interacting with the operating system if the trigger logic allows (though this is less common and generally discouraged).

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Manipulate the SQLite Database File Directly](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_manipulate_the_sqlite_database_file_directly.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to the Database File:**
        *   **Exploiting File System Permissions:** The SQLite database file has overly permissive read and/or write access permissions on the server's filesystem. This allows an attacker with access to the server (potentially through other vulnerabilities) to directly read or modify the database file.
    *   **Inject Malicious Data into the Database File:**
        *   **Direct Database Modification:** Once the attacker has unauthorized access to the database file, they can use database editors or scripts (e.g., `sqlite3` command-line tool) to directly modify the database contents.
        *   **Compromising Application Logic:** The attacker alters critical data within the database, such as user credentials, permissions, application settings, or other data that directly influences the application's behavior. This can lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or disruption of application functionality.
