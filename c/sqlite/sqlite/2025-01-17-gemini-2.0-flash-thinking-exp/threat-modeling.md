# Threat Model Analysis for sqlite/sqlite

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code into application inputs that are then used to interact with the SQLite database. This exploits the SQLite SQL parser's ability to interpret and execute these injected commands, allowing the attacker to bypass intended logic and interact with the database in unintended ways. The attacker might attempt to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, modify data, or even execute administrative commands within the database.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
        *   **Data Integrity Violation:** Modification or deletion of critical data.
        *   **Authentication Bypass:** Circumventing login mechanisms.
        *   **Potential for Remote Code Execution (with vulnerable extensions):** In rare cases, if SQLite extensions are enabled and vulnerable, SQL injection could potentially lead to remote code execution on the server *due to the way SQLite handles extension execution*.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **SQL Parser:** The component responsible for interpreting and executing SQL statements.
        *   **Query Execution Engine:** The component that carries out the parsed SQL commands.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection by ensuring user input is treated as data, not executable code, *leveraging SQLite's prepared statement functionality*.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in SQLite Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_sqlite_library.md)

*   **Description:**  The SQLite library itself might contain security vulnerabilities (bugs) in its code. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted queries or data that trigger these bugs, potentially leading to crashes, information disclosure *within SQLite's memory space*, or even arbitrary code execution in the context of the application *due to flaws in SQLite's core functionality*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Application Crash (Denial of Service):**  Causing the application to terminate unexpectedly due to a fault in SQLite.
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Leaking sensitive data from memory *managed by SQLite* or the database.
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In severe cases, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the server running the application *by exploiting a fundamental flaw in SQLite's execution model*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various core modules of the SQLite library depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., parser, virtual machine, memory management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep SQLite Library Updated:** Regularly update the SQLite library to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities *within the SQLite codebase*.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security vulnerabilities reported for SQLite.

## Threat: [Malicious SQLite Extensions](./threats/malicious_sqlite_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows loading of SQLite extensions (using `sqlite3_load_extension`), an attacker could potentially load a malicious extension. This exploits SQLite's extension mechanism to execute arbitrary code within the application's process, granting the attacker significant control over the system. The vulnerability lies in SQLite's ability to load and execute dynamically linked libraries.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The attacker can execute any code on the server running the application *due to the unrestricted nature of SQLite's extension loading*.
        *   **Data Breach:** Access to all data the application has access to.
        *   **System Compromise:**  Complete control over the server.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Extension Loading Mechanism (`sqlite3_load_extension`):** The function within the SQLite library responsible for loading and executing extension code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Extension Loading if Not Needed:** If the application doesn't require SQLite extensions, disable the ability to load them *at the SQLite level*.
        *   **Restrict Extension Loading Paths:** If extension loading is necessary, restrict the paths from which extensions can be loaded to trusted locations *enforced by the application when calling `sqlite3_load_extension`*.
        *   **Verify Extension Integrity:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of extensions before loading them.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts complex or resource-intensive SQL queries that consume excessive CPU, memory, or disk I/O resources *within the SQLite engine*. This can overwhelm SQLite's processing capabilities, leading to application slowdowns, crashes, or even complete unavailability.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Application Unavailability:** Legitimate users are unable to access the application due to SQLite being overloaded.
        *   **Performance Degradation:**  Significant slowdown of the application due to SQLite performance issues.
        *   **Resource Starvation:**  Other processes on the server might be affected due to SQLite consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Query Optimizer:** The component that determines the most efficient way to execute a query, but can be tricked by malicious queries.
        *   **Query Execution Engine:** The component that carries out the query, consuming resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Query Timeouts:** Set limits on the execution time of SQL queries *at the application level when interacting with SQLite* to prevent excessively long-running queries.
        *   **Optimize Database Schema and Queries:** Design the database schema and write efficient SQL queries to minimize resource usage *within SQLite*.
