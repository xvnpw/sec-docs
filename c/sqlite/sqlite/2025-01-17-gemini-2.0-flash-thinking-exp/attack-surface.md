# Attack Surface Analysis for sqlite/sqlite

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

*   **How SQLite Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SQLite directly executes SQL queries provided by the application. If user-provided data is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being included in these queries, attackers can inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **Example:** An application constructs a SQL query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '"+userInput+"' AND password = '"+passwordInput+"';`. If `userInput` is set to `' OR '1'='1`, the query becomes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '';`, potentially bypassing authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In some cases, depending on SQLite configuration and OS permissions, even command execution might be possible through features like `load_extension`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements).
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization (though parameterization is the preferred method).

## Attack Surface: [Database File Path Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/database_file_path_manipulation.md)

*   **How SQLite Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SQLite operates on a database file specified by a path. If the application allows users to influence this path without proper validation, attackers could potentially point to arbitrary files on the system.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to specify the database file path in a configuration file. An attacker could change this path to a sensitive system file, potentially leading to data corruption or access.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, potential for overwriting or corrupting system files (depending on permissions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid allowing users to directly specify the database file path.
        *   Use a fixed, predefined path for the database file.
        *   If user-specified paths are necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization to ensure the path stays within an expected directory and does not contain malicious characters.

## Attack Surface: [Loading Malicious Extensions](./attack_surfaces/loading_malicious_extensions.md)

*   **How SQLite Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SQLite allows loading external extensions (shared libraries) that can extend its functionality. If the application allows loading arbitrary extensions or doesn't properly validate the source of extensions, attackers could load malicious code into the SQLite process.
    *   **Example:** An application uses the `sqlite3_load_extension` function with a user-provided path to an extension. An attacker could provide a path to a malicious shared library, leading to code execution within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the application and potentially the system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable the ability to load external extensions if not strictly necessary.
        *   If loading extensions is required, implement a strict whitelist of allowed extensions and their trusted locations.
        *   Verify the integrity and authenticity of extensions before loading them.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Database File Permissions](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_database_file_permissions.md)

*   **How SQLite Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SQLite relies on the underlying file system for storage. If the database file has overly permissive permissions, unauthorized users or processes can access and manipulate the database.
    *   **Example:** The SQLite database file is created with world-readable permissions. Any user on the system can then read the contents of the database.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the database file has appropriate permissions, restricting access to only the necessary user accounts or processes.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when setting file permissions.
