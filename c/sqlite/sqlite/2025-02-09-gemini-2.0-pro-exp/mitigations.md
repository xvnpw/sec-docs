## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust SQL Injection Prevention (SQLite-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_sql_injection_prevention__sqlite-specific_aspects_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Robust SQL Injection Prevention (SQLite-Specific Aspects)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Parameterized Queries (Always):** Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for *all* SQL queries that involve user-supplied data. This is fundamental and handled through the SQLite API (e.g., `sqlite3_prepare_v2`, `sqlite3_bind_*`, `sqlite3_step` in C; similar methods in other language bindings).
    2.  **`LIKE` Clause Escaping:** When using the `LIKE` operator with user input, *always* escape the `%` and `_` characters using the `ESCAPE` keyword within the SQL query itself.  Example:
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE ? ESCAPE '\';
        ```
        The escaping logic itself is handled by the application code *before* binding the parameter, but the `ESCAPE` clause is part of the SQLite query.
    3.  **Whitelist for Dynamic Table/Column Names (Application Logic + SQL):** While the whitelisting logic is primarily in application code, the *safe* construction of the SQL query after validation still involves using the SQLite API to build the query string (or, ideally, using parameterized queries even for table/column names if your binding supports it â€“ though this is less common). The key is to *never* directly embed user-supplied strings into the SQL for table/column names.
    4.  **Whitelist for `ORDER BY` (Application Logic + SQL):** Similar to table/column names, the whitelisting is in application code, but the final, safe SQL query construction uses the SQLite API.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code. This covers the specific cases of `LIKE` injection and injection via dynamically constructed table/column names or `ORDER BY` clauses, which are not always protected by basic parameterized queries.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced from *high* (with only basic parameterized queries) to *very low* (with comprehensive mitigation, including handling of `LIKE` and dynamic identifiers).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Parameterized queries are used for most data inputs.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `LIKE` clause escaping is *not* consistently implemented.
    *   Whitelisting for dynamic table/column names and `ORDER BY` clauses is *completely absent*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Denial of Service (DoS) Prevention via SQLite PRAGMAs](./mitigation_strategies/denial_of_service__dos__prevention_via_sqlite_pragmas.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Denial of Service (DoS) Prevention via SQLite PRAGMAs**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set Resource Limits (PRAGMAs):** At the start of *each* database connection, execute the following `PRAGMA` statements (adjust values appropriately):
        ```sql
        PRAGMA max_page_count = 100000;  -- Limit database size
        PRAGMA page_size = 1024;        -- Set page size (influences max size)
        PRAGMA journal_size_limit = 1048576; -- Limit journal size
        PRAGMA cache_size = 2000;       -- Limit cache size (in pages)
        ```
        These `PRAGMA`s are *direct* SQLite commands that control its resource usage.
    2.  **Implement Timeouts (SQLite API):** Use the `sqlite3_busy_timeout()` function (or the equivalent in your language binding) to set a timeout for database operations. This is a direct API call to the SQLite library. Example (C):
        ```c
        sqlite3_busy_timeout(db, 5000); // 5-second timeout
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from exhausting resources (disk, memory) by exploiting SQLite's default behavior or lack of limits.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from *high* to *moderate*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic timeout is set using `sqlite3_busy_timeout()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `PRAGMA` limits for `max_page_count`, `journal_size_limit`, and `cache_size` are *not* explicitly set.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Database Corruption Prevention (SQLite-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/database_corruption_prevention__sqlite-specific_aspects_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Database Corruption Prevention (SQLite-Specific Aspects)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable WAL Mode (PRAGMA):** At the start of each database connection, execute: `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;`. This is a *direct* SQLite command that changes the journaling mode. WAL is generally more robust against corruption.
    2.  **Integrity Checks (PRAGMA):** Periodically run `PRAGMA integrity_check;`. This is a *direct* SQLite command that verifies the database's structural integrity. Automate this and alert on errors.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Loss due to Corruption (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of data loss.
    *   **Application Downtime (Severity: Medium):** Facilitates faster recovery.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Loss:** Risk reduced from *moderate* to *low*.
    *   **Downtime:** Reduces recovery time.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None of the SQLite-specific aspects are implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   WAL mode is *not* enabled.
    *   `PRAGMA integrity_check;` is *not* run automatically.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Shared Memory (WAL Mode - PRAGMA Related)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_shared_memory__wal_mode_-_pragma_related_.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Shared Memory (WAL Mode - PRAGMA Related)**

* **Description:**
    1. **Verify/Set WAL Mode (PRAGMA):** The core of this mitigation is related to the `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;` setting.  If WAL mode is enabled (and it *should* be for most applications, as per the previous mitigation), then the following steps become relevant.  If WAL mode is *not* enabled, this mitigation is not applicable.
    2. **(Indirectly SQLite-related):** The *rest* of this mitigation (setting file permissions on the `-shm` and `-wal` files) is *not* directly controlled by SQLite itself; it's an operating system and file system concern. However, it's *triggered* by the use of WAL mode within SQLite.
    3. **Consider Alternative Journaling Modes (PRAGMA):** If shared memory security is a paramount concern *and* the performance benefits of WAL are not essential, you can use a `PRAGMA` to switch to a different journaling mode: `PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE;` (or `TRUNCATE`, `PERSIST`, `MEMORY`, `OFF`). This is a *direct* SQLite command.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Unauthorized Data Access (Severity: High):** (Indirectly, via WAL mode's use of shared memory).
    * **Data Corruption (Severity: Medium):** (Indirectly, via WAL mode).

* **Impact:**
    * **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk reduced significantly.
    * **Data Corruption:** Additional protection.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Not applicable, as WAL mode is not currently enabled.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * If WAL mode were enabled, the file permission aspects would need to be addressed (though this is not *directly* a SQLite API call). The decision to use or not use WAL is directly controlled by a `PRAGMA`.
