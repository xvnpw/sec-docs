# Threat Model Analysis for sqlite/sqlite

## Threat: [Threat 1: Unauthorized Database File Access](./threats/threat_1_unauthorized_database_file_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the SQLite database file (e.g., `database.db`) through a vulnerability *outside* of SQLite itself (e.g., directory traversal, misconfigured server).  However, the *impact* is directly on the SQLite database. The attacker can copy, modify, or delete the entire database file.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data loss, data corruption, data theft, and potential replacement of the database with a malicious version. Bypasses all application-level access controls.
    *   **SQLite Component Affected:** The database file itself (the core storage mechanism).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store the database file in a directory with restricted file system permissions. Only the application's user account should have read/write access.
        *   Avoid storing the database file in web-accessible directories.
        *   Use operating system-level file encryption (e.g., dm-crypt, BitLocker, FileVault).
        *   Implement file system monitoring and intrusion detection.
        *   Regularly back up the database file to a secure, off-site location.
        *   Consider using a non-default file extension.

## Threat: [Threat 2: SQL Injection (SQLite-Specific)](./threats/threat_2_sql_injection__sqlite-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL input that exploits SQLite's features or parsing quirks. This could involve injecting commands that leverage SQLite's flexible typing, built-in functions (like `readfile` or `writefile` *if enabled through custom extensions*), or attempts to manipulate the database schema. The attacker aims to bypass authentication, extract data, modify records, or delete the database.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, data modification, data deletion, potential execution of arbitrary SQL commands, and, in rare cases with *custom* functions, file system interaction.
    *   **SQLite Component Affected:** SQL parser, query execution engine, any *custom* functions or extensions used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always** use parameterized queries (prepared statements). This is the *primary* defense.
        *   Validate and sanitize all user input, even when using parameterized queries.
        *   Disable unnecessary SQLite features or extensions. Be extremely cautious about enabling *custom* functions that interact with the file system.
        *   Use the principle of least privilege for the database user account.
        *   Regularly review and update SQL queries.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Database Corruption](./threats/threat_3_database_corruption.md)

*   **Description:** The SQLite database file becomes corrupted due to hardware failures, power outages during write operations, software bugs (in SQLite *or* the application), or a malicious attacker directly modifying the database file.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, application instability, denial of service. The application may crash or become unusable.
    *   **SQLite Component Affected:** The database file, potentially including internal data structures like B-trees.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use `PRAGMA integrity_check;` regularly to verify database integrity.
        *   Implement robust error handling in the application to gracefully handle corruption.
        *   Use WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode for better resilience.
        *   Ensure the underlying file system is reliable.
        *   Regularly back up the database file.

## Threat: [Threat 4: Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion)](./threats/threat_4_denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious queries designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) *within SQLite*. This could involve complex joins, large `IN` clauses, recursive CTEs, or other computationally expensive operations *handled by SQLite*. The goal is application unavailability.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation for all users.
    *   **SQLite Component Affected:** Query optimizer, query execution engine, memory management *within SQLite*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Set resource limits using `sqlite3_limit` (e.g., for memory usage, query depth).
        *   Implement query timeouts.
        *   Monitor database performance and resource usage.
        *   Implement rate limiting on database queries (this is often an application-level concern, but interacts with SQLite).
        *   Carefully design database schema and queries to avoid SQLite-specific performance bottlenecks.

## Threat: [Threat 5: ATTACH DATABASE Exploitation](./threats/threat_5_attach_database_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects SQL code that uses the `ATTACH DATABASE` command to connect to an arbitrary database file. If the attacker controls the filename, they might access or manipulate other databases, potentially bypassing access controls or accessing system files *if custom functions allowing file system interaction are enabled*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to other databases, data leakage, data modification, potential escalation of privileges.
    *   **SQLite Component Affected:** `ATTACH DATABASE` command, SQL parser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control and validate user input used in `ATTACH DATABASE` commands. Avoid using user-provided filenames directly.
        *   If possible, disable the `ATTACH DATABASE` feature if not essential.
        *   Use a whitelist of allowed database filenames if `ATTACH DATABASE` is required.
