# Attack Surface Analysis for sqlite/sqlite

## Attack Surface: [Direct Database File Access](./attack_surfaces/direct_database_file_access.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized read or write access to the SQLite database file, bypassing application security.
*   **SQLite Contribution:** SQLite's single-file database model is a single point of failure if file system permissions are weak.
*   **Example:** Path traversal vulnerability allows downloading the `.sqlite` file; compromised server allows direct file access.
*   **Impact:** Complete data breach (read), data corruption/deletion (write), potential application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if sensitive data) / High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Strict file permissions (read/write only by application user), least privilege for application, avoid web-accessible locations, robust input validation (prevent path traversal).
    *   **Users/Administrators:** OS-level encryption (full-disk or file-level), regular backups (secure, off-site), monitor file access logs.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (SQLite-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__sqlite-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL, exploiting vulnerabilities in SQLite or misuse of its features.
*   **SQLite Contribution:** Vulnerabilities *within* SQLite, or misuse of functions, `ATTACH DATABASE`, or collation sequences, create injection points.
*   **Example:** Manipulating a `LIKE` clause in a parameterized query, crafted filename in `ATTACH DATABASE` (if not validated), exploiting an unpatched SQLite vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, modification/deletion, DoS, potential code execution (rare, via extensions/triggers).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if successful) / High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** *Always* use parameterized queries, validate/sanitize *all* inputs (defense-in-depth), avoid user input in `ATTACH DATABASE` (use whitelists), cautious use of SQLite functions, keep SQLite up-to-date, avoid user-controlled collation.
    *   **Users/Administrators:** Monitor for SQLite security advisories, apply updates promptly.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, locks), making the application unresponsive.
*   **SQLite Contribution:** SQLite's design can be vulnerable to resource exhaustion; features like `ATTACH DATABASE`, recursive CTEs, FTS can be abused.
*   **Example:** Recursive CTE that never terminates, inserting massive data to fill disk, `ATTACH DATABASE` with a huge external database.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, potential data corruption (disk full).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Query timeouts, resource limits, validate input (prevent large/complex queries), optimized schema/indexes, appropriate locking modes (WAL), error handling/retries, monitor performance, limit database/data size.
    *   **Users/Administrators:** Monitor disk space, set up low disk space alerts.

## Attack Surface: [SQLite Internal Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/sqlite_internal_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of bugs in SQLite's internal C code (buffer overflows, etc.) or logic errors.
*   **SQLite Contribution:** These are vulnerabilities *within* the SQLite library itself.
*   **Example:** Crafted SQL query or database file triggers a buffer overflow in SQLite's parser, leading to code execution.
*   **Impact:** Potential code execution, data breach, application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if exploitable) / High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Keep SQLite up-to-date (primary defense), monitor advisories, consider memory-safe languages (advanced).
    *   **Users/Administrators:** Ensure the application uses the latest SQLite version.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Extension Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_extension_loading.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers load malicious SQLite extensions (shared libraries) to execute arbitrary code.
*   **SQLite Contribution:** SQLite's extension loading mechanism is the attack vector.
*   **Example:** Uploading a malicious shared library and using a vulnerability to load it as an SQLite extension.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Disable extension loading if possible (`sqlite3_enable_load_extension(db, 0)`), if needed: load only from trusted sources, verify integrity (checksums/signatures), use whitelists, strict file permissions.
    * **Users/Administrators:** Ensure the application is configured to load extensions only from trusted locations.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass (Faulty `sqlite3_set_authorizer`)](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass__faulty__sqlite3_set_authorizer__.md)

*   **Description:** Bypassing intended access control due to flawed `sqlite3_set_authorizer` implementation.
*   **SQLite Contribution:** SQLite provides `sqlite3_set_authorizer`, but correct implementation is the application's responsibility.
*   **Example:** Authorizer callback doesn't check all SQL operations, allowing unauthorized actions (e.g., dropping a table with only read access).
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Thoroughly test `sqlite3_set_authorizer` implementation (all operations), use a well-vetted authorization library if possible, follow principle of least privilege.
