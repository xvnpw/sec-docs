## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit SQLite Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_sqlite_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1.1 SQL Injection (SQLi) via FTS [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Exploits vulnerabilities in SQLite's Full-Text Search (FTS3, FTS4, FTS5) extensions. If the application uses FTS and doesn't properly sanitize user input in FTS queries, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if FTS is used and input validation is poor) / Medium (if some input validation exists but is flawed)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (data breach, modification, potential code execution)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Strict Input Validation: Rigorous validation and sanitization of all user input used in FTS queries.
        *   Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements): Use exclusively. Never construct FTS queries by concatenating user input.
        *   Least Privilege: Database user account should have minimum necessary privileges.
        *   Regular Updates: Keep SQLite updated.
        *   Web Application Firewall (WAF): Can help detect and block SQLi.
        *   Consider Alternatives: If FTS isn't essential, consider other search methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leverage Application Logic Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/2__leverage_application_logic_flaws.md)

*   **2.1 SQL Injection (SQLi) via Application Logic [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Even with parameterized queries, flaws in application logic can lead to SQLi. If the application dynamically constructs query structure (table/column names) based on user input, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (data breach, modification, potential code execution)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Whitelist Allowed Values: If table/column names are dynamic, use a strict whitelist.
        *   Careful Query Construction: Review code to ensure no query structure is influenced by untrusted input.
        *   Code Reviews: Focus on SQL query construction.

*   **2.2 Improper Error Handling [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Displaying detailed SQLite error messages to the user leaks information about the database schema, table names, or data, aiding further attacks.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (common mistake)
    *   **Impact:** Low to Medium (information disclosure, aids further attacks)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Generic Error Messages: Display generic messages to users.
        *   Logging: Log detailed errors to a secure file, not to the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Attack SQLite Configuration/Environment](./attack_tree_paths/3__attack_sqlite_configurationenvironment.md)

*   **3.1 Weak File Permissions [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Overly permissive file permissions on the database file allow attackers with local access (or through another vulnerability) to read, modify, or delete it.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (direct access to the database file)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (if local access is gained)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Restrictive Permissions: Set the most restrictive permissions. Only the application's user account should have read/write access.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Apply to the entire system.
