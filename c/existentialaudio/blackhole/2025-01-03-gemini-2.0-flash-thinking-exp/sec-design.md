    *   **Kernel Extension Deployment:** Copies the `BlackHole.kext` file to the appropriate system directory (`/Library/Extensions`).
    *   **Permissions Management:** Sets the necessary file permissions and ownership for the kernel extension to function correctly.
    *   **Kernel Extension Loading:**  May include steps to load the kernel extension into the operating system's kernel. This might involve using the `kextload` command or prompting the user to restart their system.
*   **Uninstallation Script:**
    *   **Kernel Extension Unloading:**  Unloads the `BlackHole.kext` from the kernel using the `kextunload` command.
    *   **File Removal:** Deletes the `BlackHole.kext` file from `/Library/Extensions`.

### 5. Data Flow

The following steps describe the typical flow of audio data when using BlackHole:

1. **Audio Output from Source Application:** A user application, designated as the audio source, is configured to output its audio stream to the **BlackHole Virtual Audio Input Device**.
2. **Core Audio Routing:** The macOS Core Audio framework intercepts the audio stream directed towards the BlackHole input device.
3. **Data Transfer to Kernel Extension:** Core Audio forwards the audio data to the **BlackHole Kernel Extension**.
4. **Internal Buffering (Minimal):** The BlackHole kernel extension receives the audio data. Due to the low-latency design, buffering is typically kept to a minimum.
5. **Data Transfer to Output Device:** The kernel extension immediately transfers the received audio data to the **BlackHole Virtual Audio Output Device**.
6. **Core Audio Retrieval:** The macOS Core Audio framework retrieves the audio data from the BlackHole output device when another application requests audio input from it.
7. **Audio Input to Destination Application:** The audio data is then delivered by Core Audio to the user application configured to receive audio from the **BlackHole Virtual Audio Output Device**.
