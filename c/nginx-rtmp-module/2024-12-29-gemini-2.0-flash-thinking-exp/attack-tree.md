**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit RTMP Protocol Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Malicious RTMP Messages [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Inject Malicious Metadata:**
        *   Attack Vector: Injecting malicious scripts or commands within RTMP metadata, potentially leading to execution on clients or backend systems.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Medium to High
        *   Effort: Low to Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to High
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Buffer Overflows in Message Parsing [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attack Vector: Sending overly long or specially crafted RTMP messages to trigger buffer overflows in the module's parsing logic, potentially leading to code execution on the server.
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: High
        *   Skill Level: Expert
        *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Denial of Service (DoS) via RTMP [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Flood with Connection Requests:**
        *   Attack Vector: Overwhelming the server with a large number of connection attempts, exhausting server resources and causing denial of service.
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: Medium
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Low

**2. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Module Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Directives [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Misconfigured `allow` or `deny` directives:**
        *   Attack Vector: Incorrectly configured access control lists allowing unauthorized users to publish or play streams.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Medium
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice to Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   **Weak or Default Authentication Settings (if enabled):**
        *   Attack Vector: Using weak or default credentials to gain unauthorized access to publish streams.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Medium
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Misconfigured `record` or `exec` directives [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Gain unauthorized access to recorded streams:**
            *   Attack Vector: Exploiting misconfigurations to access sensitive recorded stream data.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Medium
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Novice
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Execute arbitrary commands on the server if `exec` is used insecurely:**
            *   Attack Vector: Injecting malicious commands through the `exec` directive, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server.
            *   Likelihood: Low
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Medium to High
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
