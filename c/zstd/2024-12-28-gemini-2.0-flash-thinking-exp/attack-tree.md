Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* **Exploit Decompression Vulnerabilities -> Trigger Buffer Overflow in Decompression -> Exploit Memory Corruption for Code Execution or Information Leakage:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides maliciously crafted compressed data. When the application attempts to decompress this data, it exceeds the allocated buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow. This overflow can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially corrupting data or, more critically, allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code or leak sensitive information.
    * **Risk:** High due to the potential for complete system compromise (code execution) or significant data breaches.

* **Exploit Decompression Vulnerabilities -> Trigger Integer Overflow in Decompression -> Cause Heap Overflow or Other Memory Errors:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides compressed data that, when decompressed, results in integer overflows during calculations related to buffer sizes or memory allocation. This can lead to the allocation of smaller-than-expected buffers, causing heap overflows or other memory corruption issues during the decompression process.
    * **Risk:** High due to the potential for memory corruption, leading to crashes, denial of service, or potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.

* **Exploit Decompression Vulnerabilities -> Trigger Denial of Service via Decompression Bomb -> Cause Excessive Resource Consumption (CPU, Memory) During Decompression:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a small, highly compressible file (a "decompression bomb"). When the application attempts to decompress this file, it expands to an extremely large size, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to a denial of service.
    * **Risk:** High due to the ease of execution and the potential to disrupt application availability.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Zstd Library Internals -> Trigger Memory Corruption Bugs in Zstd Code -> Achieve Code Execution or Information Leakage:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies and exploits a memory corruption vulnerability (e.g., heap or stack overflow) within the Zstd library's code itself. This could be triggered by specific input data or through other interactions with the library. Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's process or leak sensitive information from memory.
    * **Risk:** High due to the potential for complete system compromise and the fact that this exploits a vulnerability in the underlying library.

* **Abuse of Application Logic Leveraging Zstd -> Inject Malicious Compressed Data -> Inject Data Designed to Exploit Decompression Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the application accepts user-provided compressed data, an attacker can inject data specifically crafted to trigger decompression vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows or integer overflows) described above. The application's logic for handling compressed data becomes the attack vector.
    * **Risk:** High because it leverages application functionality to deliver malicious payloads, potentially leading to code execution or data breaches.

* **Abuse of Application Logic Leveraging Zstd -> Bypass Security Checks with Compressed Data -> Inject Malicious Data That Bypasses Checks When Compressed:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application performs security checks on the *uncompressed* data. An attacker can inject malicious data that, when compressed, bypasses these checks. Once decompressed, the malicious data is present and can exploit other vulnerabilities or compromise the application's logic.
    * **Risk:** High if the application handles sensitive data, as this allows malicious content to bypass security measures.

* **Exploit Compression Vulnerabilities -> Trigger Denial of Service via Compression Bomb -> Cause Resource Exhaustion on the Server:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides data that is specifically designed to take an extremely long time or excessive resources to compress using Zstd. This can tie up server resources, leading to a denial of service.
    * **Risk:** High due to the potential to disrupt application availability by exhausting server resources.
