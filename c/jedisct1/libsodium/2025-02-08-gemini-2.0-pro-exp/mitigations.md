## Mitigation Strategy: [Correct Libsodium API Usage](./mitigation_strategies/correct_libsodium_api_usage.md)

1.  **Documentation Adherence:**  Before using *any* libsodium function, developers *must* consult the official libsodium documentation ([https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/)).  This includes understanding:
    *   Function purpose.
    *   Precise parameter types, sizes, and expected ranges.
    *   Return values and error handling mechanisms.
    *   All security considerations and warnings.
2.  **High-Level API Preference:** Prioritize the use of high-level "easy" APIs (e.g., `crypto_secretbox_easy`, `crypto_box_easy`, `crypto_generichash_easy`) over lower-level primitives whenever possible. These are designed for safer and simpler use.
3.  **Function-Specific Unit Tests:** Create unit tests that specifically target *each* libsodium function used.  Tests should cover:
    *   Valid inputs within expected ranges.
    *   Invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect sizes, null pointers) to test error handling.
    *   Boundary conditions (e.g., maximum input sizes).
    *   Verification of expected outputs and return codes.
4. **Fuzzing (Optional but Recommended):** Implement fuzzing tests that feed random or malformed inputs to libsodium wrappers or functions that directly call libsodium APIs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cryptographic Weakness (Severity: High to Critical):**  Incorrect API usage can lead to vulnerabilities that completely undermine the security guarantees of libsodium.
    *   **Implementation Errors (Severity: High):**  Reduces the risk of subtle bugs in how libsodium is used, which could lead to security flaws.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior (Severity: Medium to High):**  Helps ensure that libsodium functions behave as expected, even with unexpected inputs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cryptographic Weakness:** Risk reduced significantly (ensures correct usage of cryptographic primitives).
    *   **Implementation Errors:** Risk reduced significantly (early detection of bugs).
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Risk reduced (more robust and predictable behavior).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Unit tests exist for most cryptographic functions, but coverage could be improved.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Fuzzing is not currently implemented.
    *   Unit test coverage for boundary conditions and invalid inputs needs improvement.
    *   A formal checklist for libsodium API usage during code reviews should be created, specifically referencing the official documentation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proper Nonce Management *within* Libsodium Calls](./mitigation_strategies/proper_nonce_management_within_libsodium_calls.md)

1.  **Understand Nonce Requirements:**  For each libsodium function, carefully read the documentation to determine the *exact* nonce requirements (size, uniqueness guarantees).
2.  **`randombytes_buf()` for Nonces (Generally Preferred):**  In most cases, generate nonces using `randombytes_buf(nonce, REQUIRED_NONCE_SIZE)`.  Ensure `REQUIRED_NONCE_SIZE` matches the specific function's requirement (e.g., `crypto_secretbox_NONCEBYTES`, `crypto_box_NONCEBYTES`).
3.  **Counter-Based Nonces (Avoid if Possible):**  *Only* use counter-based nonces if *absolutely required* by a specific protocol *and* you can *guarantee* no reuse with the same key.  If used:
    *   Use a sufficiently large counter (at least 64 bits).
    *   Increment *before* each use.
    *   Persist the counter state *securely* and ensure it's recoverable.  This is *outside* the scope of libsodium itself.
4.  **Avoid Predictable Values:** Never use timestamps, easily guessable values, or sequential IDs (without robust, secure, and persistent state management) as nonces.
5. **Testing:** Include unit tests that specifically verify:
    *   Correct nonce generation (size, randomness when using `randombytes_buf()`).
    *   Correct nonce usage with *each* libsodium function.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Replay Attacks (Severity: Critical):**  Nonce reuse can completely break the security of many authenticated encryption schemes, allowing attackers to replay messages.
    *   **Cryptographic Weakness (Severity: Critical):**  Incorrect nonce usage can lead to weaknesses that make decryption or forgery easier.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (from high to negligible with correct implementation).
    *   **Cryptographic Weakness:** Risk reduced significantly (ensures the intended security properties).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `randombytes_buf()` is used for nonce generation in most cryptographic functions.
    *   Unit tests verify nonce size.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No specific tests for replay attacks (although correct nonce usage inherently mitigates this).  More focused integration tests could be added.
    *   Counter-based nonces are not used, and documentation should explicitly discourage their use unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Memory Handling with Libsodium Functions](./mitigation_strategies/secure_memory_handling_with_libsodium_functions.md)

1.  **`sodium_memzero()`:**  After using sensitive data (keys, intermediate values) that have been stored in memory, *immediately* use `sodium_memzero(sensitive_data, size_of_data)` to securely erase the data. This prevents data remnants from being recovered from memory.
2.  **`sodium_mlock()` and `sodium_munlock()` (Use with Caution):**
    *   *Consider* using `sodium_mlock(data, size)` to lock sensitive data in memory, preventing it from being swapped to disk.
    *   *Always* use `sodium_munlock(data, size)` to unlock the memory when it's no longer needed.
    *   **Important:** Thoroughly test `sodium_mlock()`/`sodium_munlock()` on your target platforms.  Be aware of potential issues:
        *   Resource exhaustion (limited locked memory).
        *   Platform-specific behavior and limitations.
        *   Potential for deadlocks if not used carefully.
    *   This is a defense-in-depth measure, *not* a primary security control.  Proper key management is far more important.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Remnants in Memory (Severity: Medium to High):**  Reduces the risk of sensitive data being recovered from memory after it's no longer needed.
    *   **Swap File Exposure (Severity: Medium):** `sodium_mlock()` (if used correctly) can prevent sensitive data from being written to the swap file.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Remnants:** Risk reduced (especially if `sodium_memzero()` is used consistently).
    *   **Swap File Exposure:** Risk reduced (if `sodium_mlock()` is used correctly and effectively).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `sodium_memzero()` is used after key usage in several places.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `sodium_memzero()` is not used consistently throughout the codebase.  A thorough audit is needed to identify all locations where it should be added.
    *   `sodium_mlock()`/`sodium_munlock()` are not currently used.  Extensive research, testing, and careful consideration are required before implementing these.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Compilation of Libsodium](./mitigation_strategies/secure_compilation_of_libsodium.md)

1.  **Follow Official Instructions:**  Strictly adhere to the compilation instructions and recommended compiler flags provided in the official libsodium documentation.
2.  **Verification:** After building libsodium, verify the integrity of the compiled library using the checksums (e.g., SHA-256) provided by the libsodium project.  This ensures that the library hasn't been tampered with during the build process.
3. **Compiler Flags:** Use appropriate compiler flags to enable security features and optimizations. This may include flags related to:
     * Stack canaries
     * Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
     * Data Execution Prevention (DEP/NX)
     * Optimization levels (ensure they don't introduce vulnerabilities)

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compilation Errors (Severity: Medium to High):**  Incorrect compilation can lead to weakened or incorrect implementations of the cryptographic algorithms.
    *   **Tampering (Severity: High):**  Checksum verification helps detect if the compiled library has been maliciously modified.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compilation Errors:** Risk reduced significantly (ensures correct and secure compilation).
    *   **Tampering:** Risk reduced (allows detection of tampering).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic compilation instructions are followed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Checksum verification is not automated.
    *   Compiler flags for enhanced security features are not consistently applied and verified.
