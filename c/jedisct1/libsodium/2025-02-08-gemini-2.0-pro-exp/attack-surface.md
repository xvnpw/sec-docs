# Attack Surface Analysis for jedisct1/libsodium

## Attack Surface: [Nonce Misuse/Reuse](./attack_surfaces/nonce_misusereuse.md)

*Description:* Reusing a nonce (number used once) with the same key in many libsodium encryption or authentication functions invalidates the security guarantees.
*How libsodium Contributes:* Libsodium's API requires the developer to correctly manage nonces for many functions. It provides `randombytes_buf` but doesn't enforce uniqueness across calls.
*Example:* A counter used as a nonce overflows and repeats, or a high-throughput system generates the same timestamp-based nonce for multiple concurrent operations.
*Impact:* Complete compromise of confidentiality and/or authenticity. An attacker can decrypt messages or forge authenticated messages.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Use `randombytes_buf` to generate cryptographically secure random nonces.
    *   *Never* hardcode or reuse nonces.
    *   Carefully review code to ensure nonce uniqueness, especially in loops/concurrent operations.
    *   Consider higher-level APIs (like `crypto_secretbox`) that manage nonces internally.
    *   Implement static analysis/code review tools to detect potential nonce reuse.
    *   Thoroughly test nonce generation/handling under various conditions (high load, edge cases).

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Function Selection](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_function_selection.md)

*Description:* Using the wrong libsodium function for the intended cryptographic task, leading to weaker security than expected or outright failure.
*How libsodium Contributes:* Libsodium offers a wide range of functions; choosing the incorrect one has serious consequences.
*Example:* Using `crypto_shorthash` (non-cryptographic hash) for password hashing instead of `crypto_pwhash`, or using symmetric encryption when asymmetric is needed.
*Impact:* Reduced security or complete failure. Could range from weak password hashing to using an inappropriate encryption scheme.
*Risk Severity:* **High** to **Critical** (depending on the misuse)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Thoroughly understand the purpose/security properties of each libsodium function.
    *   Consult the libsodium documentation carefully.
    *   Seek expert review of cryptographic design choices.
    *   Clearly document the intended use of each function in the code.
    *   Use unit tests to verify correct behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow/Underflow](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflowunderflow.md)

*Description:* Providing incorrect buffer sizes to libsodium functions, leading to memory corruption.
*How libsodium Contributes:* While designed for memory safety *when used correctly*, incorrect buffer sizes can still cause overflows/underflows.
*Example:* Allocating a buffer smaller than `crypto_secretbox_MACBYTES` for the authentication tag, or providing an incorrect length to a decryption function.
*Impact:* Potential for arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Carefully calculate buffer sizes using libsodium's constants (e.g., `crypto_secretbox_MACBYTES`).
    *   Double-check all buffer size calculations.
    *   Use memory safety tools (Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) during development/testing.

## Attack Surface: [Libsodium Vulnerabilities (Rare)](./attack_surfaces/libsodium_vulnerabilities__rare_.md)

*Description:* Exploiting a newly discovered vulnerability in the libsodium library itself.
*How libsodium Contributes:* While libsodium is highly secure, vulnerabilities are possible in any software. This is a direct risk from using the library.
*Example:* A hypothetical zero-day vulnerability in libsodium's implementation of a specific algorithm.
*Impact:* Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially ranging from denial of service to complete compromise.
*Risk Severity:* **Unknown** (until discovered), but potentially **Critical**.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Keep libsodium updated to the latest version.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories related to libsodium.
    *   Have a rapid patching process in place.
    *   Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.
