## Mitigation Strategy: [Prefer Libsodium High-Level APIs](./mitigation_strategies/prefer_libsodium_high-level_apis.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Prefer Libsodium High-Level APIs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Cryptographic Needs:** Analyze your application's cryptographic requirements and determine if they can be fulfilled using libsodium's high-level APIs such as `crypto_box` (for authenticated encryption), `crypto_secretbox` (for symmetric encryption), `crypto_sign` (for digital signatures), and `crypto_kx` (for key exchange).
    2.  **Prioritize High-Level APIs:** Whenever possible, choose and utilize libsodium's high-level APIs over lower-level cryptographic primitives (e.g., directly using block ciphers, hash functions, or elliptic curve operations).
    3.  **Understand Abstraction Benefits:** Recognize that libsodium's high-level APIs abstract away many of the complex and error-prone details of lower-level cryptography. They are designed to be more secure by default and easier to use correctly, especially for developers who are not cryptography experts.
    4.  **Justify Low-Level API Usage:** Only resort to using lower-level libsodium APIs when high-level APIs are demonstrably insufficient for very specific and well-justified cryptographic needs. In such cases, exercise extreme caution, thoroughly understand the security implications, and seek expert cryptographic review.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Libsodium's Constant-Time Operations](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_libsodium's_constant-time_operations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Libsodium's Constant-Time Operations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Timing Attacks:**  Learn about timing side-channel attacks, which exploit variations in the execution time of cryptographic operations to infer secret information (like cryptographic keys).
    2.  **Rely on Libsodium's Constant-Time Design:**  Be aware that libsodium is designed to provide constant-time implementations for its core cryptographic operations to mitigate timing attacks. This means that the execution time of these operations should ideally be independent of the secret inputs (like keys or sensitive data).
    3.  **Use Intended Constant-Time APIs:**  Ensure you are using the libsodium APIs that are intended to be constant-time. Most of libsodium's core cryptographic functions are designed with constant-time execution in mind. Refer to the documentation to confirm the constant-time properties of specific APIs if needed.
    4.  **Avoid Introducing Timing Variations:**  When using libsodium, avoid writing custom code or logic that could introduce timing variations based on secret data. For example, avoid conditional branches or variable-time memory access patterns that depend on secret keys or sensitive information within cryptographic operations.
    5.  **Consider Constant-Time Testing (If Critical):**  If your application handles extremely sensitive data and timing attack resistance is paramount, consider performing timing attack testing or analysis to verify the constant-time behavior of your cryptographic implementations in your specific environment and usage context.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Timing Side-Channel Attacks against Libsodium Implementations (Medium Severity):**  Exploiting subtle timing variations in libsodium's cryptographic operations (or surrounding code) to potentially extract secret keys or other sensitive information. While libsodium is designed to be resistant, vulnerabilities might still exist or be introduced through misuse.
