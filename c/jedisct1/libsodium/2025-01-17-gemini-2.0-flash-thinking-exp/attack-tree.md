## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Libsodium (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_libsodium__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful exploitation of libsodium or its usage leading to application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Libsodium API or Misuse its Functionality by the Application (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_libsodium_api_or_misuse_its_functionality_by_the_application__critical_node_.md)

This broad category encompasses vulnerabilities arising from incorrect implementation or usage of libsodium's functions by the application developers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Key Management Practices (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Entry)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_key_management_practices__critical_node__high-risk_path_entry_.md)

This is a fundamental weakness that can lead to complete compromise. Attack vectors include:

## Attack Tree Path: [Use of Predictable or Weak Keys (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/use_of_predictable_or_weak_keys__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Application uses hardcoded keys (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**  Keys are directly embedded in the application code or configuration, making them easily discoverable.
* **Application uses insufficient entropy for key generation (High-Risk Path):** The random number generator used to create keys does not produce enough randomness, making keys predictable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application uses hardcoded keys (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/application_uses_hardcoded_keys__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

Keys are directly embedded in the application code or configuration, making them easily discoverable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application uses insufficient entropy for key generation (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/application_uses_insufficient_entropy_for_key_generation__high-risk_path_.md)

The random number generator used to create keys does not produce enough randomness, making keys predictable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Key Storage (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/improper_key_storage__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Keys stored in plaintext in configuration files or database (High-Risk Path):** Sensitive keys are stored without any encryption, making them accessible if the storage is compromised.
* **Keys stored with weak encryption (High-Risk Path):** Keys are encrypted using easily breakable algorithms or methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Keys stored in plaintext in configuration files or database (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/keys_stored_in_plaintext_in_configuration_files_or_database__high-risk_path_.md)

Sensitive keys are stored without any encryption, making them accessible if the storage is compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Keys stored with weak encryption (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/keys_stored_with_weak_encryption__high-risk_path_.md)

Keys are encrypted using easily breakable algorithms or methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Key Exchange or Distribution Mechanisms (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_key_exchange_or_distribution_mechanisms__high-risk_path_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Incorrect Usage of Cryptographic Primitives (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Entry)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_incorrect_usage_of_cryptographic_primitives__critical_node__high-risk_path_entry_.md)

This involves misusing the core cryptographic functions provided by libsodium, leading to vulnerabilities:

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Nonce/IV Handling (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/improper_nonceiv_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Nonce Reuse in Encryption leading to Key Stream Reuse (High-Risk Path):** Using the same nonce with the same key for multiple encryptions compromises confidentiality.
* **Predictable or Weakly Random IVs (High-Risk Path):** Using predictable initialization vectors can weaken encryption and allow for attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Nonce Reuse in Encryption leading to Key Stream Reuse (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/nonce_reuse_in_encryption_leading_to_key_stream_reuse__high-risk_path_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrect Padding Schemes leading to Padding Oracle Attacks (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/incorrect_padding_schemes_leading_to_padding_oracle_attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

Vulnerabilities in how padding is handled during decryption can allow an attacker to decrypt ciphertext by observing error messages.

Encrypting data without verifying its integrity allows attackers to modify the ciphertext without detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrect Signature Verification (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/incorrect_signature_verification__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Application does not verify signatures (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**  The application trusts data without verifying its authenticity, allowing forgeries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application does not verify signatures (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/application_does_not_verify_signatures__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

The application trusts data without verifying its authenticity, allowing forgeries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application uses incorrect verification parameters or logic (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/application_uses_incorrect_verification_parameters_or_logic__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can manipulate the communication to force the use of less secure cryptographic methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within Libsodium Library (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_libsodium_library__critical_node_.md)

This involves directly exploiting security flaws within the libsodium library itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Buffer Overflows in Input Handling (e.g., during decryption, signature verification) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_buffer_overflows_in_input_handling__e_g___during_decryption__signature_verification___critic_53b627f6.md)
