# Threat Model Analysis for jedisct1/libsodium

## Threat: [Implementation Bugs in Libsodium](./threats/implementation_bugs_in_libsodium.md)

**Description:** Undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities might exist within the libsodium library's code. An attacker could potentially exploit these bugs to compromise the application.

**Impact:**  The impact can range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the bug.

**Affected Libsodium Component:** Any module or function within the libsodium library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated with the latest stable releases of libsodium and monitor security advisories.
*   Subscribe to security mailing lists or follow the libsodium project on platforms like GitHub.
*   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application's usage of libsodium.

## Threat: [Nonce Reuse in Symmetric Encryption](./threats/nonce_reuse_in_symmetric_encryption.md)

**Description:** An attacker can exploit the reuse of nonces (number used once) with deterministic symmetric encryption algorithms (like `crypto_secretbox_easy`). By observing ciphertexts encrypted with the same key and nonce, the attacker can deduce information about the plaintexts.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality. Attackers can potentially recover parts or all of the plaintext messages.

**Affected Libsodium Component:** Symmetric encryption functions like `crypto_secretbox_easy`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that nonces are unique for every encryption operation with the same key.
*   Use libsodium's nonce generation functions or implement a robust nonce management strategy.
*   Consider using authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) modes, which often incorporate nonce handling.

## Threat: [Incorrect Authentication Tag Verification](./threats/incorrect_authentication_tag_verification.md)

**Description:** An attacker can tamper with encrypted messages if the application fails to properly verify the authentication tag (MAC) provided by authenticated encryption schemes (e.g., `crypto_secretbox_easy`). The attacker can modify the ciphertext without the application detecting the alteration.

**Impact:** Loss of data integrity and authenticity. Attackers can inject malicious data or modify existing data without detection.

**Affected Libsodium Component:** Authenticated encryption functions like `crypto_secretbox_easy` and the corresponding verification functions like `crypto_secretbox_open_easy`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always verify the authentication tag before decrypting the message using the appropriate libsodium functions (e.g., `crypto_secretbox_open_easy`).
*   Ensure the verification function returns an error if the tag is invalid and handle this error appropriately.

## Threat: [Side-Channel Attacks](./threats/side-channel_attacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker might be able to extract sensitive information (like cryptographic keys) by observing side effects of cryptographic operations, such as timing variations, power consumption, or electromagnetic emanations.

**Impact:** Potential compromise of cryptographic keys or other sensitive data.

**Affected Libsodium Component:**  Cryptographic algorithms implemented within libsodium (e.g., encryption, decryption, signing).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Libsodium is designed with countermeasures against common side-channel attacks. Ensure you are using the latest version, which includes these mitigations.
*   Be aware of potential side-channel vulnerabilities in the application's surrounding code and environment.
*   For highly sensitive applications, consider hardware-based cryptographic solutions.
