# Threat Model Analysis for jedisct1/libsodium

## Threat: [Libsodium Implementation Vulnerability (Memory Corruption)](./threats/libsodium_implementation_vulnerability__memory_corruption_.md)

Description: An attacker exploits a memory corruption bug (e.g., buffer overflow, use-after-free) within libsodium's C code. The attacker might craft specific inputs to cryptographic functions or exploit vulnerabilities in parsing or handling data to trigger memory corruption. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information leakage.
Impact: Critical. Remote code execution on the server or client, complete system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
Libsodium Component Affected: Core cryptographic modules (e.g., `crypto_secretbox`, `crypto_sign`, `crypto_hash`), memory management within libsodium.
Risk Severity: Critical.
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Use stable and latest versions of libsodium.
    * Regularly update libsodium to patch security vulnerabilities.
    * Employ memory-safe programming practices in application code interacting with libsodium (though this is less direct mitigation for *libsodium* vulnerability itself, it's good practice).
    * Consider using memory sanitizers during development and testing of applications using libsodium.
    * Rely on security audits and penetration testing of libsodium itself (performed by the libsodium project and wider security community).

## Threat: [Libsodium Implementation Vulnerability (Logic Error in Algorithm)](./threats/libsodium_implementation_vulnerability__logic_error_in_algorithm_.md)

Description: An attacker discovers and exploits a logical flaw in the implementation of a cryptographic algorithm within libsodium. This could be a subtle error in the mathematical logic or the implementation of a specific cryptographic primitive. The attacker might craft specific inputs or exploit specific usage patterns to bypass security checks or weaken the cryptographic operation.
Impact: High.  Weakened or broken cryptography, potential for authentication bypass, data confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise.
Libsodium Component Affected: Specific cryptographic algorithm implementations (e.g., ChaCha20-Poly1305, Curve25519, BLAKE2b).
Risk Severity: High.
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Use stable and latest versions of libsodium.
    * Regularly update libsodium to patch security vulnerabilities.
    * Rely on the security audits and vetting performed by the libsodium project and wider cryptographic community.
    * Avoid modifying or reimplementing libsodium's cryptographic functions unless you are a cryptographic expert and have a very specific reason.
