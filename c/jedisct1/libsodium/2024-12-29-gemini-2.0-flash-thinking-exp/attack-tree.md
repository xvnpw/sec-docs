**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Cryptographic Weakness in Libsodium Usage [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This represents a broad category of attacks where the application's incorrect implementation or usage of libsodium's cryptographic functions leads to security vulnerabilities.

*   **Key Compromise [CRITICAL]:**
    *   If the attacker can obtain the secret cryptographic key, they can decrypt sensitive data, forge signatures, and bypass authentication mechanisms.

*   **Exploit Key Storage Vulnerability in Application [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Access Insecurely Stored Key File:** The application might store the secret key in a file with overly permissive access rights, allowing an attacker with local or compromised server access to read the key.
    *   **Exploit Memory Dump/Core Dump Containing Key:**  If the application crashes or generates a core dump, the secret key might be present in the memory snapshot, which an attacker could potentially access.

*   **Nonce Reuse [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Force Application to Reuse Nonce in Encryption:** In symmetric encryption schemes, using the same nonce (a unique, randomly generated value) with the same key to encrypt different messages can reveal information about the plaintext. An attacker might manipulate the application or its environment to force the reuse of a nonce.

*   **Weak Random Number Generation (If Application Relies on Application-Level RNG Instead of Libsodium's) [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Predictable Random Values Lead to Cryptographic Break:** If the application uses a weak or predictable random number generator for key generation, nonce generation, or other security-sensitive operations, an attacker might be able to predict these values and compromise the cryptography.

*   **Abuse of Libsodium Functionality:**
    *   This category involves using libsodium's features in a way that, while not exploiting a direct vulnerability in libsodium itself, can still harm the application.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Through Resource Exhaustion:**
    *   **Send Large Number of Cryptographic Requests:** An attacker can flood the application with a large number of computationally intensive cryptographic requests (e.g., encryption, decryption, signature verification). This can exhaust the server's resources (CPU, memory), making the application unresponsive to legitimate users.
