# Threat Model Analysis for jedisct1/libsodium

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Libsodium Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_known_libsodium_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a publicly known vulnerability in a specific version of `libsodium` being used by the application. This could involve crafting specific inputs or triggering certain conditions to bypass security measures.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability. It could range from information disclosure (e.g., decryption of sensitive data), to data tampering (e.g., forging signatures), to denial of service (e.g., crashing the application), or even remote code execution.

**Affected Libsodium Component:**  Potentially any module or function within `libsodium` depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., `crypto_secretbox_easy`, `crypto_sign_detached`, memory management functions).

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*  Regularly update `libsodium` to the latest stable version. Monitor security advisories and release notes from the `libsodium` project.
*  Implement a robust dependency management system to facilitate timely updates.
*  Consider using automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify outdated libraries.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption in Libsodium](./threats/memory_corruption_in_libsodium.md)

**Description:** An attacker triggers a memory corruption vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, use-after-free) within `libsodium`'s C code by providing crafted inputs or exploiting specific usage patterns. This could overwrite memory regions, leading to unexpected behavior or allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure depending on the nature of the memory corruption and the attacker's ability to control the corrupted memory.

**Affected Libsodium Component:**  Potentially any function that handles input or performs memory operations, especially those dealing with variable-length data (e.g., encryption/decryption functions, signature verification).

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*  Regularly update `libsodium` as memory corruption vulnerabilities are often patched.
*  Ensure the application uses `libsodium` functions correctly, adhering to documented input size limitations and usage patterns.
*  Consider using memory-safe programming practices in the application code that interacts with `libsodium`.

## Threat: [Incorrect Key Management Leading to Compromise](./threats/incorrect_key_management_leading_to_compromise.md)

**Description:** Developers mishandle cryptographic keys generated or used by `libsodium`. This could involve storing keys in plaintext, using weak key derivation functions *outside* of libsodium's secure primitives but for keys used with libsodium, failing to rotate keys, or transmitting keys insecurely. An attacker who gains access to these compromised keys can then decrypt data, forge signatures, or impersonate users.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the cryptographic security of the application, leading to information disclosure, data tampering, and loss of trust.

**Affected Libsodium Component:**  Functions related to key generation (`crypto_secretbox_keygen`, `crypto_kx_keypair`), key exchange (`crypto_kx_client_session_keys`, `crypto_kx_server_session_keys`), and potentially all cryptographic operations that rely on these keys.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*  Never store cryptographic keys in plaintext. Use secure storage mechanisms like hardware security modules (HSMs), key management systems, or operating system key stores.
*  Employ strong key derivation functions (KDFs) when deriving keys from passwords or other secrets.
*  Implement proper key rotation policies.
*  Use secure channels (e.g., TLS) for key exchange if necessary.
*  Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to cryptographic keys.

## Threat: [Nonce Reuse in Encryption](./threats/nonce_reuse_in_encryption.md)

**Description:** For certain authenticated encryption modes in `libsodium` (e.g., `crypto_secretbox_easy`), reusing the same nonce with the same key compromises the confidentiality and integrity of the encrypted messages. An attacker observing multiple encryptions with the same nonce can potentially recover the plaintext or forge messages.

**Impact:**  Loss of confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data.

**Affected Libsodium Component:**  Authenticated encryption functions like `crypto_secretbox_easy`, `crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt`.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*  Ensure that nonces are unique for each encryption operation with the same key. Use counters, random number generators, or other reliable methods to generate unique nonces.
*  Carefully manage nonce generation and storage to prevent accidental reuse.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Libsodium](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_libsodium.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the `libsodium` source code repository, build process, or distribution channels to inject malicious code into the library. Developers unknowingly use this compromised version, introducing vulnerabilities into their applications.

**Impact:**  Potentially complete compromise of the application, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.

**Affected Libsodium Component:**  The entire library.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*  Verify the integrity of the downloaded `libsodium` library using checksums or digital signatures provided by the official project.
*  Use trusted sources for downloading `libsodium`.
*  Consider using reproducible builds to ensure the build process hasn't been tampered with.
