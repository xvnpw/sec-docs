# Attack Surface Analysis for jedisct1/libsodium

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflows/Underflows in Input Handling](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflowsunderflows_in_input_handling.md)

**Description:** Buffer Overflows/Underflows in Input Handling
    * **How libsodium Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  `libsodium` functions operate on byte arrays. Incorrectly sized buffers passed *directly* to `libsodium` functions as input (e.g., plaintext for encryption, ciphertext for decryption, data for hashing) can lead to the library reading or writing beyond allocated memory.
    * **Example:** Passing a plaintext buffer to `crypto_secretbox_easy()` where the provided length parameter is larger than the actual allocated buffer size, causing `libsodium` to write out of bounds.
    * **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Validation (for libsodium calls):**  Thoroughly validate the size of input buffers *immediately before* passing them to `libsodium` functions.
        * **Use `sodium_memzero()` on Sensitive Data:** After using sensitive data like keys or intermediate cryptographic values, use `sodium_memzero()` to overwrite the memory.
        * **Careful Length Management:** Ensure accurate tracking and use of length parameters when interacting with `libsodium` functions.

## Attack Surface: [Cryptographic Key Exposure due to Improper Handling](./attack_surfaces/cryptographic_key_exposure_due_to_improper_handling.md)

**Description:** Cryptographic Key Exposure due to Improper Handling
    * **How libsodium Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `libsodium` is responsible for generating and operating on sensitive cryptographic keys. Vulnerabilities arise when the application mishandles these keys *after* they are generated or provided to `libsodium`.
    * **Example:**  Storing a secret key generated by `crypto_secretbox_keygen()` in an environment variable or logging it, making it accessible to attackers. Or, failing to properly zero out key material in memory after use.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the cryptographic system, allowing attackers to decrypt data, forge signatures, or impersonate users.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Key Generation (using libsodium):** Utilize `libsodium`'s secure key generation functions (`crypto_secretbox_keygen`, `crypto_sign_keypair`, etc.).
        * **Secure Key Storage:** Employ secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system or dedicated key management systems. Avoid storing keys in plaintext in configuration files or application code.
        * **Memory Protection for Keys:** Minimize the lifetime of keys in memory and use memory locking or secure memory allocation if available to prevent swapping to disk.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict access to cryptographic keys to only the necessary parts of the application.

## Attack Surface: [Nonce/IV Reuse with Encryption Functions](./attack_surfaces/nonceiv_reuse_with_encryption_functions.md)

**Description:** Nonce/IV Reuse with Encryption Functions
    * **How libsodium Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  `libsodium`'s symmetric encryption functions (like `crypto_secretbox_easy()` and `crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_encrypt()`) require a unique nonce or initialization vector (IV) for each encryption operation with the same key. Reusing a nonce/IV with the same key breaks the security guarantees of these encryption modes.
    * **Example:**  Using the same hardcoded nonce value repeatedly when encrypting different messages with the same secret key using `crypto_secretbox_easy()`.
    * **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, allowing attackers to potentially recover plaintext, distinguish encrypted messages, or forge messages.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Generate Nonces Randomly (using libsodium):**  Use `randombytes_buf()` to generate unique, unpredictable nonces for each encryption operation.
        * **Implement Counter-Based Nonces (with extreme caution):** If using counter-based nonces, ensure the counter is never repeated for the same key and handle potential overflow scenarios securely.
        * **Document and Enforce Nonce Usage Policies:** Establish clear guidelines for nonce generation and usage within the development team.

## Attack Surface: [Side-Channel Attacks (Timing Attacks) on Cryptographic Operations](./attack_surfaces/side-channel_attacks_(timing_attacks)_on_cryptographic_operations.md)

**Description:** Side-Channel Attacks (Timing Attacks) on Cryptographic Operations
    * **How libsodium Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While `libsodium` aims for constant-time implementations of its cryptographic primitives to prevent timing attacks, vulnerabilities might exist in specific functions or architectures, or improper usage might negate these protections.
    * **Example:**  While less likely with core `libsodium` functions, if custom code interacts with `libsodium` in a way that introduces data-dependent timing (e.g., comparing cryptographic hashes byte-by-byte), it can create a timing attack vector. Hypothetically, a subtle timing difference in a less-used `libsodium` function could be exploited.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can potentially infer secret information (e.g., key material, password hashes) by precisely measuring the execution time of cryptographic operations.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Rely on libsodium's Constant-Time Guarantees:** Trust and utilize `libsodium`'s core cryptographic functions, which are designed to be constant-time.
        * **Careful Code Review of Interactions:**  Thoroughly review any custom code that interacts with `libsodium` to ensure it does not introduce timing vulnerabilities.
        * **Avoid Data-Dependent Branching on Secrets:**  Minimize data-dependent branching and memory access patterns when handling sensitive cryptographic data.
