## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Libsodium Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_libsodium_vulnerability.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path involves an attacker identifying and then exploiting a security flaw directly within the libsodium library itself. This could be a bug in the C code leading to memory corruption or a subtle flaw in the implementation of a cryptographic algorithm.
    * **Critical Node: Exploit Identified Vulnerability**
        * **Attack Vector:** Once a vulnerability is identified (through methods like source code analysis, reviewing CVEs, or fuzzing), the attacker crafts specific inputs or triggers to exploit that flaw. This could involve sending specially crafted data to a vulnerable libsodium function.
        * **Critical Node: Trigger Memory Corruption**
            * **Attack Vector:** A common outcome of exploiting vulnerabilities in C libraries like libsodium is memory corruption. This occurs when the attacker can write data beyond the allocated buffer (buffer overflow) or access memory after it has been freed (use-after-free). Successfully triggering memory corruption can allow the attacker to overwrite critical program data or inject and execute arbitrary code, leading to complete control of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Side-Channel Attack on Libsodium](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_side-channel_attack_on_libsodium.md)

**Attack Vector:** Instead of directly exploiting code flaws, side-channel attacks leverage observable information about the execution of libsodium's cryptographic operations. This could involve precisely measuring the time it takes for certain operations (timing attacks) or analyzing the CPU cache usage (cache attacks).
    * **Critical Node: Recover Secret Information**
        * **Attack Vector:** By carefully analyzing the side-channel measurements, the attacker can deduce information about the secret keys being used by libsodium. For example, variations in execution time based on key bits can be exploited to recover the entire key. Once the key is recovered, the attacker can decrypt data, forge signatures, and completely bypass the cryptographic protections.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Misuse of Libsodium by the Application](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_misuse_of_libsodium_by_the_application.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is a broad category encompassing errors made by the developers when integrating and using libsodium. Even a secure library can be rendered ineffective if used incorrectly.
    * **Critical Node: Exploit Misuse**
        * **Attack Vector:** This node represents the point where the attacker leverages the identified misuse to compromise the application. This could involve sending specific requests that exploit incorrect key handling or trigger vulnerabilities due to nonce reuse.
        * **Critical Node: Incorrect Key Management**
            * **Attack Vector:** This covers various flaws in how the application manages cryptographic keys.
            * **Critical Node: Hardcoded Keys**
                * **Attack Vector:** The simplest and often most devastating key management error. If cryptographic keys are directly embedded in the application's source code, configuration files, or other easily accessible locations, an attacker can simply find and use them, completely bypassing the intended security.
            * **Critical Node: Nonce Reuse (with AEAD algorithms)**
                * **Attack Vector:** When using Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms (like ChaCha20-Poly1305), reusing the same nonce with the same key for different messages breaks the confidentiality and integrity guarantees. An attacker who observes multiple messages encrypted with the same key and nonce can decrypt them and potentially forge messages.
