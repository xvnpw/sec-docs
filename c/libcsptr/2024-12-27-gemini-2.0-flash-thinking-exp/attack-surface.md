* **Reference Counting Errors:**
    * **Description:** Flaws in `libcsptr`'s internal logic for incrementing and decrementing reference counts can lead to incorrect object lifetime management.
    * **How `libcsptr` Contributes:** `libcsptr` is responsible for managing the reference counts of the smart pointers it creates. Bugs in this core functionality directly introduce this attack surface.
    * **Example:** A race condition in the reference counting mechanism could cause the count to drop to zero prematurely while another part of the application still holds a pointer, leading to a double-free.
    * **Impact:** Memory corruption, crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the freed memory.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thorough Code Review and Static Analysis of `libcsptr`.
        * Fuzzing `libcsptr`.
        * Use Thread-Safe Smart Pointers (if available and needed).

* **Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** Accessing memory that has already been freed due to errors in `libcsptr`'s object destruction.
    * **How `libcsptr` Contributes:** If `libcsptr` incorrectly manages object lifetimes (e.g., due to reference counting errors), it can lead to objects being deallocated while still referenced by smart pointers or weak pointers.
    * **Example:** A bug in `libcsptr` might cause the destructor of an object to be called while a weak pointer to that object is still being used, leading to a crash or exploitable memory access.
    * **Impact:** Memory corruption, crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Careful Review of `libcsptr`'s Destruction Logic.
        * Proper Use of Weak Pointers.
        * Avoid Mixing Raw Pointers with Smart Pointers.

* **Double-Free Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** Freeing the same memory location multiple times, leading to memory corruption.
    * **How `libcsptr` Contributes:** Bugs in `libcsptr`'s reference counting or destruction logic can cause the destructor of an object to be called more than once.
    * **Example:** A flaw in the copy constructor or assignment operator of a smart pointer within `libcsptr` could lead to multiple smart pointers incorrectly sharing ownership and attempting to free the same resource.
    * **Impact:** Memory corruption, crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thorough Testing of Smart Pointer Operations.
        * Static Analysis Tools.
