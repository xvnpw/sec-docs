# Threat Model Analysis for cloudwu/skynet

## Threat: [Message Flooding DoS](./threats/message_flooding_dos.md)

Description: An attacker, either external or a compromised service, sends a large volume of messages to a Skynet service, overwhelming its message queue and processing capacity. This can be done by exploiting publicly accessible service endpoints or by compromising an internal service to launch the attack.
Impact: Service unavailability, performance degradation for all services due to resource exhaustion, potential system instability.
Skynet Component Affected: Message queue system, service dispatching, potentially all services if system-wide resources are exhausted.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement message rate limiting at service level.
    * Implement message queue size limits.
    * Consider message prioritization to ensure critical messages are processed.
    * Monitor message queue lengths and service performance for anomalies.
    * If external access points exist, implement input validation and filtering.

## Threat: [Message Spoofing/Service Impersonation](./threats/message_spoofingservice_impersonation.md)

Description: A malicious service or attacker crafts messages that appear to originate from a legitimate service. This could involve forging service addresses or identifiers in messages. An attacker might exploit this to bypass authorization checks or manipulate data intended for another service.
Impact: Unauthorized access to data or functionality, data corruption, privilege escalation within the Skynet system, disruption of service logic.
Skynet Component Affected: Message routing, service addressing, inter-service communication mechanisms.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement service authentication and authorization.
    * Use secure service identifiers that are difficult to guess or forge.
    * Consider message signing or encryption to verify message origin and integrity.
    * Enforce strict access control policies between services.

## Threat: [Lua Code Injection](./threats/lua_code_injection.md)

Description: If the application dynamically generates or evaluates Lua code based on untrusted input within a Skynet service, an attacker can inject malicious Lua code. This code could be executed within the context of the Skynet service, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
Impact: Arbitrary code execution within the Skynet service, system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
Skynet Component Affected: Lua scripting engine, `lua_loadstring`, `luaL_loadstring`, or similar functions used for dynamic code loading within Skynet services.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Avoid dynamic Lua code generation from untrusted input within Skynet services.
    * If dynamic code generation is necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all input.
    * Use secure coding practices in Lua to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    * Implement sandboxing or restricted execution environments for dynamically generated code (if feasible within Skynet context).

## Threat: [Skynet C Core Bugs](./threats/skynet_c_core_bugs.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities in the Skynet C core, such as buffer overflows, memory corruption, or logic errors, can be exploited. Exploiting these can lead to system crashes, arbitrary code execution in the core process, or privilege escalation.
Impact: System compromise, arbitrary code execution, denial of service, privilege escalation.
Skynet Component Affected: Skynet C core, core modules, message dispatching, scheduler.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep Skynet framework updated to the latest stable version.
    * Monitor Skynet project for security advisories and bug fixes.
    * If modifying the C core, perform rigorous security testing and code reviews.
    * Use memory-safe coding practices in C and utilize static analysis tools.

## Threat: [Skynet Lua API Binding Vulnerabilities](./threats/skynet_lua_api_binding_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Bugs or vulnerabilities in the Lua API bindings that interface Lua services with the C core can be exploited. This could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security issues when Lua services interact with the core framework.
Impact: Varies, but can include denial of service, unexpected service behavior, potentially arbitrary code execution if vulnerabilities allow for memory corruption or similar issues.
Skynet Component Affected: Skynet Lua API bindings, interface between Lua and C core.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep Skynet framework updated.
    * Review and test any custom extensions or modifications to the Skynet Lua API.
    * Ensure proper input validation and error handling in API bindings.

## Threat: [Service Isolation Failures](./threats/service_isolation_failures.md)

Description:  Vulnerabilities in Skynet's service isolation mechanisms or misconfigurations could allow one service to interfere with or compromise another service. This could be due to shared memory vulnerabilities, incorrect access control, or flaws in the message passing system.
Impact: Privilege escalation, cross-service contamination, broader system compromise starting from a single vulnerable service.
Skynet Component Affected: Service isolation mechanisms, message passing, memory management, access control (if implemented).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Ensure proper service isolation within the Skynet environment.
    * Review and test service isolation mechanisms.
    * Minimize sharing of sensitive resources or data between services.
    * Implement principle of least privilege for services.
