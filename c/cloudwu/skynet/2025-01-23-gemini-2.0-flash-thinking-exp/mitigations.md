## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization in Lua Services (Skynet Context)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_in_lua_services__skynet_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation and Sanitization in Lua Services (Skynet Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Skynet Service Input Points:** Focus on input points *within your Skynet Lua services*. This includes:
        *   Data received via `skynet.send` from other Skynet services or external clients connected through custom network protocols managed by Skynet services.
        *   Data read from configuration files loaded by Skynet services during startup.
        *   Data obtained from any external system accessed by a Skynet service (though external system interaction is less directly Skynet-specific, the *handling* within the Skynet service is).
    2.  **Define Lua-Specific Validation Rules:**  Tailor validation rules to the Lua data types and common data structures used in your Skynet services.
    3.  **Implement Validation in Lua Service Code:** Embed validation logic directly within your Lua service code that handles incoming messages or data. Use Lua's string manipulation and type checking functions.
    4.  **Sanitize Lua Strings:** Pay special attention to sanitizing Lua strings, as these are frequently used in Skynet message payloads and service logic.
    5.  **Lua Error Handling within Skynet Services:** Implement error handling in your Lua services to gracefully manage invalid input and prevent service crashes or unexpected behavior within the Skynet application.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities in Lua Services (High Severity):** SQL Injection (if Lua service interacts with databases), Command Injection (if Lua service executes system commands), Lua Injection (if using `loadstring` within the service with external input). These are exploited via malicious input to Skynet services.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Skynet Services (Medium Severity):** Malformed input sent to Skynet services can cause crashes or resource exhaustion if not validated.
    *   **Data Corruption within Skynet Application (Medium Severity):** Invalid data processed by Skynet services can lead to incorrect application state and data corruption.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces injection risks and improves the robustness of Skynet services against malicious or malformed input. Enhances the overall stability of the Skynet application.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in core game logic services within `service/game`, specifically for handling player commands and game events received via `skynet.send`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing comprehensive validation in:
    *   Newly developed Skynet services.
    *   Input handling in utility services and less critical Skynet components.
    *   Consistent validation practices across all Lua services in the Skynet application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Use of `loadstring` and `load` in Skynet Lua Services](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_use_of__loadstring__and__load__in_skynet_lua_services.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Use of `loadstring` and `load` in Skynet Lua Services
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Skynet Lua Code Review:** Specifically review the Lua code within your Skynet services for instances of `loadstring` and `load`.
    2.  **Justify Dynamic Code in Skynet Context:**  Critically assess *why* dynamic code execution is being used in each Skynet service. Are there Skynet-specific alternatives using configuration or message-driven logic?
    3.  **Refactor Skynet Services:** Refactor Skynet services to eliminate or minimize `loadstring` and `load`. Leverage Skynet's message passing and service-based architecture for modularity and configuration.
    4.  **Skynet-Aware Sandboxing (If Necessary):** If dynamic code is unavoidable in a Skynet service, implement Lua sandboxing that is aware of the Skynet environment and restricts access to potentially dangerous Skynet API functions or system calls from within the sandboxed code.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Skynet Services (Critical Severity):** `loadstring` and `load` in Skynet services are direct pathways to RCE if an attacker can control the input to these functions, potentially compromising the entire Skynet application.
    *   **Lua Injection within Skynet Services (High Severity):** Attackers can inject malicious Lua code that executes within the context of a Skynet service.
*   **Impact:** Drastically reduces the risk of RCE and Lua injection vulnerabilities within Skynet services, making the application significantly more secure against code execution attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Core game logic and critical Skynet services in `service/game` and `service/login` generally avoid `loadstring` and `load`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review and refactoring of utility Skynet services in `service/util` to remove or justify `loadstring`/`load` usage.
    *   Establishment of a clear policy against using `loadstring` and `load` in new Skynet service development.
    *   No automated checks to detect `loadstring`/`load` usage specifically within Skynet service code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for Skynet Lua Services](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_skynet_lua_services.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Limits for Skynet Lua Services
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Skynet Service Resource Needs:** Analyze the resource consumption patterns of different Skynet services (CPU, memory, message queue).
    2.  **Define Skynet Service-Specific Limits:** Set resource limits tailored to each Skynet service's function and expected load within the Skynet application.
    3.  **Implement Limits within Skynet Services or Supervisor:** Implement resource limiting mechanisms *within* the Lua service code itself or in a dedicated Skynet supervisor service that monitors and controls other services.  This leverages Skynet's service architecture for management.
    4.  **Monitor Skynet Service Resources:** Monitor resource usage of Skynet services using custom monitoring services or external tools integrated with Skynet's logging or metrics.
    5.  **Skynet Service Error Handling for Limits:** Implement error handling in Skynet services to gracefully handle resource limit violations and potentially communicate backpressure to other Skynet services or clients.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Skynet Application (High Severity):** Resource exhaustion attacks targeting Skynet services can cripple the entire application. Resource limits mitigate this.
    *   **Resource Starvation within Skynet Application (Medium Severity):** One runaway Skynet service can starve other services of resources. Limits ensure fair resource allocation within the Skynet application.
    *   **Exploitation of Resource Leaks in Skynet Services (Medium Severity):** Resource leaks in Lua code within Skynet services can be contained by resource limits.
*   **Impact:**  Significantly improves the resilience of the Skynet application to DoS attacks and resource exhaustion. Enhances stability and prevents resource starvation among Skynet services.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic message queue size limits are used in some critical `service/game` Skynet services.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive CPU and memory limits for all Skynet Lua services.
    *   A centralized Skynet service monitoring and alerting system for resource usage.
    *   Automated enforcement of resource limits and handling of violations within the Skynet environment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Message Authentication and Integrity for Skynet Service Communication](./mitigation_strategies/message_authentication_and_integrity_for_skynet_service_communication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Message Authentication and Integrity for Skynet Service Communication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secure Skynet Message Protocol Design:** Design your Skynet message protocols to include fields for authentication and integrity information (e.g., MACs or signatures).
    2.  **Skynet Key Management Service (Optional):** Consider a dedicated Skynet service for managing cryptographic keys used for message authentication between other Skynet services.
    3.  **Implement Signing/Verification in Skynet Services:** Modify message sending and receiving logic in relevant Skynet services to generate and verify MACs or signatures for inter-service communication using `skynet.send` and message handling functions.
    4.  **Apply to Critical Skynet Service Channels:** Prioritize securing communication channels between critical Skynet services that handle sensitive data or control application state.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Message Forgery/Spoofing between Skynet Services (High Severity):** Malicious Skynet services or compromised components could send forged messages to other services, disrupting application logic or gaining unauthorized access.
    *   **Message Tampering in Skynet Service Communication (Medium Severity):** Attackers within the Skynet environment could intercept and modify messages exchanged between services.
    *   **Internal Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks within Skynet (Medium Severity):**  While less likely, if an attacker gains control within the Skynet environment, they could potentially intercept and manipulate inter-service communication.
*   **Impact:**  Significantly enhances the security of communication between Skynet services, preventing message forgery and tampering within the application. Builds trust in inter-service interactions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Skynet services currently communicate without built-in message authentication or integrity checks.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No message authentication or integrity mechanisms for Skynet service communication.
    *   No key management infrastructure within the Skynet application for inter-service security.
    *   This is a significant gap for applications requiring secure communication between internal Skynet components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Message Queue Management for Skynet Services](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_message_queue_management_for_skynet_services.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting and Message Queue Management for Skynet Services
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Rate-Sensitive Skynet Services:** Determine which Skynet services are most susceptible to message flooding or high message rates (e.g., services handling external client requests, services processing frequent events).
    2.  **Define Skynet Service Rate Limits:** Establish rate limits for message processing *within* these Skynet services, considering the service's capacity and the overall Skynet application's performance.
    3.  **Implement Rate Limiting in Skynet Service Logic:** Implement rate limiting algorithms (token bucket, leaky bucket, etc.) directly within the Lua code of rate-sensitive Skynet services.
    4.  **Skynet Service Message Queue Management:** Implement queue size limits and backpressure mechanisms *within* Skynet services to manage message backlogs and prevent queue overflows.  Leverage Skynet's asynchronous message handling.
    5.  **Monitor Skynet Service Message Rates and Queues:** Monitor message rates and queue sizes for rate-limited Skynet services to tune limits and detect potential DoS attacks or performance issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Skynet Services (High Severity):** Message flooding directed at specific Skynet services can overwhelm them. Rate limiting mitigates this.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion in Skynet Services (Medium Severity):** Unbounded message queues in Skynet services can lead to memory exhaustion. Queue management prevents this.
    *   **Cascading Failures within Skynet Application (Medium Severity):**  One overloaded Skynet service can cause cascading failures to other dependent services if message queues overflow and backpressure is not handled.
*   **Impact:**  Improves the resilience of individual Skynet services and the overall Skynet application to DoS attacks and message flooding. Prevents resource exhaustion and cascading failures.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic message queue size limits exist in some `service/game` Skynet services.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent rate limiting across all critical Skynet services.
    *   Standardized rate limiting and queue management libraries for Skynet services.
    *   Advanced rate limiting algorithms and backpressure mechanisms for Skynet message flow.

    2.  **Apply Skynet Core Updates:** When updates are released, especially those addressing security vulnerabilities, promptly apply them to your Skynet deployment. Follow the Skynet update and build instructions.
    3.  **Test Updates in Staging:** Before deploying Skynet core updates to production, thoroughly test them in a staging environment to ensure compatibility and stability with your application.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Skynet Core Vulnerabilities (Severity Varies):**  Outdated Skynet core versions may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit to compromise the Skynet application or the underlying system. Severity depends on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in the Skynet framework itself. Ensures the application benefits from security improvements and bug fixes in the core.

    *   Formal security-focused code review process for Skynet Lua services.
    *   Integration of static analysis tools for Lua code in the development workflow.
    *   Security training program for Skynet developers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sandboxing Lua Environments for Skynet Services (Advanced)](./mitigation_strategies/sandboxing_lua_environments_for_skynet_services__advanced_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sandboxing Lua Environments for Skynet Services (Advanced)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Services for Sandboxing:** Determine which Skynet services would benefit most from Lua sandboxing, especially those handling untrusted input or performing sensitive operations.
    2.  **Design Skynet-Aware Sandbox:** Design a Lua sandboxing environment that is tailored to the Skynet context. This might involve:
        *   Restricting access to certain Lua standard libraries (e.g., `io`, `os`, `debug`).
        *   Limiting access to specific Skynet API functions (`skynet.send`, `skynet.call`, etc.) based on service needs.
        *   Implementing custom Lua environments with restricted global variables and function access.
    3.  **Implement Sandbox Enforcement:** Implement mechanisms to enforce the Lua sandbox for selected Skynet services. This could involve custom Lua code, modifications to the Skynet core (advanced), or external sandboxing libraries (if compatible with Skynet).
    4.  **Testing and Performance Evaluation:** Thoroughly test sandboxed Skynet services to ensure they function correctly within the restricted environment and evaluate the performance impact of sandboxing.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Lua Injection in Sandboxed Services (Critical Severity - Reduced):** Sandboxing significantly reduces the impact of RCE and Lua injection vulnerabilities by limiting the capabilities of exploited code within the sandbox. Even if code is injected, its ability to harm the system is restricted.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Skynet Application (Medium to High Severity - Reduced):** Sandboxing can prevent compromised services from escalating privileges or accessing resources they shouldn't have within the Skynet application.
*   **Impact:**  Provides a strong defense-in-depth layer for critical Skynet services. Significantly reduces the potential damage from successful code execution exploits by limiting the attacker's capabilities within the sandbox.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Lua sandboxing is not currently used for Skynet services.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No Lua sandboxing mechanisms are in place for Skynet services.
    *   This is an advanced mitigation strategy that would require significant development effort to implement and integrate with Skynet.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Message Authorization and Access Control for Skynet Services](./mitigation_strategies/message_authorization_and_access_control_for_skynet_services.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Message Authorization and Access Control for Skynet Services

    2.  **Implement Authorization Checks in Services:** Implement authorization checks within Skynet services to verify if incoming messages are from authorized sources and are of an allowed type.
    3.  **Centralized Authorization Service (Optional):** For complex authorization scenarios, consider a dedicated Skynet authorization service that can be queried by other services to make authorization decisions.
    4.  **Enforce Least Privilege Communication:** Design Skynet service communication patterns to adhere to the principle of least privilege. Services should only be able to send and receive messages necessary for their intended function.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Skynet Service Functionality (Medium to High Severity):** Without authorization, malicious or compromised Skynet services could potentially send unauthorized messages to other services, triggering unintended actions or gaining access to sensitive functionality.
    *   **Logic Exploitation within Skynet Application (Medium Severity):** Attackers could exploit weaknesses in service communication logic if authorization is not enforced, potentially manipulating application behavior.
*   **Impact:**  Restricts unauthorized access to Skynet service functionality and prevents malicious services from manipulating other services or application logic through unauthorized messages. Enforces secure service communication patterns.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic authorization checks might be present in some services, but a comprehensive and consistent authorization framework is likely missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal service communication policies and authorization framework for Skynet services.
    *   Consistent implementation of authorization checks in all relevant Skynet services.
    *   Potentially a centralized Skynet authorization service for complex scenarios.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Service Discovery and Addressing in Custom Skynet Implementations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Custom Service Discovery:** If you have implemented a custom service discovery or addressing mechanism *on top of Skynet* (beyond Skynet's basic addressing), thoroughly review its security.
    2.  **Authentication for Service Registration:** If services register themselves with a discovery service, implement authentication to prevent unauthorized services from registering or impersonating legitimate services.
    3.  **Authorization for Service Lookup:** Control access to the service registry. Implement authorization to ensure only authorized services can look up and discover other services.
    4.  **Protect Service Registry Integrity:** Protect the service registry itself from unauthorized modification or deletion. Ensure its availability and integrity.
    5.  **Secure Communication with Discovery Service:** Secure communication channels between services and the discovery service (e.g., using encryption and authentication).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Service Impersonation (Medium to High Severity):** Attackers could register malicious services under legitimate service names, intercepting messages or disrupting communication within the Skynet application.
    *   **Unauthorized Service Discovery (Medium Severity):** Unauthorized services could discover and potentially exploit other services if service discovery is not secured.
    *   **Disruption of Service Discovery (Medium Severity):** Attackers could target the service discovery mechanism itself, disrupting communication and availability of the Skynet application.
*   **Impact:**  Secures custom service discovery mechanisms built on Skynet, preventing service impersonation, unauthorized discovery, and disruption of service communication.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Implementation status depends entirely on whether a custom service discovery mechanism is used in the project. If using only Skynet's built-in addressing, this might be less relevant.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  If a custom service discovery is used, security measures as described above are likely missing and need to be implemented.
