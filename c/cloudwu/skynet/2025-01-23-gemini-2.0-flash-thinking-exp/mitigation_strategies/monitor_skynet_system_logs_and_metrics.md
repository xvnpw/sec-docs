### 2. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy: Monitor Skynet System Logs and Metrics

This mitigation strategy focuses on enhancing the observability of a Skynet application to improve security incident detection and operational diagnostics.  It is a proactive approach that aims to provide early warnings and insights into the system's behavior. Let's analyze each component in detail:

#### 2.1 Centralized Skynet Logging

*   **Description:**  This component emphasizes the importance of aggregating logs from all Skynet services into a central repository.  This is crucial because Skynet applications are often distributed, and logs scattered across different nodes or services are difficult to manage and analyze effectively.  The logs should contain information about service lifecycle events (startup, shutdown), errors, warnings, and potentially security-relevant actions (e.g., authentication attempts, access control decisions, suspicious message patterns).

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Improved Security Incident Detection:** Centralized logs provide a single source of truth for security investigations.  Analysts can correlate events across different services to identify attack patterns and timelines.
    *   **Enhanced Forensic Capabilities:**  Comprehensive logs are essential for post-incident analysis to understand the scope and impact of security breaches.
    *   **Simplified Troubleshooting:**  Centralized logging makes it easier to diagnose operational issues by providing a holistic view of system behavior.
    *   **Compliance and Auditing:**  Centralized logs are often required for compliance with security standards and regulations, enabling auditing of system activities.

*   **Challenges and Considerations:**
