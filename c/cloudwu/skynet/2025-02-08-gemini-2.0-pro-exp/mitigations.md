# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cloudwu/skynet

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Message Authentication and Integrity (HMAC within Skynet)](./mitigation_strategies/1__message_authentication_and_integrity__hmac_within_skynet_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement HMAC-based message authentication *using Skynet services*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dedicated Skynet Security Service:** Create a dedicated Skynet service (`auth_service`) responsible for handling authentication and key management. This service should *not* perform any other application logic.
    2.  **Key Management (within Skynet context):** The `auth_service` can manage shared secret keys.  While a *separate*, external KMS is ideal, for a purely Skynet-focused mitigation, the `auth_service` can:
        *   Generate keys.
        *   Store keys (encrypted, ideally using a Skynet-specific encryption service if one exists, or a simple C library).
        *   Distribute keys to other services *via secure Skynet messages* (bootstrapping the security). This initial key distribution is the most vulnerable point and requires careful consideration.  One approach is to have a pre-shared, very short-lived initial key used *only* for this distribution.
    3.  **Message Signing (Sender - Skynet Service):**
        *   A Skynet service wanting to send an authenticated message first serializes the message data (e.g., using Protocol Buffers).
        *   It then sends a request to the `auth_service`, including the serialized data and the recipient service ID.
        *   The `auth_service` retrieves the appropriate shared secret key, calculates the HMAC, and returns it to the sending service.
        *   The sending service includes the HMAC in the final message sent to the recipient.
    4.  **Message Verification (Receiver - Skynet Service):**
        *   The receiving Skynet service, upon receiving a message, extracts the HMAC.
        *   It sends a request to the `auth_service`, including the received message data, the sender service ID, and the received HMAC.
        *   The `auth_service` retrieves the shared secret, re-calculates the HMAC, and compares it to the received HMAC.  It returns a boolean (valid/invalid) to the receiving service.
        *   The receiving service acts based on the `auth_service`'s response.
    5. **Nonce/Sequence within Skynet:** The `auth_service` can also manage nonces or sequence numbers, ensuring uniqueness across the Skynet cluster. This adds replay protection.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Message Tampering (High Severity):** Prevents modification of messages *within the Skynet cluster*.
    *   **Message Spoofing (High Severity):** Prevents services from impersonating other *Skynet services*.
    *   **Replay Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prevents replaying of messages *within Skynet*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Message Tampering:** Risk reduced from High to Low (within Skynet).
    *   **Message Spoofing:** Risk reduced from High to Low (within Skynet).
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (within Skynet).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `auth_service` exists but only handles HMAC calculation. Key management is still external (encrypted config file).  Communication with `auth_service` is *not* secured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Secure key distribution *within* Skynet.
    *   Nonce/sequence number management within `auth_service`.
    *   Securing the communication *between* services and the `auth_service` itself (recursive application of this very mitigation!).

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Lua Sandboxing (Skynet Service-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/2__lua_sandboxing__skynet_service-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Lua sandboxing *specifically tailored to each Skynet service*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Per-Service Sandboxes:**  Each Skynet service that uses Lua should have its *own* isolated sandbox environment.  Do *not* use a single global sandbox for all services.
    2.  **Whitelist by Service Needs:**  The whitelist of allowed Lua functions and modules should be *specific* to the needs of each service.  A service that only needs to process data should have a much smaller whitelist than a service that needs to interact with other Skynet services.
    3.  **Skynet API Wrapper:**  Create a safe, controlled API (written in C and exposed to Lua) for interacting with other Skynet services.  This API should be the *only* way for Lua code within a service to communicate with the rest of the Skynet cluster.  This API should:
        *   Validate all inputs from Lua.
        *   Enforce access control (which services can be called).
        *   Handle message serialization and authentication (using the `auth_service` from Mitigation #1).
    4.  **Load Lua in Service Context:**  When a Skynet service starts, it should load its Lua code into its dedicated sandbox environment.  This ensures that each service's Lua code is isolated from other services.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical Severity):** Prevents malicious Lua code within *one* Skynet service from affecting other services or the underlying system.
    *   **Unauthorized Skynet Service Access (High Severity):** Prevents a compromised Lua service from calling arbitrary Skynet services.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Limits the ability of a compromised Lua service to access data belonging to other services.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (within the scope of a single service).
    *   **Unauthorized Skynet Service Access:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (between services).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic sandboxing is implemented for the `user_service`, but the Skynet API wrapper is incomplete.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Sandboxing is not implemented for all Lua-based services.
    *   The Skynet API wrapper is not fully implemented and does not enforce access control or handle authentication.
    *   No per-service sandboxes; a single, global sandbox is used (incorrectly).

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Secure C/Lua Interface (within Skynet Services)](./mitigation_strategies/3__secure_clua_interface__within_skynet_services_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Secure the C/Lua interface *within each Skynet service*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize C API Surface:**  Each Skynet service should expose a minimal C API to its Lua code.  This reduces the attack surface.
    2.  **Data Serialization (Service-Specific):**  Use a consistent data format (e.g., Protocol Buffers) for *all* data passed between C and Lua *within a service*.  This avoids direct manipulation of Lua tables or C structures.
    3.  **C-Side Validation (Service-Specific):**  The C code of *each* Skynet service must rigorously validate all data received from its Lua code.  This is *critical* for preventing C-level vulnerabilities.
    4. **Safe Skynet API:** The Skynet API wrapper (mentioned in Mitigation #2) should be implemented in C and should be the *only* way for Lua to interact with other Skynet services. This API handles the complexities of message passing, serialization, and authentication, presenting a safe interface to Lua.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Buffer Overflows (Critical Severity):** Prevents buffer overflows in the C code of a Skynet service due to malicious input from its Lua code.
    *   **Format String Vulnerabilities (Critical Severity):** Prevents format string vulnerabilities in the C code of a Skynet service.
    *   **Type Confusion (High Severity):** Prevents type confusion vulnerabilities in the C code of a Skynet service.
    *   **Code Injection (Critical):** Prevents injection of malicious C code through the Lua interface of a service.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Buffer Overflows:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (within a service).
    *   **Format String Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (within a service).
    *   **Type Confusion:** Risk reduced from High to Low (within a service).
    *   **Code Injection:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (within a service).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Protocol Buffers are used in *some* services for C/Lua communication, but not consistently.  Input validation is inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of Protocol Buffers across all services.
    *   Comprehensive input validation in the C code of *all* services that interact with Lua.
    *   Full implementation of the secure Skynet API wrapper.


## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Service Isolation (Skynet-Specific Enforcement)](./mitigation_strategies/4__service_isolation__skynet-specific_enforcement_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce service isolation using Skynet's architecture.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Service Decomposition:** Design the application as a collection of small, independent Skynet services. This is fundamental to Skynet's design.
    2.  **Minimize Inter-Service Communication:** Services should only communicate with other services they *absolutely need* to.  Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
    3.  **Skynet Message Filtering (Authorization):** Implement a Skynet service (e.g., `gatekeeper_service`) that acts as a message filter.  This service would:
        *   Receive *all* inter-service messages.
        *   Check an access control list (ACL) to determine if the sending service is authorized to send messages to the receiving service.
        *   Forward the message only if authorized; otherwise, drop the message and log the attempt.
        *   The ACL could be stored in the `gatekeeper_service`'s configuration (less secure) or managed by the `auth_service` (more secure).
    4. **Skynet Name Resolution Control:** If using Skynet's name resolution service, ensure that services can only resolve the names of other services they are allowed to communicate with. This adds another layer of isolation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents a compromised service from accessing other services it shouldn't.
    *   **Lateral Movement (High Severity):** Makes it harder for an attacker to move from one compromised service to another.
    *   **Unauthorized Service Calls (High):** Prevents services from making unauthorized calls to other services.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **Unauthorized Service Calls:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic service decomposition exists, but no message filtering or authorization.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `gatekeeper_service` (message filtering service) is not implemented.
    *   No access control lists (ACLs).
    *   No control over Skynet name resolution.
