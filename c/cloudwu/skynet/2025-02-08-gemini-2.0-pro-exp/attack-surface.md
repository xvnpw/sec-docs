# Attack Surface Analysis for cloudwu/skynet

## Attack Surface: [1. Inter-Service Message Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/1__inter-service_message_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers intercept, modify, or inject messages exchanged between Skynet services.
    *   **Skynet Contribution:** Skynet's core functionality is asynchronous message passing.  The framework itself does *not* enforce message security, leaving it entirely to the application developer. This inherent design choice makes it a primary attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts a "create user" message, modifies the requested privileges to "administrator," and forwards the altered message, gaining unauthorized administrative access.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, financial loss, unauthorized actions, system compromise, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Authentication:**  Mandatory strong authentication between *all* services.  Verify the sender of *every* message (e.g., shared secrets, service-specific tokens).
        *   **Authorization:**  Strict authorization checks on *every* message.  Ensure the sender is *allowed* to send that message type to the receiver.
        *   **Integrity:**  Mandatory message signing (e.g., HMAC) to prevent tampering.
        *   **Confidentiality (Context-Dependent):** Encrypt sensitive message payloads (lightweight encryption for internal, TLS for external).
        *   **Input Validation:**  Rigorous validation of *all* message data on the receiving end.  Treat *all* messages as potentially malicious.
        *   **Rate Limiting:**  Limit message send/receive rates to prevent flooding.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unauthorized Service Registration/Deregistration](./attack_surfaces/2__unauthorized_service_registrationderegistration.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers register malicious services or deregister legitimate ones, disrupting application functionality.
    *   **Skynet Contribution:** Skynet's service management, by default, does not inherently restrict who can register or deregister services.  This open design requires explicit security measures.
    *   **Example:** An attacker deregisters the authentication service, causing all subsequent requests to be processed without authentication, leading to unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, system instability, data breaches, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Centralized Authority:**  A single, trusted authority *must* handle all service registration/deregistration.  This authority authenticates and authorizes *all* requests.
        *   **Access Control:**  Strict ACLs or similar mechanisms to restrict registration/deregistration capabilities.
        *   **Whitelisting:**  Only allow registration from a pre-approved whitelist of services.
        *   **Monitoring:**  Continuous monitoring of service registrations/deregistrations with alerting on suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [3. Lua Script Injection](./attack_surfaces/3__lua_script_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Lua code into the Skynet environment.
    *   **Skynet Contribution:** Skynet's heavy reliance on Lua for service logic and its dynamic nature create a direct pathway for code injection if input is not handled properly.  The framework does not automatically sanitize input used in Lua scripts.
    *   **Example:**  A service accepts a user-provided "script name" parameter, which is then directly used to load and execute a Lua script.  The attacker provides a malicious script name, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, system compromise, access to other services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  *Never* directly embed user-provided data into Lua code.  Rigorously sanitize *all* input before any use in a Lua context.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Script Generation:**  Eliminate or severely restrict dynamic Lua script generation from user input.  Use pre-compiled, parameterized scripts.
        *   **Secure Sandbox:**  Employ a robust, regularly updated Lua sandbox with *strictly limited* capabilities.  Restrict access to Skynet APIs and system resources.
        *   **Code Review:**  Mandatory, thorough code reviews of *all* Lua code, focusing on injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [4. Gate Bypass and Message Tampering](./attack_surfaces/4__gate_bypass_and_message_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass the Skynet gate or manipulate messages passing through it.
    *   **Skynet Contribution:** The Skynet gate is a *designed* entry point for external communication.  If not properly secured, it becomes a single point of failure for the entire system. Skynet does not enforce security on the gate by default.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a flaw in the gate's authentication logic and connects directly to internal services, bypassing all security checks.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal services, data breaches, data manipulation, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Mandatory, robust authentication for *all* connections to the gate (e.g., TLS with client certificates, strong passwords with MFA).
        *   **Authorization:** Strict authorization rules to control client access to specific services through the gate.
        *   **Encryption:**  Mandatory TLS to encrypt *all* communication through the gate.
        *   **Message Integrity:**  Message signing (e.g., HMAC) to prevent tampering.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate *all* data received through the gate.
        *   **Regular Audits:**  Frequent security audits of the gate's configuration and code.

## Attack Surface: [5. Malicious Snax Services](./attack_surfaces/5__malicious_snax_services.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers deploy or compromise Snax services to execute malicious code.
    *   **Skynet Contribution:** Snax is a Skynet-specific mechanism for extending functionality.  Skynet itself does not validate the integrity or trustworthiness of Snax services. This places the responsibility entirely on the application developer.
    *   **Example:** An attacker publishes a Snax service that appears to provide useful functionality but secretly exfiltrates data.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Source Verification:** *Only* load Snax services from trusted, verified sources.
        *   **Code Review:** Mandatory, thorough code review of *all* Snax service code before loading.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Implement strong sandboxing or isolation to limit Snax service capabilities and prevent access to sensitive resources.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run Snax services with the absolute minimum necessary privileges.
