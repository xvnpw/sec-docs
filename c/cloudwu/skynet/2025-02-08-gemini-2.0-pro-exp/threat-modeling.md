# Threat Model Analysis for cloudwu/skynet

## Threat: [Unhandled Exceptions in Lua Scripts (Leading to Actor Crash)](./threats/unhandled_exceptions_in_lua_scripts__leading_to_actor_crash_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unhandled Exceptions in Lua Scripts (Leading to Actor Crash)
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted messages that cause unhandled exceptions within a Lua script running inside a Skynet actor.  This exploits the interaction between Skynet's message handling and the Lua runtime.  The lack of proper `pcall`/`xpcall` usage *within the Skynet context* makes this Skynet-specific.
    *   **Impact:** Actor crash, leading to denial of service for that actor and potentially cascading failures if other actors depend on it. May expose internal state information.
    *   **Skynet Component Affected:**  `lua-skynet.c` (Lua integration), specific Lua scripts within actors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust error handling in *all* Lua scripts using `pcall` or `xpcall` to catch and handle exceptions gracefully. This is crucial for Skynet's stability.
        *   Log all errors with sufficient context for debugging.
        *   Validate all input data before processing it within the Lua script.
        *   Use a linter for Lua code.

## Threat: [Global Variable Corruption in Lua (Across Actors)](./threats/global_variable_corruption_in_lua__across_actors_.md)

*   **Threat:** Global Variable Corruption in Lua (Across Actors)
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in one actor's Lua script to modify global variables *shared across the Skynet environment*. This leverages Skynet's shared Lua state, making it a Skynet-specific concern.
    *   **Impact:**  Unpredictable behavior in *multiple* actors, data corruption, potential privilege escalation *within the Skynet cluster*.
    *   **Skynet Component Affected:** `lua-skynet.c` (Lua integration), global Lua state managed by Skynet.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the use of global variables in Lua scripts *within the Skynet environment*.
        *   Use module-level variables (local to the script) whenever possible.
        *   If global variables *must* be used, carefully control access and validate modifications. This is critical in the shared Skynet context.
        *   Consider a stricter Lua sandbox that further restricts access to the global state *managed by Skynet*.

## Threat: [Deadlock due to Circular Message Dependencies (Within Skynet)](./threats/deadlock_due_to_circular_message_dependencies__within_skynet_.md)

*   **Threat:** Deadlock due to Circular Message Dependencies (Within Skynet)
    *   **Description:**  An attacker triggers a sequence of messages *between Skynet actors* that creates a circular dependency. This is a direct consequence of Skynet's actor model and message passing.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete deadlock of the involved *Skynet actors*, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Skynet Component Affected:**  `skynet_server.c` (message dispatch), `skynet_mq.c` (message queue), the logic of the interacting *Skynet actors*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design message passing protocols *within Skynet* to avoid circular dependencies.
        *   Use a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to visualize message flows and identify potential cycles *within the Skynet actor network*.
        *   Implement timeouts on message sends and receives *within Skynet's message handling* to break potential deadlocks.
        *   Monitor Skynet's internal metrics (message queue lengths, actor responsiveness) to detect deadlocks.

## Threat: [Message Flooding (DoS Targeting Skynet's Message Queue)](./threats/message_flooding__dos_targeting_skynet's_message_queue_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Message Flooding (DoS Targeting Skynet's Message Queue)
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of messages to a specific actor or to the Skynet cluster, overwhelming *Skynet's internal message queue*. This directly targets Skynet's core communication mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of service for the targeted actor or the *entire Skynet cluster*.
    *   **Skynet Component Affected:**  `skynet_mq.c` (message queue), `skynet_server.c` (message dispatch), `skynet_timer.c` (timer management, potentially affected by queue overload).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on incoming messages, both globally and per actor, *within Skynet's configuration*.
        *   Use a message queue with a bounded size and implement a backpressure mechanism *within Skynet* to handle overload.
        *   Monitor *Skynet's internal* message queue lengths and processing times.
        *   Consider dedicated message queues for critical Skynet services.

## Threat: [Replay Attack on Non-Idempotent Operations (Within Skynet Actors)](./threats/replay_attack_on_non-idempotent_operations__within_skynet_actors_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Replay Attack on Non-Idempotent Operations (Within Skynet Actors)
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts a legitimate message *sent between Skynet actors* that performs a non-idempotent operation and resends it. This exploits the lack of idempotency handling *within the Skynet actor communication*.
    *   **Impact:**  Duplicate operations, data corruption, unauthorized actions *within the Skynet cluster*.
    *   **Skynet Component Affected:** The logic of the *Skynet actor* handling the non-idempotent operation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement idempotency for all operations *within Skynet actors* where possible. Use unique request identifiers and track them.
        *   If idempotency is not possible, implement a mechanism *within the Skynet actor* to detect and reject duplicate messages (sequence numbers, timestamps).

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in `skynet_mq.c` (Skynet Core Vulnerability)](./threats/buffer_overflow_in__skynet_mq_c___skynet_core_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Buffer Overflow in `skynet_mq.c` (Skynet Core Vulnerability)
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted message with an excessively large payload that overflows a buffer *within Skynet's core message queue implementation*. This is a direct vulnerability in Skynet itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, denial of service, arbitrary code execution *within the Skynet process*.
    *   **Skynet Component Affected:**  `skynet_mq.c` (message queue).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Skynet up-to-date with the latest security patches. This is paramount.
        *   Perform regular security audits of the *Skynet codebase*, focusing on `skynet_mq.c`.
        *   Use memory-safe programming techniques in the C code (bounds checking).
        *   Use tools like AddressSanitizer and Valgrind to detect memory errors during Skynet's development and testing.

## Threat: [Malicious Service Registration (Abusing Skynet's Service Discovery)](./threats/malicious_service_registration__abusing_skynet's_service_discovery_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Malicious Service Registration (Abusing Skynet's Service Discovery)
    *   **Description:** An attacker registers a malicious service with *Skynet's service registry*, impersonating a legitimate service. This directly targets Skynet's service management.
    *   **Impact:**  Traffic redirection to the malicious service, data interception, denial of service for the legitimate service *within the Skynet cluster*.
    *   **Skynet Component Affected:**  The Skynet service registry (implementation depends on configuration, but is a core Skynet concept).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for service registration *within Skynet*. Only trusted actors should register services.
        *   Use a secure and trusted service registry *integrated with Skynet*.
        *   Validate service names and addresses *before Skynet actors connect to them*.
        *   Monitor *Skynet's service registry* for suspicious activity.
