## Threat Model: Skynet Application - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise application by executing arbitrary code within a Skynet service.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Execute Arbitrary Code within a Skynet Service ** CRITICAL NODE **
    * *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Service Vulnerability ** CRITICAL NODE **
        * *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Lua Injection ** CRITICAL NODE **
            * *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Via Malicious Input Data
                * Send crafted input to a service that directly evaluates it (e.g., using `loadstring`).
    * *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Manipulate Inter-Service Communication ** CRITICAL NODE **
        * *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Message Forgery
            * *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Without Authentication/Authorization
                * Send messages impersonating legitimate services due to lack of verification.
        * *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Service Impersonation/Hijacking
    * *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Compromise the Gate Service (Entry Point) ** CRITICAL NODE **
        * *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Input Validation Issues
            * *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Protocol Exploits (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket)
                * Exploit vulnerabilities in the protocols used by the gate service.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Execute Arbitrary Code within a Skynet Service:**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Achieving this means the attacker has gained the ability to execute any code they choose within the context of a Skynet service, leading to full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.

* **Exploit Service Vulnerability:**
    * This node represents the category of attacks that target weaknesses within the individual Skynet services. Success here allows the attacker to leverage flaws in the service's logic or implementation to gain unauthorized control.

* **Lua Injection:**
    * This specific attack vector exploits the use of the Lua scripting language within Skynet services. If user-provided data is directly evaluated as Lua code without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious Lua code that will be executed by the service.

* **Manipulate Inter-Service Communication:**
    * This node represents attacks that target the communication layer between different Skynet services. Compromising this aspect allows an attacker to intercept, modify, or forge messages, potentially disrupting the application's functionality or gaining unauthorized access.

* **Compromise the Gate Service (Entry Point):**
    * The gate service is the entry point for external communication with the Skynet application. Compromising this service allows an attacker to gain initial access to the application's internal network and potentially launch further attacks.

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Exploit Service Vulnerability -> Lua Injection -> Via Malicious Input Data:**
    * This path involves sending specially crafted input to a Skynet service that directly evaluates it as Lua code. If the service uses functions like `loadstring` without proper sanitization, the attacker's malicious code will be executed. This is a high-risk path due to the direct and often easily exploitable nature of code injection vulnerabilities in dynamic scripting environments.

* **Manipulate Inter-Service Communication -> Message Forgery -> Without Authentication/Authorization:**
    * This path exploits the lack of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for communication between Skynet services. An attacker can forge messages, pretending to be a legitimate service, and send them to other services. If services do not verify the origin of messages, they may act upon these forged messages, leading to unintended consequences or unauthorized actions. This is high-risk because it directly undermines the trust and integrity of the inter-service communication.

* **Manipulate Inter-Service Communication -> Service Impersonation/Hijacking:**
    * This path involves an attacker either registering a malicious service with the same name as a legitimate one or exploiting weaknesses in the service discovery mechanism to redirect messages intended for a legitimate service to their malicious service. This allows the attacker to intercept and potentially manipulate communication intended for the real service, gaining control over interactions and potentially sensitive data.

* **Compromise the Gate Service (Entry Point) -> Input Validation Issues -> Protocol Exploits (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket):**
    * This path targets vulnerabilities in the protocols used by the gate service to handle external communication. Attackers can exploit weaknesses in protocols like HTTP or WebSocket by sending specially crafted requests or data that the gate service fails to handle correctly. This can lead to various outcomes, including denial of service, information disclosure, or even remote code execution on the gate service itself, providing a foothold into the application. This is high-risk as the gate service is the primary entry point and protocol vulnerabilities are often well-understood and exploitable.
