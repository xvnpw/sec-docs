# Threat Model Analysis for cloudwu/skynet

## Threat: [Service Impersonation/Spoofing](./threats/service_impersonationspoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages Skynet's service registration mechanism to register a malicious service with the same name as a legitimate service. When other services attempt to communicate with the legitimate service, Skynet's routing directs them to the malicious one. The attacker can then intercept, modify, or drop messages or send fabricated responses.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, denial of service, and potentially triggering unintended actions by other services.
    *   **Affected Component:** Skynet's service registry and the message routing mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong service authentication mechanisms within Skynet, potentially using cryptographic signatures or unique identifiers verified by the framework.
        *   Secure the service registry component itself to prevent unauthorized registration or modification of service information.
        *   Consider using namespaces or more granular service identification within Skynet to prevent naming collisions.

## Threat: [Insecure Service Discovery Manipulation](./threats/insecure_service_discovery_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Skynet's service discovery mechanism to manipulate the registered service locations. This could involve directly modifying the service registry data, if accessible, or exploiting flaws in how Skynet manages and distributes service location information. This can redirect communication to malicious services.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service as legitimate services cannot find each other, or communication with malicious services leading to data breaches or further compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Skynet's service registry module and the functions responsible for resolving service addresses.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the service registry component with robust access controls enforced by Skynet.
        *   Implement integrity checks within Skynet to detect unauthorized modifications to the service registry data.
        *   Encrypt communication channels used by Skynet for distributing service discovery information.

## Threat: [Message Injection/Manipulation](./threats/message_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in how Skynet handles inter-service communication to inject malicious messages or modify existing messages in transit. This could involve vulnerabilities in Skynet's message serialization or routing layers.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions performed by services based on manipulated messages, potential for escalating attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Skynet's message passing infrastructure, including serialization and routing modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mandatory message signing or authentication within Skynet to verify the integrity and origin of messages.
        *   Encrypt inter-service communication at the Skynet level to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

## Threat: [Message Eavesdropping](./threats/message_eavesdropping.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between services facilitated by Skynet, gaining access to sensitive data being transmitted due to a lack of encryption within the framework's communication layer.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive business data, user credentials, or other confidential information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Skynet's core communication layer responsible for transmitting messages between services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mandatory encryption for all inter-service communication within Skynet.

## Threat: [Insecure Gate/API Exposure](./threats/insecure_gateapi_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** The "gate" service, a common pattern in Skynet applications for handling external communication, has vulnerabilities in its implementation or configuration that allow attackers to bypass intended security measures and interact with internal services in unintended ways through Skynet's message passing.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal services, data breaches, potential for remote code execution if vulnerabilities exist in the gate's handling of external input that is then passed through Skynet.
    *   **Affected Component:** The "gate" service implementation interacting with Skynet's messaging.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization within the "gate" service before it interacts with internal Skynet services.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received by the "gate" service before passing it as messages within Skynet.
        *   Minimize the exposed API surface area of the "gate" service.

## Threat: [Master Process Compromise](./threats/master_process_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control over the Skynet master process, potentially through exploiting vulnerabilities in its management interface or the underlying system on which Skynet runs. This compromises the entire Skynet instance.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the Skynet instance, ability to start/stop services, modify configurations, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** The Skynet master process and its associated management functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the underlying operating system and restrict access to the master process.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for any management interfaces of the master process provided by Skynet or the deployment environment.
        *   Minimize the attack surface of the master process and the environment it runs in.

## Threat: [Lua Sandbox Escapes](./threats/lua_sandbox_escapes.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious service implemented in Lua exploits vulnerabilities in Skynet's Lua sandbox implementation to escape the sandbox and gain access to the underlying system or other services within the Skynet instance.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potential compromise of other services and the entire Skynet instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** Skynet's Lua sandbox environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the latest stable version of Skynet with known sandbox escape vulnerabilities patched.
        *   Carefully review and audit any third-party or untrusted Lua code before deploying it within Skynet.
        *   Consider implementing additional security measures within services to limit the impact of a potential sandbox escape.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Hot-Reloading](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_hot-reloading.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages vulnerabilities in Skynet's hot-reloading mechanism to inject malicious code into a running service. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in how Skynet verifies the source or integrity of the new code.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the targeted service, potential for escalating attacks and compromising the entire Skynet instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** Skynet's hot-reloading functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the hot-reloading process within Skynet.
        *   Verify the integrity and authenticity of code being hot-reloaded, potentially using cryptographic signatures.
        *   Restrict access to the hot-reloading functionality to authorized personnel only.
