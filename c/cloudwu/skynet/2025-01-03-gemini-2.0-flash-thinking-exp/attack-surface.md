# Attack Surface Analysis for cloudwu/skynet

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Messages Exploiting Service Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_messages_exploiting_service_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** A service within the Skynet application contains a vulnerability that can be triggered by sending a specially crafted message.
    *   **How Skynet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Skynet's core message passing infrastructure is the primary vector for delivering these malicious messages. Skynet's design relies on services to handle message validation, and the framework itself doesn't enforce strict input sanitization at the message passing level.
    *   **Example:** A service processing user input receives a message with an overly long string, causing a buffer overflow due to insufficient validation within the service's message handler, a scenario facilitated by Skynet's message delivery.
    *   **Impact:** Service crash, denial of service, potential for remote code execution on the server hosting the vulnerable service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within each service's message handlers.
        *   Use memory-safe programming practices for service implementations.
        *   Regularly audit and test message handling logic.
        *   Consider implementing message schemas and enforcing them during processing.

## Attack Surface: [Message Spoofing and Replay Attacks](./attack_surfaces/message_spoofing_and_replay_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or crafts messages and sends them to services, impersonating legitimate services or replaying previously sent valid messages.
    *   **How Skynet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Skynet's default message passing mechanism lacks built-in authentication or integrity checks. This inherent design choice makes it susceptible to spoofing and replay attacks within the internal service network.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts a message from an authentication service to an authorization service granting admin privileges and replays it, exploiting the lack of message integrity verification in Skynet's core.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data manipulation, disruption of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement message signing and verification mechanisms at the service level.
        *   Use unique message identifiers and timestamps to prevent replay attacks.
        *   Consider encrypting internal communication channels.
        *   Restrict network access to the Skynet instance.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Message Flooding](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_(dos)_via_message_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods a service or the entire Skynet instance with a large number of messages, overwhelming its resources.
    *   **How Skynet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Skynet's message queueing system, while designed for asynchronous communication, can become a vulnerability if not protected against excessive message influx. The framework facilitates the easy sending of messages, making it a direct enabler of this attack.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a massive number of requests to a service handling external connections, saturating its message queue and preventing it from processing legitimate requests, leveraging Skynet's message delivery system.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, application downtime, resource exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on message processing for critical services.
        *   Implement message prioritization and queue management.
        *   Use load balancing across service instances.
        *   Monitor resource usage to detect and respond to DoS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting the Master Service](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_the_master_service.md)

*   **Description:** The master service in Skynet, which manages other services, is compromised.
    *   **How Skynet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The master service is a central and critical component of Skynet's architecture. Its role in managing and controlling other services makes it a high-value target. Skynet's design inherently places significant control within this service.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the master service's API, a component specific to Skynet's service management, allowing them to start/stop services or modify configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the Skynet application, potential for data breach, service disruption, and further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the master service's API and control interface with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Minimize the functionality and attack surface of the master service.
        *   Regularly audit and patch the master service.
        *   Consider running the master service in a more isolated and secure environment.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Service Registration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_service_registration.md)

*   **Description:** The process for registering new services with the Skynet master service is not adequately secured.
    *   **How Skynet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Skynet's dynamic service registration mechanism is a core feature. The framework's design necessitates a way for services to join the system, and if this process lacks security, it becomes a direct vulnerability introduced by Skynet's architecture.
    *   **Example:** An attacker registers a service with the same name as a legitimate service, intercepting messages intended for the real service, exploiting a weakness in Skynet's service registration process.
    *   **Impact:** Service impersonation, data interception, disruption of legitimate services, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for service registration.
        *   Use secure channels for service registration communication.
        *   Implement mechanisms to verify the identity and integrity of newly registered services.
        *   Monitor service registration activity for suspicious behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Lua Sandboxing Issues](./attack_surfaces/lua_sandboxing_issues.md)

*   **Description:** If the application relies on Lua's sandboxing capabilities to isolate services, vulnerabilities in the sandbox implementation could allow an attacker to break out.
    *   **How Skynet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Skynet uses Lua as its scripting language for services. The security of individual services often relies on the effectiveness of Lua's sandboxing, a direct consequence of Skynet's choice of scripting language and its integration.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the Lua sandbox implementation within a Skynet service to access restricted resources or execute arbitrary code outside the intended sandbox, leveraging the environment provided by Skynet.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, access to sensitive data, potential for compromising the entire Skynet instance or the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and configure Lua sandboxing settings.
        *   Keep the Lua interpreter and related libraries up-to-date.
        *   Consider using more robust isolation mechanisms if sandboxing is insufficient.
