# Attack Surface Analysis for cloudwu/skynet

## Attack Surface: [Malformed or Malicious Message Handling](./attack_surfaces/malformed_or_malicious_message_handling.md)

**Description:** A service receives a message with unexpected structure, data types, or malicious content, leading to crashes, errors, or potentially exploitable behavior.

**How Skynet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Skynet's core mechanism is message passing. If services don't rigorously validate incoming messages, they become vulnerable to crafted messages. The lack of a built-in, enforced message schema across all services increases this risk.

**Example:** A service expecting an integer receives a string, causing a type error and potentially crashing the service. Or, a message contains an overly long string that overflows a buffer in the receiving service.

**Impact:** Service disruption, denial of service, potential for remote code execution if vulnerabilities in message processing are exploited.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization within each service for all incoming messages.
* Define and enforce clear message schemas or data structures for communication between services.
* Use serialization libraries that offer strong type checking and validation.
* Implement error handling to gracefully manage unexpected message formats.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Unauthorized Message Sending (Spoofing)](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_unauthorized_message_sending__spoofing_.md)

**Description:** A service receives a message that appears to originate from a trusted source but is actually from a malicious actor.

**How Skynet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Skynet, by default, doesn't enforce strong authentication or authorization for inter-service communication. If not implemented by the application developers, services can be easily spoofed.

**Example:** A malicious service sends a message to a critical service pretending to be the authentication service, instructing it to grant access to a specific user.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data manipulation, privilege escalation, disruption of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement authentication mechanisms for inter-service communication (e.g., using shared secrets, tokens, or digital signatures).
* Implement authorization checks within services to verify the sender's permissions before processing messages.
* Utilize Skynet's `source` field in messages for basic identification, but don't rely solely on it for security.

## Attack Surface: [Gate Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/gate_input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the Skynet Gate is used to expose services to external clients, vulnerabilities in how the Gate handles and validates external input can be exploited.

**How Skynet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The Gate acts as the entry point for external communication. If the Gate doesn't properly sanitize or validate external input before forwarding it to internal services, it can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** The Gate doesn't properly escape user-provided data in HTTP headers, leading to HTTP header injection. Or, the Gate forwards excessively large requests without proper size limits, causing resource exhaustion in internal services.

**Impact:** Exposure of internal services to external attacks, potential for injection attacks, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization at the Gate level for all external data.
* Follow secure coding practices for the specific protocols used by the Gate (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket).
* Implement rate limiting and request size limits at the Gate to prevent resource exhaustion.

## Attack Surface: [SNLua Scripting Vulnerabilities (if dynamic loading is used)](./attack_surfaces/snlua_scripting_vulnerabilities__if_dynamic_loading_is_used_.md)

**Description:** If the application allows loading or executing Lua code from untrusted sources, this can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**How Skynet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Skynet uses Lua for scripting services. If the application design allows for dynamic loading of Lua scripts without proper security measures, it creates a significant attack vector.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious Lua script that, when loaded by a service, executes commands on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full control over the Skynet node, data breach.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid dynamic loading of Lua scripts from untrusted sources.
* If dynamic loading is necessary, implement strict security checks and sandboxing for the loaded code.
* Carefully review and audit all Lua scripts before deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Service Discovery and Naming Hijacking](./attack_surfaces/service_discovery_and_naming_hijacking.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the service discovery or naming mechanism to redirect communication to a malicious service.

**How Skynet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Skynet relies on a mechanism to locate and communicate with services. If this mechanism is not secured, attackers could potentially register malicious services with legitimate names or intercept service lookups.

**Example:** An attacker registers a service with the same name as a critical authentication service. When other services try to authenticate, they unknowingly communicate with the malicious service, which can steal credentials.

**Impact:** Redirection of sensitive data, impersonation of legitimate services, disruption of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement secure service registration and discovery mechanisms.
* Authenticate services during registration and lookup.
* Use unique and unpredictable service names.

## Attack Surface: [Inter-Node Communication Vulnerabilities (in clustered deployments)](./attack_surfaces/inter-node_communication_vulnerabilities__in_clustered_deployments_.md)

**Description:** Communication between Skynet nodes in a cluster is vulnerable to eavesdropping or tampering.

**How Skynet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** In a clustered environment, Skynet nodes communicate with each other. If this communication is not encrypted and authenticated, it becomes a potential attack vector.

**Example:** An attacker on the network intercepts communication between two Skynet nodes and steals sensitive data being exchanged. Or, an attacker injects malicious messages into the inter-node communication stream.

**Impact:** Data breaches, manipulation of cluster state, compromise of multiple nodes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Encrypt all inter-node communication using protocols like TLS.
* Implement authentication between Skynet nodes to verify their identities.

## Attack Surface: [Management Interface Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/management_interface_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If Skynet's management interface (if enabled) is not properly secured, it can be exploited for unauthorized access and control.

**How Skynet Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Skynet might offer a management interface for monitoring and controlling the application. If this interface has weak authentication, authorization flaws, or other vulnerabilities, it can be a direct entry point for attackers.

**Example:** Default credentials are used for the management interface, allowing an attacker to gain administrative access. Or, the management interface has a command injection vulnerability.

**Impact:** Full control over the Skynet application and potentially the underlying system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the management interface with strong authentication (e.g., strong passwords, multi-factor authentication).
* Implement robust authorization controls to restrict access to management functions.
* Regularly update the management interface component to patch vulnerabilities.
