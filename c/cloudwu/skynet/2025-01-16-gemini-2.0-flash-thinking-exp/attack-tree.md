## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Message Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_message_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

- This path focuses on exploiting the core communication mechanism of Skynet.
- It involves manipulating messages to achieve malicious goals.
- Critical Nodes within this path:
    - Message Injection [CRITICAL NODE]: The act of inserting unauthorized messages into the system.
        - Requires identifying a service address and forging a malicious message.
        - If successful, can lead to exploiting service logic.
    - Forge Malicious Message [CRITICAL NODE]: Crafting a message that will trigger a vulnerability in the receiving service.
    - Exploit Service Logic via Crafted Message [CRITICAL NODE]: Successfully leveraging a crafted message to execute code within a service.
    - Message Interception and Modification [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Intercepting and altering messages in transit.
        - Requires intercepting the communication channel.
        - Modifying message content can trigger vulnerabilities.
    - Modify Message Content to Trigger Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]: Altering a message to exploit a flaw in how the receiving service processes it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Service Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_service_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

- This path targets vulnerabilities within the individual services running on Skynet.
- Critical Nodes within this path:
    - Lua Injection (if services are written in Lua) [CRITICAL NODE]: Injecting malicious Lua code into a service that is then executed.
        - Requires identifying an input vector and injecting the malicious code.
    - Inject Malicious Lua Code [CRITICAL NODE]: The direct action of injecting harmful Lua code.
    - Dependency Vulnerabilities (in Lua modules used by services) [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Exploiting known vulnerabilities in external Lua modules used by services.
        - Requires identifying a vulnerable dependency.
        - Triggering the vulnerability through interaction with the service.
    - Trigger Vulnerability through Service Interaction [CRITICAL NODE]: Successfully exploiting a dependency vulnerability by interacting with the vulnerable service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Skynet Node/Agent [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_skynet_nodeagent__high-risk_path_.md)

- This path aims to compromise the underlying Skynet infrastructure.
- Critical Nodes within this path:
    - Trigger Vulnerability for Code Execution [CRITICAL NODE]: Exploiting a vulnerability in the Skynet core C code to achieve code execution.
    - Manipulate Skynet Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Gaining access to and modifying Skynet's configuration files to malicious ends.
        - Requires gaining access to the configuration files.
        - Modifying the configuration can load malicious services or alter system behavior.
    - Gain Access to Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE]: Successfully accessing Skynet's configuration files.
    - Modify Configuration to Load Malicious Services or Alter Behavior [CRITICAL NODE]: Changing the configuration to introduce malicious components or change system operation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Service Discovery/Registration (if applicable) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_service_discoveryregistration__if_applicable___high-risk_path_.md)

- This path targets the mechanisms used by services to find and communicate with each other.
- Critical Nodes within this path:
    - Spoof Service Registration [CRITICAL NODE]: Registering a malicious service with the identity of a legitimate one.
    - Intercept Communication intended for the legitimate service [CRITICAL NODE]: The result of successful service spoofing, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on or manipulate communication.
