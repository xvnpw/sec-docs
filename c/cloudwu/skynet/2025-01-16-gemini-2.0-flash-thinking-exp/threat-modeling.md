# Threat Model Analysis for cloudwu/skynet

## Threat: [Malicious Message Injection](./threats/malicious_message_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker, having compromised one service or potentially through external access if the network is not properly secured, crafts and sends malicious messages to other services. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in message parsing logic, providing unexpected data types, or sending commands that trigger unintended actions within the receiving service. This leverages Skynet's core message passing mechanism.

**Impact:** Service disruption, data corruption, potential for remote code execution within the targeted service's context, unauthorized actions.

**Affected Component:** Message Handling Logic within individual Lua Services (utilizing Skynet's message API), potentially the Message Dispatcher if it doesn't perform basic validation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within each service's message handling logic.
*   Define strict message formats and schemas.
*   Consider using message signing or encryption to verify the integrity and source of messages.
*   Employ principle of least privilege for inter-service communication.

## Threat: [Message Flooding/Denial of Service](./threats/message_floodingdenial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker, either from a compromised service or an external point if network access allows, overwhelms a target service with a large volume of messages. This can exhaust the service's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), making it unresponsive or crash. This directly exploits Skynet's message delivery system.

**Impact:** Service unavailability, resource exhaustion on the affected Skynet node, potential cascading failures if the affected service is critical.

**Affected Component:** Message Handling Logic within individual Lua Services (receiving Skynet messages), potentially the Message Dispatcher if it doesn't have mechanisms to handle excessive message rates.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting on message processing within services.
*   Employ mechanisms to detect and potentially block malicious message sources.
*   Monitor service resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
*   Consider network segmentation to limit external access to the Skynet internal network.

## Threat: [Compromise of a Single Service Leading to Lateral Movement](./threats/compromise_of_a_single_service_leading_to_lateral_movement.md)

**Description:** If one service within the Skynet network is compromised (e.g., through a vulnerability in its Lua code or dependencies), the attacker can use this compromised service as a foothold to send malicious messages to other services, potentially escalating their access and control within the application. This leverages Skynet's inter-service communication capabilities.

**Impact:** Compromise of multiple services, data breaches, widespread disruption.

**Affected Component:** Individual Lua Services (sending messages via Skynet), the inter-service communication mechanism provided by Skynet.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Employ strong security practices for individual service development, including regular security audits and dependency updates.
*   Implement the principle of least privilege for service interactions.
*   Consider sandboxing or containerization for individual services to limit the impact of a compromise.
*   Implement intrusion detection and monitoring systems to detect unusual inter-service communication patterns.

## Threat: [Malicious Service Registration](./threats/malicious_service_registration.md)

**Description:** If the service registration mechanism within Skynet is not properly secured, an attacker could register a malicious service with a legitimate-sounding name. This malicious service could then intercept messages intended for the real service or launch attacks from within the Skynet network.

**Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, service impersonation, disruption of legitimate services, potential for data theft.

**Affected Component:** The Service Registry (the mechanism by which services discover each other within Skynet).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement secure service registration and discovery mechanisms.
*   Require authentication and authorization for service registration.
*   Regularly monitor and audit registered services.
*   Consider using a trusted and secure service discovery component if the default mechanism is deemed insufficient.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Lua Code](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_lua_code.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities in the Lua code of individual services (e.g., injection flaws, insecure use of libraries, buffer overflows if interacting with C modules) can be exploited by malicious messages or internal attackers. This is a risk amplified by Skynet's reliance on Lua for service implementation.

**Impact:** Remote code execution within the service's context, data breaches, service compromise.

**Affected Component:** Individual Lua Services (the code executed within the Skynet framework).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure coding practices for Lua development.
*   Regularly audit Lua code for vulnerabilities.
*   Use static analysis tools for Lua code.
*   Keep Lua and any used libraries up-to-date.
*   Be cautious when using external Lua modules and ensure their trustworthiness.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Skynet Core](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_skynet_core.md)

**Description:** While less likely, vulnerabilities could exist in the core C code of the Skynet framework itself. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could have a wide-ranging impact on the entire application.

**Impact:** System-wide compromise, denial of service, arbitrary code execution on the Skynet nodes.

**Affected Component:** The Skynet Core (C code).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated with the latest Skynet releases and security patches.
*   Monitor for any reported vulnerabilities in the framework.
*   Consider contributing to the Skynet project's security efforts by reporting potential issues.
