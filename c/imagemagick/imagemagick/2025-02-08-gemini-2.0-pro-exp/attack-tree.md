## Attack Tree Path: [1. Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Known CVEs (Specific Vulnerabilities) [CN]**
    *   **General Description:** This is a critical node representing the exploitation of known, published vulnerabilities in ImageMagick or its dependencies. Attackers often search for unpatched systems to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep ImageMagick and all dependencies (especially Ghostscript) up-to-date with the latest security patches. Implement a robust patch management process.

    *   **1.1.1 CVE-2016-3714 (ImageTragick) - Delegate Command Injection [HR] [CN]**
        *   **Description:** This is a high-risk, critical vulnerability that allows attackers to inject arbitrary commands into ImageMagick's delegate processing. It leverages how ImageMagick handles certain image formats and external programs.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **1.1.1.1 Craft malicious image file:** The attacker creates a specially crafted image file (e.g., with a malicious filename or metadata) that, when processed by ImageMagick, triggers the execution of a command.  For example, a filename like `"|ls -la"` (in older, vulnerable versions) could execute the `ls -la` command.
            *   **1.1.1.2 Exploit vulnerable delegate configuration:**  ImageMagick uses "delegates" to handle certain image formats or operations (e.g., using `curl` to fetch images from URLs).  If the `policy.xml` file is misconfigured or if a vulnerable delegate is enabled, an attacker can inject commands through these delegates. For example, using the `url:` delegate with a crafted URL.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Apply the official patches for CVE-2016-3714.
            *   Configure `policy.xml` to disable vulnerable delegates (e.g., `https`, `url`, `mvg`, `msl`) unless absolutely necessary.
            *   Sanitize all user-provided input (filenames, metadata) before passing it to ImageMagick.
            *   Re-encode images to a safe format before processing.

    *   **1.1.3 Other CVEs [CN]**
        *   **Description:** This represents any other known CVE affecting ImageMagick. The specifics vary depending on the vulnerability.
        *   **Mitigation:** Regularly check CVE databases and security advisories for ImageMagick and apply patches promptly.

    *   **1.1.4 Ghostscript Delegate Vulnerabilities [HR] [CN]**
        *   **Description:** If ImageMagick uses Ghostscript (often for processing EPS, PS, and PDF files), vulnerabilities in Ghostscript can be exploited through ImageMagick. This is a high-risk path because Ghostscript has a history of security issues.
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **1.1.4.1 Exploit Ghostscript vulnerabilities:** The attacker crafts a malicious EPS, PS, or PDF file that exploits a known Ghostscript vulnerability. When ImageMagick processes this file and passes it to Ghostscript, the vulnerability is triggered.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Keep Ghostscript up-to-date with the latest security patches.
            *   Disable the `PS`, `EPS`, and `PDF` coders in `policy.xml` if they are not absolutely necessary.
            *   Consider using alternative libraries for handling these formats if possible.

*   **1.3 Exploit Misconfigurations [HR] [CN]**
    *   **Description:** This represents attacks that leverage misconfigurations in ImageMagick's settings, particularly the `policy.xml` file. This is a high-risk area because misconfigurations are common.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **1.3.1 Overly permissive `policy.xml` file [HR] [CN]:**  If the `policy.xml` file is too lenient, it allows attackers to use features or delegates that should be restricted. For example, allowing all delegates or not restricting access to sensitive file paths.
        *   **1.3.2 Unnecessary delegates enabled [HR] [CN]:**  If delegates that are not required for the application's functionality are enabled, attackers can potentially exploit them.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Configure `policy.xml` to be as restrictive as possible.  Disable all delegates and coders that are not absolutely necessary.
        *   **Regular Audits:**  Periodically review and update the `policy.xml` file to ensure it remains effective and reflects the application's needs.
        *   **Specific Restrictions:** Use specific `policy` directives to restrict access to resources, delegates, and coders.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Exfiltration / Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_exfiltration__information_disclosure.md)

*   **2.1 Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerabilities**
    *   **2.1.1 CVE-2016-3714 (ImageTragick) - Read Arbitrary Files [HR] [CN]**
        *   **Description:**  This is a high-risk aspect of ImageTragick that allows attackers to read arbitrary files on the server.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **2.1.1.1 Craft an image file (e.g., MVG, MSL):**  The attacker crafts an image file (often using the MVG or MSL formats) that contains instructions for ImageMagick to read a specific file on the server.  The contents of the file might then be included in the processed image or otherwise leaked.
            *   **2.1.1.2 Use `label:@/etc/passwd`:**  The attacker uses ImageMagick's features, such as the `label:` directive, to read files.  For example, setting the image label to `@/etc/passwd` might cause ImageMagick to read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file and include it in the image's metadata.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Apply the official patches for CVE-2016-3714.
            *   Configure `policy.xml` to restrict access to sensitive file paths (e.g., `<policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="/etc/*" />`).
            *   Sanitize all user-provided input.
            *   Re-encode images.
