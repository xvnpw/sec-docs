## Attack Tree Path: [1. Execute Arbitrary Code on Server (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1._execute_arbitrary_code_on_server_(critical_node).md)

*   **Goal:** To execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the web application. This represents a complete compromise of the server.
*   **Attack Vector: Exploit Delegate Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** High
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   **Identify Vulnerable Delegate (e.g., Ghostscript):** The attacker identifies a delegate used by ImageMagick that has known vulnerabilities. This often involves researching known CVEs or analyzing the application's ImageMagick configuration.
        *   **Embed Malicious Payload in Image (e.g., EPS, SVG):** The attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., EPS or SVG) that contains an embedded payload designed to exploit the identified delegate vulnerability. This payload could be shell commands or code designed to execute arbitrary commands.
        *   **Trigger Processing of Malicious Image:** The attacker uploads or submits the malicious image to the web application, triggering ImageMagick to process it and, consequently, invoke the vulnerable delegate with the malicious payload.
*   **Attack Vector: Abuse `system()` or Similar Calls (if application uses this with ImageMagick) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (dependent on application code)
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High (if input is not carefully logged)
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   **Identify Application's Use of `system()` with ImageMagick:** The attacker analyzes the application's code or behavior to determine if it uses functions like `system()`, `exec()`, or similar to execute ImageMagick commands with user-controlled input.
        *   **Inject Shell Commands into Image Processing Arguments:** The attacker manipulates user-provided input (e.g., filenames, image processing options) to inject malicious shell commands into the arguments passed to the `system()` call.
        *   **Trigger Processing with Injected Commands:** The attacker triggers the image processing functionality, causing the application to execute the injected malicious commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Gain Unauthorized File System Access (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2._gain_unauthorized_file_system_access_(critical_node).md)

*   **Goal:** To access files and directories on the server that the attacker should not have access to. This can lead to information disclosure, data breaches, or further compromise.
*   **Attack Vector: Path Traversal via Filenames (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   **Inject "../" sequences in filenames:** The attacker provides filenames containing sequences like `"../"` to navigate up the directory structure and access files outside the intended directory.
        *   **Utilize absolute paths in filenames (if allowed):** If the application doesn't properly sanitize filenames, the attacker might be able to use absolute file paths to directly target specific files on the server.
        *   **Trigger Image Processing with Malicious Filenames:** The attacker triggers an ImageMagick operation that uses the manipulated filename, potentially leading to reading or writing files in unintended locations.
*   **Attack Vector: Read Local Files via Delegates (e.g., SVG `file://` protocol) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   **Use a vulnerable delegate (e.g., SVG renderer):** The attacker targets a delegate known to be vulnerable to local file inclusion, such as older versions of SVG renderers.
        *   **Embed `file://` URI pointing to sensitive files:** The attacker crafts a malicious image (e.g., an SVG file) that includes a `file://` URI pointing to sensitive files on the server's file system.
        *   **Trigger Processing of Malicious Image:** When ImageMagick processes the malicious image, the vulnerable delegate is triggered, and it attempts to access and potentially include the content of the specified local file.
