## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the primary entry point for many attacks targeting ImageMagick. If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize input, it becomes vulnerable to various injection attacks.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Maliciously crafted image files designed to exploit parsing vulnerabilities or trigger delegate execution.
        *   Filenames or paths containing path traversal sequences.
        *   URLs pointing to malicious resources or internal servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Image File [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_image_file__critical_node_.md)

*   Attackers embed malicious code within image files, leveraging ImageMagick's processing capabilities to execute it.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Crafting images with malicious MSL (Magick Scripting Language) code that ImageMagick interprets and executes.
        *   Embedding malicious SVG code (e.g., using `<script>` tags) that gets executed during rendering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Delegate Vulnerabilities (e.g., Shell Injection) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_delegate_vulnerabilities__e_g___shell_injection___critical_node_.md)

*   ImageMagick uses "delegates" to handle certain file formats. If these delegates are not configured securely, attackers can inject arbitrary commands that get executed by the system shell.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Crafting image files (e.g., using formats like `msl:`, `ephemeral:`, `url:`) that trigger vulnerable delegates and allow command injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Image with Malicious MSL (Magick Scripting Language)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_image_with_malicious_msl__magick_scripting_language_.md)

*   MSL allows embedding scripts within images. If enabled and not sanitized, attackers can craft images containing malicious scripts that execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Embedding commands within the MSL image format that, when processed by ImageMagick, are executed by the underlying operating system.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Execute Arbitrary Commands on Server:** Successful exploitation leads to the ability to run any command on the server with the privileges of the ImageMagick process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Image with Malicious SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_image_with_malicious_svg__scalable_vector_graphics_.md)

*   SVG files can contain embedded scripts. If ImageMagick processes SVGs without proper sanitization, malicious scripts can be executed.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Embedding `<script>` tags or other executable content within SVG files that are processed by ImageMagick.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Execute Arbitrary Commands via `<script>` or similar tags:** Successful exploitation allows executing arbitrary JavaScript or similar code within the context of the server-side processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Inclusion Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_inclusion_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   Attackers can trick ImageMagick into loading local or remote files, potentially exposing sensitive information or triggering further attacks.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Crafting image filenames or using features like `label:` or `ephemeral:` with URLs pointing to local files containing sensitive data.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Read Local Files on Server:** Successful exploitation allows reading arbitrary files on the server, potentially including configuration files, secrets, and other sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Image with Malicious `label:` or `ephemeral:` URLs](./attack_tree_paths/craft_image_with_malicious__label__or__ephemeral__urls.md)

*   The `label:` and `ephemeral:` coders in ImageMagick can be abused to read local files if a malicious path is provided.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Providing a path to a sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, application configuration files) within the `label:` or `ephemeral:` URL.

## Attack Tree Path: [Read Arbitrary Files on Server (via Path Traversal) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/read_arbitrary_files_on_server__via_path_traversal___critical_node_.md)

*   By manipulating filenames or paths provided to ImageMagick, attackers can bypass directory restrictions and access files outside the intended scope.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Using ".." sequences in filenames to navigate up the directory structure and access sensitive files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities in ImageMagick Setup [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_in_imagemagick_setup__critical_node_.md)

*   Insecure default configurations or misconfigurations in ImageMagick can create significant vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Leveraging default delegates that are known to be vulnerable to shell injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Default Delegates [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_default_delegates__critical_node_.md)

*   Many default delegates in ImageMagick have known security risks, particularly related to shell command execution.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Triggering the execution of insecure default delegates by processing specific file types or using specific ImageMagick features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize Default Delegates with Known Shell Injection Risks](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_default_delegates_with_known_shell_injection_risks.md)

*   Specifically targeting delegates like `ephemeral`, `url`, or `msl` when they are enabled and not properly secured.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Crafting input that forces ImageMagick to use these vulnerable delegates with attacker-controlled data.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Execute Arbitrary Commands:** Successful exploitation allows executing arbitrary commands on the server.
