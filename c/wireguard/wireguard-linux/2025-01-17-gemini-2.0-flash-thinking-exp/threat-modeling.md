# Threat Model Analysis for wireguard/wireguard-linux

## Threat: [Private Key Compromise](./threats/private_key_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the private key of a WireGuard interface. This could happen through exploiting vulnerabilities in key storage *managed by the application interacting with WireGuard*, or if the `wg` tool itself has vulnerabilities leading to key disclosure. With the private key, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate peer, decrypt traffic intended for that peer, and potentially inject malicious traffic into the tunnel.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the VPN connection, allowing for eavesdropping, data manipulation, and impersonation.

**Affected Component:** Key generation functions within the `wg` tool, or vulnerabilities in how the application interacts with the kernel module regarding key management.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Generate private keys using cryptographically secure random number generators (ensure the application or `wg` tool uses secure methods).
* Store private keys with strict file permissions (the application must enforce this when managing keys).
* Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure key management systems for storing private keys in sensitive environments (this impacts how the application interacts with WireGuard).
* Regularly rotate keys.

## Threat: [Kernel Module Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/kernel_module_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Description:** A security vulnerability exists within the `wireguard-linux` kernel module. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain kernel-level privileges on the system running the WireGuard interface. This could be achieved through crafted network packets processed by the module or by exploiting local access to trigger vulnerable code paths within the module.

**Impact:** Complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to control the entire system, including the application using WireGuard.

**Affected Component:** The `wireguard-linux` kernel module itself.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the kernel and the `wireguard-linux` package updated with the latest security patches.
* Implement kernel hardening techniques to reduce the attack surface.
* Monitor security advisories specifically related to the `wireguard-linux` kernel module.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Packets](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_malicious_packets.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a large volume of maliciously crafted packets specifically designed to exploit weaknesses in the `wireguard-linux` kernel module's packet processing logic, overwhelming the system's resources and causing the interface to become unresponsive or crash.

**Impact:** Disruption of the VPN connection, preventing legitimate communication and potentially impacting the application's functionality.

**Affected Component:** The WireGuard kernel module's packet processing functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting or traffic shaping at the network level (this can help mitigate the impact on the WireGuard interface).
* Consider using intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to identify and block malicious traffic patterns targeting WireGuard.
* Ensure sufficient system resources are available to handle expected traffic loads.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via `wg` Command](./threats/privilege_escalation_via__wg__command.md)

**Description:** If the application executes the `wg` command-line tool with elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo` without proper safeguards), vulnerabilities in the `wg` tool itself could be exploited by an attacker to gain root access. This could happen if input to the `wg` command is not properly sanitized *within the `wg` tool itself*.

**Impact:** Complete system compromise.

**Affected Component:** The `wg` command-line tool.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Minimize the use of elevated privileges when interacting with the `wg` command.
* If `sudo` is necessary, use it with specific command restrictions and carefully validate any input passed to the `wg` command (ensure the application does not pass unsanitized input).
* Consider alternative methods for managing the WireGuard interface programmatically that do not require direct execution of the `wg` command with elevated privileges.
