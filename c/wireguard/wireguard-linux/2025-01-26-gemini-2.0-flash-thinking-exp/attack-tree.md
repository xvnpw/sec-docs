## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known WireGuard Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_wireguard_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Vulnerable WireGuard Version in Use [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application is running an outdated version of WireGuard-linux that contains publicly known security vulnerabilities (CVEs).
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   Attackers research publicly available CVE databases and security advisories related to WireGuard-linux.
        *   They identify if the target application is using a vulnerable version.
        *   If vulnerable, they search for and utilize existing exploits (publicly available or custom-developed) targeting the identified vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, successful exploitation could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or other forms of compromise on the system running WireGuard.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit WireGuard Configuration/Deployment Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_wireguard_configurationdeployment_issues__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Weak Key Management [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Compromise Private Key Storage [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to the private keys used by WireGuard peers due to insecure storage practices.
        *   **Breakdown:**
            *   **Insecure Storage Location [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Private keys are stored in world-readable files, publicly accessible directories, exposed backups, or other insecure locations. Attackers can directly access these files.
            *   **Key Logging/Interception:**  While less directly related to WireGuard-linux itself, malware on the system or insider threats could lead to the logging or interception of private keys during generation or usage.
        *   **Impact:** Compromising the private key allows an attacker to impersonate a legitimate WireGuard peer. They can establish a connection to the WireGuard network, potentially decrypt traffic, and inject malicious traffic into the tunnel, bypassing WireGuard's intended security.

*   **Misconfiguration of WireGuard Interface [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Insecure AllowedIPs/Endpoint Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Incorrectly configured `AllowedIPs` or endpoint settings in the WireGuard configuration file lead to unintended network access or routing.
        *   **Breakdown:**
            *   **Overly Permissive AllowedIPs [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** The `AllowedIPs` setting is too broad, granting access to a wider network range than intended. Attackers from outside the intended scope can connect and access resources behind the WireGuard tunnel.
        *   **Impact:**  Overly permissive `AllowedIPs` can bypass intended network segmentation and access controls, allowing attackers to reach internal resources they should not be able to access.

    *   **Firewall Misconfiguration related to WireGuard [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Firewall rules are not properly configured to restrict traffic to and from the WireGuard interface, negating the intended security of the VPN.
        *   **Breakdown:**
            *   **Firewall rules not properly restricting traffic to/from WireGuard interface [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Firewall rules are either missing, too permissive, or incorrectly configured, allowing unauthorized traffic to bypass the WireGuard tunnel or access services intended to be protected by WireGuard.
        *   **Impact:** Firewall misconfigurations can completely undermine the network security provided by WireGuard, allowing attackers to bypass intended access controls and potentially directly access internal services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Interaction with WireGuard [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_interaction_with_wireguard__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Configuration Injection/Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application allows external influence on the WireGuard configuration, enabling attackers to inject malicious settings.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   **Application allows external influence on WireGuard configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** The application's design or implementation allows external sources (e.g., user input, API calls, configuration files) to modify the WireGuard configuration.
        *   **Inject Malicious Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit this influence to inject malicious configuration parameters into WireGuard, such as adding their own `AllowedIPs` or modifying routing rules.
        *   **WireGuard applies malicious configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** WireGuard, as designed, applies the provided configuration, including the malicious settings injected by the attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Successful configuration injection can grant attackers unauthorized access to the WireGuard network, allowing them to bypass intended access controls and potentially pivot to internal resources.

*   **Data Injection/Manipulation via Tunnel [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application does not properly validate data received over the WireGuard tunnel, allowing attackers to inject malicious data and exploit application-level vulnerabilities.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   **Application doesn't properly validate data received over WireGuard tunnel [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** The application assumes that data received over the WireGuard tunnel is inherently safe and does not perform sufficient input validation.
        *   **Inject Malicious Data into Tunnel [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers craft and send malicious data payloads through the WireGuard tunnel, targeting vulnerabilities in the application's data processing logic.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful data injection can lead to application-level vulnerabilities being exploited, such as command injection, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (if the application processes web requests), or other application-specific attacks.

*   **Resource Exhaustion/DoS via WireGuard [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers flood the WireGuard tunnel with excessive traffic to exhaust resources on the WireGuard server or client, leading to a Denial of Service.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   **Send excessive traffic through WireGuard tunnel [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers generate and send a large volume of network traffic through the WireGuard tunnel towards the target system.
        *   **Overload WireGuard server/client resources [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** The excessive traffic overloads the CPU, memory, bandwidth, or other resources of the WireGuard server or client, causing it to become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **Impact:** A successful DoS attack disrupts the availability of the application and services relying on the WireGuard tunnel, causing service outages and impacting legitimate users.

*   **Information Leakage via WireGuard Logs/Debug Information [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sensitive information is inadvertently leaked in WireGuard logs or debug output, and access to these logs is not properly restricted.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   **WireGuard logs or debug output contain sensitive information [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** WireGuard logs or debug messages inadvertently include sensitive data such as IP addresses, internal network details, configuration parameters, or potentially even keys in misconfigured logging scenarios.
        *   **Access to logs/debug output is not properly restricted [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Access control to log files or debug output is insufficient, allowing unauthorized individuals (including attackers) to access them.
        *   **Extract sensitive information [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers gain access to the logs and extract the leaked sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Information leakage can aid attackers in reconnaissance, providing valuable details about the network infrastructure, internal systems, and potential attack targets. In extreme cases of key leakage in logs, it could lead to direct compromise of WireGuard security.
