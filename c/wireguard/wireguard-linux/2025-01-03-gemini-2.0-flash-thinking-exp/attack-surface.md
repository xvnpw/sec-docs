# Attack Surface Analysis for wireguard/wireguard-linux

## Attack Surface: [Key Attack Surface 1: Kernel Module Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/key_attack_surface_1_kernel_module_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of security flaws within the `wireguard-linux` kernel module itself.

**How WireGuard-Linux Contributes:** The presence of a custom kernel module introduces a potential attack surface at the kernel level. Any vulnerabilities in its code can directly compromise the system's core.

**Example:** A remote attacker sends a specially crafted network packet that triggers a buffer overflow within the `wireguard-linux` module, leading to arbitrary code execution in the kernel.

**Impact:**  Full system compromise, privilege escalation to root, kernel panic (system crash), data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep the kernel and `wireguard-linux` module updated to the latest stable versions with security patches.
*   Implement kernel hardening techniques.
*   Utilize kernel security modules (e.g., SELinux, AppArmor) to restrict the module's capabilities.
*   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the WireGuard integration.

## Attack Surface: [Key Attack Surface 2: Insecure Configuration Management](./attack_surfaces/key_attack_surface_2_insecure_configuration_management.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from improper handling, storage, or access control of WireGuard configuration files (e.g., `/etc/wireguard/*.conf`).

**How WireGuard-Linux Contributes:** WireGuard relies on configuration files containing sensitive information like private keys and peer details. Weaknesses in managing these files directly expose the VPN's security.

**Example:** The WireGuard configuration file is readable by non-root users, allowing an attacker to obtain the private key and impersonate the VPN endpoint or decrypt traffic.

**Impact:** VPN compromise, unauthorized access to the VPN network, interception of encrypted traffic, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Restrict access to WireGuard configuration files to the root user only (using appropriate file permissions like `chmod 600`).
*   Implement secure key generation and storage practices. Avoid storing private keys in easily accessible locations.
*   Consider using configuration management tools to enforce consistent and secure configurations.
*   Regularly review and audit WireGuard configurations for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Key Attack Surface 3: Vulnerabilities in the `wg` Utility Interface](./attack_surfaces/key_attack_surface_3_vulnerabilities_in_the__wg__utility_interface.md)

**Description:** Exploiting flaws in the `wg` command-line utility, which is used to manage and control WireGuard interfaces.

**How WireGuard-Linux Contributes:** The `wg` utility provides the primary interface for interacting with the `wireguard-linux` module. Vulnerabilities here can allow unauthorized control or information disclosure directly affecting the module's state.

**Example:** An application directly executes `wg setconf wg0 <untrusted_input>`, and the untrusted input contains shell metacharacters, leading to command injection and arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the user running the application, potentially manipulating the WireGuard tunnel.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification of WireGuard configuration, denial of service by disabling the interface, potential for privilege escalation if the application runs with elevated privileges, leading to control over the WireGuard tunnel.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid direct execution of `wg` commands with untrusted input. Sanitize and validate all input before using it in `wg` commands.
*   Use the `wireguard-go` library or other secure interfaces for managing WireGuard programmatically instead of relying on direct `wg` execution.
*   Minimize the privileges of the user or process executing `wg` commands.
*   Keep the `wireguard-tools` package (which includes `wg`) updated.
