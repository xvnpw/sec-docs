* *****HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit WireGuard Kernel Module Vulnerabilities ***CRITICAL NODE***:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Attackers target vulnerabilities within the WireGuard kernel module, which operates with the highest privileges.
        * Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the kernel, granting the attacker complete control over the system and the application.

* *****HIGH-RISK PATH*** Memory Corruption Exploits (e.g., Buffer Overflow, Use-After-Free) ***CRITICAL NODE***:**
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * Attackers craft malicious network packets specifically designed to trigger memory corruption bugs like buffer overflows (writing beyond allocated memory) or use-after-free vulnerabilities (accessing memory that has been freed).
            * **Trigger Vulnerability via Maliciously Crafted Network Packets:**
                * **Send crafted IPv4 packets:** Sending specially crafted IPv4 packets with specific header combinations or oversized payloads to trigger memory corruption.
                * **Send crafted IPv6 packets:** Sending specially crafted IPv6 packets with specific header combinations or oversized payloads to trigger memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Privilege Escalation Exploits ***CRITICAL NODE***](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_privilege_escalation_exploits_critical_node.md)

* *****HIGH-RISK PATH*** Privilege Escalation Exploits ***CRITICAL NODE***:**
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * Attackers exploit logical flaws or race conditions within the kernel module to elevate their privileges to root. This does not necessarily require direct memory corruption.
            * **Leverage Kernel Vulnerability to Gain Root Access:**
                * **Exploit race conditions in kernel module:** Manipulating the timing of kernel operations to exploit race conditions and gain elevated privileges.
                * **Exploit logic errors in kernel module:** Identifying and exploiting flaws in the kernel module's code logic to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Abuse WireGuard Configuration ***CRITICAL NODE***](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_abuse_wireguard_configuration_critical_node.md)

* *****HIGH-RISK PATH*** Abuse WireGuard Configuration ***CRITICAL NODE***:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Attackers exploit weaknesses or errors in the configuration of WireGuard to gain unauthorized access. This often involves leveraging misconfigurations or compromised credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Weak or Compromised Private Keys ***CRITICAL NODE***](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_weak_or_compromised_private_keys_critical_node.md)

* *****HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Weak or Compromised Private Keys ***CRITICAL NODE***:**
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * WireGuard's security heavily relies on the secrecy of private keys. If these keys are weak or compromised, attackers can impersonate legitimate peers and decrypt communication.
            * **Brute-force Weak Private Keys (Unlikely but theoretically possible):** Attempting to guess the private key through exhaustive search, although highly improbable with strong key generation.
            * **Obtain Stolen Private Keys:**
                * *****HIGH-RISK PATH*** Compromise the system where private keys are stored ***CRITICAL NODE***:** Gaining unauthorized access to the system where the WireGuard private key is stored (e.g., through other vulnerabilities or weak access controls) and directly stealing the key.
            * **Exploit Insecure Key Generation Practices:**
                * **Predictable key generation algorithms:** If weak or predictable methods are used to generate private keys, attackers might be able to predict or recreate them.
