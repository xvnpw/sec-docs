# Threat Model Analysis for wireguard/wireguard-linux

## Threat: [Private Key Compromise via File System Access](./threats/private_key_compromise_via_file_system_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized read access to the WireGuard private key file (e.g., `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` if not properly secured). This could be through exploiting other system vulnerabilities that allow local file access.

**Impact:** With the private key, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate peer, decrypt intercepted traffic, and potentially establish unauthorized VPN connections.

**Affected Component:** Configuration file handling, specifically the storage and access of the `PrivateKey` parameter.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict file system permissions (e.g., `chmod 600`) on the WireGuard configuration files containing the private key.
* Ensure only the root user has read access to these files.
* Consider storing private keys in dedicated secure storage mechanisms if available.

## Threat: [Insecure Key Storage in Memory (Potential Side-Channel)](./threats/insecure_key_storage_in_memory__potential_side-channel_.md)

**Description:** While `wireguard-linux` aims for secure memory handling, vulnerabilities or implementation flaws might allow an attacker with sufficient privileges to potentially extract key material from kernel memory through side-channel attacks (e.g., timing attacks, rowhammer).

**Impact:** Compromise of the private key, allowing decryption of traffic and impersonation. This is a complex attack but theoretically possible.

**Affected Component:** Kernel module memory management related to key storage.

**Risk Severity:** Medium (While complex, the impact of key compromise elevates it for this filtered list)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the kernel and `wireguard-linux` module updated to benefit from security patches.
* Implement system-level security measures to prevent unauthorized memory access.
* Utilize hardware with mitigations against side-channel attacks if highly sensitive data is involved.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Packet Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service_via_packet_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a large volume of specially crafted or random packets to the WireGuard interface, overwhelming the system's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) specifically handled by the `wireguard-linux` module.

**Impact:** The VPN connection becomes unresponsive, impacting the application's ability to communicate securely. The entire system could become unstable in severe cases.

**Affected Component:** Network interface handling within the `wireguard` kernel module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting or traffic shaping on the network interface facing the potential attacker.
* Use firewalls to filter out suspicious traffic patterns.
* Ensure sufficient system resources to handle expected traffic loads and potential spikes.

## Threat: [Protocol Implementation Bugs Leading to Information Disclosure](./threats/protocol_implementation_bugs_leading_to_information_disclosure.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability exists within the `wireguard-linux` kernel module's implementation of the WireGuard protocol, potentially allowing an attacker to craft specific packets that cause the module to leak sensitive information (e.g., memory contents, internal state).

**Impact:** Information leakage could aid attackers in further compromising the system or the VPN connection.

**Affected Component:** Various parts of the `wireguard` kernel module responsible for protocol handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `wireguard-linux` module updated to benefit from security patches.
* Participate in or monitor security audits and vulnerability disclosures related to WireGuard.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Malicious Configuration or Bugs](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_malicious_configuration_or_bugs.md)

**Description:** A misconfiguration or a bug within `wireguard-linux` could lead to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) on the system specifically by the `wireguard` kernel module or related processes. An attacker might exploit this by sending specific traffic or manipulating the configuration.

**Impact:** System performance degradation, instability, or even complete system failure.

**Affected Component:** Resource management within the `wireguard` kernel module and configuration parsing.

**Risk Severity:** Medium (Elevated to High due to potential for significant impact)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review and test WireGuard configurations before deployment.
* Monitor system resource usage for anomalies related to WireGuard processes.
* Implement resource limits if applicable.
