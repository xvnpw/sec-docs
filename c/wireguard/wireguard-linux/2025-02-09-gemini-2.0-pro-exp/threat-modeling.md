# Threat Model Analysis for wireguard/wireguard-linux

## Threat: [Cryptographic Weakness Exploitation](./threats/cryptographic_weakness_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Cryptographic Weakness Exploitation

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a theoretical or newly discovered vulnerability in one of WireGuard's core cryptographic primitives (Curve25519, ChaCha20, Poly1305, BLAKE2s, SipHash24, or the Noise Protocol Framework itself). The attacker could craft specific packets to break encryption or authentication. This is a *direct* threat to the `wireguard-linux` implementation of these algorithms.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of confidentiality and/or integrity of the VPN tunnel.  All data transmitted over the affected connection could be read or modified by the attacker.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core cryptographic functions within the `wireguard-linux` kernel module, specifically those implementing the Noise Protocol Framework and the chosen ciphers. This could involve functions related to key exchange, encryption, decryption, and authentication tag generation/verification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developer)** Continuously monitor for security advisories related to the cryptographic primitives used.  Rapidly patch and release updates if vulnerabilities are found.  Participate in cryptographic research and peer review.
        *   **(User)** Keep the `wireguard-linux` module and associated user-space tools (especially `wg` and `wg-quick`) up-to-date.  Subscribe to security mailing lists for WireGuard and the Linux kernel.

## Threat: [Denial-of-Service (DoS) - Packet Flood](./threats/denial-of-service__dos__-_packet_flood.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial-of-Service (DoS) - Packet Flood

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large volume of invalid or malformed packets *directly* to the WireGuard interface, attempting to overwhelm the system's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and specifically targeting the `wireguard-linux` module's processing capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Disruption of VPN connectivity.  The WireGuard interface may become unresponsive, preventing legitimate traffic from passing through.
    *   **Affected Component:** The packet processing and filtering logic within the `wireguard-linux` kernel module.  This includes functions responsible for validating packet headers, decrypting packets, and handling cryptographic operations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developer)** Optimize the kernel module for performance and resilience to high packet loads.  Implement robust error handling and resource management.
        *   **(User)** Use a firewall (e.g., `iptables` or `nftables`) *in front of* the WireGuard interface to rate-limit incoming traffic.  Configure appropriate resource limits (e.g., `ulimit`) for the WireGuard process.  Monitor system resource usage. *Note: While firewalls are external, they are crucial for mitigating this WireGuard-specific DoS.*

## Threat: [Denial-of-Service (DoS) - Kernel Module Vulnerability](./threats/denial-of-service__dos__-_kernel_module_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial-of-Service (DoS) - Kernel Module Vulnerability

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *directly within* the `wireguard-linux` kernel module itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, memory leak, or logic error) to cause a kernel panic or crash the module.
    *   **Impact:** Complete loss of VPN connectivity.  Potentially a system-wide crash, requiring a reboot.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any part of the `wireguard-linux` kernel module could be affected, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developer)** Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits.  Use static analysis tools and fuzzing to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Follow secure coding practices.
        *   **(User)** Keep the `wireguard-linux` module up-to-date.  Monitor system logs for any unusual errors or warnings.  Consider using a kernel hardening framework (e.g., grsecurity).
