## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise the WireGuard Interface [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_the_wireguard_interface__critical_.md)

This is the root node and represents the overall objective of compromising the WireGuard VPN setup. It's critical because success here grants the attacker significant control.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Kernel Module Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_kernel_module_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

*Description:*  This involves finding and exploiting vulnerabilities within the WireGuard kernel module itself.  While WireGuard's small codebase and security focus make this less likely than in other VPN software, the impact of a kernel-level exploit is extremely high.
*Likelihood:* Low (but the overall risk is considered High due to the impact)
*Impact:* Very High (Kernel-level code execution, complete system compromise)
*Effort:* High to Very High
*Skill Level:* Advanced to Expert
*Detection Difficulty:* Hard to Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1 Inject Malicious Configuration via File [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1_inject_malicious_configuration_via_file__high-risk_.md)

*Description:*  An attacker who gains write access to the WireGuard configuration file can inject malicious settings. This could redirect traffic, disable security features, or even execute arbitrary commands (if combined with other vulnerabilities).
*Likelihood:* Low (Requires prior compromise to gain write access)
*Impact:* High (Can control VPN behavior, potentially execute commands)
*Effort:* Low (Once write access is obtained)
*Skill Level:* Intermediate
*Detection Difficulty:* Medium (File integrity monitoring could detect changes)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1 Inject Commands via Unsanitized Input [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1_inject_commands_via_unsanitized_input__high-risk_.md)

*Description:* If `wg` or `wg-quick` fail to properly sanitize user-provided input (like interface names, addresses, or other configuration parameters), an attacker could inject arbitrary shell commands.
*Likelihood:* Low (Good coding practices should prevent this, but it's a common vulnerability)
*Impact:* High (Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the tool)
*Effort:* Low
*Skill Level:* Intermediate
*Detection Difficulty:* Medium (Input validation should prevent this, but mistakes happen)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Compromise Keys [CRITICAL] [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_compromise_keys__critical___high-risk_.md)

This branch represents the most direct and damaging attack vector: gaining control of the cryptographic keys used by WireGuard.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Steal Private Key [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_steal_private_key__high-risk_.md)

This involves obtaining the WireGuard private key, which allows the attacker to decrypt all traffic and impersonate the legitimate user.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1.1 Read Key from Unprotected Filesystem [CRITICAL] [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_1_read_key_from_unprotected_filesystem__critical___high-risk_.md)

*Description:*  If the private key file is stored with weak permissions (e.g., world-readable), any user on the system (or an attacker who has gained unprivileged access) can read it.
*Likelihood:* Medium (Unfortunately, a common mistake)
*Impact:* Very High (Complete compromise of the VPN connection)
*Effort:* Very Low
*Skill Level:* Novice
*Detection Difficulty:* Medium (File access monitoring could detect this)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1.3 Social Engineering/Phishing to Obtain Key [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_3_social_engineeringphishing_to_obtain_key__high-risk_.md)

*Description:*  Tricking the user into revealing their private key through social engineering techniques, such as phishing emails or fake websites.
*Likelihood:* Medium (Depends on user awareness and security practices)
*Impact:* Very High (Complete compromise of the VPN connection)
*Effort:* Low to Medium
*Skill Level:* Intermediate
*Detection Difficulty:* Hard (Relies on user reporting and awareness)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2.2 Replace Legitimate Public Key with Attacker's Key [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_2_replace_legitimate_public_key_with_attacker's_key__high-risk_.md)

*Description:* If an attacker can modify the WireGuard configuration to replace a legitimate peer's public key with their own, they can perform a man-in-the-middle attack.  This requires write access to the configuration file.
*Likelihood:* Low (Requires prior compromise to gain write access)
*Impact:* High (Can decrypt and modify traffic between the victim and the legitimate peer)
*Effort:* Low (Once write access is obtained)
*Skill Level:* Intermediate
*Detection Difficulty:* Medium (File integrity monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.1.1 Spoof Source IP Address [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_1_1_spoof_source_ip_address__high-risk_.md)

*Description:* If the `AllowedIPs` setting is misconfigured (e.g., set to `0.0.0.0/0` for a client, allowing all traffic) or not used at all, and if the network allows IP spoofing, an attacker could send traffic through the VPN tunnel that they shouldn't be able to.
*Likelihood:* Medium (Depends on network configuration and the ability to spoof IP addresses)
*Impact:* Medium (Can access unintended networks or resources)
*Effort:* Low
*Skill Level:* Intermediate
*Detection Difficulty:* Medium (Firewall rules and network monitoring can help detect this)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.2.1 Steal preshared key [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_2_1_steal_preshared_key__high-risk_.md)

*Description:* Similar to private key theft, if a preshared key is used and stored insecurely, an attacker can gain access to it.
*Likelihood:* Medium
*Impact:* High
*Effort:* Low
*Skill Level:* Novice
*Detection Difficulty:* Medium
