Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path.

## Deep Analysis of WireGuard Attack Tree Path: 1.3.2.2 Replace Legitimate Public Key with Attacker's Key

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the attack vector described in path 1.3.2.2, "Replace Legitimate Public Key with Attacker's Key," within the context of a WireGuard-based application.  This includes identifying the specific vulnerabilities that enable this attack, the potential consequences, and effective mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the application's security posture against this specific threat.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses solely on the attack path 1.3.2.2.  We will consider:

*   **Target System:**  Applications utilizing the `wireguard-linux` module (https://github.com/wireguard/wireguard-linux).  This includes both client and server configurations.  We assume a standard Linux environment, but will note any OS-specific considerations.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker is assumed to have already gained some level of privileged access to the system, specifically write access to the WireGuard configuration file(s).  We *will not* analyze *how* the attacker gained this initial access (e.g., phishing, exploiting other vulnerabilities).  Our focus is on what they can do *after* achieving write access to the configuration.
*   **Configuration Files:** We will consider the standard WireGuard configuration file locations (e.g., `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`) and any application-specific configuration storage mechanisms.
*   **WireGuard Versions:** We will primarily focus on the current stable release of `wireguard-linux`, but will note any known vulnerabilities in older versions that are relevant to this attack path.
* **Exclusions:** We will not analyze attacks that do not involve replacing the public key in the configuration file. For example, attacks that rely on tricking the user into manually adding a malicious peer are out of scope.

**Methodology:**

Our analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  We will identify the specific system and application-level vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to modify the WireGuard configuration file.
2.  **Attack Scenario Walkthrough:**  We will describe a realistic scenario where an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, step-by-step.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  We will detail the specific consequences of a successful attack, including data breaches, traffic manipulation, and potential denial of service.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  We will propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies to prevent or detect this attack.  These will be categorized by their effectiveness and implementation complexity.
5.  **Detection Techniques:** We will outline methods for detecting this attack, both proactively and reactively.
6.  **Code Review Considerations:** We will highlight specific areas of the application's code that should be reviewed to ensure they do not introduce vulnerabilities related to this attack path.

### 2. Deep Analysis

**2.1 Vulnerability Identification:**

The core vulnerability enabling this attack is **insufficient protection of the WireGuard configuration file**.  This can stem from several underlying issues:

*   **Weak File Permissions:** The configuration file (e.g., `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`) might have overly permissive file permissions (e.g., world-writable or group-writable by a non-privileged group).  This allows any user or process in that group to modify the file.
*   **Insecure Configuration Storage:** If the application stores the WireGuard configuration in a non-standard location (e.g., a user's home directory, a database, or a network share), that location might have weaker security controls than the standard `/etc/wireguard/` directory.
*   **Application-Level Vulnerabilities:** The application itself might have vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to write to arbitrary files, including the WireGuard configuration.  Examples include:
    *   **Path Traversal:**  If the application takes user input to specify a file path (e.g., for importing a configuration), it might be vulnerable to path traversal attacks, allowing the attacker to write to `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` even if the application intends to write to a different location.
    *   **Command Injection:** If the application uses user input to construct shell commands (e.g., to start or stop the WireGuard interface), it might be vulnerable to command injection, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, including modifying the configuration file.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  A vulnerability within the application might allow an attacker to escalate their privileges to a level where they can modify the configuration file.
*   **Compromised Root Account:** If the attacker has already compromised the root account, they have full control over the system and can modify any file, including the WireGuard configuration. This is the most straightforward, albeit highest-privilege, pathway.
* **Lack of File Integrity Monitoring:** Even with proper permissions, a sophisticated attacker might find ways to modify the file. Without file integrity monitoring, these changes might go unnoticed.

**2.2 Attack Scenario Walkthrough:**

Let's consider a scenario where a web application manages WireGuard configurations for users.

1.  **Initial Compromise:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the web application (e.g., a SQL injection or cross-site scripting flaw) to gain limited access to the server.
2.  **Privilege Escalation (Optional):** The attacker might leverage a local privilege escalation vulnerability to gain higher privileges, potentially root access.  This step is not strictly necessary if the web application runs with excessive privileges.
3.  **Configuration File Modification:** The attacker, now with sufficient privileges, modifies the WireGuard configuration file (e.g., `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`). They locate the `PublicKey` entry for a legitimate peer (e.g., a user's client) and replace it with their own attacker-controlled public key.
4.  **Man-in-the-Middle:** When the victim connects to the WireGuard server, the server uses the attacker's public key to establish the tunnel.  The attacker can now intercept, decrypt, modify, and re-encrypt all traffic between the victim and the server.  The victim is unaware of the compromise.
5.  **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** The attacker can steal sensitive data transmitted by the victim, inject malicious code, or redirect the victim to a phishing site.

**2.3 Impact Assessment:**

The impact of a successful public key replacement attack is severe:

*   **Complete Loss of Confidentiality:** The attacker can decrypt all traffic passing through the WireGuard tunnel, exposing sensitive data such as passwords, personal information, and business secrets.
*   **Loss of Integrity:** The attacker can modify the traffic in transit, potentially injecting malicious code, altering data, or causing application errors.
*   **Loss of Availability (Potential):** While the primary goal is usually interception, the attacker could also disrupt the connection, causing a denial of service.
*   **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization responsible for it.
*   **Legal and Financial Consequences:** Data breaches can lead to legal action, fines, and significant financial losses.

**2.4 Mitigation Strategies:**

Here are several mitigation strategies, categorized by their effectiveness and implementation complexity:

| Mitigation Strategy                               | Effectiveness | Implementation Complexity | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :------------ | :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Strict File Permissions**                     | High          | Low                       | Ensure the WireGuard configuration file has the most restrictive permissions possible.  Typically, this means `600` (read/write only by the owner, usually root) and owned by `root:root`.  This prevents unauthorized users from modifying the file.                                                                               |
| **2. Secure Configuration Storage**                | High          | Medium                    | If the application stores the configuration in a non-standard location, ensure that location is protected with appropriate security controls (e.g., strong file permissions, encryption, access control lists).  Avoid storing configurations in user-writable directories.                                                               |
| **3. Application Hardening**                       | High          | High                      | Address any application-level vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to write to arbitrary files or execute arbitrary commands.  This includes thorough input validation, output encoding, and secure coding practices to prevent path traversal, command injection, and privilege escalation vulnerabilities. |
| **4. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**             | High          | Medium                    | Implement a file integrity monitoring system (e.g., AIDE, Tripwire, Samhain) to detect unauthorized modifications to the WireGuard configuration file.  FIM tools create a baseline of the file's hash and alert administrators if the hash changes.                                                                        |
| **5. Least Privilege Principle**                    | High          | Medium                    | Run the application and any related processes with the least privileges necessary.  Avoid running the application as root.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they compromise the application.                                                                                                                            |
| **6. SELinux/AppArmor**                             | High          | High                      | Use mandatory access control (MAC) systems like SELinux or AppArmor to enforce fine-grained access control policies.  These systems can prevent even the root user from modifying certain files if the policy prohibits it.                                                                                                      |
| **7. Configuration Signing (Future-Proofing)**     | Very High     | High                      |  A more advanced mitigation would be to digitally sign the WireGuard configuration file.  The WireGuard client/server could then verify the signature before loading the configuration, ensuring that it hasn't been tampered with. This is not currently a standard feature of WireGuard but could be implemented as an extension. |
| **8. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Tests** | High          | High                      | Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities in the application and its infrastructure.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **9. Use of Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)**      | Very High     | Very High                 | For extremely sensitive environments, consider storing the WireGuard private key in a Hardware Security Module (HSM). This makes it much harder for an attacker to extract the private key, even if they compromise the server. This is a high-cost, high-complexity solution.                                                  |

**2.5 Detection Techniques:**

*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** As mentioned above, FIM is the primary detection method.  Alerts from the FIM system should be investigated immediately.
*   **Log Analysis:** Monitor system logs for any unusual activity related to the WireGuard configuration file or the `wg` command.  This might include unexpected file access, permission changes, or errors.
*   **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic for anomalies that might indicate a man-in-the-middle attack.  This could include unexpected IP addresses, unusual traffic patterns, or changes in TLS certificates.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  IDS/IPS systems can be configured to detect and potentially block malicious traffic patterns associated with a compromised WireGuard tunnel.
* **Regular Manual Checks:** Periodically, manually inspect the WireGuard configuration file to ensure that the public keys are correct. This is a low-tech but potentially effective method, especially if combined with other detection techniques.

**2.6 Code Review Considerations:**

During code reviews, pay close attention to the following areas:

*   **File Handling:**  Any code that reads, writes, or modifies files, especially configuration files, should be scrutinized for vulnerabilities like path traversal and insecure file permissions.
*   **Command Execution:**  Any code that executes shell commands should be carefully reviewed for command injection vulnerabilities.  Avoid using user input directly in shell commands.  Use parameterized commands or libraries that handle escaping properly.
*   **Privilege Management:**  Ensure that the application runs with the least privileges necessary.  Avoid running as root unless absolutely required.  If the application needs to perform privileged operations, use a separate, privileged process and communicate with it securely.
*   **Configuration Loading:**  The code that loads the WireGuard configuration should verify the integrity of the configuration file before using it.  This could involve checking file permissions, verifying a digital signature (if implemented), or comparing the file to a known-good copy.
*   **Error Handling:**  Ensure that the application handles errors gracefully and does not leak sensitive information in error messages.

### 3. Conclusion

The attack path 1.3.2.2, "Replace Legitimate Public Key with Attacker's Key," represents a significant threat to WireGuard-based applications.  By understanding the vulnerabilities that enable this attack and implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly reduce the risk of a successful man-in-the-middle attack.  Regular security audits, penetration testing, and a strong focus on secure coding practices are essential for maintaining the security of the application over time. The most crucial immediate steps are ensuring strict file permissions on the WireGuard configuration and implementing file integrity monitoring. These two measures provide a strong defense against the most common attack vectors.
