Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the WireGuard Linux implementation.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.4.2.1 Steal Preshared Key [HIGH-RISK]

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the attack vector "Steal Preshared Key" within the context of a WireGuard-based application on Linux.  We aim to identify:

*   Specific vulnerabilities that could lead to preshared key theft.
*   The technical steps an attacker might take to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   The potential impact of a successful key compromise.
*   Effective mitigation strategies and best practices to prevent key theft.
*   Detection methods to identify potential key compromise attempts or successful breaches.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where a preshared key (PSK) is used in a WireGuard configuration on a Linux system.  It considers the following aspects:

*   **Storage:** How and where the PSK is stored on the system (e.g., configuration files, environment variables, databases, key management systems).
*   **Access Control:**  The permissions and access controls governing the PSK's storage location.
*   **Application Logic:** How the application interacts with the PSK (e.g., reading, writing, transmitting).
*   **System Configuration:**  Relevant system-level security settings that could impact PSK security (e.g., file system permissions, user accounts, process isolation).
*   **WireGuard Implementation:**  We assume the standard `wireguard-linux` implementation is used, without custom modifications that might introduce new vulnerabilities.  We will, however, consider common misconfigurations.
* **Attacker Model:** We consider attackers with varying levels of access, from remote attackers with no prior access to local users with limited privileges.

**Methodology:**

We will employ a combination of the following methodologies:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will systematically identify potential threats and vulnerabilities related to PSK storage and access.
2.  **Code Review (Conceptual):** While we won't have access to the specific application's source code, we will conceptually review how a typical application might interact with the PSK and identify potential weaknesses.  We will review relevant parts of the `wireguard-linux` codebase documentation and known best practices.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities and exploits related to file system permissions, process injection, and other relevant attack vectors.
4.  **Best Practices Analysis:** We will identify and recommend industry best practices for secure key storage and management.
5.  **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):** We will describe potential penetration testing techniques that could be used to attempt to steal the PSK.
6.  **Mitigation and Detection Strategy Development:**  We will propose concrete steps to mitigate the identified risks and detect potential attacks.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.4.2.1 Steal Preshared Key

**2.1 Vulnerability Identification and Exploitation Scenarios:**

Here are several scenarios where an attacker could steal the preshared key:

*   **Scenario 1: Insecure File Permissions (Most Common):**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The WireGuard configuration file (typically located in `/etc/wireguard/`) containing the PSK has overly permissive file permissions (e.g., `644` or `777`).  This allows any local user on the system to read the file.
    *   **Exploitation:** A low-privileged user or a compromised application running under a different user account can simply read the configuration file and extract the PSK.
    *   **Example:** `cat /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` (if the interface is named `wg0`).
    *   **Likelihood:** High, due to common misconfiguration.
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice

*   **Scenario 2:  Compromised Root User:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The root user account is compromised through any means (e.g., SSH brute-force, vulnerability in a root-owned service).
    *   **Exploitation:** The attacker, having root privileges, can access any file on the system, including the WireGuard configuration file.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on overall system security).
    *   **Effort:** Variable (depends on how root is compromised).
    *   **Skill Level:** Varies (from Novice to Advanced, depending on the method of root compromise).

*   **Scenario 3:  Process Memory Inspection:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The PSK is loaded into the memory of a process (e.g., `wg-quick`, the application using WireGuard).  A vulnerability in another process or a debugging tool allows for memory inspection.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker uses tools like `gdb`, `/proc/<pid>/mem`, or a custom exploit to read the memory of the WireGuard-related process and extract the PSK.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (requires a separate vulnerability or misconfiguration).
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced

*   **Scenario 4:  Environment Variable Leakage:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The PSK is mistakenly stored in an environment variable, and this environment variable is exposed to other processes or logged.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker gains access to the environment variables of the process (e.g., through a vulnerability, misconfigured logging, or a compromised service that has access to the environment).
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (due to being a less common, but still possible, misconfiguration).
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate

*   **Scenario 5:  Backup Exposure:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Unencrypted or poorly secured backups of the system or the WireGuard configuration directory are created.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker gains access to the backup files (e.g., through a compromised backup server, physical theft of a backup drive) and extracts the PSK.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on backup practices).
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate

*   **Scenario 6:  Configuration Management System Vulnerability:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The PSK is stored in a configuration management system (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef) and that system is compromised.
    *   **Exploitation:** The attacker gains access to the configuration management system's secrets store and retrieves the PSK.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on the security of the configuration management system).
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced

* **Scenario 7: Side-Channel Attacks (Theoretical):**
    * **Vulnerability:**  While highly unlikely in practice for PSKs, theoretical side-channel attacks (e.g., timing attacks, power analysis) could potentially be used to infer the PSK if the attacker has physical access to the device and can observe the cryptographic operations.
    * **Exploitation:**  Highly specialized and requires deep understanding of the hardware and software.
    * **Likelihood:** Extremely Low
    * **Effort:** Extremely High
    * **Skill Level:** Expert

**2.2 Impact Analysis:**

The impact of a stolen PSK is **High**.  A compromised PSK allows an attacker to:

*   **Establish a VPN Connection:** The attacker can connect to the WireGuard network as if they were a legitimate peer.
*   **Intercept Traffic:**  The attacker can decrypt and view all traffic passing through the VPN tunnel. This includes sensitive data, credentials, and communications.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** The attacker can modify traffic in transit, potentially injecting malicious code or redirecting users to phishing sites.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Once inside the VPN, the attacker can potentially access other systems and resources on the network.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While less likely with just the PSK, the attacker could potentially disrupt the VPN service by flooding the network or interfering with legitimate connections.

**2.3 Mitigation Strategies:**

The following mitigation strategies are crucial to prevent PSK theft:

*   **1. Strict File Permissions (Essential):**
    *   Ensure the WireGuard configuration file has the most restrictive permissions possible.  Ideally, it should be owned by `root` and have permissions set to `600` (read/write only by the owner).
    *   **Command:** `chown root:root /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf && chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`
    *   **Verification:** `ls -l /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` (should show `-rw-------  1 root root ...`)

*   **2. Avoid Environment Variables:**
    *   Never store the PSK in an environment variable.  Environment variables are often less secure and can be leaked more easily.

*   **3. Secure Configuration Management:**
    *   If using a configuration management system, ensure it is properly secured and uses strong authentication and encryption for secrets.  Follow best practices for the specific system (e.g., using Ansible Vault, Chef encrypted data bags, or Puppet Hiera with eyaml).

*   **4. Secure Backups:**
    *   Encrypt all backups, especially those containing sensitive data like WireGuard configuration files.
    *   Store backups securely, with restricted access.

*   **5. Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Run the WireGuard service (and any application using it) under a dedicated, non-root user account with the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the impact of a potential compromise of the application.

*   **6.  Consider Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) (Advanced):**
    *   For extremely high-security environments, consider using an HSM to store and manage the PSK.  HSMs provide a tamper-resistant environment for cryptographic keys.

*   **7.  Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the system and application to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

*   **8.  Minimize PSK Usage (Best Practice):**
    *   While PSKs simplify setup, they are inherently less secure than key pairs.  Whenever possible, avoid using PSKs and rely solely on public/private key pairs for authentication.  If PSKs *must* be used, treat them with the same level of security as private keys.

* **9.  Use a dedicated Key Management System:**
    * If the application is complex and uses many keys, consider using dedicated key management system.

**2.4 Detection Methods:**

Detecting PSK theft can be challenging, but here are some methods:

*   **1. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**
    *   Use a FIM tool (e.g., AIDE, Tripwire, OSSEC) to monitor the WireGuard configuration file for unauthorized changes or access.  This can alert you if the file is read or modified by an unexpected user or process.

*   **2. Audit Logging:**
    *   Enable audit logging (e.g., using `auditd` on Linux) to track file access and system calls.  This can help identify suspicious activity related to the configuration file.

*   **3. Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**
    *   An IDS (e.g., Snort, Suricata) can be configured to detect network traffic patterns associated with unauthorized VPN connections.  This is more effective if you have a baseline of normal network activity.

*   **4.  Regular Key Rotation (Mitigation and Detection):**
    *   Even if you don't suspect a compromise, regularly rotate the PSK.  This limits the window of opportunity for an attacker to use a stolen key.  If a rotated key suddenly stops working, it could indicate a compromise.

*   **5.  Monitor WireGuard Logs:**
    *   WireGuard itself may generate logs related to connection attempts.  Monitor these logs for unusual activity.

*   **6.  Behavioral Analysis:**
    *   Monitor network traffic and system behavior for anomalies that might indicate a compromised PSK, such as unexpected connections from unknown IP addresses or unusual data transfer patterns.

### 3. Conclusion

Stealing a WireGuard preshared key is a high-impact, relatively low-effort attack if basic security precautions are not taken.  The most common vulnerability is insecure file permissions on the configuration file.  By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, particularly strict file permissions, avoiding environment variables, and minimizing PSK usage, the risk of PSK theft can be significantly reduced.  Regular security audits and monitoring are essential for detecting and responding to potential compromises.  The best defense is to avoid using PSKs altogether and rely on the more secure public/private key authentication mechanism inherent to WireGuard.
