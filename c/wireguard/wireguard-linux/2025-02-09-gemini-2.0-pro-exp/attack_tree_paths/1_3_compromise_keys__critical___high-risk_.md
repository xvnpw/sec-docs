Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Compromise Keys" attack tree path for a WireGuard-based application, focusing on the `wireguard-linux` implementation.

## Deep Analysis: WireGuard Key Compromise

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the potential attack vectors that could lead to the compromise of WireGuard private and public keys within the context of the `wireguard-linux` implementation.  We aim to identify vulnerabilities, assess their likelihood and impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to harden the system against key compromise, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the VPN tunnel.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Key Generation:**  How keys are generated by `wg genkey` and `wg pubkey`, and potential weaknesses in this process.
*   **Key Storage:** How and where keys are stored on the Linux system, both in memory and on persistent storage (e.g., configuration files, environment variables, kernel keyring).
*   **Key Usage:** How the `wireguard-linux` kernel module and user-space tools (`wg`, `wg-quick`) access and utilize the keys.
*   **Key Transmission:**  How keys are exchanged during the handshake process (out-of-band key exchange is assumed; we are *not* analyzing the Noise protocol itself, but rather how pre-shared keys or initial public keys are handled).
*   **Key Destruction/Rotation:** How keys are (or should be) securely deleted or rotated.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** We will consider attackers with varying levels of access, including:
    *   **Remote attackers:**  No prior access to the system.
    *   **Local attackers:**  Unprivileged user access to the system.
    *   **Privileged attackers:**  Root access to the system.
    *   **Physical attackers:**  Physical access to the hardware.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examining the relevant source code of `wireguard-linux` (kernel module), `wireguard-tools` (user-space utilities), and any related libraries (e.g., `libmnl`, `libnetlink`).  This will focus on identifying potential vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, insecure API usage, and improper permission handling.
2.  **Documentation Review:**  Analyzing the official WireGuard documentation, whitepaper, and related security advisories to understand the intended security model and known limitations.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Systematically identifying potential threats and attack vectors based on the attacker capabilities outlined in the scope.
4.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Searching for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) and exploit techniques that could be relevant to key compromise.
5.  **Best Practices Analysis:**  Comparing the implementation against established security best practices for key management and secure coding.
6.  **Hypothetical Attack Scenario Development:**  Constructing realistic attack scenarios to illustrate how vulnerabilities could be exploited.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.3 Compromise Keys

This section breaks down the "Compromise Keys" attack path into sub-categories and analyzes each.

**2.1 Key Generation Weaknesses**

*   **Insufficient Entropy:**  The security of WireGuard keys relies entirely on the quality of the random number generator (RNG) used during key generation.  If the RNG is weak, predictable, or compromised, the generated keys will be vulnerable.
    *   **Source Code:**  `wg genkey` uses `/dev/urandom` (or `/dev/random` if configured) on Linux.  The kernel's cryptographic RNG (CRNG) is generally considered strong, but it relies on sufficient entropy being available.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Low-entropy environments:**  Virtual machines, embedded systems, or newly booted systems may have insufficient entropy, leading to weak key generation.  This is particularly a concern immediately after boot.
        *   **RNG Backdoors/Vulnerabilities:**  While unlikely, a compromised or backdoored kernel RNG could lead to predictable key generation.
        *   **Side-channel attacks on RNG:**  Sophisticated attackers might attempt to extract information about the RNG state through side channels (e.g., timing, power analysis).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Entropy Monitoring:**  Monitor the available entropy pool (`/proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail`) and ensure it remains above a safe threshold.
        *   **Entropy Augmentation:**  Use tools like `rngd` or `haveged` to supplement the kernel's entropy pool, especially in low-entropy environments.  Carefully vet the source of any external entropy source.
        *   **Hardware RNGs:**  Utilize hardware random number generators (HRNGs) if available and trusted.
        *   **Early Boot Entropy:** Consider using techniques to gather entropy early in the boot process, such as `early-rng`.

*   **Implementation Errors in `wg genkey`:** While unlikely, a bug in the `wg genkey` tool itself could lead to weak keys.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Code Audits:** Regular security audits of the `wireguard-tools` codebase.
        *   **Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing techniques to test `wg genkey` for unexpected behavior.

**2.2 Key Storage Vulnerabilities**

*   **Insecure Configuration Files:**  The most common storage location for WireGuard keys is in the configuration files (e.g., `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`).  These files must be protected with appropriate permissions.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Incorrect File Permissions:**  If the configuration file is world-readable, any user on the system can read the private key.
        *   **Unprivileged User Access:**  An unprivileged user gaining access to the configuration file (e.g., through a vulnerability in another application) could steal the key.
        *   **Backup/Snapshot Exposure:**  Backups or snapshots of the configuration file might be stored insecurely, exposing the keys.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strict File Permissions:**  Set the configuration file permissions to `600` (read/write only by the owner, typically root).  Use `chown root:root /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` and `chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`.
        *   **Secure Backup Practices:**  Encrypt backups and store them securely.  Ensure that backup systems themselves are protected from unauthorized access.
        *   **Configuration Management:**  Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef) to enforce secure file permissions and prevent accidental misconfiguration.
        * **Avoid storing keys in unencrypted cloud storage or version control systems.**

*   **Environment Variables:**  Some scripts or applications might store keys in environment variables.  This is generally discouraged.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Process Listing:**  Environment variables can often be viewed by other processes on the system (e.g., using `ps` or `/proc/<pid>/environ`).
        *   **Debugging/Logging:**  Environment variables might be inadvertently logged or exposed during debugging.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Avoid Environment Variables:**  Do not store keys in environment variables.  Use configuration files with proper permissions instead.
        *   **If Unavoidable:**  If environment variables *must* be used, ensure they are cleared immediately after use and are not accessible to other users or processes.

*   **Kernel Keyring:**  WireGuard uses the Linux kernel keyring to store keys in memory.  This is generally secure, but vulnerabilities in the kernel keyring itself could exist.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Kernel Exploits:**  A kernel exploit could potentially allow an attacker to read or modify the keyring contents.
        *   **Keyring Bugs:**  Bugs in the kernel keyring implementation could lead to key leakage or corruption.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Kernel Updates:**  Keep the kernel up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   **Kernel Hardening:**  Employ kernel hardening techniques (e.g., SELinux, AppArmor, grsecurity) to limit the impact of potential kernel exploits.

*   **RAM Scraping:**  An attacker with physical access or a sophisticated memory exploit could potentially extract keys from RAM.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Cold Boot Attacks:**  Data remanence in RAM can allow attackers to recover keys even after the system is powered off.
        *   **DMA Attacks:**  Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks can bypass normal memory protections and read kernel memory.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Full Disk Encryption (FDE):**  Encrypt the entire hard drive, including the swap partition, to protect against cold boot attacks.
        *   **Secure Boot:**  Enable Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized bootloaders and operating systems from loading.
        *   **IOMMU:**  Use an Input/Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) to restrict DMA access to specific memory regions.
        *   **Memory Encryption (SME/SEV):**  Consider using hardware-supported memory encryption (e.g., AMD SME/SEV) if available and supported.

**2.3 Key Usage Vulnerabilities**

*   **User-Space Tool Vulnerabilities:**  Bugs in `wg`, `wg-quick`, or other user-space tools that handle WireGuard keys could lead to key compromise.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Buffer Overflows:**  A buffer overflow in a user-space tool could allow an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially extract keys.
        *   **Format String Bugs:**  A format string vulnerability could allow an attacker to read arbitrary memory locations, including key material.
        *   **Command Injection:**  If user input is not properly sanitized, an attacker might be able to inject commands that expose the keys.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Code Audits:**  Regular security audits of the `wireguard-tools` codebase.
        *   **Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing techniques to test user-space tools for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user input to prevent command injection and other injection attacks.
        *   **Least Privilege:**  Run user-space tools with the minimum necessary privileges.

*   **Kernel Module Vulnerabilities:**  Bugs in the `wireguard-linux` kernel module itself could lead to key compromise.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Kernel Exploits:**  A kernel exploit could allow an attacker to read or modify kernel memory, including key material.
        *   **Logic Errors:**  Logic errors in the key handling code could lead to key leakage or corruption.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Kernel Updates:**  Keep the kernel up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   **Kernel Hardening:**  Employ kernel hardening techniques.
        *   **Code Audits:**  Regular security audits of the `wireguard-linux` codebase.

**2.4 Key Transmission Vulnerabilities**

*   **Insecure Key Exchange (Out-of-Band):**  WireGuard relies on out-of-band key exchange.  If the method used to exchange keys is insecure, the keys can be compromised.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Unencrypted Communication:**  Sending keys over unencrypted channels (e.g., plain text email, unencrypted chat) allows attackers to intercept them.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**  If the key exchange is not authenticated, an attacker could intercept the communication and substitute their own keys.
        *   **Social Engineering:**  Attackers could trick users into revealing their keys through phishing or other social engineering techniques.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Encrypted Communication:**  Use secure, encrypted channels (e.g., Signal, encrypted email, SSH) to exchange keys.
        *   **Key Verification:**  Verify the authenticity of the received public key through a trusted channel (e.g., voice call, in-person meeting).  Use a fingerprinting mechanism if available.
        *   **User Education:**  Educate users about the importance of secure key exchange and the risks of social engineering.

**2.5 Key Destruction/Rotation Vulnerabilities**

*   **Insecure Key Deletion:**  Simply deleting the configuration file might not securely erase the key from the disk.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Data Remanence:**  Data can remain on the disk even after a file is deleted, allowing attackers to recover the key using forensic tools.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Secure Deletion Tools:**  Use secure deletion tools (e.g., `shred`, `wipe`) to overwrite the key data multiple times.
        *   **Full Disk Encryption (FDE):**  FDE makes it much more difficult for attackers to recover deleted data.

*   **Lack of Key Rotation:**  Using the same keys for an extended period increases the risk of compromise.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Compromised Keys Remain Valid:**  If a key is compromised, it remains valid until it is rotated.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Regular Key Rotation:**  Implement a policy of regularly rotating WireGuard keys.  The frequency of rotation depends on the sensitivity of the data and the threat model.
        *   **Automated Key Rotation:**  Automate the key rotation process to reduce the risk of human error and ensure consistency.
