Okay, let's create a design document for the WireGuard Linux project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

WireGuard is a fast, modern, and secure VPN tunnel. It aims to be more performant and less complex than existing solutions like IPsec and OpenVPN.  Given its nature as a core piece of networking infrastructure, the business priorities revolve around performance, security, and maintainability.  It's likely used in a wide variety of contexts, from individual users to large enterprises, so adaptability is also key.

Business Priorities:

*   Performance:  Provide a high-speed VPN solution with minimal overhead.
*   Security:  Offer strong cryptographic protection for user data.
*   Simplicity:  Be easy to configure and deploy compared to alternatives.
*   Maintainability:  Have a clean and well-documented codebase for long-term viability.
*   Cross-Platform Compatibility (While this document focuses on the Linux implementation, the broader WireGuard project aims for this).
*   Auditability: The code should be easy to audit for security vulnerabilities.

Business Goals:

*   Become a widely adopted VPN solution.
*   Replace legacy VPN technologies in many use cases.
*   Provide a secure and reliable way to access private networks.
*   Minimize the attack surface exposed by the VPN software.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Cryptographic Weakness:  A flaw in the cryptographic implementation could compromise the security of all users.
*   Vulnerabilities in Code:  Bugs in the kernel module or user-space tools could lead to denial of service, privilege escalation, or information leaks.
*   Complexity Creep:  Adding features without careful consideration could lead to a more complex and less secure system over time.
*   Lack of Adoption: If WireGuard fails to gain traction, it may not receive the necessary community support and scrutiny.
*   Integration Challenges: Difficulty integrating with existing network infrastructure could hinder adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Cryptography: WireGuard uses a well-defined set of modern cryptographic primitives (Noise protocol framework, ChaCha20, Poly1305, BLAKE2s, SipHash24, HKDF). This is described in the whitepaper and source code.
*   security control: Minimal Attack Surface: The design philosophy emphasizes simplicity and a small codebase, reducing the potential for vulnerabilities. This is evident in the project's goals and code structure.
*   security control: Kernel Module: Running as a Linux kernel module allows for high performance and direct access to network interfaces.
*   security control: Authenticated Encryption: All packets are authenticated and encrypted, preventing tampering and eavesdropping. This is inherent to the Noise protocol framework.
*   security control: Key Exchange: Uses a secure key exchange mechanism based on public keys. This is detailed in the protocol specification.
*   security control: Perfect Forward Secrecy: Provides forward secrecy, meaning that past sessions cannot be decrypted even if long-term keys are compromised. This is a property of the Noise protocol framework.
*   security control: Cryptokey Routing: Associates each public key with a list of allowed IP addresses, providing a simple form of access control. This is a core part of the WireGuard configuration.
*   security control: Denial-of-Service Mitigation: Includes mechanisms to mitigate denial-of-service attacks, such as handling unauthenticated packets efficiently. This is mentioned in the documentation and implemented in the code.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Kernel Module Risks: Running code in the kernel inherently carries risks, as a vulnerability could compromise the entire system. This is mitigated by the small codebase and focus on security, but the risk remains.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on Cryptographic Primitives: The security of WireGuard depends entirely on the security of the chosen cryptographic primitives. While these are considered strong, future cryptanalytic advances could weaken them.
*   accepted risk: User Misconfiguration: While WireGuard itself is designed to be secure, users can still misconfigure it, potentially creating security vulnerabilities (e.g., using weak pre-shared keys, exposing the interface to the public internet unintentionally).

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Formal Verification: Consider applying formal verification techniques to critical parts of the codebase to prove their correctness.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular independent security audits of the codebase and protocol.
*   security control: Fuzzing: Implement continuous fuzzing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Static Analysis: Integrate static analysis tools into the build process to catch potential bugs early.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All peers must be authenticated using their public keys.
    *   Pre-shared keys should be optional and used only for specific use cases.
    *   The key exchange mechanism must be resistant to known attacks.

*   Authorization:
    *   Cryptokey routing should be enforced to restrict access to specific IP addresses.
    *   Consider adding more granular access control mechanisms in the future (e.g., based on user identity).

*   Input Validation:
    *   All input from user-space tools and configuration files must be carefully validated.
    *   All network packets must be validated to ensure they conform to the protocol specification.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Only strong, well-vetted cryptographic primitives should be used.
    *   Cryptographic keys must be generated and stored securely.
    *   The implementation must be resistant to side-channel attacks.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Development: Developers write and modify the C code for the WireGuard kernel module, hosted on GitHub.
2.  Source Code: The source code is retrieved from the repository (e.g., via `git clone`).
3.  Kernel Build System: The code is compiled using the Linux kernel build system (kbuild). This involves using Makefiles and configuration files specific to the kernel.
4.  DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support): DKMS is often used to build and install WireGuard as an out-of-tree module. This allows the module to be automatically rebuilt when the kernel is updated.
5.  Signed Kernel Module: The output of the build process is a compiled kernel module (`.ko` file).  Ideally, this module should be digitally signed to ensure its integrity and authenticity.
6.  Package Builder:  Tools like `dpkg` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `rpmbuild` (Fedora/Red Hat) are used to create distribution packages from the compiled module and associated files.
7.  Distribution Package: The final output is a package (e.g., `.deb`, `.rpm`) that can be easily installed on target systems.
8.  Linters: Linters are used to check the code for style and potential errors.
9.  Static Analysis: Static analysis tools are used to identify potential bugs and security vulnerabilities in the code.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code Review: All changes to the codebase should be reviewed by other developers before being merged.
*   security control: Static Analysis: Static analysis tools (as mentioned above) should be integrated into the build process.
*   security control: DKMS: Using DKMS helps ensure that the module is compatible with the running kernel.
*   security control: Package Signing: Distribution packages should be digitally signed to prevent tampering.
*   security control: Reproducible Builds:  Strive for reproducible builds, where the same source code always produces the same binary output. This helps ensure that the build process has not been compromised.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   Secure Remote Access: The primary business process is providing secure remote access to private networks. Any disruption or compromise of this process would have significant consequences.
*   Data Confidentiality: Maintaining the confidentiality of data transmitted through the VPN tunnel is critical.
*   Data Integrity: Ensuring the integrity of data transmitted through the VPN tunnel is also essential.
*   System Availability: The VPN service must be available and reliable for users.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   Network Traffic: All data transmitted through the VPN tunnel is considered highly sensitive. This could include anything from web browsing traffic to confidential business data.
*   Cryptographic Keys: The private keys used by WireGuard peers are extremely sensitive and must be protected at all costs. Compromise of a private key would allow an attacker to impersonate a user or decrypt their traffic.
*   Configuration Data: WireGuard configuration files (containing public keys, allowed IPs, etc.) are moderately sensitive. While they don't contain private keys, they could reveal information about the network topology and access control policies.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific Linux distributions and kernel versions are the primary targets for deployment? This will influence the build and packaging process.
*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., FIPS 140-2) that need to be considered?
*   What is the expected scale of deployment (number of users, concurrent connections)? This will impact performance testing and optimization.
*   What are the existing security monitoring and incident response procedures? This will help determine how WireGuard logs and alerts should be integrated.
*   Are there plans to integrate with any specific identity providers or access management systems?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: We assume a moderate risk appetite. While WireGuard aims for simplicity, security is paramount, and performance optimizations should not compromise security.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: We assume that the underlying Linux operating system is reasonably secure and up-to-date. We also assume that users will follow best practices for securing their private keys.
*   DESIGN: We assume that the standard deployment method will be via distribution packages. We also assume that users will primarily use the `wg-quick` tool for configuration.
