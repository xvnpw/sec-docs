# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for wireguard/wireguard-linux

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict `AllowedIPs` Enforcement (Kernel-Level)](./mitigation_strategies/strict__allowedips__enforcement__kernel-level_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Kernel Enforcement:** The `wireguard-linux` module *directly* enforces the `AllowedIPs` rules within the kernel's network stack. This is *not* a firewall rule; it's a fundamental part of WireGuard's security model.
    2.  **Configuration:** As before, configure `AllowedIPs` in the WireGuard configuration file (or via `wg` commands) to be as restrictive as possible for each peer.
    3.  **Packet Filtering:** The kernel module examines each incoming and outgoing packet associated with the WireGuard interface.  It *drops* any packet that doesn't match the `AllowedIPs` rules for the associated peer. This happens *before* any other network processing, making it very efficient and secure.
    4.  **Cryptokey Routing:** The `AllowedIPs` setting also directly influences the kernel's "cryptokey routing" table, which is used to determine which peer a packet should be sent to (and which key should be used to decrypt it).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Traffic Injection (High Severity):** The kernel module prevents unauthorized traffic from entering or leaving the tunnel.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Limits the scope of DoS attacks by dropping traffic from unallowed sources at the kernel level.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) (High Severity):** Makes MitM significantly harder by enforcing source IP restrictions within the kernel.
    *   **Reconnaissance (Low Severity):** Hinders network probing through the tunnel.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Traffic Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated with correct configuration).
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **MitM:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Reconnaissance:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   This is a *core, fundamental feature* of the `wireguard-linux` kernel module. The enforcement happens directly within the kernel.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   While the *kernel-level enforcement* is robust, user-space tools for managing and visualizing `AllowedIPs` could be improved, especially for complex deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pre-shared Keys (PSKs) (Kernel-Level)](./mitigation_strategies/pre-shared_keys__psks___kernel-level_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Kernel-Level Authentication:** The `wireguard-linux` module handles PSK authentication *directly within the kernel*.
    2.  **Configuration:** As before, configure the `PresharedKey` option in the WireGuard configuration.
    3.  **Additional Authentication Factor:** When a handshake is initiated, the kernel module requires *both* the correct private key *and* the correct PSK to establish the connection. This is an additional cryptographic check performed within the kernel.
    4.  **Rejection:** If the PSK is incorrect or missing, the handshake fails at the kernel level, and no connection is established.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Key Compromise (High Severity):** Requires an attacker to possess both the private key and the PSK.
    *   **Replay Attacks (Medium Severity):** PSKs help mitigate replay attacks within the kernel's handshake process.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) (High Severity):** Significantly increases the difficulty of MitM attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Key Compromise:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **MitM:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   PSK support and enforcement are *fully implemented* within the `wireguard-linux` kernel module.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The kernel-level implementation is complete.  Improvements could be made in user-space tools for managing PSK rotation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Kernel and WireGuard Module Updates (Directly Addressing Module Vulnerabilities)](./mitigation_strategies/kernel_and_wireguard_module_updates__directly_addressing_module_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Vulnerability Patches:** Updates to the `wireguard-linux` module often contain patches for security vulnerabilities discovered in the module's code. These are *direct fixes* to the kernel-level implementation.
    2.  **Bug Fixes:** Updates also address bugs that could lead to denial-of-service conditions or other unexpected behavior within the kernel module.
    3.  **Performance Improvements:**  Updates may include performance optimizations that improve the efficiency of the kernel module, indirectly reducing the potential for resource exhaustion.
    4.  **Installation:**  Install updates using your distribution's package manager or by compiling the module from source, ensuring you obtain the code from a trusted source (the official WireGuard website or your distribution's repositories).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Protocol Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** Addresses vulnerabilities in the WireGuard protocol implementation *within the kernel module*.
    *   **Implementation Bugs (Variable Severity):** Fixes bugs in the `wireguard-linux` code that could lead to security issues or instability.
    *   **DoS Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Addresses potential DoS vectors within the kernel module.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Protocol Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced significantly, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Implementation Bugs:** Risk reduced significantly, depending on the bug.
    *   **DoS Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced moderately to significantly.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The update *mechanism* is provided by the distribution (package manager) or by manual compilation.  The *fixes themselves* are implemented within the updated `wireguard-linux` module code.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More proactive notification systems specifically for `wireguard-linux` security updates would be beneficial.
