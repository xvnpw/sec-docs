*   **Threat:** Message Forgery/Spoofing
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a message with a source address that impersonates a trusted internal service. They then send this message to a target service, hoping to trigger an action based on the assumed identity. This involves directly using Skynet's message sending API or exploiting vulnerabilities in how services handle message sources within the Skynet framework.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed by the target service, data manipulation, or denial of service by triggering unintended behavior within the Skynet application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Skynet core message passing mechanism (`skynet_send`, `skynet_callback`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mutual authentication between services using shared secrets or digital signatures within the Skynet environment.
        *   Validate the source of incoming messages before processing sensitive actions, leveraging Skynet's message handling capabilities.
        *   Avoid relying solely on the reported source address of a message for authorization within the Skynet application.

*   **Threat:** Message Queue Saturation/Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker floods a service's message queue with a large number of messages, overwhelming its processing capacity. This can be achieved by sending a high volume of messages directly through Skynet's messaging system or by exploiting a vulnerability that causes other services within the Skynet application to send excessive messages to the target.
    *   **Impact:** The target service becomes unresponsive, leading to denial of service for dependent components or the entire Skynet application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Skynet core message queue management within individual services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on message reception for individual services within Skynet.
        *   Set maximum queue sizes for services to prevent unbounded growth within the Skynet environment.
        *   Implement mechanisms to detect and mitigate message floods, potentially by identifying and blocking malicious senders at the Skynet level.

*   **Threat:** Service Impersonation/Registration Hijacking
    *   **Description:** An attacker registers a service with a name intended to mimic a legitimate service within the Skynet framework. Other services might then inadvertently send messages to the malicious service, believing it to be the legitimate one. This could happen if Skynet's implicit service registration or any custom registration mechanisms are not properly secured.
    *   **Impact:**  Data theft, manipulation, or denial of service if the malicious service responds inappropriately or not at all within the Skynet application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Skynet's service registry or naming service (implicit within Skynet's design).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure service registration mechanisms requiring authentication or authorization within the Skynet environment.
        *   Use a centralized and protected service registry if possible within the Skynet application.
        *   Services should verify the identity of other services they interact with, not just rely on the name within the Skynet framework.

*   **Threat:** Lua Sandbox Escape
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability in the Lua sandbox implementation within Skynet allows malicious code within a service's Lua script to escape the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the server. This could be due to flaws in the `snlua` module or the underlying Lua interpreter used by Skynet.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server hosting the Skynet instance, including data theft, malware installation, and further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** `snlua` module (Skynet's Lua integration), the underlying Lua interpreter.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Skynet and its Lua dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Carefully review and audit any custom Lua modules or C bindings used within Skynet for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using additional sandboxing techniques or security layers if running untrusted Lua code within Skynet.

*   **Threat:** Unsafe Use of `require`
    *   **Description:** If the `require` function in Lua within a Skynet service is not properly controlled, malicious actors might be able to load arbitrary Lua modules from unexpected locations, potentially introducing malicious code into the service's execution environment within Skynet.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious code within the service, potentially leading to sandbox escapes or other vulnerabilities within the Skynet application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `snlua` module, the Lua `require` function within Skynet.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict the paths from which Lua modules can be loaded within the Skynet environment.
        *   Carefully vet any external Lua modules used by the Skynet application.
        *   Avoid using dynamic paths for `require` based on external input within Skynet services.

*   **Threat:** Gate Exploitation
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Skynet `gate` service (if used for handling external connections) could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to internal services or to cause a denial of service. This could involve buffer overflows, format string bugs, or other common network vulnerabilities within the `gate` module itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to internal services managed by Skynet, denial of service affecting the Skynet application, or information leakage.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `gate` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the `gate` service with standard network security practices (firewalls, intrusion detection) at the network level.
        *   Carefully review and audit the `gate` module's code for vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization at the `gate` to protect the Skynet backend.
