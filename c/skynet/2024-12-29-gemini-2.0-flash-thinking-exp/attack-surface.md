*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthenticated Message Forgery/Spoofing
    *   **Description:** A malicious service or external entity can send messages that appear to originate from a legitimate Skynet service without proper authentication.
    *   **How Skynet Contributes:** By default, Skynet's core message passing mechanism doesn't enforce strong authentication or integrity checks on messages between services. Services often rely on implicit trust based on the source address, which can be spoofed.
    *   **Example:** A rogue service sends a message to a database service pretending to be the authentication service, instructing it to grant administrative privileges to a malicious user.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized actions, data manipulation, privilege escalation, and disruption of services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement custom authentication mechanisms within services to verify the identity of the sender.
        *   Utilize message signing or encryption to ensure message integrity and authenticity.
        *   Enforce access control lists (ACLs) based on service identity rather than relying solely on source addresses.

*   **Attack Surface:** Message Interception and Eavesdropping
    *   **Description:** Attackers can intercept and read messages exchanged between Skynet services.
    *   **How Skynet Contributes:**  Communication between Skynet services, by default, is not encrypted. This makes it vulnerable to eavesdropping if an attacker gains access to the network.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as the Skynet application intercepts messages containing sensitive user data being passed between a web frontend service and a backend processing service.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, and business secrets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement encryption for inter-service communication. This could involve using TLS/SSL for network connections or encrypting message payloads.
        *   Utilize secure channels for sensitive data transmission.

*   **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Message Flooding
    *   **Description:** A malicious entity overwhelms Skynet services with a large volume of messages, causing performance degradation or service unavailability.
    *   **How Skynet Contributes:** Skynet's message queue can become a bottleneck if not properly managed. Without rate limiting or input validation on message volume, it's susceptible to flooding attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a massive number of requests to the Gate service, which then forwards these requests as messages to backend services, overwhelming their processing capacity.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion, and potential cascading failures within the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on message processing within services.
        *   Implement input validation and filtering on messages received by services.
        *   Utilize message queue management techniques to handle backpressure and prevent queue overflow.
        *   Consider using a dedicated message queue system with built-in DoS protection features.

*   **Attack Surface:** Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Gate Service
    *   **Description:** The Gate service, acting as the entry point for external requests, doesn't adequately validate input, allowing attackers to send malicious payloads.
    *   **How Skynet Contributes:** The Gate service is often the bridge between the external world and the internal Skynet services. If the Gate doesn't sanitize or validate external input before forwarding it as messages, vulnerabilities in internal services can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to the Gate service containing a payload that, when forwarded as a message, triggers a buffer overflow in a backend service.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, service crashes, data corruption, and potential compromise of the Skynet node.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the Gate service for all external data.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when forwarding data to internal services.
        *   Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) in front of the Gate service.

*   **Attack Surface:** Unsafe Lua Code Execution
    *   **Description:**  If services dynamically load or execute untrusted Lua code without proper sandboxing, attackers can inject malicious code.
    *   **How Skynet Contributes:** Skynet services are often implemented using Lua. If services are designed to load or execute Lua code from external sources or user input without sufficient security measures, it creates a significant risk.
    *   **Example:** A service designed to execute user-provided Lua scripts for custom logic is exploited by an attacker who injects malicious code to gain shell access on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Skynet node, including data theft, system manipulation, and potential lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid executing untrusted Lua code whenever possible.
        *   If dynamic code execution is necessary, implement strong sandboxing techniques to restrict the capabilities of the executed code.
        *   Carefully vet any external Lua libraries or modules used by services.

*   **Attack Surface:** Service Discovery Poisoning
    *   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate the service discovery mechanism to redirect communication to malicious services.
    *   **How Skynet Contributes:** If the method by which services locate and communicate with each other is not secured, an attacker could potentially register a malicious service with the same name as a legitimate one, intercepting or manipulating communication.
    *   **Example:** An attacker registers a rogue service with the same name as the authentication service. When other services attempt to authenticate, they are unknowingly communicating with the malicious service, potentially leaking credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, and disruption of service functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure service registration and discovery mechanisms.
        *   Verify the identity of services during discovery and communication.
        *   Use a trusted and secure registry for service information.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Lua Libraries
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Lua libraries used by Skynet services can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **How Skynet Contributes:** Skynet services heavily rely on Lua and its ecosystem of libraries. If these libraries contain security flaws, they can be exploited to compromise the services.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a commonly used Lua HTTP library allows an attacker to send a specially crafted request that leads to remote code execution on the service.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, service crashes, and potential compromise of the Skynet node.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Lua and all used Lua libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly audit the dependencies of Skynet services for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in Lua code and libraries.
