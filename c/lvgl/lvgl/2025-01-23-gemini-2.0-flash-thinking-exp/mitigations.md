## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for LVGL Widgets](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_lvgl_widgets.md)

### 1. Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for LVGL Widgets

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for LVGL Widgets
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify LVGL Input Widgets:** Determine all LVGL widgets in your application that accept user input or display external data. Examples include `lv_textarea`, `lv_label` (if displaying external strings), `lv_dropdown`, etc.
    2.  **Validate Input to Widgets:** Implement validation logic *before* setting the value or text of these widgets. This validation should check for:
        *   **Expected Data Type:** Ensure the input data matches the expected type for the widget (e.g., integer for a numeric input, string for text).
        *   **Format and Range:** Validate the format and range of the input data (e.g., date format, numerical limits, allowed character sets).
        *   **Length Limits:** Enforce maximum length limits for text inputs to prevent buffer overflows within LVGL's internal string handling or your application's widget usage.
    3.  **Sanitize Widget Input:** If displaying external data in LVGL widgets (especially in `lv_label` or `lv_textarea`), sanitize the data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters *before* setting the widget's text. This is crucial to prevent interpretation of data as LVGL commands or escape sequences (though less common, consider if displaying any external text directly).
    4.  **Handle Invalid Widget Input:** Define how your application should react to invalid input intended for LVGL widgets. Options include:
        *   Rejecting the input and providing visual feedback to the user via LVGL (e.g., error message in a label).
        *   Ignoring the invalid input and maintaining the previous widget state.
        *   Sanitizing the input and using the sanitized version in the widget.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks via LVGL Display (Low to Medium Severity):** Prevents potential injection attacks if LVGL is used to display untrusted data that could be misinterpreted as commands or escape sequences by LVGL itself (though this is less common in typical LVGL usage compared to web contexts).
    *   **Buffer Overflow in LVGL String Handling (Medium Severity):** Input length limits help prevent buffer overflows if LVGL's internal string handling has vulnerabilities or if your application misuses LVGL string functions.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Low Severity):** Validation ensures that data displayed by LVGL widgets is in the expected format and range, preventing display of incorrect or misleading information.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks via LVGL Display:** Low to Medium reduction in risk. Reduces the risk of unintended interpretation of displayed data by LVGL.
    *   **Buffer Overflow in LVGL String Handling:** Medium reduction in risk. Lessens the chance of buffer overflows related to string inputs to LVGL widgets.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Low reduction in risk. Improves the reliability and correctness of data displayed via LVGL.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Input validation is present for some configuration settings displayed via LVGL, but not consistently applied to all user inputs and external data displayed in widgets.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in areas such as:
    *   Systematic validation of all user inputs to LVGL widgets across the application.
    *   Sanitization of external data displayed in `lv_label` and `lv_textarea` widgets.
    *   Consistent enforcement of input length limits for text-based LVGL widgets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Memory Safety Audits Focused on LVGL Usage](./mitigation_strategies/memory_safety_audits_focused_on_lvgl_usage.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Memory Safety Audits Focused on LVGL Usage
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Targeted Code Reviews:** Conduct code reviews specifically focusing on the application code that interacts with LVGL. Reviewers should pay close attention to:
        *   **LVGL Object Lifecycle:** Verify correct creation and deletion of LVGL objects using `lv_obj_create`, `lv_obj_del`, and related functions. Ensure no memory leaks due to forgotten deletions or incorrect object parenting.
        *   **LVGL Memory Allocation:** Examine usage of LVGL's memory management functions (`lv_mem_alloc`, `lv_mem_free`) if used directly in custom code interacting with LVGL.
        *   **Data Buffers for LVGL:** Review memory allocation and deallocation for data buffers used with LVGL, such as image buffers, font data, or custom draw buffers. Ensure proper sizing and lifetime management.
        *   **LVGL String Handling:** Analyze string operations involving LVGL functions, looking for potential buffer overflows when passing strings to or receiving strings from LVGL.
    2.  **Dynamic Analysis with Memory Sanitizers (LVGL Context):** When running dynamic analysis tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan) or MemorySanitizer (MSan), focus testing scenarios that heavily utilize LVGL features and object creation/deletion to specifically detect memory errors related to LVGL usage.
    3.  **Static Analysis for LVGL Integration:** Configure static analysis tools to specifically check for common memory safety issues in code sections that interact with LVGL APIs.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Memory Leaks due to LVGL Object Handling (Medium Severity):** Prevents memory leaks caused by improper management of LVGL objects, leading to performance degradation and potential crashes over time.
    *   **Use-After-Free related to LVGL Objects (High Severity):** Detects and prevents use-after-free vulnerabilities arising from incorrect LVGL object lifecycle management, which can lead to crashes and potential code execution.
    *   **Double Free related to LVGL Objects (High Severity):** Detects and prevents double free errors related to LVGL objects, which can cause crashes and memory corruption.
    *   **Buffer Overflow in LVGL Integration Code (Medium Severity):** Helps identify buffer overflows in application code that interacts with LVGL, especially in data handling for LVGL widgets or custom drawing routines.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Memory Leaks due to LVGL Object Handling:** Medium reduction in risk. Reduces the occurrence of memory leaks related to LVGL.
    *   **Use-After-Free related to LVGL Objects:** High reduction in risk. Greatly reduces the likelihood of use-after-free vulnerabilities in LVGL integration.
    *   **Double Free related to LVGL Objects:** High reduction in risk. Greatly reduces the likelihood of double free errors related to LVGL.
    *   **Buffer Overflow in LVGL Integration Code:** Medium reduction in risk. Can help identify buffer overflows in code interacting with LVGL.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Code reviews cover general functionality, but specific focus on memory safety in LVGL integration is not consistently emphasized. Dynamic and static analysis are not routinely targeted at LVGL usage patterns.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in areas such as:
    *   Dedicated code review checklist items for memory safety in LVGL integration.
    *   Regular dynamic analysis runs specifically testing LVGL object lifecycle and memory usage.
    *   Static analysis configurations tailored to detect memory issues in LVGL-related code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Quotas for LVGL Objects](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_quotas_for_lvgl_objects.md)

### 3. Resource Limits and Quotas for LVGL Objects

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Limits and Quotas for LVGL Objects
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Limits for LVGL Objects:** Establish limits on the number of certain types of LVGL objects that can be created, especially resource-intensive ones like images, styles, or complex widgets.
    2.  **Monitor LVGL Object Count:** Implement monitoring to track the number of active LVGL objects of different types in your application. LVGL provides functions to iterate through objects, which can be used for monitoring.
    3.  **Enforce Object Creation Limits:** Before creating new LVGL objects, check if the defined limits are being approached or exceeded. If a limit is reached, prevent further object creation and handle the situation gracefully (e.g., display an error message, recycle existing objects if possible).
    4.  **Memory Limits for LVGL:** Monitor the overall memory usage by LVGL (using LVGL's memory monitoring features if available or system-level memory monitoring). Implement mechanisms to prevent excessive memory consumption by LVGL, potentially by limiting the complexity of the UI or the number of displayed elements.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via LVGL Object Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks where an attacker attempts to exhaust system resources by forcing the application to create an excessive number of LVGL objects, leading to memory exhaustion or performance degradation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via LVGL Object Exhaustion:** Medium reduction in risk. Reduces the application's vulnerability to DoS attacks targeting LVGL object creation.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic limits might be implicitly present due to hardware resource constraints, but no explicit quotas or monitoring for LVGL object counts are in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in areas such as:
    *   Explicitly defined and enforced limits on the number of LVGL objects.
    *   Runtime monitoring of LVGL object counts and memory usage.
    *   Mechanisms to prevent object creation when limits are reached.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular LVGL Library Updates and Patching](./mitigation_strategies/regular_lvgl_library_updates_and_patching.md)

### 4. Regular LVGL Library Updates and Patching

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular LVGL Library Updates and Patching
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor LVGL Releases:** Regularly check the official LVGL GitHub repository ([https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl)) for new releases, bug fixes, and security patches. Subscribe to release notifications if available.
    2.  **Review Release Notes and Security Advisories:** Carefully review release notes and any accompanying security advisories for each new LVGL release. Identify if any reported vulnerabilities affect your application's usage of LVGL.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Dependency scanning is not currently configured to specifically include or target the LVGL library.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in areas such as:
    *   Configuring dependency scanning tools to include LVGL as a dependency to be scanned.
    *   Establishing a process for reviewing and acting upon vulnerability reports related to LVGL.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Build Process with Compiler Hardening for LVGL Application](./mitigation_strategies/secure_build_process_with_compiler_hardening_for_lvgl_application.md)

### 6. Secure Build Process with Compiler Hardening for LVGL Application

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Build Process with Compiler Hardening for LVGL Application
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Compiler Hardening Flags:** Ensure that compiler hardening flags are enabled when building your LVGL application. These flags enhance the security of the compiled executable, making it more resistant to exploitation. Common flags include:
        *   `-fstack-protector-strong` (Stack protection)
        *   `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` (Fortify Source)
        *   `-fPIE -pie` (Position Independent Executable and enable ASLR - if supported by target platform)
    2.  **Apply Hardening to LVGL Compilation (if building from source):** If you are building LVGL from source as part of your project, ensure that these compiler hardening flags are also applied during the compilation of the LVGL library itself. This maximizes the security benefits.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in LVGL or Application (Medium to High Severity):** Compiler hardening makes it more difficult to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows) that might exist in LVGL or your application's code interacting with LVGL.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in LVGL or Application:** Medium to High reduction in risk. Increases the difficulty of exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities in the LVGL application.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some basic compiler flags might be used, but full compiler hardening flag sets are not consistently enabled for the LVGL application build. Hardening is likely not applied to LVGL library compilation if built from source.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in areas such as:
    *   Systematically enabling a comprehensive set of compiler hardening flags for the application build.
    *   Ensuring compiler hardening is applied to LVGL library compilation when building from source.
    *   Documenting the compiler hardening flags used and their rationale.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Image and Font Handling Security within LVGL Context](./mitigation_strategies/image_and_font_handling_security_within_lvgl_context.md)

### 7. Image and Font Handling Security within LVGL Context

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Image and Font Handling Security within LVGL Context
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Validate Image/Font Files Before LVGL Loading:** Before loading image or font files into LVGL (e.g., using `lv_img_set_src`, `lv_font_load`), perform basic validation checks on the file:
        *   **File Format Verification:** Check if the file extension and/or magic numbers match the expected image or font format.
        *   **File Size Limits:** Enforce maximum file size limits to prevent loading excessively large files that could consume too much memory within LVGL's image/font handling.
    2.  **Use LVGL's Built-in Image/Font Support Carefully:** Be aware of the image and font formats supported by LVGL and any known limitations or potential vulnerabilities in LVGL's handling of these formats.
    3.  **Consider External Image/Font Libraries (if needed and carefully):** If your application requires handling complex or potentially untrusted image or font files, consider using well-vetted external libraries for decoding and rendering *before* passing the processed data to LVGL for display. This can isolate potential vulnerabilities in parsing complex formats from LVGL's core. However, carefully choose and integrate external libraries, ensuring they are also secure and regularly updated.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Image/Font Parsing Vulnerabilities in LVGL (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents exploitation of potential vulnerabilities in LVGL's built-in image and font handling routines when processing malicious or malformed image/font files.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Images/Fonts in LVGL (Medium Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks where loading specially crafted images or fonts in LVGL could exhaust memory or processing resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Image/Font Parsing Vulnerabilities in LVGL:** Medium to High reduction in risk. Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities in LVGL's image and font handling.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Images/Fonts in LVGL:** Medium reduction in risk. Lessens the chance of DoS attacks through malicious image or font files loaded into LVGL.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic image and font loading functionality is used in LVGL, but explicit validation of image/font files before loading into LVGL is not consistently performed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in areas such as:
    *   Systematic validation of image and font files before loading into LVGL widgets.
    *   Enforcement of file size limits for images and fonts loaded into LVGL.
    *   Formal consideration of using external libraries for more robust image/font handling in security-sensitive contexts.

        *   **Unit Tests with Security Checks:** Write unit tests that specifically check for potential security vulnerabilities in custom widgets, such as buffer overflows or incorrect memory handling under various input conditions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities Introduced by Custom LVGL Widgets (High Severity):** Prevents the introduction of new security vulnerabilities through insecurely developed custom LVGL widgets. These vulnerabilities could range from memory corruption and buffer overflows to logic flaws exploitable by attackers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities Introduced by Custom LVGL Widgets:** High reduction in risk. Minimizes the risk of security flaws originating from custom LVGL widget development.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic code reviews are performed for custom widgets, but security is not always a primary focus. Dedicated security testing or fuzzing of custom widgets is not routinely conducted.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in areas such as:
    *   Formal secure coding guidelines specifically for custom LVGL widget development.
    *   Security-focused checklist items for code reviews of custom LVGL widgets.
    *   Dedicated security testing and fuzzing processes for custom LVGL widgets.
