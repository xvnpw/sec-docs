# Threat Model Analysis for lvgl/lvgl

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in String Handling](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_string_handling.md)

Description: An attacker provides overly long strings as input to LVGL widgets or functions that handle text (e.g., `lv_label_set_text`, `lv_textarea_set_text`). If LVGL's internal string handling lacks proper bounds checking, this can lead to writing beyond allocated memory buffers. An attacker might craft strings to overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially leading to code execution by overwriting function pointers or return addresses.
Impact: Application crash, arbitrary code execution, data corruption.
Affected LVGL Component: String handling functions within core modules like `lv_label`, `lv_textarea`, `lv_btnmatrix`, and potentially other widgets that display text.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Thoroughly review code using LVGL string APIs for potential buffer overflows.
    * Use safe string handling functions where possible.
    * Enable compiler-based buffer overflow detection during development and testing (e.g., AddressSanitizer).
    * Regularly update LVGL to the latest version with security patches.

## Threat: [Heap Overflow in Image Decoding](./threats/heap_overflow_in_image_decoding.md)

Description: An attacker provides a maliciously crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPG, BMP) to be displayed by LVGL (e.g., using `lv_image_set_src`). If the image decoding library used by LVGL (either built-in or external) has vulnerabilities, parsing the malicious image could cause a heap overflow. This allows an attacker to overwrite heap memory, potentially leading to code execution.
Impact: Application crash, arbitrary code execution.
Affected LVGL Component: Image handling module (`lv_image`), image decoding functions (potentially within `lv_draw_img` or external image libraries).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Identify and audit the image decoding libraries used by LVGL.
    * Keep image decoding libraries updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    * Consider using safer image formats or libraries if security is critical.
    * Implement input validation on image files before processing them with LVGL, checking for file type and basic sanity.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free in Object Management](./threats/use-after-free_in_object_management.md)

Description: Due to errors in LVGL's object lifecycle management (creation, deletion, event handling), a dangling pointer might be created. If this dangling pointer is later dereferenced after the memory it points to has been freed, it can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker might trigger specific sequences of UI interactions or events to exploit such vulnerabilities, potentially gaining control of program execution.
Impact: Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.
Affected LVGL Component: Core object management system (`lv_obj`, `lv_event`), memory management within LVGL.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Carefully review LVGL object creation, deletion, and event handling logic in the application code.
    * Utilize memory debugging tools (e.g., Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) during development and testing to detect use-after-free errors.
    * Report any potential memory management issues found in LVGL to the developers.
