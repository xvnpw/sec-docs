## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities in LVGL [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_in_lvgl__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious Input Data [HIGH_RISK_PATH]
    *   **Fuzzing Input Streams (Touch, Keyboard, Encoder) [HIGH_RISK_PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers use fuzzing tools to send a large volume of random or semi-random input data through LVGL's input channels (touch, keyboard, encoder, etc.). This aims to trigger unexpected behavior, crashes, or memory corruption in LVGL's input processing logic.
        *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application, potential information disclosure if crashes reveal sensitive data, or in rare cases, memory corruption that could be further exploited.
    *   **Crafted Input Payloads (Specific to Input Types) [HIGH_RISK_PATH]:**
        *   **Overflow in Text Input Fields [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** Attackers provide excessively long strings as input to text input fields in the UI. If LVGL or the application code doesn't properly handle string lengths, this can lead to buffer overflows, overwriting adjacent memory regions.
            *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, or in severe cases, Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE).

*   **Attack Vector:** Weaknesses in LVGL Input Processing Logic [CRITICAL_NODE] [HIGH_RISK_PATH]
    *   **Buffer Overflows in Input Buffers [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within LVGL's code that handles input data, specifically buffer overflows in internal buffers used to store and process input events. These overflows can occur if input data exceeds the allocated buffer size due to programming errors in LVGL.
        *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, or Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE).
    *   **Integer Overflows in Input Size Calculations [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Integer overflows in calculations related to input sizes within LVGL. If integer overflows are not properly handled, they can lead to incorrect buffer size calculations, resulting in buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues when processing input data.
        *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, or Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Management Vulnerabilities in LVGL [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_management_vulnerabilities_in_lvgl__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Memory Corruption [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]
    *   **Buffer Overflows in Rendering/Drawing Operations [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Buffer overflows occurring during LVGL's rendering and drawing operations. This can happen when drawing complex UI elements, handling images, rendering text, or performing other graphical operations if buffer sizes are not correctly managed or bounds checking is insufficient.
        *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, or Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE).
    *   **Heap Overflows in Object Allocation/Deallocation [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Heap overflows occurring during the allocation or deallocation of LVGL objects (widgets, styles, etc.). If there are vulnerabilities in LVGL's object management, attackers might be able to trigger heap overflows by manipulating object creation or destruction processes.
        *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, or Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE).
    *   **Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Use-after-free vulnerabilities arise when memory is accessed after it has been freed. In LVGL, this could occur if there are errors in object lifetime management, leading to dangling pointers that are later dereferenced.
        *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, or Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE).
    *   **Double-Free Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Double-free vulnerabilities occur when memory is freed multiple times. In LVGL, this could happen due to errors in object destruction paths or reference counting, leading to corruption of the heap metadata.
        *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom LVGL Integrations/Extensions [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_lvgl_integrationsextensions__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Insecure Custom Code [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Widgets [HIGH_RISK_PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Security flaws introduced in custom widgets developed specifically for the application using LVGL. Custom widgets might not undergo the same level of scrutiny as core LVGL components and could contain vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, logic errors, or injection flaws.
        *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the widget's functionality. Could range from Denial of Service (DoS) or UI manipulation to information disclosure or even Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) if the widget interacts with sensitive system resources.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Input Drivers [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities in custom input drivers implemented to handle specific input devices for LVGL. If custom input drivers are not securely implemented, they could be exploited to inject malicious input or cause system-level issues.
        *   **Impact:** Potentially high impact. If an attacker can compromise a custom input driver, they might gain control over the input stream and potentially the underlying system, leading to information disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), or even Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE).
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Rendering/Drawing Functions [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Security flaws in custom rendering or drawing functions added to LVGL to extend its graphical capabilities. If these custom functions are not implemented securely, they could introduce vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues during rendering.
        *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, or Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE).
