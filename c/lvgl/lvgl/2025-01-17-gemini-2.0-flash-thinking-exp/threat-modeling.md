# Threat Model Analysis for lvgl/lvgl

## Threat: [Input Injection](./threats/input_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides maliciously crafted input data through UI elements like text areas or sliders. LVGL's input handling logic might fail to properly sanitize or validate this input. The attacker might attempt to inject control characters, escape sequences, or overly long strings.

**Impact:**  The application could crash due to unexpected input, exhibit incorrect behavior, or potentially lead to memory corruption if the injected data overflows buffers. In some scenarios, it might be possible to influence internal state or trigger unintended actions.

**Affected Component:** `lv_indev` (Input Device Handling), specifically functions processing text input (`lv_textarea`), slider values (`lv_slider`), or other interactive elements.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received from user input fields before processing it with LVGL.
*   Use LVGL's built-in input filtering mechanisms where available.
*   Set maximum length limits for text inputs.
*   Carefully handle and escape special characters if they are allowed in input.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Complex UI Elements](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_complex_ui_elements.md)

**Description:** An attacker triggers the creation of an excessive number of UI objects or excessively complex UI structures (e.g., deeply nested containers, numerous animations). This could be done through specific user interactions or by exploiting application logic that dynamically creates UI elements based on external data.

**Impact:** The application consumes excessive memory and processing power, leading to performance degradation, crashes, or even system instability. This can effectively deny service or make the application unusable.

**Affected Component:** `lv_obj` (Object Management), `lv_mem` (Memory Management), specific widget creation functions (e.g., `lv_label_create`, `lv_container_create`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement limits on the number of dynamically created UI elements.
*   Use object reuse techniques where possible.
*   Avoid creating excessively deep or complex UI hierarchies.
*   Implement proper resource management and deallocation of unused objects.
*   Monitor memory usage and implement safeguards if memory consumption exceeds thresholds.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption through Malformed Images/Fonts](./threats/memory_corruption_through_malformed_imagesfonts.md)

**Description:** If the application allows loading external images or fonts that are then processed by LVGL, an attacker could provide maliciously crafted files. These files could exploit vulnerabilities in LVGL's image decoding or font rendering logic, leading to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.

**Impact:** Application crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution if the memory corruption is exploitable.

**Affected Component:** `lv_image` (Image Handling), `lv_font` (Font Handling), specific image decoder libraries integrated with LVGL (e.g., PNG, JPG decoders).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all external image and font files before loading them into LVGL.
*   Use trusted and well-maintained image and font decoding libraries.
*   Consider sandboxing or isolating the image/font loading and rendering process.
*   Implement error handling to gracefully handle invalid or corrupted files.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities](./threats/use-after-free_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Due to errors in LVGL's internal memory management, an object might be freed, and later the application attempts to access or manipulate that freed memory. This can occur due to incorrect object lifecycle management or race conditions within LVGL.

**Impact:** Application crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution if the freed memory is reallocated and contains attacker-controlled data.

**Affected Component:** `lv_obj` (Object Management), `lv_mem` (Memory Management), various widget and module-specific functions that handle object creation and deletion.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure proper object lifecycle management and avoid dangling pointers.
*   Carefully review code that handles object deletion and references.
*   Utilize memory debugging tools during development to identify potential use-after-free issues.
*   Keep LVGL updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Size or Coordinate Calculations](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_size_or_coordinate_calculations.md)

**Description:**  LVGL might perform calculations on sizes, coordinates, or other numerical values related to UI elements. If these calculations are not properly checked for overflows or underflows within LVGL's code, an attacker could provide input or trigger conditions that lead to unexpected results, potentially causing buffer overflows or other memory corruption.

**Impact:** Application crashes, incorrect UI rendering, potential for memory corruption.

**Affected Component:** Various modules involved in layout and rendering, including `lv_obj_pos`, `lv_obj_size`, and widget-specific drawing functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement bounds checking on numerical values used in size and coordinate calculations within the application logic interacting with LVGL.
*   Use data types that are large enough to prevent overflows in expected scenarios.
*   Carefully review arithmetic operations involving sizes and coordinates.
