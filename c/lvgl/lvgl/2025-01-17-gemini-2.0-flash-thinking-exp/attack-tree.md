## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using LVGL Weaknesses **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_lvgl_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

**1. Compromise Application Using LVGL Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]:**
* This is the root goal. Successful exploitation of any of the underlying vulnerabilities leads to this compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos___high-risk_path_start_.md)

**2. Cause Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:**
* **Objective:** To make the application unavailable to legitimate users.

    * **2.1. Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **2.1.1. Trigger Excessive Object Creation:**
            * **2.1.1.1. Send Malicious Input Causing Widget Spawning [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]:** An attacker sends crafted input (e.g., through a network connection or local interface) that exploits the application's logic to create an excessive number of LVGL widgets (buttons, labels, etc.). This rapidly consumes available memory, leading to application slowdown or a crash.
        * **2.1.2. Trigger Complex Rendering Operations:**
            * **2.1.2.1. Provide Malformed or Highly Complex Vector Graphics [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]:** The attacker provides specially crafted vector graphics data that is either malformed or extremely complex. When LVGL attempts to render this data, it consumes excessive CPU resources, potentially freezing the application or making it unresponsive.
        * **2.1.3. Flood with Malicious Input Events:**
            * **2.1.3.1. Simulate Rapid Touch/Key Events [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]:** The attacker sends a flood of simulated touch or key press events to the application's input queue. This overwhelms the application's event processing mechanism, making the UI unresponsive and potentially leading to a crash.
            * **2.1.3.2. Send Large Volume of Invalid Input Data [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]:** The attacker sends a large amount of invalid or unexpected input data. The application spends excessive time trying to process this invalid data, leading to CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness.

    * **2.2. Rendering Errors Leading to Crash:**
        * **2.2.1. Provide Invalid Image Data [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]:** The attacker provides a corrupted or malformed image file that the application attempts to load and display using LVGL. This can trigger errors in LVGL's image decoding or rendering process, leading to an application crash.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Control **[HIGH-RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_control__high-risk_path_start___critical_node_.md)

**3. Gain Unauthorized Control [HIGH-RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
* **Objective:** To gain unauthorized access to the application's functionality or data.

    * **3.1. Memory Corruption [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * While specific memory corruption attack steps are generally lower likelihood and higher effort, the potential impact of successful memory corruption (buffer overflows, heap overflows, use-after-free, integer overflows) is arbitrary code execution, making this a critical area. Exploiting vulnerabilities in image/font loading or text rendering within LVGL could lead to memory corruption.

    * **3.2. Logic Flaws:**
        * **3.2.1. State Manipulation:**
            * **3.2.1.1. Trigger Unexpected State Transitions via Malicious Input [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]:** The attacker sends specific input or triggers a sequence of events that forces the LVGL-based application into an unintended or invalid state. This can bypass security checks, unlock hidden functionality, or lead to exploitable conditions.
        * **3.2.2. Privilege Escalation (Less Likely, but Possible in Specific Integrations):**
            * **3.2.2.1. Bypass Access Controls Implemented Using LVGL Elements [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]:** The attacker exploits flaws in how access controls are implemented using LVGL elements (e.g., button visibility, enabled states). By manipulating the UI or sending specific events, they can bypass these controls and gain access to restricted features or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Display/Information **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_displayinformation__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**4. Manipulate Display/Information [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:**
* **Objective:** To alter the information displayed to the user or manipulate the user interface for malicious purposes.

    * **4.1. Data Injection:**
        * **4.1.1. Inject Malicious Text into Displayed Labels/Text Areas [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]:** The attacker provides malicious text input that is displayed by the application through LVGL labels or text areas. This can be used for phishing attacks, displaying misleading information, or defacing the UI.
        * **4.1.2. Display False Information to the User [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]:** The attacker exploits logic flaws or vulnerabilities to manipulate the data that is displayed to the user through LVGL elements, leading them to believe false information.

    * **4.2. UI Redressing/Clickjacking (Within the Application's UI):**
        * **4.2.1. Overlap UI Elements to Trick User into Unintended Actions [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]:** The attacker exploits layout vulnerabilities or uses techniques to overlap UI elements. This tricks the user into clicking on an unintended element, leading to actions they did not intend to perform.

    * **4.3. Resource Hijacking (Display Related):**
        * **4.3.1. Force Display of Malicious Images/Content [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities to force the application to display malicious images or other unwanted content through LVGL image widgets or similar elements.
        * **4.3.2. Consume Excessive Display Resources to Degrade Performance [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]:** The attacker manipulates the application to display a large number of graphical elements or complex animations, causing the UI to become slow and unresponsive, effectively a localized denial of service affecting the user experience.
