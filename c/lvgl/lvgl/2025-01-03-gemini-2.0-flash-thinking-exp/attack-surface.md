# Attack Surface Analysis for lvgl/lvgl

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Handling](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within image decoding libraries used by LVGL through crafted image files.
    *   **How LVGL Contributes:** LVGL utilizes image decoding libraries to display images. Vulnerabilities in these libraries directly impact LVGL's security when processing untrusted image data.
    *   **Example:** An application using LVGL displays a maliciously crafted PNG image, triggering a buffer overflow in the underlying PNG decoding library, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service (application crash).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure and up-to-date image decoding libraries. Ensure regular patching of these dependencies.
        *   Implement robust input validation on image files before decoding, verifying file headers and sizes against expected values.
        *   Consider sandboxing or isolating the image decoding process to limit the impact of potential exploits.
        *   Avoid displaying images from untrusted or unverified sources.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Font Handling](./attack_surfaces/malicious_font_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in font rendering engines used by LVGL through crafted font files.
    *   **How LVGL Contributes:** LVGL relies on font rendering engines to display text. Malicious font files can trigger vulnerabilities within these engines when LVGL attempts to render text.
    *   **Example:** An application renders text using a custom font provided by an untrusted source. The font file is crafted to exploit a buffer overflow in the font rendering engine, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service (application crash).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Employ secure and up-to-date font rendering libraries.
        *   Restrict the sources of font files to trusted locations or bundle them directly with the application.
        *   Implement validation checks on font files before using them for rendering.
        *   Consider using simpler, well-vetted font formats if security is a primary concern.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Management Errors within LVGL](./attack_surfaces/memory_management_errors_within_lvgl.md)

*   **Description:**  Presence of bugs within LVGL's internal memory management leading to vulnerabilities such as memory leaks, double frees, or use-after-free errors.
    *   **How LVGL Contributes:** As a complex graphical library, LVGL manages memory for UI objects and internal data structures. Errors in this memory management directly introduce security vulnerabilities within the library itself.
    *   **Example:** A specific sequence of UI object creation and deletion triggers a bug within LVGL, leading to a double-free vulnerability that can be exploited for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service due to memory corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Consistently use the latest stable version of LVGL to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the development team.
        *   Report any suspected memory management issues or crashes to the LVGL development team with detailed reproduction steps.
        *   While developers cannot directly fix internal LVGL bugs, staying updated is the primary mitigation. Consider contributing to the project by reporting and helping to identify such issues.
