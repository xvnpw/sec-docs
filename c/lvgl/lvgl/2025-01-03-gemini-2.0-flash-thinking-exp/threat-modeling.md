# Threat Model Analysis for lvgl/lvgl

## Threat: [Malformed Input to Text Area](./threats/malformed_input_to_text_area.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides excessively long strings or strings containing special characters to an `lv_textarea` widget. This could potentially overflow internal buffers *within LVGL* when processing or rendering the text.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential memory corruption if the overflow is exploitable.
    *   **Affected Component:** `lv_textarea` module, specifically the text rendering and buffer management functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement input sanitization and validation on the application side *before* passing data to `lv_textarea`.
        *   Limit the maximum length of text accepted by the `lv_textarea` using `lv_textarea_set_max_length`.
        *   Consider using LVGL's built-in input filtering mechanisms where available.

## Threat: [Malicious Font File Leading to Crash](./threats/malicious_font_file_leading_to_crash.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted font file to be used by LVGL. Vulnerabilities in the font parsing or rendering logic *within LVGL or its underlying font libraries* could be exploited, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for remote code execution if the vulnerability is severe.
    *   **Affected Component:** Font handling within LVGL, potentially the `lv_font` module and any underlying font rendering libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use trusted and verified font files.
        *   If loading fonts dynamically, implement strict validation of the font files before using them.
        *   Keep LVGL and its dependencies updated to patch any known vulnerabilities in font handling.

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability in Logging (If Enabled)](./threats/format_string_vulnerability_in_logging_(if_enabled).md)

*   **Description:** If LVGL's logging functionality is enabled and accepts user-controlled input as part of the log message format, an attacker could inject format string specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`) to read from arbitrary memory locations or potentially write to them *within the LVGL process*.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** LVGL's logging mechanism (if enabled), specifically the functions responsible for formatting log messages.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-controlled input directly in log message formats.
        *   Sanitize any user-provided data before including it in log messages.
        *   If possible, disable or restrict the use of LVGL's logging functionality in production environments if it's not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free in Event Handling](./threats/use-after-free_in_event_handling.md)

*   **Description:** A race condition or flaw *within LVGL's event handling logic* could lead to a situation where an object is freed while its event handler is still being executed, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** LVGL's event handling mechanism (`lv_event_send`, `lv_obj_add_event_cb`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design and review event handling logic to avoid race conditions and ensure proper object lifecycle management.
        *   Utilize memory safety tools and techniques during development to detect use-after-free errors.
        *   Keep LVGL updated as newer versions may contain fixes for such issues.
