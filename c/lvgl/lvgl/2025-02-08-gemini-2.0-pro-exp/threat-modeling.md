# Threat Model Analysis for lvgl/lvgl

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Image Decoding](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_image_decoding.md)

*   **Threat:** Buffer Overflow in Image Decoding

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a maliciously crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPG, BMP, or a custom format if using a custom decoder) that, when decoded by LVGL's image handling functions, causes a buffer overflow. The attacker crafts the image with dimensions or data structures that exceed the allocated buffer size. This could be triggered through a file upload (if the device supports it), a network transfer, or even by loading an image from external storage.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution with the application's privileges, leading to complete system compromise. Data corruption, denial of service.
    *   **LVGL Component Affected:**
        *   `lv_img_decoder` module.
        *   Specific decoder functions (e.g., `lv_img_decoder_open`, functions within decoder implementations for PNG, JPG, etc.).
        *   Custom image decoders integrated with LVGL (although this is partly application responsibility, the vulnerability exists *because* of the integration with LVGL's image handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Built-in Decoders with Caution:** Prefer LVGL's built-in decoders (if available for the required format) as they are more likely to have undergone security review. However, *still* validate their safety.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Thoroughly fuzz test *all* image decoders (built-in and custom) with a wide range of malformed and edge-case image files.
        *   **Input Validation:** Before passing image data to the decoder, validate the image dimensions and other header information to ensure they are within reasonable bounds and consistent with the image format.
        *   **Memory Protection:** Use an MPU/MMU to isolate the memory used by the image decoder.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to detect potential buffer overflows in the decoder code.
        *   **Limit Image Size:** Enforce maximum image dimensions and file sizes at the application level.
        *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** If possible, run the image decoder in a separate, isolated process or sandbox with limited privileges.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Widget Layout Calculations](./threats/integer_overflow_in_widget_layout_calculations.md)

*   **Threat:** Integer Overflow in Widget Layout Calculations

    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates input parameters (e.g., widget sizes, positions, padding) to trigger integer overflows during layout calculations within LVGL. This could occur through malicious input events, manipulated configuration data, or even through unexpected interactions between widgets. For example, setting extremely large or negative values for dimensions.
    *   **Impact:** Unpredictable UI behavior, potential memory corruption (if the overflow affects memory allocation), denial of service, and potentially (though less likely) code execution.
    *   **LVGL Component Affected:**
        *   `lv_obj_...` functions related to size and position (e.g., `lv_obj_set_width`, `lv_obj_set_height`, `lv_obj_set_pos`).
        *   Layout managers (e.g., `lv_layout_flex`, `lv_layout_grid`).
        *   Style handling functions (e.g., those related to padding and margins).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Strictly validate and sanitize all input values that affect widget dimensions, positions, and layout parameters. Reject unreasonable values.
        *   **Defensive Programming:** Use checked arithmetic operations (e.g., functions that detect and handle integer overflows) within custom widgets and layout calculations.  LVGL itself should ideally incorporate these checks.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools that can detect potential integer overflows.
        *   **Limit Maximum Sizes:** Define and enforce maximum sizes and positions for widgets at the application level.
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review all code that performs arithmetic operations on widget dimensions and positions.

## Threat: [Font Handling Vulnerabilities (Custom Fonts)](./threats/font_handling_vulnerabilities__custom_fonts_.md)

*   **Threat:** Font Handling Vulnerabilities (Custom Fonts)

    *   **Description:** If using custom fonts (especially TrueType/OpenType fonts), vulnerabilities in the font rendering engine (which may be a third-party library integrated with LVGL, *but accessed through LVGL's API*) could be exploited by providing a maliciously crafted font file. This is similar to the image decoding threat but applies to fonts.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, denial of service, data corruption.
    *   **LVGL Component Affected:**
        *   `lv_font` module.
        *   External font rendering libraries (e.g., FreeType) *as used through LVGL's interfaces*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Well-Vetted Font Libraries:** If using an external font rendering library, choose a well-maintained and security-audited library (e.g., a recent version of FreeType). Ensure LVGL is configured to use a secure version.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz test the font rendering engine (as exposed through LVGL) with malformed font files.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the font file header and other metadata before loading it *through LVGL's API*.
        *   **Memory Protection:** Use an MPU/MMU to isolate the memory used by the font rendering engine.
        *   **Limit Font Features:** If possible, disable or restrict the use of complex font features that are more likely to be vulnerable, configuring this within LVGL's font handling.
        *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Run the font rendering engine in a separate, isolated process (this would likely require significant modification to LVGL's integration).
