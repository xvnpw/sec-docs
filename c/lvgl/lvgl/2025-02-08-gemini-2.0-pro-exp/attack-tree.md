# Attack Tree Analysis for lvgl/lvgl

Objective: To gain unauthorized control over the device's display and/or input, leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially execution of arbitrary code within the context of the LVGL application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via LVGL](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_lvgl.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Memory Exhaustion/Corruption

    *   **High-Risk Path:**
        *   **Large Allocation Requests:**
            *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that causes LVGL to allocate excessively large buffers or objects. This could be through a compromised input device, a network interface (if LVGL is used in a networked context), or exploiting a vulnerability in input handling.
            *   **Example:** Sending a specially crafted string or image data that results in an attempt to allocate a buffer larger than available memory.
            *   **Mitigation:** Strict input validation with size limits and sanity checks. Resource limits on LVGL's memory allocation, if possible.

        *   **Unfreed Memory (Leaks):**
            *   **Description:** Repeatedly triggering actions that allocate memory within LVGL without properly freeing it. This leads to a gradual depletion of available memory.
            *   **Example:** Rapidly creating and destroying many LVGL objects without proper cleanup in a loop.
            *   **Mitigation:** Careful memory management in custom widget code and application logic. Use memory leak detection tools during development.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via LVGL](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_lvgl.md)

*    **High-Risk Path:**
    *   **Displaying Debug Info:**
        *   **Description:** If debug features are accidentally left enabled in a production build, LVGL might render internal data structures, memory addresses, or other sensitive information on the screen.
        *   **Example:** `LV_USE_DEBUG` or `LV_LOG_LEVEL` are set to levels that expose internal information.
        *   **Mitigation:** Ensure all LVGL debug features are disabled in production builds.

*   **High-Risk Path:**
    *   **Exposing Internal Data Structures:**
        *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in drawing functions, especially custom drawing functions, could allow an attacker to read arbitrary memory locations and potentially leak sensitive data.
        *   **Example:** A custom drawing function with a buffer overflow vulnerability that allows reading beyond the intended bounds.
        *   **Mitigation:** Secure coding practices when implementing custom drawing functions. Avoid unsafe functions and pointer arithmetic without proper bounds checking.

## Attack Tree Path: [Arbitrary Code/Command Execution (within LVGL context)](./attack_tree_paths/arbitrary_codecommand_execution__within_lvgl_context_.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Buffer Overflow/Underflow

    *   **High-Risk Path:**
        *   **Heap-based Overflow:**
            *   **Description:** A vulnerability in LVGL's memory management or custom widget code allows writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. This can overwrite adjacent data structures, potentially leading to code execution.
            *   **Example:** A custom widget that uses `lv_mem_alloc` to allocate a buffer, but then writes beyond the allocated size due to incorrect input handling.
            *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous input validation. Use safe string handling functions. Enable compiler warnings and use static analysis tools. Consider memory protection mechanisms (ASLR, DEP/NX).

        *   **Stack-based Overflow:**
            *   **Description:** Similar to heap-based overflows, but targeting the stack. Less likely in LVGL itself, but possible in custom widget code with large local variables or unchecked recursion.
            *   **Example:** A custom widget with a recursive function that doesn't properly check for stack overflow conditions.
            *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous input validation. Avoid large local variables and unchecked recursion. Enable compiler warnings and use static analysis tools.
