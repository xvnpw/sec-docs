# Attack Surface Analysis for lvgl/lvgl

## Attack Surface: [Image Decoding Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_decoding_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries used by LVGL to process image data.

**How LVGL Contributes:** LVGL relies on external libraries or user-provided decoders for image processing (PNG, JPG, BMP, GIF, SVG, etc.). LVGL *calls* these decoders and uses their output, making it a direct conduit for exploits if the decoder is vulnerable.  The vulnerability is *in* the decoder, but LVGL's usage is the attack vector.

**Example:** A crafted PNG image with a malformed chunk exploits a buffer overflow in libpng (used by LVGL's default PNG decoder), leading to arbitrary code execution.  LVGL's attempt to display the image triggers the vulnerability.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability and decoder used).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Well-Vetted Libraries:** Employ only well-known and actively maintained image decoding libraries (e.g., libpng, libjpeg-turbo).
    *   **Keep Libraries Updated:** Regularly update image decoding libraries to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Conduct fuzz testing on the image decoders used by the application, specifically targeting the integration with LVGL's image handling.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate image decoding in a separate process or sandbox to limit the impact of a successful exploit. This is crucial.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (memory, CPU time) for image decoding to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Font Rendering Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/font_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the font rendering engine used by LVGL to display text.

**How LVGL Contributes:** LVGL uses external font rendering libraries (like FreeType) or custom rendering routines. LVGL *calls* the font rendering engine to generate glyphs, making it directly vulnerable to exploits targeting the engine.

**Example:** A specially crafted TrueType font file exploits a vulnerability in FreeType, causing a buffer overflow when LVGL attempts to render text using that font. LVGL's text rendering function triggers the vulnerability.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability and font engine).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Well-Vetted Libraries:** Use a reputable and actively maintained font rendering library (e.g., FreeType).
    *   **Keep Libraries Updated:** Regularly update the font rendering library to the latest version.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Perform fuzz testing on the font rendering engine with various font files, specifically testing LVGL's text rendering functions.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Consider isolating font rendering in a separate process (if feasible). This is a strong mitigation.
    *   **Font Source Validation:** If fonts are loaded from external sources, validate the source and integrity of the font files *before* passing them to LVGL.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Drawing (lv_draw) Errors](./attack_surfaces/custom_drawing__lv_draw__errors.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities introduced by developers when implementing custom drawing functions using LVGL's `lv_draw` API.

**How LVGL Contributes:** LVGL *provides* the `lv_draw` API, which gives developers direct access to the display buffer.  This is an LVGL-specific feature, and errors in using this API are directly related to LVGL's design.

**Example:** A custom drawing function incorrectly calculates buffer offsets, leading to an out-of-bounds write that corrupts memory. This occurs within the LVGL drawing context.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Bounds Checking:**  Thoroughly validate all parameters and perform rigorous bounds checking within custom drawing functions to ensure that all drawing operations stay within the allocated buffer. This is paramount.
    *   **Memory Safety:** If possible, use a memory-safe language (e.g., Rust) for custom drawing code that interacts with the LVGL API.
    *   **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of custom drawing functions, focusing on memory safety.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz test custom drawing functions with various inputs and parameters, specifically targeting the interaction with LVGL's drawing buffer.
    *   **Avoid Complexity:** Keep custom drawing functions as simple as possible to reduce the risk of errors.

## Attack Surface: [File System Access (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/file_system_access__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from LVGL's ability to access the file system (e.g., to load images or fonts), if not configured securely.

**How LVGL Contributes:** LVGL *provides the functionality* to load resources from the file system. While the application configures *how* this is used, the *capability* itself is part of LVGL.

**Example:** An application uses LVGL to load images, and LVGL is configured to access a directory. If the application doesn't sanitize the paths used *within LVGL*, an attacker could provide a path traversal payload (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`) to access sensitive system files *through LVGL's file loading mechanism*.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized file access, potential code execution (if an attacker can overwrite executable files).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the level of access and the system's configuration).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Path Validation:**  Rigorously validate and sanitize all file paths *within the LVGL configuration and usage*. Use a whitelist approach to allow access only to specific directories and files. This is crucial, even if the application *thinks* it's validating paths; LVGL needs its own validation.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application (and therefore LVGL) with the least necessary file system privileges.
    *   **Chroot Jail/Sandboxing:** Consider using a chroot jail or other sandboxing techniques to limit LVGL's file system access. This is a strong mitigation.
    *   **Avoid User-Controlled Paths:** Avoid using user-provided input directly as file paths *within the LVGL configuration*. If necessary, map user input to a predefined set of allowed paths *before* passing them to LVGL.
