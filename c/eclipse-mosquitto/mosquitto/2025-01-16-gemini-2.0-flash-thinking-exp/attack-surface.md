# Attack Surface Analysis for eclipse-mosquitto/mosquitto

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to MQTT Broker](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_mqtt_broker.md)

*   **Description:** The MQTT broker allows connections without requiring any authentication.
    *   **How Mosquitto Contributes:** Mosquitto's configuration allows disabling authentication, making it open to any connecting client.
    *   **Example:** An attacker connects to the broker and subscribes to sensitive topics, intercepting real-time data. They could also publish malicious messages to control devices or disrupt operations.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of data confidentiality and integrity. Unauthorized control over connected devices. Potential for service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable Authentication: Configure Mosquitto to require username/password authentication for all connections.
        *   Use Strong Credentials: Enforce strong, unique passwords for all MQTT clients.
        *   Consider Client Certificates: Implement TLS client certificate authentication for stronger verification.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Authentication Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_authentication_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** The MQTT broker uses easily guessable or default usernames and passwords.
    *   **How Mosquitto Contributes:** Mosquitto relies on the configured authentication mechanism (e.g., password file, database) and the strength of the credentials stored there.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses common default credentials or brute-force techniques to gain access to the broker.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the broker, leading to potential data breaches, manipulation, and service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce Strong Password Policies: Require complex and unique passwords for all MQTT clients.
        *   Regularly Rotate Credentials: Periodically change MQTT client credentials.
        *   Avoid Default Credentials: Never use default usernames or passwords provided in examples or documentation.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authorization Controls (ACLs)](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authorization_controls__acls_.md)

*   **Description:**  Even with authentication, clients have access to topics they shouldn't, allowing unauthorized data access or manipulation.
    *   **How Mosquitto Contributes:** Mosquitto's Access Control List (ACL) configuration determines which clients can publish or subscribe to specific topics. Inadequate configuration leads to over-permissive access.
    *   **Example:** A sensor client is able to publish commands to an actuator topic, potentially causing unintended or malicious actions. A low-privilege client can subscribe to administrative topics containing sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized control over devices, potential for service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement Granular ACLs: Define precise access rules for each client, limiting their publish and subscribe permissions to only necessary topics.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Grant clients the minimum necessary permissions to perform their intended functions.
        *   Regularly Review ACLs: Periodically audit and update ACL configurations to reflect changes in application requirements and client roles.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted MQTT Communication](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_mqtt_communication.md)

*   **Description:** MQTT communication occurs over plain TCP without encryption.
    *   **How Mosquitto Contributes:** Mosquitto listens on port 1883 by default, which is for unencrypted communication.
    *   **Example:** An attacker eavesdrops on network traffic and intercepts sensitive data being transmitted between clients and the broker, including credentials or sensor readings.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of data confidentiality. Potential exposure of authentication credentials.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS Encryption: Configure Mosquitto to use TLS encryption for all MQTT connections, typically on port 8883.
        *   Force TLS Connections: Disable or restrict access to the unencrypted port (1883).
        *   Use Secure WebSockets (WSS): If using WebSockets, ensure connections are over WSS (secure WebSockets).

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of MQTT Ports to the Public Internet](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_mqtt_ports_to_the_public_internet.md)

*   **Description:** The MQTT broker's ports (1883, 8883, 9001, etc.) are directly accessible from the public internet.
    *   **How Mosquitto Contributes:** By default, Mosquitto listens on all network interfaces, making it potentially accessible from anywhere.
    *   **Example:** Attackers can directly connect to the broker from the internet and attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, brute-force credentials, or launch denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Increased risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Firewalls: Implement firewall rules to restrict access to the MQTT ports to only trusted networks or IP addresses.
        *   Network Segmentation: Isolate the MQTT broker within a private network segment.
        *   VPN or SSH Tunneling: Require clients to connect through a VPN or SSH tunnel for an added layer of security.

## Attack Surface: [Malformed MQTT Packets](./attack_surfaces/malformed_mqtt_packets.md)

*   **Description:** Sending specially crafted or malformed MQTT packets can exploit vulnerabilities in the broker's parsing logic.
    *   **How Mosquitto Contributes:** Mosquitto is responsible for parsing and processing incoming MQTT packets. Vulnerabilities in this process can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a malformed PUBLISH packet that triggers a buffer overflow in the Mosquitto broker, potentially leading to a crash or even remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Mosquitto Updated: Regularly update Mosquitto to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Input Validation: Implement input validation on the client-side to prevent the creation of malformed packets.
        *   Consider Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): These systems can detect and potentially block malicious MQTT traffic.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Mosquitto Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_mosquitto_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in custom or third-party Mosquitto plugins can introduce new attack vectors.
    *   **How Mosquitto Contributes:** Mosquitto's plugin architecture allows extending its functionality, but poorly written plugins can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A custom authentication plugin has a vulnerability that allows bypassing the authentication process. A third-party bridge plugin has a buffer overflow that can be triggered by a specially crafted message.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the plugin vulnerability, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Can be Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Plugin Development Practices: Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Mosquitto plugins.
        *   Thoroughly Vetting Third-Party Plugins: Carefully evaluate the security of third-party plugins before using them. Check for updates and known vulnerabilities.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins: Grant plugins only the necessary permissions.
