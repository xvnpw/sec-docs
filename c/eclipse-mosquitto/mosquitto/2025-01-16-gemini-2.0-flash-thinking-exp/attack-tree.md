## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mosquitto Weakness -> Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws -> Exploit Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mosquitto_weakness_-_exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws_-_exploit_default_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to log in to the Mosquitto broker using the default username and password. If these credentials have not been changed, the attacker gains full access to the broker.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the Mosquitto broker, allowing the attacker to publish, subscribe, and manage topics, potentially disrupting service, accessing sensitive data, or injecting malicious messages.
*   **Likelihood:** High, as many deployments fail to change default credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mosquitto Weakness -> Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws -> Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Unencrypted Connection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mosquitto_weakness_-_exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws_-_man-in-the-middle_attack_on_74592cb8.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If TLS encryption is not enabled for Mosquitto connections, an attacker positioned on the network can intercept the communication between clients (including the application) and the broker. This allows them to steal login credentials during the authentication process.
*   **Impact:** Compromised credentials allow the attacker to authenticate as a legitimate client, gaining unauthorized access to publish, subscribe, and manage topics.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium, depending on whether TLS is enforced.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mosquitto Weakness -> Exploit Message Handling Vulnerabilities -> Publish Malicious Payloads -> Application Vulnerable to Payload Content -> Inject Code via MQTT Message](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mosquitto_weakness_-_exploit_message_handling_vulnerabilities_-_publish_malicious_payloads_-_c49ac781.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker publishes a crafted MQTT message containing malicious code. If the application does not properly sanitize and validate the data received from the MQTT topic, it may interpret and execute the malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the application server, allowing the attacker to gain full control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium, depending on the application's input validation practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mosquitto Weakness -> Exploit MQTT Protocol Weaknesses -> Session Hijacking (If Sessions Not Properly Secured)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mosquitto_weakness_-_exploit_mqtt_protocol_weaknesses_-_session_hijacking__if_sessions_not_p_61d106da.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If session identifiers used by the MQTT protocol are not properly secured (e.g., transmitted over an unencrypted connection or using weak generation methods), an attacker can steal a valid session identifier and use it to impersonate a legitimate client.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can perform actions as the hijacked client, potentially publishing malicious messages or accessing sensitive data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium, depending on the security of session management.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Relies on Compromised Mosquitto Data/Functionality -> Application Processes Malicious Data from Mosquitto](./attack_tree_paths/application_relies_on_compromised_mosquitto_datafunctionality_-_application_processes_malicious_data_cddbfa51.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** After compromising the Mosquitto broker through other means, the attacker publishes malicious data to topics that the application subscribes to. If the application trusts the data from the broker without proper validation, it will process the malicious data, leading to a compromise.
*   **Impact:** Can range from application logic errors and data corruption to remote code execution, depending on how the application processes the malicious data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium, assuming the broker can be compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This represents a category of attacks that bypass the security measures designed to control access to the Mosquitto broker. Successful exploitation grants the attacker unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the Mosquitto broker, leading to various potential compromises.
*   **Likelihood:** Varies depending on the specific flaw.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** As described in the High-Risk Paths.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the Mosquitto broker.
*   **Likelihood:** High.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_bypass_vulnerability__cves_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known security vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in Mosquitto's authentication mechanism to bypass the login process entirely.
*   **Impact:** Complete and immediate unauthorized access to the Mosquitto broker.
*   **Likelihood:** Low, as it depends on unpatched systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Publish Malicious Payloads -> Application Vulnerable to Payload Content -> Inject Code via MQTT Message](./attack_tree_paths/publish_malicious_payloads_-_application_vulnerable_to_payload_content_-_inject_code_via_mqtt_messag_30a00356.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** As described in the High-Risk Paths.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the application server.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Broker Vulnerabilities -> Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_broker_vulnerabilities_-_remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known security vulnerabilities in the Mosquitto broker software that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the broker.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the Mosquitto broker server, potentially allowing the attacker to compromise other services on the same server or pivot to other parts of the network.
*   **Likelihood:** Low, as it depends on unpatched systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Broker Vulnerabilities -> Configuration File Manipulation (If Accessible)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_broker_vulnerabilities_-_configuration_file_manipulation__if_accessible_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the attacker gains access to the server hosting the Mosquitto broker, they might be able to modify the broker's configuration file. This could allow them to change authentication settings, grant themselves administrative privileges, or disrupt the broker's operation.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the broker's configuration and behavior, potentially leading to complete compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Low, as it requires server access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Relies on Compromised Mosquitto Data/Functionality -> Application Credentials Stored on or Accessible via Compromised Broker](./attack_tree_paths/application_relies_on_compromised_mosquitto_datafunctionality_-_application_credentials_stored_on_or_05872b88.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application stores its own credentials or other sensitive information within the Mosquitto broker's configuration or in a way that becomes accessible if the broker is compromised, an attacker who gains control of the broker can retrieve these credentials.
*   **Impact:** Access to sensitive application credentials, potentially allowing the attacker to compromise the application directly or access other related systems.
*   **Likelihood:** Low, depending on credential management practices.
