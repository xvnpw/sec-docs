## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Application Credentials Stored on Compromised Mosquitto Broker

This document provides a deep analysis of a specific attack tree path identified for an application utilizing the Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT broker. The analysis aims to understand the attack vector, potential impact, likelihood, and recommend mitigation strategies.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path: **"Application Relies on Compromised Mosquitto Data/Functionality -> Application Credentials Stored on or Accessible via Compromised Broker"**. This involves understanding how an attacker could exploit a compromised Mosquitto broker to gain access to sensitive application credentials, the potential consequences of such an attack, and strategies to prevent and detect it.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where application credentials or sensitive information required for application functionality are stored on or become accessible through a compromised Mosquitto broker. The scope includes:

*   **The Mosquitto broker:** Its configuration files, data storage mechanisms, and access control features.
*   **The application:** Its interaction with the Mosquitto broker, including how it authenticates and potentially stores sensitive information.
*   **The attacker:** Their potential methods for compromising the Mosquitto broker and accessing stored credentials.

This analysis **excludes** other potential attack paths related to Mosquitto, such as denial-of-service attacks, message manipulation without credential access, or vulnerabilities within the application itself unrelated to broker compromise.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

**Attack Tree Path:** Application Relies on Compromised Mosquitto Data/Functionality -> Application Credentials Stored on or Accessible via Compromised Broker

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1. **Mosquitto Broker Compromise:** The attacker first needs to gain unauthorized access and control over the Mosquitto broker. This could be achieved through various means:
    *   **Exploiting vulnerabilities:**  Unpatched vulnerabilities in the Mosquitto software itself.
    *   **Weak credentials:**  Default or easily guessable passwords for the broker's administrative interface or access control lists (ACLs).
    *   **Insider threat:**  Malicious actions by an authorized user.
    *   **Network compromise:**  Gaining access to the network where the Mosquitto broker is hosted and then pivoting to the broker.
    *   **Supply chain attack:** Compromise of a dependency or plugin used by Mosquitto.

2. **Access to Stored Credentials:** Once the broker is compromised, the attacker can attempt to locate and retrieve application credentials. This assumes the application, either intentionally or unintentionally, stores these credentials in a location accessible upon broker compromise. Potential locations include:
    *   **Mosquitto Configuration Files:**  If the application's authentication details are directly embedded within `mosquitto.conf` or related configuration files. This is a highly insecure practice.
    *   **Custom Authentication Plugins:** If the application uses a custom authentication plugin for Mosquitto, the plugin's code or configuration might store credentials.
    *   **Mosquitto Persistence Database:** If the application stores credentials as MQTT retained messages or within a database integrated with Mosquitto (if such integration exists and is used for this purpose).
    *   **Accessible File System:** If the application stores credentials in files on the same system as the Mosquitto broker and the attacker gains file system access through the broker compromise.
    *   **Environment Variables (if accessible):** In some scenarios, environment variables might be accessible from the compromised broker's context.

**Threat Actor Profiling:**

The attacker could be:

*   **External Malicious Actor:** Motivated by financial gain, data theft, or disruption of service. They would likely employ various techniques to exploit vulnerabilities and gain access.
*   **Disgruntled Insider:**  An individual with legitimate access who abuses their privileges for malicious purposes.
*   **Nation-State Actor:**  Highly sophisticated attackers with advanced capabilities and resources, potentially targeting critical infrastructure or sensitive data.

**Technical Analysis:**

*   **Mosquitto Security Features:**  Mosquitto offers features like TLS encryption for communication, username/password authentication, and ACLs for topic-based access control. However, these features are only effective if properly configured and maintained.
*   **Application Authentication Methods:**  The application's method of authenticating with the broker is crucial. Using strong, unique credentials and avoiding storing them directly on the broker are essential.
*   **Data Persistence in Mosquitto:** Understanding how Mosquitto stores persistent data (retained messages, subscriptions) is important to assess potential credential storage locations.

**Impact Assessment:**

The impact of a successful attack could be severe:

*   **Full Application Compromise:** Access to application credentials could allow the attacker to impersonate the application, perform unauthorized actions, access sensitive data managed by the application, or even take complete control of the application.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised application credentials could potentially be used to access other related systems or services that the application interacts with.
*   **Data Breach:**  If the application handles sensitive data, the attacker could gain access to and exfiltrate this information.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach of this nature can severely damage the reputation of both the application and the organization.
*   **Financial Losses:**  Recovery from a security incident, potential fines, and loss of business can result in significant financial losses.

**Likelihood Assessment:**

The likelihood of this attack path depends heavily on the application's and the broker's security posture:

*   **Low:** If the application employs strong credential management practices, such as not storing credentials directly on the broker, using secure storage mechanisms, and implementing robust authentication methods. If the Mosquitto broker is properly secured with strong passwords, up-to-date software, and restrictive ACLs, the likelihood of compromise is lower.
*   **Medium:** If the application stores credentials in a way that could be accessible upon broker compromise (e.g., in configuration files without proper encryption) and the broker has some security measures in place but might have weaknesses (e.g., default passwords not changed).
*   **High:** If the application directly embeds credentials in the broker's configuration or uses weak authentication, and the broker has significant security vulnerabilities or is poorly configured.

**Mitigation Strategy Development:**

To mitigate the risk associated with this attack path, the following strategies should be implemented:

*   **Secure Credential Management:**
    *   **Never store application credentials directly within the Mosquitto broker's configuration files.**
    *   Utilize secure credential storage mechanisms, such as dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) or encrypted configuration files accessed by the application.
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege for application access to the broker.
    *   Rotate application credentials regularly.
*   **Broker Hardening:**
    *   **Keep Mosquitto software up-to-date:** Patch vulnerabilities promptly.
    *   **Use strong, unique passwords for all administrative accounts and broker authentication.**
    *   **Implement robust Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Restrict topic access based on user or application identity.
    *   **Disable unnecessary features and plugins.**
    *   **Secure the broker's network environment:** Use firewalls and network segmentation to limit access to the broker.
    *   **Enable TLS encryption for all communication between clients and the broker.**
    *   **Regularly review and audit broker configurations and access logs.**
*   **Application Security Best Practices:**
    *   **Avoid storing sensitive information on the broker unless absolutely necessary and with appropriate security measures.**
    *   Use secure authentication methods for the application's connection to the broker (e.g., client certificates).
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks that could potentially lead to credential exposure.
*   **Monitoring and Detection:**
    *   **Monitor Mosquitto broker logs for suspicious activity:**  Failed login attempts, unauthorized topic subscriptions, unusual message patterns.
    *   **Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect potential broker compromises.**
    *   **Set up alerts for critical security events related to the broker.**
*   **Incident Response Plan:**
    *   Develop a clear incident response plan to address potential broker compromises and credential leaks.
    *   Regularly test and update the incident response plan.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path where application credentials are accessible via a compromised Mosquitto broker poses a significant risk. While the likelihood can be managed through robust security practices, the potential impact of a successful attack is severe. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack vector and ensure the security of the application and its data. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are crucial to maintain a strong security posture.
