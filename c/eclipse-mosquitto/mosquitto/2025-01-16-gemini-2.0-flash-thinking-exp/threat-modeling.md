# Threat Model Analysis for eclipse-mosquitto/mosquitto

## Threat: [Anonymous Access Exploitation](./threats/anonymous_access_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker connects to the Mosquitto broker without providing any credentials (if anonymous access is enabled). They might then subscribe to sensitive topics to eavesdrop on communications or publish malicious messages to disrupt operations or manipulate data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data transmitted via MQTT, potential for data manipulation leading to incorrect application state or actions, disruption of service by publishing unwanted messages.
*   **Affected Component:** `Listener` configuration in `mosquitto.conf`, specifically the `allow_anonymous` setting.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable anonymous access by setting `allow_anonymous false` in the `mosquitto.conf` file.
    *   Implement authentication mechanisms such as username/password or TLS client certificates.

## Threat: [Weak Password Authentication Brute-Force](./threats/weak_password_authentication_brute-force.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to guess usernames and passwords through repeated login attempts to gain access to the Mosquitto broker. This is especially effective if weak or default passwords are used.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the broker, allowing the attacker to subscribe to topics and read messages, publish malicious messages, or potentially reconfigure the broker if administrative credentials are compromised.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication module, specifically the password checking mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for MQTT users.
    *   Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts (can be done via plugins or external authentication mechanisms).
    *   Consider using more secure authentication methods like TLS client certificates.
    *   Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Lack of TLS Encryption (Man-in-the-Middle Attack)](./threats/lack_of_tls_encryption__man-in-the-middle_attack_.md)

**Description:** Communication between MQTT clients and the broker is not encrypted using TLS. An attacker positioned on the network can intercept and read MQTT messages, potentially exposing sensitive data. They could also modify messages in transit.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted via MQTT, potential for data manipulation leading to incorrect application state or actions, compromise of credentials if transmitted in plaintext.
*   **Affected Component:** `Listener` configuration in `mosquitto.conf`, specifically the TLS settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS encryption for all listeners in the `mosquitto.conf` file.
    *   Configure the broker to require TLS connections.
    *   Ensure clients are configured to use TLS when connecting to the broker.

## Threat: [Insecure Access Control Lists (ACLs)](./threats/insecure_access_control_lists__acls_.md)

**Description:** ACLs are not properly configured, granting excessive permissions to certain users or clients. An attacker exploiting a vulnerability in a client or with compromised credentials could gain access to topics they shouldn't have access to, potentially reading sensitive data or publishing malicious messages.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential for unauthorized data modification or deletion, disruption of service by publishing unwanted messages on critical topics.
*   **Affected Component:** Authorization module, specifically the ACL configuration (often in `mosquitto.conf` or a separate ACL file).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege when configuring ACLs.
    *   Regularly review and audit ACL configurations.
    *   Use more specific topic filters in ACLs instead of wildcards where possible.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_connection_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the Mosquitto broker with a large number of connection requests, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable to legitimate clients.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of application functionality relying on MQTT communication, potential for service outage.
*   **Affected Component:** Connection handling module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure connection limits in `mosquitto.conf` (e.g., `max_connections`).
    *   Implement rate limiting on connection attempts (can be done via external firewalls or load balancers).
    *   Monitor broker resource usage for unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Message Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_message_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker publishes a large volume of messages to the broker, potentially overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and making it unavailable.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of application functionality relying on MQTT communication, potential for service outage.
*   **Affected Component:** Message handling and queuing module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement message size limits in `mosquitto.conf` (`payload_size_limit`).
    *   Implement rate limiting on message publishing (can be done via plugins or external mechanisms).
    *   Monitor broker resource usage for unusual spikes.
    *   Implement topic-based access control to restrict who can publish to certain topics.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Mosquitto Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_mosquitto_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Mosquitto relies on various underlying libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries could be exploited to compromise the broker.
*   **Impact:** Various security vulnerabilities depending on the specific library vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Various modules depending on the vulnerable dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Mosquitto updated to the latest version, which includes updated dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in Mosquitto and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugins.md)

**Description:** If Mosquitto is using third-party plugins, these plugins could contain vulnerabilities or be intentionally malicious, potentially allowing an attacker to compromise the broker.
*   **Impact:** Various security vulnerabilities depending on the plugin, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Plugin interface and the specific plugin.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only use trusted and well-maintained plugins.
    *   Review the code of plugins before installing them if possible.
    *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions.
    *   Implement security scanning for plugins.
