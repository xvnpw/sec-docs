# Threat Model Analysis for eclipse-mosquitto/mosquitto

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Unencrypted Connection](./threats/man-in-the-middle_(mitm)_attack_on_unencrypted_connection.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between a client and the Mosquitto broker (or between brokers in a bridge scenario) when TLS is not used. They can eavesdrop, modify messages in transit, or impersonate either party.

**Impact:** Data breaches through eavesdropping, manipulation of data leading to incorrect application behavior, or complete compromise of communication channels.

**Affected Mosquitto Component:** Network Listener, Bridge (if applicable)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Enforce TLS Encryption:** Configure the `listener` section in `mosquitto.conf` to require TLS encryption (`require_certificate true` for mutual TLS).
- **Use Strong Ciphers:** Configure the `tls_version` and `ciphers` options in `mosquitto.conf` to use strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms.
- **Certificate Verification:** Ensure clients are configured to verify the broker's certificate to prevent connecting to rogue brokers.

## Threat: [Message Injection by Unauthorized Publisher](./threats/message_injection_by_unauthorized_publisher.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access (due to weak credentials or vulnerabilities in Mosquitto) and publishes malicious messages to topics the application subscribes to.

**Impact:** The application processes and acts upon false or harmful data, leading to incorrect behavior, potential security breaches within the application's domain, or disruption of services.

**Affected Mosquitto Component:** Broker Core (message handling and routing), Authentication/Authorization Modules

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Strong Authentication:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, client certificates) and enforce strong password policies within Mosquitto.
- **Fine-grained Authorization:** Configure Access Control Lists (ACLs) in `mosquitto.conf` or using an authentication plugin to restrict publishing permissions to specific clients and topics.

## Threat: [Message Tampering by Unauthorized Publisher](./threats/message_tampering_by_unauthorized_publisher.md)

**Description:** Similar to message injection, but the attacker modifies existing messages before they reach subscribers, exploiting a lack of integrity checks within Mosquitto's core functionality for unencrypted messages.

**Impact:** Similar to message injection, leading to incorrect application behavior or security breaches based on the altered data.

**Affected Mosquitto Component:** Broker Core, Authentication/Authorization Modules

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms within Mosquitto.
- **Enforce TLS Encryption:** While application-level integrity checks are good, TLS encryption prevents tampering in transit.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Excessive Connections](./threats/denial_of_service_(dos)_through_excessive_connections.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the Mosquitto broker with a large number of connection requests, overwhelming its resources.

**Impact:** The broker becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate clients from connecting or exchanging messages, disrupting the application's functionality.

**Affected Mosquitto Component:** Network Listener, Broker Core (connection management)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Connection Limits:** Configure `max_connections` in `mosquitto.conf` to limit the number of concurrent client connections.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on connection attempts using firewall rules or broker plugins (if available).

## Threat: [Exploiting Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/exploiting_weak_or_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to the Mosquitto broker using default or easily guessable usernames and passwords.

**Impact:** Successful login grants the attacker unauthorized access to publish and subscribe to topics, potentially leading to data breaches, message manipulation, or denial of service.

**Affected Mosquitto Component:** Authentication Modules

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Change Default Credentials:** Immediately change any default usernames and passwords provided by Mosquitto or its plugins.
- **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Configure Mosquitto to require strong, unique passwords for all user accounts.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities](./threats/authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** A security vulnerability in the Mosquitto broker or its authentication plugins allows an attacker to bypass the authentication process without providing valid credentials.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the broker's security, allowing unauthorized access and control.

**Affected Mosquitto Component:** Authentication Modules, Broker Core

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Keep Mosquitto Updated:** Regularly update Mosquitto to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Authentication Plugin Configuration:** If using authentication plugins, ensure they are properly configured and up-to-date.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass Vulnerabilities](./threats/authorization_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** A security vulnerability in the Mosquitto broker or its authorization mechanisms allows an attacker to perform actions (publish or subscribe to topics) they are not authorized to.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or the ability to manipulate the system by publishing to restricted topics.

**Affected Mosquitto Component:** Authorization Modules, Broker Core

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Keep Mosquitto Updated:** As with authentication bypass, updates often include fixes for authorization vulnerabilities.
- **Thorough ACL Configuration:** Carefully configure and regularly review Access Control Lists (ACLs) in `mosquitto.conf` to ensure they accurately reflect the required permissions.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:** The `mosquitto.conf` file, which may contain sensitive information like passwords or access credentials, is exposed due to insecure file permissions or misconfiguration.

**Impact:** Attackers can gain access to credentials and other sensitive settings, leading to complete broker compromise.

**Affected Mosquitto Component:** Configuration Management

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Secure File Permissions:** Ensure the `mosquitto.conf` file has restrictive file system permissions, limiting access to only the necessary user accounts.
- **Avoid Storing Secrets Directly:** Consider using external secret management solutions or environment variables instead of storing sensitive information directly in the configuration file.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Mosquitto](./threats/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_mosquitto.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known security vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of Mosquitto being used.

**Impact:** Can range from denial of service and information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Affected Mosquitto Component:** Varies depending on the vulnerability

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Keep Mosquitto Updated:** This is the most crucial mitigation strategy. Regularly apply security patches and updates.
- **Subscribe to Security Advisories:** Stay informed about known vulnerabilities by subscribing to the Mosquitto project's security mailing list or monitoring relevant security feeds.
