Critical Node: Exploit Mosquitto Broker Vulnerabilities

* Description: This critical node represents attacks that directly target security flaws within the Mosquitto broker's code. Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the broker and potentially the underlying system.
* High-Risk Path: Exploit Known CVEs in Mosquitto
    * Attack Vector: Attackers research publicly disclosed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) affecting the specific version of Mosquitto being used. They then utilize existing exploit code or develop their own to leverage these vulnerabilities.
    * Why High-Risk:
        * Likelihood: Medium - Known vulnerabilities are actively sought after by attackers, and exploit code is often readily available. The likelihood depends on how quickly organizations patch their systems.
        * Impact: High - Successful exploitation can grant attackers complete control over the Mosquitto broker, allowing them to eavesdrop on all messages, publish malicious data, or even execute arbitrary code on the server.

Critical Node: Exploit Misconfigurations in Mosquitto

* Description: This critical node encompasses attacks that exploit weaknesses introduced by improper setup or configuration of the Mosquitto broker. These are often easier to execute than exploiting code vulnerabilities.
* High-Risk Path: Bypass Authentication
    * Attack Vector: Attackers attempt to gain access to the Mosquitto broker without providing valid credentials.
    * Why High-Risk:
        * Likelihood: Medium (overall for the path) - Depends on the specific sub-attack.
        * Impact: High - Successful authentication bypass grants the attacker full access to the broker's functionalities, allowing them to subscribe, publish, and manage the broker.
        * Sub-Attack Vector: Weak or Default Credentials
            * Description: Attackers attempt to log in using commonly known default credentials or weak passwords that have not been changed.
            * Why High-Risk:
                * Likelihood: Medium - Many installations fail to change default credentials.
                * Impact: High - Direct access to the broker.
        * Sub-Attack Vector: Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force
            * Description: Attackers use lists of compromised credentials or systematically try different password combinations to gain access.
            * Why High-Risk:
                * Likelihood: Medium - If weak passwords are used and rate limiting is not in place.
                * Impact: High - Direct access to the broker.
* High-Risk Path: Bypass Authorization (ACLs)
    * Attack Vector: Attackers attempt to perform actions (subscribe or publish to topics) that they should not be authorized to perform according to the Access Control Lists (ACLs).
    * Why High-Risk:
        * Likelihood: Medium - Often due to overly permissive or poorly configured ACLs.
        * Impact: Medium - Can lead to access of sensitive data or the ability to manipulate application behavior by publishing to restricted topics.
        * Sub-Attack Vector: Weak or Missing ACLs
            * Description: ACLs are either not implemented or are configured in a way that allows unauthorized access.
            * Why High-Risk:
                * Likelihood: Medium - A common oversight in configuration.
                * Impact: Medium - Unrestricted access to topics.
* High-Risk Path: Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration
    * Attack Vector: Attackers exploit weaknesses in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) configuration used to encrypt communication with the Mosquitto broker.
    * Why High-Risk:
        * Likelihood: Low to Medium (overall for the path) - Depends on the specific misconfiguration.
        * Impact: High - Exposure of sensitive communication between clients and the broker.
        * Sub-Attack Vector: Weak Ciphers Enabled
            * Description: The broker is configured to allow the use of weak cryptographic algorithms that can be easily broken.
            * Why High-Risk:
                * Likelihood: Low - Modern versions have better defaults, but misconfiguration is possible.
                * Impact: High - Ability to decrypt communication.
        * Sub-Attack Vector: Missing Certificate Validation
            * Description: The broker or clients do not properly verify the authenticity of certificates, allowing for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
            * Why High-Risk:
                * Likelihood: Low - Requires network positioning for MITM.
                * Impact: High - Ability to intercept and potentially modify communication.
        * Sub-Attack Vector: Outdated TLS Version
            * Description: The broker is using an outdated version of the TLS protocol with known vulnerabilities.
            * Why High-Risk:
                * Likelihood: Low - Should be avoided, but legacy systems might exist.
                * Impact: High - Potential exposure of communication due to TLS vulnerabilities.
