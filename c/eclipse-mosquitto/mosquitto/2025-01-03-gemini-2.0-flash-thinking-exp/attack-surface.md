# Attack Surface Analysis for eclipse-mosquitto/mosquitto

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** The broker uses easily guessable or default usernames and passwords for authentication.

**How Mosquitto Contributes:** Mosquitto relies on configured authentication mechanisms (e.g., password file, database backend) where weak credentials can be set.

**Example:** An attacker attempts to connect to the broker using the default username "mosquitto" and password "password".

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the MQTT broker, allowing attackers to subscribe to sensitive topics, publish malicious messages, or disrupt broker functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong password policies requiring complex and unique passwords.
*   Avoid using default usernames and passwords; change them immediately upon installation.
*   Consider using more robust authentication mechanisms like TLS client certificates or integrating with external authentication systems.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Authentication](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_authentication.md)

**Description:** Authentication is disabled or not enforced on the Mosquitto broker.

**How Mosquitto Contributes:** Mosquitto's configuration allows disabling authentication, making the broker publicly accessible without any checks.

**Example:** Any client can connect to the broker without providing any credentials and freely interact with topics.

**Impact:** Complete unauthorized access to the broker, allowing anyone to read and write messages, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always enable authentication in the Mosquitto configuration.
*   Ensure the `allow_anonymous` setting is set to `false`.
*   Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms based on the application's security requirements.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authorization](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authorization.md)

**Description:** Authentication is enabled, but the authorization rules are too permissive, granting excessive access to clients.

**How Mosquitto Contributes:** Mosquitto's access control lists (ACLs) or plugin-based authorization might be misconfigured, granting broader permissions than intended.

**Example:** A sensor device is authorized to publish data to a specific topic, but due to a misconfiguration, it can also subscribe to administrative topics containing sensitive information.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to specific topics, allowing attackers to read sensitive data or publish malicious messages to critical parts of the system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement granular authorization rules that follow the principle of least privilege.
*   Carefully define ACLs or configure authorization plugins to restrict access to only necessary topics and actions.
*   Regularly review and update authorization rules as application requirements change.

## Attack Surface: [Cleartext Communication](./attack_surfaces/cleartext_communication.md)

**Description:** MQTT communication between clients and the broker is not encrypted.

**How Mosquitto Contributes:** By default, Mosquitto listens on port 1883 for unencrypted connections. Configuration is required to enforce encrypted communication.

**Example:** An attacker on the same network as a client and the broker intercepts MQTT messages containing sensitive data (e.g., sensor readings, control commands).

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the network, including credentials, application data, and control commands.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for all MQTT communication.
*   Configure Mosquitto to listen on the secure port 8883 and disable the insecure port 1883.
*   Enforce the use of TLS/SSL for client connections.
*   Use strong cipher suites for TLS/SSL.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Management Interface](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_management_interface.md)

**Description:** The Mosquitto administrative interface (if enabled) is exposed without proper authentication or over an insecure connection.

**How Mosquitto Contributes:**  Mosquitto can be configured with a web-based administrative interface, which, if not secured, becomes an attack vector.

**Example:** An attacker accesses the unsecured web interface and gains insight into broker configuration, connected clients, or even the ability to manage the broker.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for unauthorized modification of broker configuration, and control over the broker.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the administrative interface with strong authentication and authorization.
*   Access the administrative interface only over HTTPS.
*   Restrict access to the administrative interface to trusted networks or IP addresses.
*   Disable the administrative interface if it's not required.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Authentication/Authorization Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_authenticationauthorization_plugins.md)

**Description:**  Security flaws exist in custom or third-party authentication or authorization plugins used with Mosquitto.

**How Mosquitto Contributes:** Mosquitto's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality, but vulnerabilities in these plugins can compromise security.

**Example:** A vulnerability in a database authentication plugin allows an attacker to bypass authentication checks by injecting SQL commands.

**Impact:** Bypassing authentication and authorization controls, leading to unauthorized access and control over the broker.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet and audit any third-party or custom plugins before deploying them.
*   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom plugins.
