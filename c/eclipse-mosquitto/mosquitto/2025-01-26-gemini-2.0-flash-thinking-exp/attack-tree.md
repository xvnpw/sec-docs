## Attack Tree Path: [Root Goal: Compromise Application via Mosquitto Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/root_goal_compromise_application_via_mosquitto_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate objective. Success in any of the sub-paths leads to achieving this goal. It's critical because it represents the overall security posture of the application in relation to Mosquitto.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Mosquitto Broker Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_mosquitto_broker_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   Directly targeting the Mosquitto broker is a critical path because compromising the broker can have widespread impact, affecting all applications and clients connected to it.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Exploit Known Mosquitto Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__exploit_known_mosquitto_vulnerabilities__cves___critical_node_.md)

*   Known vulnerabilities are critical because they are publicly documented and often have readily available exploits. Outdated Mosquitto instances are prime targets.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Execute Exploit ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3__execute_exploit_high-risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging publicly available exploits (e.g., from exploit databases, Metasploit) for known CVEs in Mosquitto.
        *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Mosquitto broker, potentially leading to control over all MQTT communications, data breaches, and further system compromise if the broker host is also vulnerable.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Maintain up-to-date Mosquitto versions, implement vulnerability scanning, and have a patch management process.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Mosquitto Configuration Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_mosquitto_configuration_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

*   Misconfigurations are a common source of vulnerabilities and are often easier to exploit than code-level vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Leverage Default/Weak Credentials ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__leverage_defaultweak_credentials_high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting default usernames and passwords that are sometimes left unchanged after installation, or using easily guessable/brute-forceable weak passwords.
        *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Mosquitto broker with administrative or privileged user rights, allowing full control over broker settings, topics, and client management.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Disable default accounts, enforce strong password policies, use password complexity requirements, and consider multi-factor authentication if supported or via plugin.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2. Attempt Default Credentials ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2__attempt_default_credentials_high-risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Trying common default username/password combinations against the Mosquitto broker's authentication mechanism.
            *   **Impact:**  Gain unauthorized access if default credentials are still active.
            *   **Mitigation:**  Change or disable default credentials immediately upon deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.3. Brute-Force Weak Credentials ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_3__brute-force_weak_credentials_high-risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using automated tools to try a large number of password combinations (dictionary attack, brute-force) to guess weak passwords.
            *   **Impact:** Gain unauthorized access if weak passwords are in use.
            *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies, implement account lockout mechanisms after failed login attempts, and use rate limiting on login attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3. Abuse Anonymous Access ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3__abuse_anonymous_access_high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If anonymous access is enabled in Mosquitto configuration, attackers can connect without any authentication.
        *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the broker, potentially allowing subscription to sensitive topics, publishing malicious messages, and causing denial of service.
        *   **Mitigation:** Disable anonymous access and enforce authentication for all clients.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.2. Exploit Anonymous Access Permissions ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_2__exploit_anonymous_access_permissions_high-risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Once anonymous access is gained, exploiting the permissions granted to anonymous users.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.2.1. Subscribe to Sensitive Topics ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_2_1__subscribe_to_sensitive_topics_high-risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Subscribing to MQTT topics that contain sensitive data (e.g., personal information, sensor readings, control commands) if anonymous users are allowed to subscribe to these topics.
                    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data leakage, unauthorized information access.
                    *   **Mitigation:** Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict topic access even for authenticated users, and especially for anonymous users if it cannot be disabled.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.2.2. Publish Malicious Messages ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_2_2__publish_malicious_messages_high-risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Publishing crafted MQTT messages to topics that control application functionality, inject malicious data, or cause disruption if anonymous users are allowed to publish.
                    *   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, application malfunction, unauthorized control of devices, potential for command injection vulnerabilities in the application.
                    *   **Mitigation:** Implement ACLs to restrict publish access, validate and sanitize all MQTT messages received by the application, and design application logic to be resilient to malicious inputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.2.3. Cause Denial of Service (DoS) ***HIGH-RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_2_3__cause_denial_of_service__dos__high-risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Flooding the broker with messages or connection requests from anonymous connections to overwhelm resources and cause service disruption.
                    *   **Impact:** Broker unavailability, application disruption, impacting legitimate users.
                    *   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, connection limits, resource monitoring, and consider using a firewall to filter malicious traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2. Message Eavesdropping (Without TLS) ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2__message_eavesdropping__without_tls__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting unencrypted MQTT traffic on the network to eavesdrop on sensitive data transmitted in MQTT messages.
            *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data, loss of privacy.
            *   **Mitigation:** Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all MQTT communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2.2. MQTT Communication is Unencrypted (No TLS) ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_2__mqtt_communication_is_unencrypted__no_tls__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The fundamental vulnerability is the lack of TLS/SSL encryption for MQTT communication, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.
                *   **Impact:** Enables eavesdropping and message tampering.
                *   **Mitigation:**  Configure Mosquitto to require TLS/SSL for all client connections and broker-to-broker connections.
