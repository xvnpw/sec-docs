# Attack Surface Analysis for eclipse-mosquitto/mosquitto

## Attack Surface: [1. Unencrypted Communication (Plaintext MQTT)](./attack_surfaces/1__unencrypted_communication__plaintext_mqtt_.md)

*   **Description:** MQTT communication occurs without encryption, exposing data in transit.
*   **Mosquitto's Contribution:** Mosquitto, by default, listens on port 1883 for unencrypted MQTT connections. If TLS/SSL is not explicitly configured and enforced in Mosquitto's configuration, communication remains in plaintext.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network uses a network sniffer to capture MQTT packets transmitted via the default plaintext port 1883. They read sensitive data like device telemetry, control commands, usernames, and passwords.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data leakage, potential for credential theft, Man-in-the-Middle attacks to modify or inject messages.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if sensitive data is transmitted) to **High** (even with less sensitive data due to potential for wider network compromise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce TLS/SSL in Mosquitto Configuration:** Configure Mosquitto to use TLS/SSL for all MQTT listeners (port 8883) by setting up certificates and enabling TLS listeners in `mosquitto.conf`.
    *   **Disable Plaintext Listener in Mosquitto Configuration:** Disable the default plaintext listener on port 1883 by commenting out or removing the `listener 1883` line in `mosquitto.conf` if TLS/SSL is mandatory.
    *   **Educate Developers to Use Secure Connections:** Ensure developers are aware of the security implications and configure MQTT clients to connect using secure protocols (MQTT over TLS/SSL - `mqtts://`) and the correct port (8883).

## Attack Surface: [2. Weak or Missing Authentication](./attack_surfaces/2__weak_or_missing_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of proper authentication or use of weak credentials allows unauthorized access to the MQTT broker.
*   **Mosquitto's Contribution:** Mosquitto's authentication mechanisms (password file, plugins) are configurable. If authentication is disabled in `mosquitto.conf` (anonymous access) or weak default credentials are used in configured authentication methods, it becomes a significant vulnerability directly related to Mosquitto's setup.
*   **Example:** Anonymous access is enabled in Mosquitto's configuration (`allow_anonymous true`). An attacker connects without credentials and gains full access to publish and subscribe to any topic, potentially controlling devices or accessing sensitive data. Alternatively, a weak password file is used, easily brute-forced, granting unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to publish and subscribe, data breaches, control system compromise, potential for denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**, depending on the sensitivity of data and control systems accessible via MQTT.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication in Mosquitto Configuration:** Always enable authentication in `mosquitto.conf` by setting `allow_anonymous false` and configuring an authentication method (e.g., password file, auth plugin).
    *   **Strong Passwords for Mosquitto Users:** Use strong, unique passwords for all MQTT users defined in the chosen authentication method (password file or plugin). Avoid default or easily guessable passwords.
    *   **Secure Password File (if used):** If using password files, ensure they are properly secured with appropriate file system permissions on the server running Mosquitto and consider using hashed passwords generated by `mosquitto_passwd`.
    *   **External Authentication Plugins (for enhanced security):** Consider using external authentication plugins (e.g., LDAP, database-backed, OAuth2) for more robust, scalable, and centrally managed authentication, which can be configured within Mosquitto.

## Attack Surface: [3. Insufficient Authorization (ACLs)](./attack_surfaces/3__insufficient_authorization__acls_.md)

*   **Description:** Improperly configured or missing Access Control Lists (ACLs) within Mosquitto grant excessive permissions to MQTT clients.
*   **Mosquitto's Contribution:** Mosquitto's ACL functionality, configured via `acl_file` or plugins, directly controls client topic access. Misconfiguration or lack of ACLs in Mosquitto's setup leads to clients having broader access than intended, a vulnerability managed within Mosquitto itself.
*   **Example:** ACLs are not configured in Mosquitto, or are configured too permissively in `mosquitto.conf` or the ACL file. A client intended only to publish sensor data can also subscribe to sensitive control topics and send malicious commands, disrupting operations or causing damage due to Mosquitto's lack of proper access control enforcement.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, unauthorized control actions, potential for system compromise, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Medium** (downgraded to Medium as it's less likely to be *critical* unless directly controlling life-critical systems, but still *High* for most sensitive applications), depending on the scope of over-permissions and the sensitivity of the topics involved.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement and Enforce ACLs in Mosquitto Configuration:** Define and implement granular ACLs in `mosquitto.conf` or an external ACL file, based on the principle of least privilege, specifying topic access permissions for each user or user group.
    *   **Regularly Review ACLs in Mosquitto Configuration:** Periodically review and update ACL rules defined in Mosquitto to ensure they remain appropriate and secure as application requirements evolve.
    *   **Test ACL Configurations in Mosquitto:** Thoroughly test ACL configurations within Mosquitto to verify they are working as intended and prevent unintended access by using tools to simulate client connections and topic interactions.
    *   **Centralized ACL Management (for larger deployments):** For larger deployments, consider using centralized ACL management systems or plugins integrated with Mosquitto for easier administration, auditing, and consistent enforcement of access control policies.

## Attack Surface: [4. Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection/Message Flooding](./attack_surfaces/4__denial_of_service__dos__via_connectionmessage_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm the Mosquitto broker with excessive connection requests or messages, causing service disruption.
*   **Mosquitto's Contribution:** Mosquitto, as an MQTT broker, is the target of connection and message floods. Without configuring rate limiting or connection limits within Mosquitto itself, it can be overwhelmed, directly impacting its availability.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a large number of connection requests to the Mosquitto broker, exhausting its connection limits (if any are configured) and resources. Legitimate clients are unable to connect to Mosquitto, and the MQTT service becomes unavailable. Alternatively, an attacker publishes a massive volume of messages to a topic, overwhelming subscribers and Mosquitto's message processing capabilities.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability of the Mosquitto broker, disruption of MQTT-based applications, potential data loss if messages are dropped due to overload.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Medium** (downgraded to Medium as it's primarily an availability issue, but *High* if service disruption has significant business impact), depending on the criticality of the MQTT service and the ease of launching a DoS attack against Mosquitto.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Connection Limits in Mosquitto Configuration:** Configure `max_connections` in `mosquitto.conf` to limit the number of concurrent connections Mosquitto will accept, preventing connection exhaustion DoS.
    *   **Rate Limiting Plugins for Mosquitto:** Implement rate limiting using Mosquitto plugins (if available or develop custom plugin) to restrict the rate of incoming connections or messages from specific clients or IP addresses, directly managed within Mosquitto's plugin architecture.
    *   **Resource Monitoring for Mosquitto Server:** Monitor Mosquitto server resource usage (CPU, memory, network) to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks targeting Mosquitto. Set up alerts based on resource thresholds.
    *   **Firewall and Network Security (complementary):** Use firewalls and network intrusion detection/prevention systems to filter malicious traffic and mitigate network-level DoS attacks *in addition* to Mosquitto-specific mitigations.
    *   **QoS Levels Management (within application design):** Utilize MQTT Quality of Service (QoS) levels appropriately in client applications. Higher QoS levels increase broker load on Mosquitto, so consider using lower QoS levels where message loss is acceptable to reduce potential for message flooding to overwhelm Mosquitto.

## Attack Surface: [5. MQTT Protocol Exploits and Implementation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/5__mqtt_protocol_exploits_and_implementation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Mosquitto's implementation of the MQTT protocol (being C code) can be exploited.
*   **Mosquitto's Contribution:** As a software implementation of the MQTT protocol, Mosquitto's codebase itself is the source of potential implementation vulnerabilities, especially being written in C, which is prone to memory safety issues.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Mosquitto's handling of long client IDs in CONNECT packets due to a coding error in Mosquitto's C implementation. An attacker crafts a malicious CONNECT packet with an excessively long client ID, exploiting the buffer overflow in Mosquitto and potentially gaining control of the broker server.
*   **Impact:** Broker crash, remote code execution on the Mosquitto server, denial of service, information disclosure, complete system compromise of the server running Mosquitto.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**, depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the exploitability of the specific flaw within Mosquitto's code.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Mosquitto Updated (critical):** Regularly update Mosquitto to the latest stable version from official sources to patch known vulnerabilities in Mosquitto's code. This is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing (proactive):** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the Mosquitto broker installation to identify potential vulnerabilities in its configuration and implementation.
    *   **Input Validation in Mosquitto (development/contribution):** If contributing to Mosquitto development, ensure robust input validation is performed in the codebase to prevent exploitation of protocol parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Memory Safety Practices (Mosquitto development/contribution):** If modifying Mosquitto source code, adhere to secure coding practices in C to prevent memory-related vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, etc.) in Mosquitto's implementation.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning (regularly):** Use vulnerability scanning tools to regularly identify potential weaknesses in the Mosquitto installation and the underlying operating system, although these may not catch application-specific vulnerabilities in Mosquitto itself.
