# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for eclipse-mosquitto/mosquitto

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_authentication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong Authentication

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Disable Anonymous Access:** Modify the `mosquitto.conf` file. Locate the `allow_anonymous` setting.  If it's missing or set to `true`, change it to `allow_anonymous false`.  Restart the Mosquitto service.
        2.  **Choose an Authentication Method:**
            *   **Username/Password:**
                *   Create a password file using the `mosquitto_passwd` utility:  `mosquitto_passwd -c /path/to/passwordfile username`.  Repeat for each user, omitting the `-c` flag after the first user.
                *   In `mosquitto.conf`, add `password_file /path/to/passwordfile`.
            *   **Client Certificates (TLS):**
                *   Generate a Certificate Authority (CA) key and certificate: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt -days 3650 -nodes`.
                *   Generate a server key and certificate signing request (CSR): `openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout mosquitto.key -out mosquitto.csr -nodes`.
                *   Sign the server CSR with the CA: `openssl x509 -req -in mosquitto.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out mosquitto.crt -days 365`.
                *   Generate client keys and CSRs (repeat for each client): `openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout client.key -out client.csr -nodes`.
                *   Sign the client CSRs with the CA: `openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 365`.
                *   In `mosquitto.conf`, add:
                    ```
                    cafile /path/to/ca.crt
                    certfile /path/to/mosquitto.crt
                    keyfile /path/to/mosquitto.key
                    require_certificate true
                    tls_version tlsv1.3 # Or tlsv1.2
                    ```
                *   Clients must be configured to use their respective certificates and the CA certificate.
            *   **Authentication Plugin:**
                *   Choose and install a suitable plugin (e.g., `mosquitto-auth-plug`).
                *   Configure the plugin according to its documentation, connecting it to your authentication source (database, LDAP, etc.).
                *   In `mosquitto.conf`, specify the plugin and its configuration file.
        3.  **Restart Mosquitto:** After making changes to `mosquitto.conf`, restart the Mosquitto service to apply the changes.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthenticated users from connecting, publishing, or subscribing.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: High):** Strong passwords or client certificates make brute-force attacks significantly harder.
        *   **Credential Stuffing (Severity: High):** Unique passwords per client mitigate the impact of credential stuffing attacks.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Severity: Critical):** Client certificates, when used with TLS, provide strong authentication and prevent MitM attacks.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced to near zero.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced, dependent on password strength or certificate security.
        *   **Credential Stuffing:** Risk significantly reduced if unique passwords are used.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Risk reduced to near zero when using client certificates and TLS with proper certificate validation.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Username/password authentication is implemented using `mosquitto_passwd` and `password_file` in `/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Client certificate authentication is not implemented.  The system relies solely on username/password authentication, which is less secure.  An authentication plugin is also not currently used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Fine-Grained Authorization (ACLs)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_fine-grained_authorization__acls_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Fine-Grained Authorization (ACLs)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Create an ACL File:** Create a text file (e.g., `aclfile.txt`).
        2.  **Define ACL Rules:**  Add rules to the file, following this format:
            ```
            user <username>
            topic read <topic_pattern>
            topic write <topic_pattern>
            topic readwrite <topic_pattern>
            pattern <topic_pattern_with_wildcards>
            ```
            *   Example:
                ```
                user sensor1
                topic read sensors/sensor1/#

                user control_panel
                topic readwrite sensors/#
                ```
        3.  **Configure Mosquitto:** In `mosquitto.conf`, add `acl_file /path/to/aclfile.txt`.
        4.  **Restart Mosquitto:** Restart the service to apply the changes.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Topics (Severity: High):** Prevents clients from accessing topics they are not explicitly authorized to use.
        *   **Data Leakage (Severity: High):** Limits the potential for sensitive data to be exposed to unauthorized clients.
        *   **Malicious Message Injection (Severity: High):** Restricts which clients can publish to specific topics, preventing unauthorized message injection.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Topics:** Risk significantly reduced, dependent on the granularity of the ACL rules.
        *   **Data Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced, as clients can only access authorized data.
        *   **Malicious Message Injection:** Risk significantly reduced, as only authorized clients can publish to specific topics.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** No.  There is no `acl_file` configured in `mosquitto.conf`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  The entire ACL system is missing.  All authenticated users currently have unrestricted access to all topics.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Limits](./mitigation_strategies/connection_limits.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Connection Limits

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Edit `mosquitto.conf`:** Open the configuration file.
        2.  **Set `max_connections`:** Add or modify the `max_connections` setting.  Choose a value based on your server's capacity and expected client load.  For example: `max_connections 1000`.
        3.  **(Optional) Per-Listener Settings:** If you have multiple listeners, use `per_listener_settings true` and configure `max_connections` within each listener block.
        4.  **Restart Mosquitto:** Restart the service.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Limits the number of simultaneous connections, preventing attackers from overwhelming the broker with connection requests.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of the broker running out of resources (file descriptors, memory) due to excessive connections.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk significantly reduced, as the broker will reject connections beyond the configured limit.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced, as the number of connections is capped.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** No. `max_connections` is not set in `mosquitto.conf`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** The `max_connections` limit is not enforced.  The broker is vulnerable to connection-based DoS attacks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Always Use TLS/SSL](./mitigation_strategies/always_use_tlsssl.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Always Use TLS/SSL

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Obtain a TLS Certificate:** Get a certificate from a trusted CA (e.g., Let's Encrypt) or create a self-signed certificate (for testing only).
        2.  **Configure `mosquitto.conf`:**
            *   Add or modify the following settings:
                ```
                listener 8883
                cafile /path/to/ca.crt
                certfile /path/to/mosquitto.crt
                keyfile /path/to/mosquitto.key
                tls_version tlsv1.3 # Or tlsv1.2
                ```
            *   Replace the paths with the actual paths to your certificates and key.
        3.  **Configure Clients:** Ensure all clients are configured to connect using TLS, providing the CA certificate and, if required, client certificates.
        4.  **Restart Mosquitto:** Restart the service.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Severity: Critical):** TLS encrypts the communication, preventing attackers from intercepting or modifying messages.
        *   **Eavesdropping (Severity: High):** Encryption prevents attackers from reading the contents of MQTT messages.
        *   **Data Tampering (Severity: High):** TLS provides integrity checks, ensuring that messages have not been altered in transit.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Risk reduced to near zero with proper certificate validation.
        *   **Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced to near zero.
        *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced to near zero.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. The `mosquitto.conf` file includes `cafile`, `certfile`, and `keyfile` settings, and a listener is configured for port 8883 (TLS). However, `tls_version` is not explicitly set, and `tls_insecure` is likely not set to `false`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** While TLS is configured, it's crucial to verify that all clients are *actually* connecting using TLS and that certificate validation is working correctly.  `tls_insecure false` should be set to enforce certificate validation. The `tls_version` should be explicitly set to `tlsv1.3` or `tlsv1.2`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Bridge Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_bridge_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Bridge Configuration

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Enable TLS:** Use `connection <bridge_name>` and `address <remote_broker_address>:8883` in `mosquitto.conf`. Configure `cafile`, `certfile`, and `keyfile` for the bridge connection, just like for client connections.
        2.  **Use Authentication:** Set `remote_username` and `remote_password` (or use client certificates) for the bridge connection.
        3.  **Define Topic Mappings:** Use `topic <pattern> <direction> <local_prefix> <remote_prefix>` to control which topics are bridged.  Avoid using `#` alone.  Example: `topic sensors/# out local/ remote/`.
        4.  **Restart Mosquitto:** Restart the service.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Bridged Brokers (Severity: High):** TLS and authentication prevent unauthorized connections to the remote broker.
        *   **Data Leakage Across Brokers (Severity: High):** Topic mappings control which data is shared between brokers.
        *   **Message Loops (Severity: Medium):** Careful topic mapping with prefixes prevents messages from being endlessly forwarded between brokers.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Bridged Brokers:** Risk significantly reduced with TLS and authentication.
        *   **Data Leakage Across Brokers:** Risk significantly reduced with well-defined topic mappings.
        *   **Message Loops:** Risk minimized with proper prefixing.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable. The current system does not use bridging.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Not Applicable, as bridging is not used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Retained Messages Management](./mitigation_strategies/retained_messages_management.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Retained Messages Management

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Use Retained Messages Sparingly:** Only retain messages when absolutely necessary for new subscribers.
        2.  **Set Expiry:** In `mosquitto.conf`, use `message_expiry_interval <seconds>` to set a global expiry time for retained messages.  Clients can also set expiry intervals when publishing.
        3.  **Clear Retained Messages:** Publish an empty payload to a retained topic to clear it.
        4.  **Use ACLs:** Restrict which clients can publish retained messages using ACL rules (part of the broader ACL strategy).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of Stale Data (Severity: Medium):** Expiry intervals ensure that old data is eventually removed.
        *   **Data Leakage (Severity: Medium):** ACLs and careful use of retained messages limit the potential for sensitive data to be exposed.
        *   **Unexpected Behavior (Severity: Low):** Clearing retained messages when they are no longer needed prevents unexpected behavior for new subscribers.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of Stale Data:** Risk significantly reduced with expiry intervals.
        *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced with careful use and ACLs.
        *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Risk minimized by clearing unnecessary retained messages.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. There is no global `message_expiry_interval` set.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** A global expiry interval should be set in `mosquitto.conf`. ACLs should be used to restrict publishing of retained messages (this is part of the missing ACL implementation).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Queue Limits](./mitigation_strategies/queue_limits.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Queue Limits

    * **Description:**
        1.  **Edit `mosquitto.conf`:** Open the configuration file.
        2.  **Set `max_queued_messages`:** Add or modify this setting to limit the number of queued QoS 1 and 2 messages for disconnected clients. Example: `max_queued_messages 100`.
        3.  **Set `max_inflight_messages`:** Add or modify this setting to limit the number of unacknowledged QoS 1 and 2 messages. Example: `max_inflight_messages 20`.
        4. **Restart Mosquitto:** Restart the service.

    * **Threats Mitigated:**
        * **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Limits memory usage by preventing excessive message queuing.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Indirectly helps mitigate DoS by limiting resource consumption.

    * **Impact:**
        * **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced, preventing uncontrolled growth of message queues.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Some indirect mitigation by limiting resource consumption.

    * **Currently Implemented:** No. Neither `max_queued_messages` nor `max_inflight_messages` are set.

    * **Missing Implementation:** Both queue limit settings are missing, leaving the broker potentially vulnerable to resource exhaustion from queued messages.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Persistence Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/persistence_configuration.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Persistence Configuration

    * **Description:**
        1.  **Edit `mosquitto.conf`:** Open the configuration file.
        2.  **Set `autosave_interval`:** Configure how often the persistent database is saved (in seconds). Example: `autosave_interval 300` (5 minutes).
        3.  **Set `persistence_location`:** Specify the directory for the persistence database. Example: `persistence_location /var/lib/mosquitto/`.
        4.  **Ensure Sufficient Disk Space:** Make sure the chosen location has enough free space.
        5. **Restart Mosquitto:** Restart the service.

    * **Threats Mitigated:**
        * **Data Loss (Severity: Medium):** Controls how often data is saved, balancing performance and data loss risk.
        * **Performance Degradation (Severity: Low):**  Avoids excessively frequent disk writes.
        * **Disk Space Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):**  Ensuring sufficient disk space prevents crashes due to lack of storage.

    * **Impact:**
        * **Data Loss:** Risk balanced by choosing an appropriate `autosave_interval`.
        * **Performance Degradation:**  Risk minimized by avoiding overly frequent saves.
        * **Disk Space Exhaustion:** Risk minimized by monitoring and providing sufficient disk space.

    * **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `persistence` is enabled, and `persistence_location` is set. `autosave_interval` is not explicitly set, using the default value.

    * **Missing Implementation:** `autosave_interval` should be explicitly set to a value appropriate for the application's needs, rather than relying on the default.
