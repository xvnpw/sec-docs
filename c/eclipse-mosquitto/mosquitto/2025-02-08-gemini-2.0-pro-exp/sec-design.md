# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a lightweight, open-source Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) broker.
*   Support multiple MQTT protocol versions (5.0, 3.1.1, and 3.1).
*   Offer a stable and reliable messaging service for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications.
*   Maintain a small footprint to be suitable for resource-constrained environments.
*   Provide security features to protect message confidentiality and integrity.
*   Foster a community-driven development model.
*   Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows, macOS, and others).

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Unauthorized access to the MQTT broker, leading to data breaches or manipulation of connected devices.
*   Denial-of-service attacks against the broker, disrupting communication between IoT devices and applications.
*   Vulnerabilities in the broker software that could be exploited by attackers.
*   Lack of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing unauthorized clients to connect and interact with the broker.
*   Insufficient logging and monitoring, hindering the detection and investigation of security incidents.
*   Compromise of the build and distribution process, leading to the deployment of malicious versions of the broker.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: TLS/SSL support for encrypted communication between clients and the broker. Implemented in the broker's network communication layer and configured through configuration files.
*   security control: Authentication using username/password. Described in the documentation and configured through configuration files.
*   security control: Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict client access to specific topics. Described in the documentation and configured through configuration files.
*   security control: Support for various authentication plugins (e.g., JWT, database-backed authentication). Described in the documentation and implemented as loadable modules.
*   security control: Bridge support for connecting to other MQTT brokers, with security options for the bridge connection. Described in the documentation and configured through configuration files.
*   security control: C and C++ code, with some attention to avoiding buffer overflows and other common vulnerabilities. Evident in the source code.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The default configuration does not enforce strong security settings, requiring users to explicitly configure them.
*   accepted risk: Older versions of TLS/SSL may be supported for compatibility reasons, which could be vulnerable to known attacks.
*   accepted risk: The plugin architecture, while providing flexibility, introduces a potential attack surface if plugins are not carefully vetted.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement mandatory TLS/SSL encryption with strong ciphers by default.
*   security control: Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.
*   security control: Integrate with a centralized identity and access management (IAM) system.
*   security control: Implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks.
*   security control: Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing.
*   security control: Implement a comprehensive logging and monitoring system with real-time alerting.
*   security control: Provide a security hardening guide for production deployments.
*   security control: Implement a secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) with static and dynamic code analysis.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The broker must support strong authentication mechanisms, including username/password, client certificates, and integration with external authentication providers.
    *   The broker must enforce strong password policies.
    *   The broker should support multi-factor authentication.

*   Authorization:
    *   The broker must implement fine-grained access control using ACLs or a similar mechanism.
    *   The broker must allow administrators to define granular permissions for clients based on topics and actions (publish, subscribe).

*   Input Validation:
    *   The broker must validate all inputs from clients, including topic names, payloads, and control packets.
    *   The broker must protect against common injection attacks, such as SQL injection (if applicable) and command injection.

*   Cryptography:
    *   The broker must use strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols for secure communication (TLS/SSL).
    *   The broker must securely store sensitive data, such as passwords and private keys.
    *   The broker should support hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI, Jenkins) is triggered by the commit.
3.  The pipeline performs the following steps:
    *   Runs linters (e.g., `cpplint`, `clang-format`) to check code style and potential errors.
    *   Runs static analysis security testing (SAST) tools (e.g., Coverity, SonarQube) to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   Executes unit and integration tests to verify the functionality of the code.
    *   If all checks and tests pass, builds the Mosquitto broker (compiles the C/C++ code).
    *   Creates a Docker image containing the compiled broker and necessary dependencies.
    *   Pushes the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).

Security Controls:

*   security control: Use of linters to enforce coding standards and identify potential errors.
*   security control: Integration of SAST tools to detect security vulnerabilities early in the development process.
*   security control: Automated testing to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: Building and distributing the broker as a container image to ensure consistency and reproducibility.
*   security control: Use of a secure container registry to store and distribute the Docker image.
*   security control: Signing of Docker images to ensure authenticity and integrity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT
