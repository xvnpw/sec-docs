## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) - Flood Broker with Messages [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos__-_flood_broker_with_messages__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends a massive number of MQTT messages (CONNECT, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE) to the broker, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
*   **Likelihood:** High.  Easy to execute with readily available tools.  Effectiveness depends on broker configuration and resources.
*   **Impact:** High.  Can render the MQTT service unavailable to legitimate clients, disrupting application functionality.
*   **Effort:** Low.  Can be automated with simple scripts.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  High network traffic and resource utilization are observable, but distinguishing malicious traffic from legitimate bursts can be challenging without proper monitoring and thresholds.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) [HR] (if TLS is not enforced)](./attack_tree_paths/2__man-in-the-middle__mitm___hr___if_tls_is_not_enforced_.md)

*   **Intercept/Modify Traffic [CN]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker positions themselves between the client and the broker to intercept, modify, or replay MQTT messages. This is the *critical enabling step* for the rest of the MitM attacks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (with TLS), High (without TLS).  Requires network access.
    *   **Impact:** Very High.  Complete compromise of confidentiality and integrity.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (without TLS), Very Hard (with TLS).

    *   **TLS Stripping [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker actively removes TLS encryption from the connection, forcing it to fall back to plaintext.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (if TLS is enforced by both client and server).
        *   **Impact:** Very High.  Allows eavesdropping and manipulation.
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High.
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard.

    *   **Downgrade to Plaintext [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** Similar to TLS stripping, but focuses on preventing TLS negotiation from the start.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (if TLS is enforced).
        *   **Impact:** Very High.
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High.
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard.

    *   **Eavesdrop on Traffic [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** Passively listening to unencrypted MQTT messages.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (with TLS), High (without TLS).
        *   **Impact:** High (if sensitive data is transmitted).
        *   **Effort:** Low (without TLS).
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice (without TLS).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (with TLS), Easy (without TLS).

    *   **Inject False Data [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** Actively modifying or injecting MQTT messages.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (with TLS), High (without TLS).
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High.
        *   **Effort:** Medium.
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Broker Vulnerabilities [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_broker_vulnerabilities__cn_.md)

*   **Buffer Overflow (CVE-XXXX-YYYY) [HR][CN]:**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting a specific, known buffer overflow vulnerability in Mosquitto (represented by a CVE identifier).  This is a placeholder; real CVEs would be listed.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on the specific CVE and patch status).  Higher if the vulnerability is unpatched and an exploit is publicly available.
    *   **Impact:** Very High.  Often leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Effort:** High to Very High.  Requires finding the vulnerability, developing or obtaining an exploit.
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard (especially for zero-days).  Requires IDS/IPS with specific signatures or behavioral analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Compromise Authentication [HR][CN]](./attack_tree_paths/4__compromise_authentication__hr__cn_.md)

    *   **Brute-Force Credentials [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** Repeatedly guessing usernames and passwords.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depends on password strength and lockout policies).
        *   **Impact:** High.  Grants attacker access to the broker.
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (detectable through failed login attempts).

    *   **Weak/Default Credentials [CN]:**
        *   **Description:** Using easily guessable or default passwords that haven't been changed.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on administrative practices).
        *   **Impact:** High.  Immediate access.
        *   **Effort:** Very Low.
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if successful).
