# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for eclipse-mosquitto/mosquitto

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strong Authentication - Username/Password](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strong_authentication_-_usernamepassword.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strong Authentication - Username/Password
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Password File:** In your `mosquitto.conf` file, configure the `password_file` directive to point to a file that will store usernames and hashed passwords. Example: `password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd`. Create this file if it doesn't exist.
    2.  **Disable Anonymous Access:** In `mosquitto.conf`, set `allow_anonymous false`. This prevents clients from connecting without providing credentials.
    3.  **Generate Passwords using `mosquitto_passwd`:** Use the `mosquitto_passwd` utility (provided with Mosquitto) to generate hashed passwords for each user and add them to the password file. Example: `mosquitto_passwd -b /etc/mosquitto/passwd username password`. Use strong, unique passwords.
    4.  **Restart Mosquitto:** Restart the Mosquitto broker for the configuration changes to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized clients from connecting to the broker and accessing MQTT topics.
    *   **Data Breaches (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data transmitted via MQTT topics.
    *   **Message Injection/Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized clients from publishing malicious or incorrect messages to MQTT topics.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Message Injection/Manipulation:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented in the `broker.conf` file. `password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd` and `allow_anonymous false` are configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Password complexity policy is not enforced within Mosquitto itself. Password rotation policy is not in place within Mosquitto configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strong Authentication - TLS Client Certificates](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strong_authentication_-_tls_client_certificates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strong Authentication - TLS Client Certificates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure TLS Listener for Client Certificates:** In `mosquitto.conf`, configure a listener for TLS (e.g., port 8883) and enable client certificate authentication using the following directives:
        *   `port 8883`
        *   `listener 8883`
        *   `certfile /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.crt` (Path to server certificate)
        *   `keyfile /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.key` (Path to server private key)
        *   `cafile /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt` (Path to CA certificate)
        *   `require_certificate true` (Require client certificates)
        *   `use_identity_as_username true` (Optional: Use certificate's Common Name as username)
    2.  **Restart Mosquitto:** Restart the Mosquitto broker for the configuration changes to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Significantly strengthens authentication, making unauthorized access much harder.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** TLS encryption and certificate verification prevent eavesdropping and tampering with communication.
    *   **Impersonation (High Severity):** Client certificates make it very difficult for attackers to impersonate legitimate clients.
    *   **Data Breaches (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of data breaches by securing communication channels and authenticating clients.
    *   **Message Injection/Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized message publication by ensuring only authenticated clients can connect and publish.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Impersonation:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Message Injection/Manipulation:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. TLS encryption is enabled on port 8883 using server certificates. However, `require_certificate` is set to `false`, so client certificate authentication is not enforced by Mosquitto.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enforce `require_certificate true` in `mosquitto.conf`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_access_control_lists__acls_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable ACL File:** In your `mosquitto.conf` file, configure the `acl_file` directive to point to a file that will define your ACL rules. Example: `acl_file /etc/mosquitto/acl.conf`. Create this file if it doesn't exist.
    2.  **Define ACL Rules in ACL File:** Edit the ACL file to define rules that specify which users or client certificates have access to which MQTT topics and operations (subscribe, publish, read, write).  ACL rules are defined line by line, using Mosquitto's ACL syntax. Example: `user client1 topic sensor/+/temperature read`.
    3.  **Restart Mosquitto:** Restart the Mosquitto broker for the ACL configuration to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Specific Topics (High Severity):** Prevents authorized but potentially compromised clients from accessing or manipulating topics they shouldn't.
    *   **Data Breaches (Medium Severity):** Limits the scope of potential data breaches by restricting access to sensitive topics.
    *   **Message Injection/Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Prevents authorized but compromised clients from publishing to critical control topics.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):**  Restricts the ability of an attacker who has compromised one client to access or control other parts of the system via MQTT.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Specific Topics:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Message Injection/Manipulation:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** No ACL file is currently configured in `mosquitto.conf`. Mosquitto is not enforcing topic-based access control.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Create an `acl_file` (e.g., `/etc/mosquitto/acl.conf`). Define granular ACL rules based on user roles and application requirements within this file. Configure `acl_file /etc/mosquitto/acl.conf` in `mosquitto.conf`. Restart Mosquitto.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unencrypted Listener](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unencrypted_listener.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unencrypted Listener
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Comment out or Remove Port 1883 Listener:** In `mosquitto.conf`, comment out or remove the default `port 1883` listener configuration line. This prevents Mosquitto from listening for unencrypted connections.
    2.  **Verify TLS Listener is Enabled:** Ensure a TLS listener is configured and enabled on a different port (e.g., 8883) in `mosquitto.conf`.
    3.  **Restart Mosquitto:** Restart the Mosquitto broker for the configuration changes to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents eavesdropping and tampering with MQTT communication by forcing encrypted communication.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Protects sensitive data transmitted over MQTT from being intercepted in plaintext.
    *   **Passive Information Gathering (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the ability of attackers to passively monitor MQTT traffic to gather information about your system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Passive Information Gathering:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. TLS listener on port 8883 is configured, but the unencrypted listener on port 1883 is still enabled in `mosquitto.conf`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Comment out or remove the `port 1883` line in `mosquitto.conf`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Connection Limits (`max_connections`)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_connection_limits___max_connections__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Connection Limits (`max_connections`)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set `max_connections` in `mosquitto.conf`:**  Add or modify the `max_connections` directive in your `mosquitto.conf` file. Set a value that limits the maximum number of concurrent client connections the broker will accept. Example: `max_connections 1000`.
    2.  **Restart Mosquitto:** Restart the Mosquitto broker for the configuration change to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Connection Exhaustion (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the broker with excessive connection attempts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Connection Exhaustion:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, `max_connections` is not explicitly set in `mosquitto.conf`. Mosquitto is using its default, very high connection limit.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Add `max_connections` directive to `mosquitto.conf` with a reasonable value (e.g., `max_connections 1000`). Restart Mosquitto.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Message Size Limits (`payload_size_limit`)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_message_size_limits___payload_size_limit__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Message Size Limits (`payload_size_limit`)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set `payload_size_limit` in `mosquitto.conf`:** Add or modify the `payload_size_limit` directive in your `mosquitto.conf` file. Set a value that restricts the maximum size of MQTT message payloads the broker will accept. Example: `payload_size_limit 102400`.
    2.  **Restart Mosquitto:** Restart the Mosquitto broker for the configuration change to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Message Flood (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from flooding the broker with extremely large messages.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Limits the impact of large messages on broker memory and network bandwidth.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Message Flood:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, `payload_size_limit` is not set in `mosquitto.conf`. Mosquitto is using its default, very large payload size limit.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Add `payload_size_limit` directive to `mosquitto.conf` with a reasonable value (e.g., `payload_size_limit 102400`). Restart Mosquitto.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Mosquitto Broker Software
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Mosquitto Security Announcements:** Subscribe to the official Mosquitto security mailing list or monitor their website/GitHub repository for security advisories and release announcements.
    2.  **Check for Updates Regularly:** Periodically check for new versions of Mosquitto.
    3.  **Apply Updates:** When updates are available, especially security updates, apply them promptly following the recommended update procedures for your system.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Patches known security flaws in Mosquitto, preventing attackers from exploiting them.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. System administrators are generally responsible for updates, but a proactive, scheduled process for checking specifically for Mosquitto updates might be missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish a scheduled task or reminder to regularly check for Mosquitto updates and security advisories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Run Mosquitto as a Dedicated, Non-Root User](./mitigation_strategies/run_mosquitto_as_a_dedicated__non-root_user.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Run Mosquitto as a Dedicated, Non-Root User
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify Mosquitto User:** Ensure that the Mosquitto broker process is configured to run as a dedicated, non-root system user (e.g., `mosquitto` user). This is typically configured during installation and managed by system service tools.
    2.  **Check Service Configuration:** Verify the service configuration (e.g., systemd unit file) for Mosquitto to confirm the user under which the process is running.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Limits the impact of a potential compromise of the Mosquitto process to the privileges of the dedicated user, not `root`.
    *   **System-Wide Compromise (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of a compromise of the Mosquitto broker leading to a full system compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **System-Wide Compromise:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, Mosquitto is installed and configured to run as a dedicated user (`mosquitto` user).
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Regularly audit the Mosquitto service configuration to ensure it continues to run as the intended non-root user, especially after system updates or configuration changes.
