## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed architectural design of the OBS Studio project, an open-source software suite for video recording and live streaming. This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's components, their interactions, and data flows. This information will be crucial for subsequent threat modeling activities to identify potential security vulnerabilities and design appropriate mitigations. This version includes minor clarifications and improvements based on the initial draft.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of OBS Studio are to:

*   Capture audio and video from various sources (e.g., webcams, screen captures, application windows, microphones).
*   Compose scenes by arranging and transforming these sources.
*   Encode the composed scenes into various video and audio formats.
*   Stream the encoded output to various online platforms (e.g., Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Live).
*   Record the encoded output to local storage.
*   Provide a user-friendly interface for configuration and control.
*   Offer extensibility through a plugin architecture.

This design document aims to clearly articulate the architecture that enables these goals.

## 3. System Architecture Overview

OBS Studio follows a modular architecture, allowing for flexibility and extensibility. The core of the application manages the capture, processing, and output of audio and video. Plugins extend the functionality by providing new sources, filters, encoders, and streaming services.

## 5. Detailed Component Interactions and Data Flow

This section describes the flow of data through the system during typical operations like streaming and recording.

### 5.1. Streaming Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "User Interface"
        A["'User initiates streaming'"]
    end
    subgraph "Core Logic"
        B["'Scene Manager selects active scene'"]
        C["'Source Manager retrieves source data'"]
        D["'Filter Manager applies filters'"]
        E["'Audio System processes audio'"]
        F["'Video System processes video'"]
        G["'Encoding System encodes audio/video'"]
        H["'Output System (Streaming) sends data to streaming service'"]
    end

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    D --> F
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H
```

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **User initiates streaming:** The user interacts with the User Interface, clicking the "Start Streaming" button or a similar control.
2. **Scene Manager selects active scene:** The Scene Manager determines the currently active scene based on user selection or configuration.
3. **Source Manager retrieves source data:** For each source within the active scene, the Source Manager retrieves the raw audio and video data. This involves interacting with the specific source implementation (e.g., querying the operating system for window content, accessing webcam data).
4. **Filter Manager applies filters:**  The Filter Manager iterates through the configured audio and video filters for each source and applies them sequentially to the retrieved data.
5. **Audio System processes audio:** The Audio System mixes the processed audio streams from different sources according to their volume levels and routing configurations. It also applies any scene-level audio filters.
6. **Video System processes video:** The Video System composites the processed video frames from different sources based on their position, size, and layering within the scene. It applies transformations and scene-level video filters.
7. **Encoding System encodes audio/video:** The processed audio and video data are passed to the Encoding System. The system selects the appropriate encoders based on user settings and encodes the data into the desired formats (e.g., H.264 video, AAC audio).
8. **Output System (Streaming) sends data to streaming service:** The encoded data is encapsulated into packets and transmitted by the Output System to the configured streaming service. This involves establishing a network connection, authenticating with the service (using provided credentials), and adhering to the streaming protocol's specifications.

### 5.2. Recording Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "User Interface"
        A["'User initiates recording'"]
    end
    subgraph "Core Logic"
        B["'Scene Manager selects active scene'"]
        C["'Source Manager retrieves source data'"]
        D["'Filter Manager applies filters'"]
        E["'Audio System processes audio'"]
        F["'Video System processes video'"]
        G["'Encoding System encodes audio/video'"]
        H["'Output System (Recording) writes data to local storage'"]
    end

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    D --> F
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H
```

**Detailed Steps:**

The recording workflow mirrors the streaming workflow up to the encoding stage.

1. **User initiates recording:** The user interacts with the User Interface, clicking the "Start Recording" button or a similar control.
2. **Scene Manager selects active scene:** The Scene Manager identifies the currently active scene.
3. **Source Manager retrieves source data:** The Source Manager retrieves raw audio and video data from the sources in the active scene.
4. **Filter Manager applies filters:** Configured audio and video filters are applied to the source data.
5. **Audio System processes audio:** The Audio System mixes and processes audio streams, applying filters.
6. **Video System processes video:** The Video System composites video frames, applying transformations and filters.
7. **Encoding System encodes audio/video:** The processed audio and video data are encoded into the desired formats.
8. **Output System (Recording) writes data to local storage:** The encoded data is written to a file on the local storage. The Output System handles file creation, writing data in the selected container format, and closing the file upon completion of the recording.

## 6. Security Considerations (Initial)

This section outlines initial security considerations based on the architecture. A more detailed threat model will be developed based on this document.

*   **Plugin Security:** Plugins, due to their ability to extend core functionality, represent a significant attack surface. Malicious or poorly written plugins could:
    *   Execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the OBS Studio process.
    *   Access sensitive user data or system resources.
    *   Introduce vulnerabilities that could be exploited by remote attackers.
    *   Compromise the integrity of the streaming or recording output.
    *   The plugin API and its security mechanisms are critical areas for scrutiny.
*   **Network Security (Streaming):** Streaming involves transmitting potentially sensitive audio and video data over the network. Security concerns include:
    *   **Man-in-the-middle attacks:** Interception of the stream content.
    *   **Data injection:** Injecting malicious data into the stream.
    *   **Authentication and authorization:** Ensuring only authorized users can stream to specific platforms.
    *   Vulnerabilities in the implementation of streaming protocols (e.g., RTMP, SRT, WebRTC).
    *   Exposure of stream keys or credentials.
*   **User Input Validation:**  The application must rigorously validate all user-provided input to prevent various attacks, including:
    *   **Command injection:**  If user input is used to construct system commands.
    *   **Path traversal:** If user-provided file paths are not properly sanitized.
    *   **Cross-site scripting (XSS) via browser sources:** If embedded web pages are not handled securely.
    *   Malicious URLs or data provided for streaming endpoints or custom commands.
*   **Resource Management:**  Improper resource management can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions or other stability issues:
    *   Excessive memory consumption due to memory leaks or inefficient data handling.
    *   CPU exhaustion due to computationally intensive filters or encoding settings.
    *   Disk space exhaustion due to uncontrolled recording.
*   **Data Storage (Recording):**  Recorded files may contain sensitive information, requiring appropriate security measures:
    *   Access control to prevent unauthorized access to recordings.
    *   Potential for information leakage if temporary files are not securely handled.
    *   Risk of data corruption or loss if file writing operations are not robust.
*   **Update Mechanism:** A compromised update mechanism could allow attackers to distribute malicious versions of OBS Studio:
    *   Lack of secure communication channels for updates.
    *   Absence of digital signatures to verify the authenticity of updates.
    *   Vulnerabilities in the update process itself.
*   **Third-Party Libraries:** OBS Studio relies on numerous third-party libraries, which can introduce vulnerabilities:
    *   Outdated or vulnerable versions of libraries.
    *   Security flaws within the libraries themselves.
    *   Supply chain attacks targeting the distribution of these libraries.
*   **Browser Source Security:** The Browser Source component, based on CEF, introduces the security considerations of a web browser:
    *   Exposure to web-based vulnerabilities.
    *   Potential for malicious scripts to access local resources or interact with OBS Studio.
    *   Need for proper sandboxing and security policies for the embedded browser.
