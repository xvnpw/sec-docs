## Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes for Compromising Application Using OBS Studio

**Objective:** Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server hosting the application that utilizes OBS Studio.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

└── Achieve Remote Code Execution on Application Server (AND) **CRITICAL NODE**
    ├── Exploit OBS Studio Directly (OR) **HIGH-RISK PATH**
    │   └── Exploit Known Vulnerability in OBS Studio (AND) **CRITICAL NODE**
    ├── Exploit OBS Studio Plugins (OR) **HIGH-RISK PATH**
    │   ├── Exploit Vulnerability in Installed OBS Studio Plugin (AND) **CRITICAL NODE**
    │   └── Introduce Malicious OBS Studio Plugin (AND) **HIGH-RISK PATH**
    │       └── Gain Access to Application Server's OBS Plugin Directory **CRITICAL NODE**
    ├── Manipulate OBS Studio Configuration (OR) **HIGH-RISK PATH**
    │   └── Directly Modify OBS Studio Configuration Files (AND) **HIGH-RISK PATH**
    │       └── Gain Access to Application Server's OBS Configuration Files **CRITICAL NODE**
    ├── Exploit OBS Studio Control Interface (e.g., obs-websocket) (OR) **HIGH-RISK PATH**
    │   └── Abuse Control Interface Functionality (AND) **HIGH-RISK PATH**
    │       └── Gain Access to OBS Control Interface (Authentication Bypass/Weak Credentials) **CRITICAL NODE**
    └── Exploit Media Handling within OBS Studio (OR) **HIGH-RISK PATH**
        ├── Inject Malicious Media Files (AND) **HIGH-RISK PATH**
        │   └── Identify Input Points for Media Files (e.g., Browser Sources, Media Sources) **CRITICAL NODE**

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Achieve Remote Code Execution on Application Server (AND) - CRITICAL NODE:**
    * **Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest impact scenario. Success here means complete compromise of the application server.
    * **Why Critical:** Achieving this node signifies a complete security failure. All mitigation efforts are aimed at preventing this.

**2. Exploit OBS Studio Directly (OR) - HIGH-RISK PATH:**
    * **Description:** This path involves directly exploiting vulnerabilities within the core OBS Studio application.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Known vulnerabilities are often well-documented, and exploits may be readily available, making this a relatively accessible attack vector.
    * **Critical Node within Path: Exploit Known Vulnerability in OBS Studio (AND):** Successfully exploiting a known vulnerability is a significant step towards RCE.

**3. Exploit OBS Studio Plugins (OR) - HIGH-RISK PATH:**
    * **Description:** This path targets vulnerabilities within OBS Studio plugins or involves introducing malicious plugins.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Plugins often have less rigorous security reviews than the core application, making them potential weak points.
    * **Critical Nodes within Path:**
        * **Exploit Vulnerability in Installed OBS Studio Plugin (AND):**  Compromising a plugin can provide a foothold for further attacks.
        * **Introduce Malicious OBS Studio Plugin (AND):** Directly injecting malicious code via a plugin leads to immediate compromise.
        * **Gain Access to Application Server's OBS Plugin Directory (AND):** This is a prerequisite for introducing malicious plugins and represents a significant security breach.

**4. Manipulate OBS Studio Configuration (OR) - HIGH-RISK PATH:**
    * **Description:** This path involves altering OBS Studio's configuration to execute malicious code.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Misconfigurations can be easily overlooked and can provide a direct path to code execution.
    * **Critical Node within Path: Directly Modify OBS Studio Configuration Files (AND):** Directly altering configuration files bypasses application-level controls.
    * **Critical Node within Path: Gain Access to Application Server's OBS Configuration Files (AND):**  Gaining access to these files is a crucial step for malicious configuration.

**5. Exploit OBS Studio Control Interface (e.g., obs-websocket) (OR) - HIGH-RISK PATH:**
    * **Description:** This path involves exploiting vulnerabilities or abusing the functionality of OBS Studio's control interface.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Control interfaces are designed for external control, making them a powerful tool for attackers if not properly secured.
    * **Critical Node within Path: Abuse Control Interface Functionality (AND):**  Once access is gained, the control interface can be used for various malicious actions.
    * **Critical Node within Path: Gain Access to OBS Control Interface (Authentication Bypass/Weak Credentials) (AND):**  This is the crucial first step in abusing the control interface.

**6. Exploit Media Handling within OBS Studio (OR) - HIGH-RISK PATH:**
    * **Description:** This path involves injecting malicious media files that exploit vulnerabilities in OBS Studio's media processing capabilities.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Media processing is complex and can be prone to vulnerabilities. If the application allows loading external media, this becomes a significant risk.
    * **Critical Node within Path: Inject Malicious Media Files (AND):** Successfully injecting a malicious media file is a direct step towards exploitation.
    * **Critical Node within Path: Identify Input Points for Media Files (e.g., Browser Sources, Media Sources) (AND):** Understanding where media is loaded is essential for injecting malicious content.

This focused sub-tree and detailed breakdown highlight the most critical areas that require immediate attention and robust security measures to protect the application from compromise via OBS Studio.
