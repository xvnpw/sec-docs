# Threat Model Analysis for arut/nginx-rtmp-module

## Threat: [Malformed RTMP Message Processing](./threats/malformed_rtmp_message_processing.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted or malformed RTMP messages to the server. This could involve invalid header fields, incorrect data types, or exceeding expected data lengths. The attacker aims to trigger unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially exploit buffer overflows in the module's processing logic.

**Impact:** Server crash, denial of service, potential for remote code execution if a memory corruption vulnerability is present.

**Affected Component:** RTMP message parsing logic within the module.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all incoming RTMP messages.
*   Ensure the module is updated to the latest version, which includes bug fixes and security patches.
*   Consider using a security-focused RTMP proxy or firewall to filter potentially malicious traffic.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Stream Access (Publish/Play)](./threats/unauthenticated_stream_access_(publishplay).md)

**Description:** An attacker connects to the RTMP server and attempts to publish or play streams without providing valid credentials or authorization. This allows unauthorized content to be broadcast or private streams to be viewed.

**Impact:** Unauthorized content injection, privacy breaches, disruption of legitimate streams.

**Affected Component:** Connection and stream handling logic within the module.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement a strong authentication mechanism for both publishing and playing streams. This can be done through the `nginx-rtmp-module`'s directives or by integrating with an external authentication service.
*   Utilize the `allow` and `deny` directives within the `nginx-rtmp-module` configuration to restrict access based on IP addresses or other criteria (though this is less robust than proper authentication).

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Connection Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service_via_connection_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a large number of connection requests to the RTMP server in a short period. This can overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, network connections), making it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Server unavailability, inability for legitimate users to connect or stream content.

**Affected Component:** Connection handling logic within the module.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement connection limits within the `nginx-rtmp-module` configuration.
*   Use network firewalls to block suspicious traffic or implement rate limiting on incoming connections.
*   Consider using a DDoS mitigation service.

## Threat: [Exposure of Control Endpoints (if enabled without proper authentication)](./threats/exposure_of_control_endpoints_(if_enabled_without_proper_authentication).md)

**Description:** The `nginx-rtmp-module` can expose HTTP control endpoints for managing streams and server settings. If these endpoints are enabled without proper authentication, an attacker could potentially manipulate the server configuration, stop or start streams, or gather sensitive information.

**Impact:** Unauthorized server control, disruption of services, information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** HTTP control interface of the module.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical if sensitive actions are exposed.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the HTTP control endpoints with strong authentication (e.g., HTTP Basic Auth, API keys).
*   Restrict access to these endpoints to specific IP addresses or networks.
*   Disable control endpoints if they are not needed.
