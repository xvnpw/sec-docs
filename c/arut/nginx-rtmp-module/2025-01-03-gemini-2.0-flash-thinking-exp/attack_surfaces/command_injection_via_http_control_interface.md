## Deep Dive Analysis: Command Injection via HTTP Control Interface in nginx-rtmp-module

This analysis focuses on the "Command Injection via HTTP Control Interface" attack surface identified for applications using the `nginx-rtmp-module`. We will delve into the technical details, potential attack vectors, and provide comprehensive mitigation strategies tailored for the development team.

**1. Understanding the Attack Surface:**

The `nginx-rtmp-module` extends the functionality of the Nginx web server to handle Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) streams. To manage these streams and the module's behavior, it often exposes an HTTP-based control interface. This interface allows administrators (and potentially attackers if not secured) to interact with the module through HTTP requests.

The core vulnerability lies in the potential for this control interface to execute system commands based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization. If an attacker can manipulate the parameters sent to this interface, they can inject malicious commands that the server will then execute with the privileges of the Nginx process (typically `www-data` or `nginx`).

**2. Deeper Dive into the Vulnerability:**

* **How the Control Interface Works (Hypothetical):** While the specific implementation details can vary depending on the configuration and any custom extensions, the control interface likely works by mapping specific HTTP endpoints (e.g., `/control/stream/update`, `/control/server/reload`) to internal functions within the `nginx-rtmp-module`. These functions might then:
    * Directly execute system commands using functions like `system()`, `exec()`, `popen()`, or similar.
    * Construct shell commands based on the received parameters and then execute them.
    * Interact with the underlying operating system through other means that are susceptible to command injection if input is not handled carefully.

* **Identifying Vulnerable Code Points:**  Pinpointing the exact vulnerable code requires examining the `nginx-rtmp-module`'s source code or any custom extensions implementing the control interface. Key areas to investigate include:
    * **Request Handling Logic:**  The functions responsible for parsing HTTP requests and extracting parameters from the URL, POST data, or headers.
    * **Command Construction:**  Any code sections where strings are built to be executed as system commands. Look for string concatenation or formatting where user input is directly inserted.
    * **Execution Functions:**  Instances of `system()`, `exec()`, `popen()`, or other functions that execute external commands.

* **Example Scenario Breakdown:** Let's consider a hypothetical endpoint `/control/stream/update` that allows updating a stream's description. The request might look like:

   ```
   GET /control/stream/update?name=mystream&description=New+description
   ```

   If the backend code naively uses the `description` parameter to construct a command, it could be vulnerable. For instance, if the code does something like:

   ```c
   char command[256];
   snprintf(command, sizeof(command), "streamtool update %s -d '%s'", stream_name, stream_description);
   system(command);
   ```

   An attacker could craft a malicious request like:

   ```
   GET /control/stream/update?name=mystream&description=test'%3B+whoami%3B'
   ```

   This would result in the following command being executed:

   ```bash
   streamtool update mystream -d 'test'; whoami;'
   ```

   The semicolon (`;`) acts as a command separator, allowing the `whoami` command to be executed after the intended `streamtool` command.

**3. Potential Attack Vectors and Exploitation:**

* **GET Requests:** As illustrated in the example, parameters passed in the URL query string are a common attack vector.
* **POST Requests:**  Data submitted in the body of a POST request can also be vulnerable if the control interface accepts POST requests.
* **Headers:**  Less common but possible, if the control interface processes specific headers and uses their values in system commands.
* **Authentication Bypass (if any):**  If there are weaknesses in the authentication or authorization mechanisms protecting the control interface, attackers might gain unauthorized access to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Chaining with other vulnerabilities:** This command injection could be chained with other vulnerabilities (e.g., information disclosure) to gather more information before launching the attack.

**4. Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

A successful command injection attack can have devastating consequences:

* **Full Server Compromise:** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Nginx process. This allows them to:
    * **Read sensitive data:** Access configuration files, database credentials, private keys, etc.
    * **Modify system files:** Alter configurations, install backdoors, and disrupt services.
    * **Create new users or escalate privileges:** Gain persistent access to the system.
    * **Install malware:** Deploy ransomware, cryptominers, or other malicious software.
    * **Pivot to other systems:** If the compromised server has network access to other internal systems, the attacker can use it as a stepping stone for further attacks.
* **Service Disruption:** Attackers can terminate the Nginx process, causing a denial of service for the RTMP streaming platform.
* **Data Breach:**  If the server stores or processes sensitive user data, the attacker can exfiltrate this information.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the reputation and trust associated with the service.
* **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Depending on the nature of the data compromised, there could be significant legal and regulatory consequences.

**5. Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies (Actionable for Developers):**

* **Input Sanitization and Validation (Crucial):**
    * **Whitelisting:** Define a strict set of allowed characters, formats, and values for each input parameter. Reject any input that doesn't conform.
    * **Blacklisting (Less Effective):** Avoid relying solely on blacklisting malicious characters, as attackers can often find ways to bypass these filters.
    * **Escaping:** Properly escape special characters that have meaning in shell commands (e.g., `, `, `, `, `|`, `&`, `;`, `$`, `(`, `)`, `<`, `>`, `!`, `\`, `'`, `"`, `{`, `}`). Use language-specific escaping functions.
    * **Input Length Limits:** Enforce reasonable length limits on input parameters to prevent buffer overflows or other related issues.
    * **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that input parameters are of the expected data type (e.g., integer, string).

* **Avoid Direct Execution of System Commands:**
    * **Prefer APIs and Libraries:** If possible, use programming language APIs or libraries to interact with the operating system or other services instead of directly executing shell commands.
    * **Parameterization:** If system commands are unavoidable, use parameterized commands or prepared statements where user input is treated as data, not as executable code. This is often applicable when interacting with databases but can be adapted for other scenarios.

* **Strong Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Require Authentication:** Ensure that the HTTP control interface requires strong authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) before allowing any actions.
    * **Implement Authorization:**  Implement granular authorization controls to restrict which users or roles can access specific control interface endpoints and perform specific actions.
    * **HTTPS Only:** Enforce the use of HTTPS for the control interface to protect credentials and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Run Nginx with Minimal Privileges:** Configure the Nginx process to run with the lowest possible privileges necessary to perform its tasks. This limits the damage an attacker can do if they gain command execution.
    * **Separate Processes:** Consider separating the control interface functionality into a separate process with restricted privileges if possible.

* **Disable Unnecessary Features:**
    * **Disable the Control Interface:** If the HTTP control interface is not strictly required for the application's functionality, consider disabling it entirely.
    * **Restrict Access:** If the control interface is necessary, restrict access to it from trusted networks or specific IP addresses only (e.g., using firewall rules).

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of the `nginx-rtmp-module` configuration and any custom extensions implementing the control interface, specifically looking for potential command injection vulnerabilities.
    * **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Use SAST tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Perform DAST or penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities in the running application.

* **Security Headers:** Implement relevant security headers for the HTTP control interface to mitigate other potential attacks (e.g., X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy).

* **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * **Log All Requests:** Log all requests made to the HTTP control interface, including the parameters. This can help in detecting suspicious activity.
    * **Monitor for Anomalous Behavior:** Implement monitoring to detect unusual patterns or commands being executed on the server.

**6. Developer-Specific Considerations:**

* **Understand the `nginx-rtmp-module` Code:** Familiarize yourself with the source code of the `nginx-rtmp-module` and any related extensions that implement the control interface.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Adhere to secure coding principles, especially when handling user input and executing system commands.
* **Input Validation Libraries:** Utilize well-vetted input validation libraries specific to your programming language.
* **Unit and Integration Testing:** Write unit and integration tests that specifically target the control interface and attempt to inject malicious commands to ensure proper sanitization and handling.
* **Stay Updated:** Keep the `nginx-rtmp-module` and the underlying Nginx server up-to-date with the latest security patches.
