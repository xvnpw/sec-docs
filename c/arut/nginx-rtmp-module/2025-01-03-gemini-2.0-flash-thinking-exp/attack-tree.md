## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RTMP Protocol Weaknesses -> Inject Malicious RTMP Packets (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rtmp_protocol_weaknesses_-_inject_malicious_rtmp_packets_(high_risk_path).md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts and sends specially designed RTMP packets that exploit vulnerabilities in how the nginx-rtmp-module parses or processes RTMP data.
- **Likelihood:** Medium - Requires knowledge of the RTMP protocol and the ability to craft specific packets, but tools and information for this exist.
- **Impact:** High - Successful injection can lead to various consequences, including:
    - **Remote Code Execution:** If a vulnerability allows for memory corruption, attackers might execute arbitrary code on the server.
    - **Server Crash/Denial of Service:** Malformed packets can cause the module or the entire Nginx server to crash.
    - **Stream Manipulation:** Attackers might be able to inject malicious content into the stream or alter its properties.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement robust RTMP input validation and sanitization to reject malformed or malicious packets.
    - Utilize a well-vetted and security-audited RTMP parsing library.
    - Regularly update the nginx-rtmp-module to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RTMP Protocol Weaknesses -> Denial of Service via RTMP Protocol Abuse (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rtmp_protocol_weaknesses_-_denial_of_service_via_rtmp_protocol_abuse_(high_risk_path).md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker floods the server with a large volume of invalid or resource-intensive RTMP requests, overwhelming its capacity to handle legitimate traffic.
- **Likelihood:** High - Relatively easy to execute using readily available tools or simple scripts.
- **Impact:** High - Can lead to a complete disruption of the streaming service, preventing legitimate users from accessing or publishing streams.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of RTMP requests from a single IP address or connection.
    - Implement connection limiting to restrict the number of concurrent connections.
    - Utilize network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection to identify and block malicious traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Insecure Default Configuration (HIGH RISK PATH - part of Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_insecure_default_configuration_(high_risk_path_-_part_of_critical_node).md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weak or overly permissive default settings in the nginx-rtmp-module configuration.
- **Likelihood:** Medium - Developers might overlook the security implications of default settings.
- **Impact:** Medium - Can lead to:
    - **Unauthorized Access:** Weak default authentication or authorization settings can allow unauthorized users to publish or control streams.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Permissive settings might expose sensitive information about the streaming setup.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Thoroughly review and harden the default nginx-rtmp-module configuration.
    - Enforce a secure configuration baseline during deployment.
    - Regularly audit the configuration for deviations from security best practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data (HIGH RISK PATH - part of Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data_(high_risk_path_-_part_of_critical_node).md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to configuration files containing sensitive information, such as authentication keys, stream keys, or database credentials.
- **Likelihood:** Medium - If file permissions are not properly managed or if sensitive data is stored directly in configuration files.
- **Impact:** High - Exposure of sensitive data can lead to:
    - **Full System Compromise:** If database credentials or server access keys are exposed.
    - **Unauthorized Stream Access and Control:** If stream keys or authentication credentials are leaked.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Secure access to server files and directories containing configuration files using appropriate file permissions.
    - Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files. Utilize secrets management solutions or environment variables.
