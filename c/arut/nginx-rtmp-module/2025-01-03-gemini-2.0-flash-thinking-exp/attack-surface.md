# Attack Surface Analysis for arut/nginx-rtmp-module

## Attack Surface: [Malformed RTMP Handshake](./attack_surfaces/malformed_rtmp_handshake.md)

*   **Description:** The initial handshake process in the RTMP protocol can be targeted with malformed or oversized packets.
    *   **How nginx-rtmp-module contributes:** The module is responsible for parsing and processing the incoming RTMP handshake. Vulnerabilities in this parsing logic can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a CONNECT packet with an excessively large payload or incorrect formatting.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the Nginx worker process handling the connection might crash, potentially impacting the entire server if not properly configured.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust RTMP handshake parsing with strict validation of packet sizes and formats.
        *   Set limits on the maximum size of handshake packets.
        *   Consider using Nginx's `limit_conn` or `limit_req` modules to mitigate excessive connection attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via HTTP Control Interface](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_http_control_interface.md)

*   **Description:** The `nginx-rtmp-module` often provides an HTTP-based control interface for managing streams and server settings. If this interface doesn't properly sanitize input parameters, it can be vulnerable to command injection.
    *   **How nginx-rtmp-module contributes:** The module implements the logic for handling requests to the control interface and executing associated actions.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a request to the control interface with a malicious payload in a parameter meant for a stream name or other configuration setting.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Full server compromise, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the HTTP control interface.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all input parameters received by the control interface.
        *   Avoid using user-provided input directly in system calls or shell commands.
        *   Consider disabling the control interface if it's not strictly necessary or restrict access to trusted networks.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Stream Publishing](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_stream_publishing.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can attempt to exhaust server resources by publishing a large number of streams or streams with excessively high bitrates.
    *   **How nginx-rtmp-module contributes:** The module handles the ingestion and processing of incoming streams. If not properly limited, it can consume excessive CPU, memory, or network bandwidth.
    *   **Example:** An attacker launches multiple publishing clients, each sending a high-bandwidth stream to the server.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - The server becomes overloaded and unable to handle legitimate requests.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   ** mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the number of concurrent publishing connections.
        *   Implement limits on the maximum bitrate allowed for published streams.
        *   Use Nginx's `limit_conn` and `limit_req` modules to control connection and request rates.
        *   Monitor server resource usage and implement alerting for abnormal activity.
