# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for arut/nginx-rtmp-module

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Connection Limits](./mitigation_strategies/implement_connection_limits.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Connection Limits (`max_connections` directive)
*   **Description:**
    1.  Edit your Nginx configuration file.
    2.  Locate the `rtmp` block.
    3.  Within the `rtmp` block, or within specific `application` blocks, add the `max_connections` directive followed by the desired maximum number of concurrent connections.
    4.  Example:
        ```nginx
        rtmp {
            server {
                listen 1935;
                max_connections 1000;
                application live {
                    live on;
                    max_connections 500;
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    5.  Save and reload Nginx configuration.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High Severity:** Prevents connection floods that can overwhelm the server.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion - High Severity:** Limits resource usage from excessive connections.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS Mitigation - High:** Effectively reduces the impact of connection-based DoS attacks.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion Mitigation - High:** Prevents resource depletion due to connection overload.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in `nginx.conf` within the `rtmp` block, limiting total RTMP connections to 500.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular connection limits are missing within specific `application` blocks like `live` and `vod`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Apply Rate Limiting for Publishing and Playback](./mitigation_strategies/apply_rate_limiting_for_publishing_and_playback.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting (`limit_pub`, `limit_play` directives)
*   **Description:**
    1.  Open your Nginx configuration file.
    2.  Find the `application` blocks in your `rtmp` configuration.
    3.  Within each `application` block, use `limit_pub` to restrict publishing rate and `limit_play` for playback rate, specifying rates in requests per second (e.g., `10r/s`).
    4.  Example:
        ```nginx
        rtmp {
            server {
                listen 1935;
                application live {
                    live on;
                    limit_pub 5r/s;
                    limit_play 20r/s;
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    5.  Save and reload Nginx.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DoS/DDoS Attacks (Publish/Playback Floods) - Medium to High Severity:** Mitigates attacks flooding the server with publish/playback requests.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Bandwidth, Processing) - Medium Severity:** Prevents excessive resource consumption from rate-based attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS/DDoS Mitigation - Medium:** Provides defense against rate-based attacks.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion Mitigation - Medium:** Helps control bandwidth and processing usage.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Playback rate limiting (`limit_play 10r/s`) is globally implemented in the `rtmp` block.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Publish rate limiting (`limit_pub`) is not implemented for applications like `live`. Rate limits need fine-tuning.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Streaming Keys (Publish and Play Keys) via HTTP Callbacks](./mitigation_strategies/secure_streaming_keys__publish_and_play_keys__via_http_callbacks.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Authentication/Authorization using HTTP Callbacks (`publish_notify`, `play_notify` directives)
*   **Description:**
    1.  Develop a backend HTTP server to handle authentication and authorization.
    2.  In your Nginx configuration, within secured `application` blocks, add `publish_notify` and `play_notify` directives, pointing to your backend server's endpoints.
    3.  Example:
        ```nginx
        rtmp {
            server {
                listen 1935;
                application secure_live {
                    live on;
                    publish_notify http://auth.example.com/rtmp/publish;
                    play_notify http://auth.example.com/rtmp/play;
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    4.  Implement `/rtmp/publish` and `/rtmp/play` endpoints on your backend to validate client credentials and authorize access based on your logic. Respond with HTTP 200 OK to allow, or error codes (e.g., 403, 401) to deny.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Streaming (Publishing and Playback) - High Severity:** Prevents unauthorized stream access.
    *   **Content Theft/Piracy - Medium to High Severity:** Reduces unauthorized content redistribution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access Mitigation - High:** Provides strong access control.
    *   **Content Theft Mitigation - Medium to High:** Significantly reduces unauthorized content access.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic `play_notify` authentication is implemented for `vod` using a hardcoded API key.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `publish_notify` is not implemented, leaving publishing unsecured.
    *   `play_notify` authentication is basic and needs a robust system (database, tokens, sessions).
    *   Authorization logic is missing; even authenticated users can access any `vod` stream.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement RTMPS (RTMP over TLS/SSL)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rtmps__rtmp_over_tlsssl_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Encryption in Transit (RTMPS configuration within `rtmp` block)
*   **Description:**
    1.  Obtain SSL/TLS certificates for your server.
    2.  In your Nginx configuration's `rtmp` block, create a new `server` block for RTMPS.
    3.  Use `listen 443 ssl;` in the new block to enable SSL on port 443.
    4.  Configure `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` directives to point to your certificate and key files.
    5.  Define your `application` blocks within this RTMPS server block.
    6.  Example:
        ```nginx
        rtmp {
            server {
                listen 1935; # Optional regular RTMP
                application live {
                    live on;
                }
            }
            server {
                listen 443 ssl; # RTMPS server
                ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl/your_domain.crt;
                ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/your_domain.key;
                application secure_live {
                    live on;
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    7.  Save and reload Nginx. Clients must use `rtmps://` protocol.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping/Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks - High Severity:** Prevents interception of RTMP stream data.
    *   **Data Tampering - Medium Severity:** Reduces risk of stream data modification during transit.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping/MitM Mitigation - High:** Provides strong encryption for stream data.
    *   **Data Tampering Mitigation - Medium:** Offers some data integrity protection.
*   **Currently Implemented:** RTMPS is not implemented; only regular RTMP is enabled.
*   **Missing Implementation:** RTMPS needs to be configured with a dedicated SSL server block in the Nginx RTMP configuration. SSL certificates are required.
