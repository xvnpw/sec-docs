# Threat Model Analysis for arut/nginx-rtmp-module

## Threat: [Malformed RTMP Packet Processing](./threats/malformed_rtmp_packet_processing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts and sends malformed RTMP packets to the server. The module's parsing logic fails to handle these packets correctly, potentially leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the Nginx worker process handling the RTMP connection. Potential for arbitrary code execution if memory corruption vulnerabilities are present.
*   **Affected Component:** RTMP input handler within the module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict RTMP protocol parsing and validation.
    *   Discard packets that do not conform to the expected structure.
    *   Consider using a well-vetted RTMP parsing library if feasible.
    *   Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Stream Data Handling](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_stream_data_handling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends an RTMP stream with excessively large data chunks or manipulates data sizes in a way that exceeds allocated buffer sizes within the module's processing logic. This can lead to buffer overflows, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) through crashes. Potential for arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server.
*   **Affected Component:** RTMP stream data processing functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement bounds checking on all data received from RTMP streams.
    *   Use memory-safe programming practices and languages where applicable.
    *   Regularly audit the codebase for potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Stream Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service_via_stream_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the server with a large number of RTMP streams, consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and overwhelming the module and the Nginx server, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), preventing legitimate users from publishing or viewing streams.
*   **Affected Component:** RTMP connection handling, Nginx worker processes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement connection limits per client IP address.
    *   Use rate limiting techniques to restrict the number of new connections or streams per time unit.
    *   Configure Nginx's `limit_conn` and `limit_req` directives.
    *   Consider using a firewall to block suspicious traffic.

## Threat: [Path Traversal in Recording Paths](./threats/path_traversal_in_recording_paths.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the recording path configuration (if user-configurable or derived from user input) to write recording files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially overwriting critical system files or gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to system compromise or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Recording path handling, configuration parsing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize any user-provided input used in constructing recording paths.
    *   Use absolute paths for recording directories in the configuration.
    *   Implement checks to prevent writing files outside of the intended recording directory.
