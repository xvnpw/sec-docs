## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RTMP Protocol Vulnerabilities -> Malicious Stream Injection -> Inject Malicious Metadata -> [CRITICAL] Execute Arbitrary Code on Server (via vulnerable metadata parsing)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rtmp_protocol_vulnerabilities_-_malicious_stream_injection_-_inject_malicious_metadata_-__cr_eabaceab.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious RTMP stream that includes specially crafted metadata. If the nginx-rtmp-module or the application processing the stream doesn't properly sanitize or validate this metadata, it can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This could allow the attacker to gain complete control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RTMP Protocol Vulnerabilities -> Denial of Service (DoS) via RTMP -> [CRITICAL] Send Large Number of Connection Requests](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rtmp_protocol_vulnerabilities_-_denial_of_service__dos__via_rtmp_-__critical__send_large_num_37925c6f.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker floods the server with a large number of connection requests to the RTMP service. This can overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), making it unresponsive to legitimate users and effectively causing a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RTMP Protocol Vulnerabilities -> Denial of Service (DoS) via RTMP -> Send Malformed RTMP Packets (crashing the module or Nginx)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rtmp_protocol_vulnerabilities_-_denial_of_service__dos__via_rtmp_-_send_malformed_rtmp_packe_d0c71c15.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends RTMP packets that violate the protocol specification or contain unexpected data. This can exploit vulnerabilities in the nginx-rtmp-module's parsing logic, leading to crashes of the module itself or even the entire Nginx server, resulting in a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit nginx-rtmp-module Specific Vulnerabilities -> HIGH RISK Exploit Known CVEs in nginx-rtmp-module -> [CRITICAL] Identify and Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nginx-rtmp-module_specific_vulnerabilities_-_high_risk_exploit_known_cves_in_nginx-rtmp-modu_81c299bb.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The nginx-rtmp-module, like any software, may have publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs). Attackers can identify these vulnerabilities and use readily available exploit code to compromise the application. The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit nginx-rtmp-module Specific Vulnerabilities -> HIGH RISK Configuration Exploitation -> [CRITICAL] Weak Authentication Configuration -> Brute-force or Dictionary Attack on RTMP Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nginx-rtmp-module_specific_vulnerabilities_-_high_risk_configuration_exploitation_-__critica_f3f0c2a9.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the authentication mechanism for publishing or subscribing to RTMP streams is not properly configured with strong credentials, attackers can attempt to guess the credentials using brute-force or dictionary attacks. Successful authentication allows them to potentially publish malicious streams, subscribe to sensitive streams, or perform other unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Stream Handling -> HIGH RISK Stream Interception and Manipulation -> Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on RTMP Connection (if not using RTMPS)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_stream_handling_-_high_risk_stream_interception_and_manipulation_-_man-in-the-middl_5e94ec8d.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the RTMP connection between the publisher and the server (or the server and the subscriber) is not encrypted using RTMPS (RTMP over TLS/SSL), an attacker positioned on the network can intercept the communication. This allows them to eavesdrop on the stream content, modify it in transit, or inject malicious content into the stream without the knowledge of the legitimate parties.
