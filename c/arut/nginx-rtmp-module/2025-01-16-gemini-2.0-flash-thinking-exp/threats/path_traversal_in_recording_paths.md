## Deep Analysis of Path Traversal in Recording Paths

**1. Vulnerability Breakdown:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the potential for an attacker to manipulate the string used to define the location where recording files are saved. If the recording path is constructed using user-provided input or is derived from user-controlled configuration without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject path traversal sequences like `../` to navigate outside the intended recording directory.

**How it Works:**

*   **Configuration Dependence:** The `nginx-rtmp-module` likely uses configuration directives to specify where recordings should be saved. If these directives allow for user-defined paths or incorporate user input, they become potential attack vectors.
*   **String Concatenation:**  The module might construct the final recording path by concatenating a base directory with a filename or subdirectory derived from user input (e.g., stream name, application name). Without proper validation, malicious input can be injected during this concatenation.
*   **File System Interpretation:** The underlying operating system's file system interprets the `../` sequence as a command to move up one directory level. By strategically injecting multiple `../` sequences, an attacker can traverse the directory structure to arbitrary locations.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine the configuration allows setting a base recording path and the filename is derived from the stream name.

```nginx
rtmp {
    server {
        listen 1935;
        application live {
            live on;
            record all;
            record_path /var/www/media/recordings; # Base path
            record_file $app-$name-$date.flv; # Filename pattern
        }
    }
}
```

If an attacker can control the `$app` or `$name` variables (e.g., through a specially crafted stream name), they could inject malicious sequences:

*   **Malicious Stream Name:**  Instead of a legitimate stream name, the attacker uses something like `../../../../etc/nginx/conf.d/malicious`. This could lead to a recording file being written to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/malicious-live-stream-date.flv`, potentially overwriting critical configuration files.

**2. Technical Details and Potential Weak Points:**

*   **Configuration Parsing Logic:** The code responsible for parsing the `record_path` and `record_file` directives is a critical point of analysis. We need to understand how these values are extracted and stored. Are there any checks for invalid characters or path traversal sequences during parsing?
*   **String Manipulation Functions:** The functions used to construct the final recording path (likely involving string concatenation or formatting) are potential areas for vulnerabilities. Are these functions susceptible to buffer overflows if the injected path becomes too long? While path traversal is the primary concern, related memory safety issues can exacerbate the problem.
*   **File System API Calls:** The functions used to open and write the recording files (e.g., `fopen`, `open` in C/C++) are the final point of interaction with the file system. The module needs to ensure that the path passed to these functions is safe.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The most significant weakness is likely the absence or inadequacy of input validation and sanitization on any user-controlled data that influences the recording path.

**3. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Stream Names/Application Names:** As illustrated in the example, if the recording filename or subdirectory is derived from the stream name or application name, attackers can manipulate these values.
*   **Configuration Injection (Less Likely but Possible):** In scenarios where configuration files are dynamically generated or influenced by external sources, an attacker might try to inject malicious path components directly into the configuration.
*   **API Manipulation (If Applicable):** If the `nginx-rtmp-module` exposes an API for managing recordings or their paths, vulnerabilities in this API could be exploited.

**4. Impact Analysis (Detailed):**

A successful path traversal attack can have severe consequences:

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** The attacker gains the ability to write files to any location on the server where the nginx process has write permissions.
*   **System Compromise:**
    *   **Overwriting Critical System Files:** Attackers could overwrite essential system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, systemd unit files), leading to system instability, privilege escalation, or complete system takeover.
    *   **Web Shell Deployment:** Attackers could write executable code (e.g., PHP, Python scripts) to web-accessible directories, creating a backdoor for remote command execution.
    *   **Configuration Manipulation:** Overwriting nginx configuration files could allow attackers to redirect traffic, disable security features, or inject malicious code into served content.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Filling Disk Space:**  Attackers could repeatedly write large recording files to the root partition or other critical file systems, leading to disk exhaustion and system crashes.
    *   **Overwriting Critical Application Files:**  Disrupting the functionality of the `nginx-rtmp-module` or other applications by overwriting their files.
*   **Data Breach:** While less direct, if the attacker can write to directories containing sensitive data, they could potentially exfiltrate it.

**5. Root Cause Analysis:**

The root cause of this vulnerability stems from:

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Lack of proper checks and sanitization of user-provided input used in constructing recording paths.
*   **Reliance on User Input for Critical Operations:** Allowing user-controlled data to directly influence file system operations without strict validation.
*   **Lack of Path Normalization:** Not canonicalizing paths to resolve relative references (`.`, `..`) before using them for file system operations.
*   **Inadequate Security Awareness:**  Potentially a lack of awareness among developers regarding the risks associated with path traversal vulnerabilities.

**6. Detailed Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations:**

*   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Whitelist Approach:** Define a strict set of allowed characters for any user-provided input that contributes to the recording path (e.g., alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores). Reject any input containing other characters, especially path traversal sequences (`../`, `..\\`).
    *   **Path Canonicalization:** Use functions provided by the operating system or programming language to normalize paths, resolving relative references and ensuring a consistent representation.
    *   **Regular Expression Matching:** Employ regular expressions to validate the format of user-provided input against expected patterns.
*   **Use Absolute Paths for Recording Directories:**
    *   **Configuration Best Practice:**  Strongly recommend or enforce the use of absolute paths for the `record_path` directive in the configuration. This eliminates ambiguity and prevents attackers from manipulating the base directory.
    *   **Documentation Emphasis:** Clearly document the importance of using absolute paths and provide examples in the module's documentation.
*   **Implement Boundary Checks:**
    *   **Path Prefix Check:** Before writing any recording file, verify that the constructed absolute path starts with the intended base recording directory. This prevents writing files outside the designated area.
    *   **Chroot Jails (Advanced):** For highly sensitive environments, consider using chroot jails or containerization to restrict the file system access of the nginx process.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the nginx worker processes run with the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks. Avoid running them as root.
*   **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly conduct security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on file handling and path construction logic.
*   **Security Linters and Static Analysis Tools:** Integrate security linters and static analysis tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect potential path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   **Consider Alternative Recording Mechanisms:** Explore alternative approaches to managing recordings that minimize reliance on user-provided path components, such as using a dedicated recording service with a well-defined API.
*   **Rate Limiting and Input Validation on API Endpoints:** If API endpoints are involved in managing recordings, implement rate limiting and robust input validation to prevent abuse.

**Conclusion:**

The "Path Traversal in Recording Paths" threat poses a significant risk to the security and stability of applications using the `nginx-rtmp-module`. By understanding the mechanics of this vulnerability and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the attack surface and protect against potential exploitation. A layered security approach, combining input validation, secure configuration practices, and regular security assessments, is crucial for effectively addressing this threat.
