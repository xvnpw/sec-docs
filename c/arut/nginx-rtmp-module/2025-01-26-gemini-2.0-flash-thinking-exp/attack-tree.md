## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application Using nginx-rtmp-module](./attack_tree_paths/1_0__critical_node__compromise_application_using_nginx-rtmp-module.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal of the attacker. Success at any of the child nodes contributes to achieving this overall objective.
*   **Attack Vectors (Summarized by Child Nodes):**
    *   Denial of Service attacks to disrupt availability.
    *   Authentication and Authorization bypass to gain unauthorized control.
    *   Malicious content injection to harm users or reputation.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Disrupt Service Availability (Denial of Service - DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__high_risk_path__critical_node__disrupt_service_availability__denial_of_service_-_dos_.md)

*   **Description:**  This path focuses on making the streaming service unavailable to legitimate users. DoS attacks are generally easier to execute and can have immediate impact.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (1.1.1):** Overwhelming the server with requests or data to consume resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) and cause service degradation or failure.
    *   **Protocol-Level Exploits (1.1.2):** Exploiting weaknesses in the RTMP protocol handling to cause server errors, crashes, or hangs.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__high_risk_path__critical_node__resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:**  This is a common DoS technique targeting server resources.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.1.1.1 [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] High Connection Count Attack:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Flooding the RTMP server with a massive number of connection requests.
        *   **Mechanism:** Attackers use botnets or distributed tools to initiate numerous RTMP connections simultaneously.
        *   **Impact:**  Exhausts server connection limits, memory, and CPU, preventing legitimate users from connecting and potentially crashing the server.
    *   **1.1.1.2 Large Stream Data Attack (Not in High-Risk Subtree, but related):** While not marked as High-Risk Path in the focused tree based on previous estimations, it's worth noting as a resource exhaustion vector.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Sending extremely large or malformed data streams to the RTMP server.
        *   **Mechanism:** Attackers publish streams with unusually large data chunks or crafted data that consumes excessive processing power or memory during handling.
        *   **Impact:** Overwhelms server processing capabilities, potentially leading to hangs, crashes, or service degradation.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Protocol-Level DoS](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__high_risk_path__critical_node__protocol-level_dos.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the RTMP protocol implementation within `nginx-rtmp-module`.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.1.2.1 [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] RTMP Handshake Exploits:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Sending malformed or incomplete RTMP handshake messages.
        *   **Mechanism:** Attackers craft RTMP handshake packets that deviate from the protocol specification in ways that cause the `nginx-rtmp-module` to get stuck in handshake processing, consume excessive resources, or crash.
        *   **Impact:** Prevents legitimate connections, exhausts server resources during handshake processing, or causes service crashes.
    *   **1.1.2.2 [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Malformed RTMP Messages:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted RTMP messages with invalid headers, data types, or commands.
        *   **Mechanism:** Attackers create RTMP messages that violate the protocol structure or contain unexpected data. When `nginx-rtmp-module` attempts to parse these malformed messages, it can lead to parsing errors, unexpected behavior, crashes, or resource exhaustion.
        *   **Impact:** Service disruption, potential crashes due to parsing errors, or unexpected behavior in the streaming service.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 [HIGH RISK PATH] Gain Unauthorized Access or Control](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__high_risk_path__gain_unauthorized_access_or_control.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on bypassing security controls to gain unauthorized access to publishing streams or managing the streaming service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.2.1 [HIGH RISK PATH] Authentication/Authorization Bypass (If Implemented by Application):** Exploiting weaknesses in the application's authentication and authorization mechanisms that are intended to control access to RTMP publishing.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 [HIGH RISK PATH] Authentication/Authorization Bypass (If Implemented by Application)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__high_risk_path__authenticationauthorization_bypass__if_implemented_by_application_.md)

*   **Description:**  Targeting weaknesses in how the application verifies user identity and permissions for publishing streams.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.2.1.1 [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Weak or Default Credentials:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Using easily guessable passwords or default credentials for accounts that are supposed to be protected.
        *   **Mechanism:** Attackers attempt common usernames and passwords, or exploit default credentials that were not changed during setup.
        *   **Impact:**  Gains unauthorized access to publishing streams, allowing attackers to inject malicious content, disrupt legitimate streams, or gain control over the streaming service's content.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 [HIGH RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Content into Streams](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__high_risk_path__inject_malicious_content_into_streams.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on injecting harmful or unwanted content into the media streams served by the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.3.1 [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Stream Data Injection:** Injecting malicious data directly into the media stream itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Stream Data Injection](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__high_risk_path__critical_node__stream_data_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Directly manipulating the content of the media stream.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.3.1.1 [HIGH RISK PATH] Malicious Media Stream Injection:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Publishing a stream that contains malicious media content.
        *   **Mechanism:** Attackers, having gained unauthorized publishing access (e.g., through authentication bypass), publish a stream that contains video or audio with embedded exploits, phishing content, propaganda, or other harmful material.
        *   **Impact:**  Reputational damage to the service, potential client-side exploits if viewers' media players are vulnerable to the injected content, serving harmful or unwanted content to users.
