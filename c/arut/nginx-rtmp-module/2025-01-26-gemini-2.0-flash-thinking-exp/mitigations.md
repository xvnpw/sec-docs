# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for arut/nginx-rtmp-module

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Authentication for Publishing](./mitigation_strategies/implement_authentication_for_publishing.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Choose an authentication method supported by `nginx-rtmp-module`, primarily HTTP callback authentication using the `on_publish` directive.
*   Step 2: Configure the `on_publish` directive within the `rtmp` block and specific `application` blocks in your Nginx configuration.  Specify the URL of your authentication backend service.
*   Step 3: Ensure your authentication backend service is implemented to receive HTTP POST requests from `nginx-rtmp-module` when a client attempts to publish.
*   Step 4: The backend service should validate publisher credentials and return an HTTP 200 OK to allow publishing or a 403 Forbidden to deny it.
*   Step 5: Utilize `allow publish` and `deny publish` directives in conjunction with `on_publish` for more granular access control based on IP addresses or network ranges if needed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized Stream Publishing - Severity: High
*   Content Spoofing - Severity: Medium to High
*   Resource Abuse - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized Stream Publishing: High Risk Reduction
*   Content Spoofing: Medium to High Risk Reduction
*   Resource Abuse: Medium Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:** Partial - Basic HTTP callback authentication is configured for the main application using `on_publish`, but it's not consistently applied across all applications and stream types.

**Missing Implementation:** Consistent and robust authentication for publishing across all applications and stream types using `on_publish`. Strengthening the authentication backend and ensuring it's correctly integrated with `nginx-rtmp-module` configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Authentication for Playing](./mitigation_strategies/implement_authentication_for_playing.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Choose HTTP callback authentication using the `on_play` directive, as it's the primary method supported by `nginx-rtmp-module` for playback authentication.
*   Step 2: Configure the `on_play` directive within the `rtmp` block and specific `application` blocks in your Nginx configuration. Specify the URL of your authentication backend service for playback.
*   Step 3: Implement your authentication backend service to handle HTTP POST requests from `nginx-rtmp-module` when a client attempts to play a stream.
*   Step 4: The backend service should validate viewer credentials and stream access permissions, returning HTTP 200 OK to allow playback or 403 Forbidden to deny it.
*   Step 5: Use `allow play` and `deny play` directives alongside `on_play` for IP-based access control if required.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized Stream Access - Severity: High
*   Data Breaches (Content Leakage) - Severity: High
*   Resource Abuse (Playback Bandwidth) - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized Stream Access: High Risk Reduction
*   Data Breaches (Content Leakage): High Risk Reduction
*   Resource Abuse (Playback Bandwidth): Medium Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:** No - Stream playback is currently publicly accessible without authentication using `on_play` or any other `nginx-rtmp-module` authentication feature.

**Missing Implementation:** Implementing authentication for stream playback across all applications and stream types using `on_play`. Developing and deploying an authentication backend for playback and configuring `nginx-rtmp-module` with the `on_play` directive.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Concurrent Connections](./mitigation_strategies/limit_concurrent_connections.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Define acceptable limits for concurrent connections to your RTMP applications.
*   Step 2: Configure Nginx's `limit_conn_zone` directive in the `http` block to create a shared memory zone for tracking connection counts, often based on IP addresses.
*   Step 3: Apply the `limit_conn` directive within the `rtmp` block or specific `application` blocks to enforce connection limits for RTMP connections.  This directly impacts `nginx-rtmp-module` connections.
*   Step 4: Customize the error response for connection limit violations as needed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Connection Flooding DoS - Severity: High
*   Resource Exhaustion (Connection Limits) - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Connection Flooding DoS: High Risk Reduction
*   Resource Exhaustion (Connection Limits): Medium Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:** Yes - Basic connection limits are configured at the HTTP level using `limit_conn`, but not specifically tuned or applied within the `rtmp` context or `application` blocks for `nginx-rtmp-module`.

**Missing Implementation:** Fine-grained connection limits specifically tailored for RTMP applications by applying `limit_conn` within the `rtmp` block or `application` blocks.  Potentially separate limits for publishing and playing within RTMP applications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Publishing and Playing](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_publishing_and_playing.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Determine appropriate request rate limits for publishing and playing streams to prevent abuse.
*   Step 2: Configure Nginx's `limit_req_zone` directive in the `http` block to set up shared memory zones for tracking request rates, typically based on IP addresses.
*   Step 3: Use the `limit_req` directive within the `rtmp` block or `application` blocks to enforce rate limits on RTMP requests. This can help control the rate of `publish` and `play` requests handled by `nginx-rtmp-module`.
*   Step 4: Customize the error response for rate limit violations.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Request Flooding DoS - Severity: High
*   Brute-Force Attacks (Publishing/Playing Credentials) - Severity: Medium
*   Resource Exhaustion (Request Processing) - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Request Flooding DoS: High Risk Reduction
*   Brute-Force Attacks (Publishing/Playing Credentials): Medium Risk Reduction
*   Resource Exhaustion (Request Processing): Medium Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:** No - Rate limiting is not currently implemented for publishing or playing streams specifically within the `rtmp` context.

**Missing Implementation:** Implementing rate limiting for both publishing and playing streams by configuring `limit_req_zone` and `limit_req` directives within the `rtmp` block or `application` blocks to directly affect `nginx-rtmp-module` request handling.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for Streams (using Timeouts)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_streams__using_timeouts_.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Utilize `nginx-rtmp-module`'s timeout directives to limit resource consumption related to stream and session durations. Focus on:
    *   `rtmp_idle_stream_timeout`:  Configure a timeout to automatically close idle streams that are not actively publishing or playing data.
    *   `rtmp_session_timeout`: Set a maximum session timeout to limit the duration of RTMP sessions, regardless of stream activity.
    *   `rtmp_auto_push_timeout`: If using auto-pushing, configure a timeout for auto-push connections.
*   Step 2: Set appropriate timeout values based on your expected stream durations and application requirements. Shorter timeouts can help reclaim resources more quickly.
*   Step 3: Monitor the impact of timeout configurations on legitimate stream usage and adjust as needed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Resource Exhaustion (Stream-Specific) - Severity: Medium
*   Long-Running Connection DoS - Severity: Medium
*   Unfair Resource Allocation - Severity: Low to Medium

**Impact:**
*   Resource Exhaustion (Stream-Specific): Medium Risk Reduction
*   Long-Running Connection DoS: Medium Risk Reduction
*   Unfair Resource Allocation: Low to Medium Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:** Yes - Default `nginx-rtmp-module` timeout configurations are likely in place, but they haven't been specifically tuned for optimal resource management or security.

**Missing Implementation:** Reviewing and optimizing `nginx-rtmp-module`'s `rtmp_idle_stream_timeout`, `rtmp_session_timeout`, and `rtmp_auto_push_timeout` directives.  Tuning these timeouts to proactively limit resource consumption from idle or long-running streams and sessions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Timeout Configuration (RTMP Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/connection_timeout_configuration__rtmp_specific_.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Focus on configuring `nginx-rtmp-module` specific timeout directives to control connection behavior:
    *   `rtmp_session_timeout`:  As mentioned above, this limits the overall session duration.
    *   Potentially consider Nginx core timeouts like `client_header_timeout` and `client_body_timeout` if they are relevant to the initial RTMP handshake or connection setup phases (though less directly `nginx-rtmp-module` specific, they can still impact RTMP connections).
*   Step 2: Set appropriate values for `rtmp_session_timeout` to prevent sessions from lingering indefinitely, especially if clients become unresponsive or malicious.
*   Step 3: Test timeout configurations to ensure they don't prematurely disconnect legitimate clients under normal network conditions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Slowloris DoS Attacks - Severity: Medium (Indirectly, by limiting session duration).
*   Hung Connection DoS - Severity: Medium
*   Resource Exhaustion (Connection State) - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Slowloris DoS Attacks: Medium Risk Reduction (Indirectly helps by limiting session lifespan).
*   Hung Connection DoS: Medium Risk Reduction
*   Resource Exhaustion (Connection State): Medium Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:** Yes - Default Nginx and `nginx-rtmp-module` timeout configurations are active, but likely not optimized for security in the RTMP context.

**Missing Implementation:**  Specifically reviewing and tuning `rtmp_session_timeout` to enhance resilience against hung connections and DoS attempts.  Considering the impact of Nginx core timeouts on RTMP connection establishment and adjusting if necessary.
