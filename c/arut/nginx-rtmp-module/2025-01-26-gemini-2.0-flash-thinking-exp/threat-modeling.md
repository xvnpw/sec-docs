# Threat Model Analysis for arut/nginx-rtmp-module

## Threat: [RTMP Packet Parsing Overflow](./threats/rtmp_packet_parsing_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted RTMP packets containing oversized or malformed data fields. This can exploit buffer overflows in the module's RTMP parsing logic, potentially leading to memory corruption and allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Server Crash, Service Disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** `nginx-rtmp-module` - RTMP Protocol Parsing functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `nginx-rtmp-module` updated to the latest version.
        *   Implement input validation at the application level where possible, although direct control over RTMP parsing is limited.
        *   Use memory safety tools during development and testing to detect potential buffer overflows in custom modules or extensions interacting with `nginx-rtmp-module`.

## Threat: [Malformed Media Stream Handling Vulnerability](./threats/malformed_media_stream_handling_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a media stream with malformed or malicious data embedded within the audio or video stream. This could exploit vulnerabilities in the module's stream processing logic or potentially in underlying libraries used by the module (if any) for media handling, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Server Crash, Service Disruption, Potential for limited code execution depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** `nginx-rtmp-module` - Media Stream Handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `nginx-rtmp-module` and Nginx updated.
        *   Limit accepted media codecs and formats to reduce the attack surface.
        *   Sanitize or validate media streams at the application level before publishing if possible.
        *   Monitor server resource usage for anomalies during stream processing.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Stream Publishing](./threats/unauthenticated_stream_publishing.md)

*   **Description:**  If authentication is not properly configured *within the context of `nginx-rtmp-module` using its directives*, an attacker can publish unauthorized RTMP streams to the server. This allows them to inject arbitrary content into the streaming service, potentially defacing content, injecting malicious content, or disrupting legitimate streams. This threat is directly related to how the module's authentication features are (or are not) used.
    *   **Impact:** Content Defacement, Service Disruption, Injection of Malicious Content, Resource Abuse.
    *   **Affected Component:** `nginx-rtmp-module` - Authentication mechanisms (specifically `on_publish` directive), Nginx configuration related to the module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication using `on_publish` directive in `nginx-rtmp-module` configuration.
        *   Verify user credentials against a secure backend (e.g., database, API) *using the module's callback mechanisms*.
        *   Enforce authentication for all publishing endpoints configured within the `rtmp` block.
        *   Regularly review and test authentication configurations specific to `nginx-rtmp-module`.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Stream Playback](./threats/unauthenticated_stream_playback.md)

*   **Description:** If authorization is not properly configured *within the context of `nginx-rtmp-module` using its directives*, an attacker can access and view private or restricted RTMP streams without authorization. This leads to information disclosure and privacy violations. This threat is directly related to how the module's authorization features are (or are not) used.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Privacy Breach, Unauthorized Access to Content.
    *   **Affected Component:** `nginx-rtmp-module` - Authorization mechanisms (specifically `on_play` directive), Nginx configuration related to the module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authorization using `on_play` directive in `nginx-rtmp-module` configuration.
        *   Verify user permissions against a secure backend *using the module's callback mechanisms*.
        *   Enforce authorization for all playback endpoints configured within the `rtmp` block.
        *   Use secure protocols for delivery to clients if confidentiality is critical (e.g., RTMPS, HTTPS for HLS/DASH) *in conjunction with the module's output directives*.

## Threat: [RTMP Protocol DoS Attack](./threats/rtmp_protocol_dos_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the server with a large number of RTMP connection requests or malformed RTMP messages *specifically targeting the RTMP ports handled by `nginx-rtmp-module`*. This can overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) and prevent legitimate users from accessing the streaming service.
    *   **Impact:** Service Disruption, Denial of Service for legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `nginx-rtmp-module` - RTMP Protocol Handling, Nginx core *when processing RTMP connections*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting at the Nginx level (e.g., `limit_conn`, `limit_req`) *specifically targeting the RTMP listener block*.
        *   Use firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to filter malicious traffic *directed at RTMP ports*.
        *   Configure connection limits and resource quotas in Nginx *within the RTMP context if possible*.
        *   Monitor server resource usage and implement alerts for DoS attacks *related to RTMP traffic*.
