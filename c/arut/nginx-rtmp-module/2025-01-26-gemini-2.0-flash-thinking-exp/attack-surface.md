# Attack Surface Analysis for arut/nginx-rtmp-module

## Attack Surface: [RTMP Buffer Overflow](./attack_surfaces/rtmp_buffer_overflow.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities arising from writing beyond the allocated buffer memory when processing RTMP messages within the `nginx-rtmp-module`.
nginx-rtmp-module Contribution: The module's core function is parsing and processing binary RTMP messages. Insufficient input validation during this process can lead to buffer overflows.
Example: An attacker sends a crafted RTMP command message with an excessively long string parameter. The `nginx-rtmp-module` fails to validate the length, and when copying the string into a fixed-size buffer, it overwrites adjacent memory regions.
Impact: Code execution, denial of service, information disclosure. Successful exploitation can grant the attacker complete control over the server.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Strict Input Validation: Implement rigorous input validation within the `nginx-rtmp-module`'s code for all RTMP message fields, especially lengths and data sizes.
    *   Memory-Safe Functions: Utilize memory-safe string handling functions and avoid unbounded memory operations when processing RTMP data.
    *   Code Reviews and Security Audits: Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits specifically focusing on RTMP message parsing routines within the `nginx-rtmp-module` to identify and remediate potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
    *   Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP): Enable operating system-level security features like ASLR and DEP to hinder exploitation attempts, even if a buffer overflow vulnerability exists.

## Attack Surface: [RTMP Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/rtmp_command_injection.md)

Description: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the handling of RTMP commands within `nginx-rtmp-module` to inject malicious commands and gain unauthorized access or manipulate stream behavior.
nginx-rtmp-module Contribution: The module interprets and processes RTMP commands such as `connect`, `publish`, and `play`. Improper sanitization or validation of these commands can allow for injection attacks.
Example: An attacker crafts a `connect` command with a manipulated `app` parameter. If the `nginx-rtmp-module` uses this parameter in a server-side command execution context (e.g., constructing file paths or system commands) without proper sanitization, it could lead to command injection.
Impact: Unauthorized access to streams, manipulation of stream behavior, potentially server-side command execution depending on the module's internal processing and privileges.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Command Parameter Sanitization: Thoroughly sanitize and validate all parameters within RTMP commands processed by the `nginx-rtmp-module`. Implement strict whitelisting for allowed characters and command structures.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure the nginx worker processes running the `nginx-rtmp-module` operate with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Secure Configuration and Access Control:  Carefully configure access control lists (ACLs) and authentication mechanisms provided by the `nginx-rtmp-module` to restrict command execution and stream access to authorized users only. Regularly review and audit these configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass in RTMP Access Control](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass_in_rtmp_access_control.md)

Description: Circumventing authentication and authorization mechanisms implemented by or configured within the `nginx-rtmp-module` to gain unauthorized access to publish or play streams.
nginx-rtmp-module Contribution: The module provides directives like `allow publish`, `allow play`, and `deny` for access control. Weaknesses in the implementation or configuration of these mechanisms within the `nginx-rtmp-module` can lead to bypasses.
Example: If authentication for publishing streams relies solely on checking the client's IP address against an `allow publish` directive, an attacker could spoof their IP address or utilize an open proxy to bypass this restriction and publish unauthorized content.
Impact: Unauthorized stream publishing, unauthorized stream viewing, potential content manipulation, and reputational damage.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Strong Authentication Methods: Implement robust authentication methods beyond simple IP-based restrictions. Consider using token-based authentication, username/password combinations, or integration with external authentication services that are properly integrated with the `nginx-rtmp-module` if such features are available or can be developed.
    *   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): For highly sensitive streams, explore implementing MFA for publishing and viewing streams to add an extra layer of security.
    *   Regular Security Audits of Access Control Logic: Regularly review and test the access control logic configured within the `nginx-rtmp-module` to identify and address potential bypass vulnerabilities. Ensure configurations are correctly applied and enforced.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege (Access Control):  Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring access control rules. Only grant necessary permissions to users and applications, and default to denying access.
