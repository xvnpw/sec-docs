## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) - High-Risk Paths](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__-_high-risk_paths.md)

*   **Connection Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to overwhelm the server by opening a large number of RTMP connections without closing them. This consumes server resources (file descriptors, memory) and prevents legitimate clients from connecting.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Service Disruption)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement connection limits using Nginx directives like `limit_conn`.
        *   Set appropriate connection timeouts (`timeout` directive).
        *   Monitor connection counts and alert on suspicious patterns.
        *   Use a firewall to block IPs with excessive connection attempts.

*   **Slowloris-style RTMP Connections [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Similar to the HTTP Slowloris attack, the attacker establishes RTMP connections but sends data very slowly. This keeps connections open for extended periods, consuming server resources and blocking legitimate clients.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Service Disruption)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Configure appropriate timeouts for RTMP connections (e.g., `timeout` directive).  Ensure the server doesn't wait indefinitely for data.
        *   Monitor connection states and identify slow clients.
        *   Use Nginx's `limit_req` directive (although primarily for HTTP, it can offer some protection).

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Stream Access - High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_stream_access_-_high-risk_path.md)

*   **Bypass Access Controls [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits weaknesses in the module's authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain access to streams they shouldn't have access to. This could involve manipulating stream keys, exploiting flaws in `allow`/`deny` rules, or bypassing `on_publish`/`on_play` script checks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized Access to Streams)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Thoroughly test all access control configurations.
        *   Use strong authentication (secure passwords, tokens).
        *   Regularly audit access logs.
        *   Ensure `on_publish` and `on_play` scripts are secure and do not leak information or allow unauthorized access.  Apply secure coding practices to these scripts.
        *   Use a whitelist approach for allowed stream keys/paths.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication if possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__-_high-risk_paths_and_critical_nodes.md)

*   **Command Injection [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  If the `exec` directive is used and incorporates user-supplied input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (but *very* high if `exec` is used improperly)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete System Compromise)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Avoid `exec` if possible.**  Find alternative solutions that don't involve executing external commands.
        *   **If `exec` is unavoidable:**
            *   **Whitelist:**  Strictly control the allowed commands and arguments.  *Never* allow arbitrary commands.
            *   **Input Validation:**  Rigorously validate and sanitize *all* input using a whitelist approach.
            *   **Least Privilege:**  Run the spawned process with the absolute minimum necessary privileges.
            *   **Sandboxing:**  Isolate the executed process using chroot, containers, or other sandboxing techniques.

*   **Exploit Module Configuration Flaws [HIGH RISK]**
    * **Description:** Incorrect or insecure configurations of the module itself can create vulnerabilities. This is a broad category, encompassing various misconfigurations.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** High/Very High (depending on the specific flaw)
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard
    * **Mitigation:**
        * Follow the principle of least privilege.
        * Disable unnecessary features and directives.
        * Regularly review and audit the configuration.
        * Use a configuration management tool.
        * Validate configuration against known best practices.

*   **Critical Node: `exec` command (***)**
    *   **Description:**  The `exec` directive itself is a critical node.  Any use of `exec` introduces significant risk, and its misuse is a direct path to command injection.
    *   **Mitigation:** (Same as Command Injection above - this is the *most* critical point to address)

*  **Critical Node: `on_publish` (within Bypass Access Controls)**
    * **Description:** If `on_publish` uses a script, vulnerabilities in that script can be exploited.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * Secure coding practices for the script.
        * Rigorous input validation.
        * Run the script with minimum privileges.
