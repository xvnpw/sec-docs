Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Unauthorized Access to Recorded Streams" threat for the `nginx-rtmp-module`.

## Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Access to Recorded Streams

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Unauthorized Access to Recorded Streams" threat, identify the root causes and contributing factors, evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and propose additional or refined security measures to minimize the risk.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for developers and system administrators.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the `record` directive within the `nginx-rtmp-module` and its interaction with the underlying file system and Nginx's configuration.  We will consider:

*   The configuration options related to the `record` directive.
*   How `nginx-rtmp-module` handles file creation and permissions.
*   The interaction between the module's recording functionality and Nginx's broader HTTP serving capabilities.
*   The potential for misconfigurations and common attack vectors.
*   The interplay between the module, the operating system's file system permissions, and any external access control mechanisms.
*   Encryption at rest.

We will *not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities unrelated to the recording functionality (e.g., buffer overflows in the RTMP protocol handling).
*   General Nginx security best practices that are not directly related to the `record` directive.
*   Security of the streaming content *before* it reaches the recording stage.

**Methodology:**

We will employ a combination of techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the relevant parts of the `nginx-rtmp-module` source code (available on GitHub) to understand how recording is implemented, how file paths are handled, and how permissions are (or are not) managed.  This is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities at the code level.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:** We will analyze example configurations and documentation to identify common misconfigurations and insecure practices related to the `record` directive.
3.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:** We will expand upon the initial threat description, breaking it down into more specific attack scenarios.
4.  **Mitigation Evaluation:** We will critically assess the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations and identify any gaps or weaknesses.
5.  **Best Practices Research:** We will research industry best practices for securing file storage and access control in similar contexts.
6.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):** While we won't perform live testing in this document, we will conceptually outline how dynamic analysis (e.g., penetration testing) could be used to validate the findings of the static analysis and configuration review.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Attack Scenarios:**

Let's break down the "Unauthorized Access" threat into more concrete scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Direct File System Access (No HTTP):**
    *   **Attacker Goal:** Gain access to recorded files directly through the file system.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker exploits weak file system permissions on the recording directory or its parent directories.  This could involve:
        *   A compromised user account with read access to the directory.
        *   A misconfigured `umask` setting that results in overly permissive file creation.
        *   Exploitation of a separate vulnerability that allows the attacker to escalate privileges or bypass file system restrictions.
    *   **Example:** The `record` directive is set to `/var/www/recordings`, and this directory has permissions `777` (read, write, and execute for everyone).

*   **Scenario 2:  Unprotected HTTP Access:**
    *   **Attacker Goal:** Access recorded files via an HTTP request.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The recording directory is inadvertently exposed via an Nginx `location` block without any authentication or authorization.
    *   **Example:**
        ```nginx
        location /recordings {
            alias /var/www/recordings;  # No auth_basic, allow/deny, etc.
        }
        ```
        An attacker can simply navigate to `http://example.com/recordings/stream.flv` to download the recording.

*   **Scenario 3:  Directory Traversal (If Misconfigured):**
    *   **Attacker Goal:** Access files outside the intended recording directory.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  If the `alias` or `root` directive in Nginx is misconfigured in conjunction with the recording directory, a directory traversal attack *might* be possible, although this is less likely with proper Nginx configuration.  This would require a vulnerability *outside* the `nginx-rtmp-module` itself, but the recording setup could exacerbate the impact.
    *   **Example:** A poorly configured `alias` directive might allow an attacker to use `../` sequences in the URL to escape the intended directory.  This is primarily an Nginx configuration issue, but it's worth mentioning in the context of securing recorded streams.

* **Scenario 4: Predictable File Names:**
    * **Attacker Goal:** Guess the names of recorded files to access them.
    * **Attack Vector:** If the file naming convention used by `nginx-rtmp-module` is predictable (e.g., sequential numbering, timestamps without sufficient randomness), an attacker might be able to guess the names of recorded files and access them, even if directory listing is disabled.
    * **Example:** Files are named `stream1.flv`, `stream2.flv`, etc.

**2.2. Code Review (Conceptual - Key Areas):**

We need to examine the `nginx-rtmp-module` source code, focusing on these areas:

*   **`ngx_rtmp_record_open` (and related functions):**  This function (or its equivalent) is likely responsible for opening and creating the recording files.  We need to check:
    *   How the file path is constructed.  Is it based solely on user-provided input (the `record` directive), or are there any sanitization or validation steps?
    *   What file permissions are used when creating the file?  Does it use the system default `umask`, or does it explicitly set permissions?  If so, what are they?
    *   Are there any checks to prevent overwriting existing files unintentionally?
    *   Are there any checks to prevent the creation of files outside the intended directory (e.g., by using `..` in the file name)?

*   **File Naming Conventions:**  We need to understand how the module generates file names for recordings.  Is it predictable?  Does it include any random components to prevent guessing?

*   **Error Handling:**  How does the module handle errors during file creation or writing?  Are there any potential information leaks or vulnerabilities in the error handling logic?

*   **Interaction with Nginx Core:** How does the module interact with Nginx's core functionality, particularly regarding file serving and access control?  Does it rely entirely on Nginx's built-in mechanisms, or does it implement any custom logic?

**2.3. Mitigation Evaluation:**

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigations:

*   **"Store recorded files in a directory with restricted access permissions. Use strong file system permissions (e.g., `chmod`, `chown`)."**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  **Highly Effective (Essential).** This is the foundation of file system security.  Proper permissions (`700` or `750`, owned by the Nginx user, with the group potentially having read access if necessary) are crucial.
    *   **Gaps:**  Relies on the administrator to correctly configure and maintain permissions.  Doesn't address potential vulnerabilities within the module itself (e.g., if the module ignores or overrides these permissions).  Needs to be combined with a secure `umask` setting.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Emphasize the importance of using the *least privilege principle*.  The Nginx user should only have the minimum necessary permissions.  Document specific `chmod` and `chown` commands for administrators.

*   **"Do *not* make the recording directory directly accessible via HTTP unless absolutely necessary and properly secured (e.g., with authentication)."**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  **Highly Effective (Best Practice).**  Avoiding direct HTTP access is the best way to prevent unauthorized web-based access.
    *   **Gaps:**  Doesn't address direct file system access.  Administrators might still choose to make the directory accessible via HTTP.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Strongly discourage direct HTTP access.  If it *must* be done, provide clear instructions on using Nginx's authentication mechanisms.

*   **"If serving recorded files via HTTP, use Nginx's access control features (e.g., `auth_basic`, `allow`/`deny`) to restrict access."**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  **Effective (If Necessary).**  `auth_basic` provides basic password protection.  `allow`/`deny` can restrict access based on IP address.
    *   **Gaps:**  `auth_basic` transmits passwords in plain text (unless used with HTTPS).  IP-based restrictions can be bypassed with spoofing or proxies.  More robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., using a separate authentication server) might be preferable.
    *   **Recommendation:**  If HTTP access is required, recommend using HTTPS with `auth_basic` or, preferably, a more secure authentication method (e.g., integrating with an existing authentication system).  Consider using `auth_request` for more complex authorization scenarios.

*   **"Consider encrypting recorded files."**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  **Highly Effective (Defense in Depth).**  Encryption at rest protects the data even if an attacker gains access to the files.
    *   **Gaps:**  Adds complexity.  Requires key management.  Performance overhead.  Doesn't prevent unauthorized access to the *keys* themselves.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Strongly recommend encryption, especially for sensitive content.  Provide guidance on choosing an appropriate encryption method (e.g., using `dm-crypt` or `LUKS` at the file system level, or implementing application-level encryption).  Emphasize the importance of secure key management.

**2.4. Additional Recommendations:**

*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Nginx configuration and file system permissions.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege to all aspects of the system, including user accounts, file permissions, and Nginx configuration.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement robust monitoring and logging to detect unauthorized access attempts.  Log file access, Nginx access logs, and system logs should be monitored.
*   **Input Validation:** Even though the `record` directive takes a file path, ensure that the module performs some basic validation to prevent unexpected behavior (e.g., checking for invalid characters).
*   **Secure File Naming:** Use a file naming convention that includes a random component to make it difficult for attackers to guess file names.  Consider using a hash of the stream key or a UUID.
*   **Update Regularly:** Keep the `nginx-rtmp-module` and Nginx itself up to date to benefit from security patches.
*   **Consider a Separate Storage Server:** For large-scale deployments or high-security environments, consider storing recorded files on a separate, dedicated storage server with its own access control mechanisms. This isolates the recordings from the live streaming server.
* **Use a WAF:** Implement a Web Application Firewall to filter malicious requests.

### 3. Conclusion

The "Unauthorized Access to Recorded Streams" threat is a significant concern for deployments using the `nginx-rtmp-module`'s recording functionality.  The primary risk stems from a combination of weak file system permissions, insecure Nginx configurations (exposing the recording directory via HTTP), and potentially predictable file naming.

The proposed mitigations are generally effective, but they rely heavily on correct configuration and administration.  Encryption at rest is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.  A thorough code review of the `nginx-rtmp-module` is necessary to identify any potential vulnerabilities in the module's file handling logic.  By combining strong file system permissions, secure Nginx configuration, encryption, and regular security audits, the risk of unauthorized access can be significantly reduced.  The recommendations provided above offer a comprehensive approach to securing recorded streams.
