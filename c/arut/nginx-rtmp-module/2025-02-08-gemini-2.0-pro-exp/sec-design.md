Okay, let's create a design document for the `nginx-rtmp-module` project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

The primary goal of the `nginx-rtmp-module` is to extend Nginx, a widely-used web server, to handle real-time media streaming via the RTMP protocol. This enables users to set up their own streaming servers for live video and audio, potentially reducing reliance on third-party streaming platforms.  Key business priorities likely include:

*   Reliability: The module must provide stable and consistent streaming capabilities. Downtime or stream interruptions directly impact user experience.
*   Performance:  The module should handle a large number of concurrent streams and viewers with minimal latency.  Performance bottlenecks can lead to buffering and poor user experience.
*   Scalability: The architecture should allow for scaling the streaming infrastructure to accommodate growing audiences and increased demand.
*   Cost-Effectiveness:  Leveraging Nginx, an open-source web server, suggests a focus on cost-effective solutions compared to proprietary streaming server software.
*   Ease of Use and Configuration: While not explicitly stated, ease of configuration and management is crucial for adoption. Complex setups can deter users.
*   Extensibility: The module design should be open for future extensions and features.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Service Disruption:  Outages or instability in the streaming service leading to loss of viewers/users and potential reputational damage.
*   Performance Degradation:  Inability to handle peak loads, resulting in poor stream quality and user dissatisfaction.
*   Security Breaches:  Unauthorized access to streams, server compromise, or denial-of-service attacks disrupting the service.
*   Data Loss: Loss of recorded streams or configuration data.
*   High Operational Costs: Unexpectedly high infrastructure costs due to inefficient resource utilization.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Access Control (Publish/Play): The module provides directives (`allow`, `deny`) to control which clients can publish and play streams based on IP addresses. Implemented in `ngx_rtmp_access_module.c`.
*   security control: Authentication: Basic on-connect authentication is supported using `on_connect` directive and external control applications. Implemented in `ngx_rtmp_notify_module.c`.
*   security control: Secure Link: The module supports RTMP "secure link" feature, which uses a shared secret to generate time-limited URLs, preventing unauthorized access. Implemented in `ngx_rtmp_core_module.c`.
*   security control: Referrer Validation: The `secure_link` feature can also validate the SWF player's URL (referrer), adding another layer of protection. Implemented in `ngx_rtmp_core_module.c`.
*   security control: Exec Module: The `exec` directive allows executing external programs on certain events (e.g., `publish`, `play`), which *could* be used for custom security checks, but this is inherently risky if not carefully managed. Implemented in `ngx_rtmp_exec_module.c`.
*   security control: Nginx Core Security: The module inherits the security features and best practices of the underlying Nginx web server, including its event-driven architecture, which is generally resistant to certain types of attacks.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Limited Built-in Authentication: The built-in authentication mechanisms are relatively basic. More robust authentication (e.g., integration with external identity providers) requires custom development or external control applications.
*   accepted risk: Complexity of Configuration: Securely configuring the module, especially features like `exec` and external control applications, requires a good understanding of Nginx and the RTMP protocol. Misconfiguration can lead to vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on External Applications: Security often depends on the security of external applications used for authentication, authorization, or other control functions.
*   accepted risk: RTMP Protocol Limitations: RTMP itself has some inherent security limitations, and the module's security is ultimately bound by the protocol's capabilities.
*   accepted risk: No built-in encryption: RTMP protocol itself doesn't provide encryption.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement RTMPS support: Add support for RTMPS (RTMP over TLS/SSL) to encrypt the communication between clients and the server, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   security control: Enhanced Authentication: Integrate with more robust authentication systems, such as OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect, to provide stronger user authentication and authorization.
*   security control: Input Validation: Thoroughly validate all input received from clients, including stream names, URLs, and any other parameters, to prevent injection attacks.
*   security control: Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to mitigate denial-of-service attacks by limiting the number of connections or requests from a single IP address or user.
*   security control: Auditing and Logging: Implement comprehensive logging of all relevant events, including connection attempts, authentication successes/failures, and any errors, to facilitate security monitoring and incident response.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints.
    *   Secure storage of user credentials (if applicable).

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control to streams (publish and play).
    *   Ability to restrict access based on user roles or attributes.
    *   Integration with external authorization services.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all client-supplied data.
    *   Prevention of injection attacks (e.g., command injection, path traversal).

*   Cryptography:
    *   Support for RTMPS to encrypt communication.
    *   Secure generation and management of cryptographic keys (for secure link and RTMPS).

2.  Multi-Server Deployment: Multiple servers run Nginx and the RTMP module, potentially with a load balancer in front. This provides higher capacity and redundancy.
3.  Cloud-Based Deployment:  Deploying on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP, using virtual machines or container services (e.g., Kubernetes). This offers scalability and flexibility.
4.  Hybrid Deployment: A combination of on-premise and cloud-based servers.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Live Stream Delivery: The core process of delivering live video and audio streams to viewers.
*   Stream Recording: The process of recording streams for later playback or archival.
*   User Authentication and Authorization: Managing user access to streams and server resources.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   Stream Content: The actual video and audio data being streamed. Sensitivity depends on the content (e.g., public broadcast vs. private event).
*   User Credentials: Usernames, passwords, or other authentication tokens. High sensitivity.
*   Stream Metadata: Information about streams, such as titles, descriptions, and schedules. Moderate sensitivity.
*   Configuration Data: Server configuration files, including access control settings and secrets. High sensitivity.
