```markdown
# Deep Analysis: Command Injection in `nginx-rtmp-module` (`exec` Directives)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the command injection vulnerability associated with the `exec` directives (`exec`, `exec_pull`, `exec_push`, `exec_static`) within the `nginx-rtmp-module`.  We aim to:

*   Understand the precise mechanisms by which this vulnerability can be exploited.
*   Identify the specific code paths and configurations that increase risk.
*   Develop concrete, actionable recommendations for developers and system administrators to mitigate this risk effectively.
*   Go beyond the general description and provide specific examples and edge cases.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses *exclusively* on the command injection vulnerability arising from the use of the `exec`-related directives provided by the `nginx-rtmp-module`.  It does *not* cover:

*   Other potential vulnerabilities in the module (e.g., buffer overflows, authentication bypasses).
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or other software running on the server.
*   Vulnerabilities in custom scripts called by the `exec` directives (although we *will* discuss how to secure these scripts).
*   Vulnerabilities in HTTP callbacks (although we recommend them as a safer alternative).

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review (Conceptual):**  While we don't have direct access to modify the `nginx-rtmp-module` source code in this context, we will conceptually analyze the likely implementation based on the module's documented behavior and common C programming practices for handling external processes.  We'll make informed assumptions about how user input is likely processed and passed to the system's command execution facilities.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:** We will examine various `nginx.conf` configurations that utilize the `exec` directives, highlighting both dangerous and (relatively) safer patterns.
3.  **Exploit Scenario Development:** We will construct detailed exploit scenarios, demonstrating how an attacker might leverage this vulnerability.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:** We will critically evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of various mitigation strategies, including their limitations.
5.  **Best Practices Definition:** We will synthesize our findings into a set of clear, actionable best practices for secure configuration and usage of the `nginx-rtmp-module`.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. Mechanism of Exploitation

The core vulnerability lies in the way the `nginx-rtmp-module` handles user-supplied data when constructing commands for execution via the `exec` directives.  The module likely uses a system call like `system()`, `popen()`, or a combination of `fork()` and `exec()` to execute the configured command.  The critical flaw is the *direct concatenation* of user-supplied data (e.g., stream name, application name, arguments) into the command string *without proper sanitization or escaping*.

**Conceptual Code (Illustrative - NOT the actual module code):**

```c
// HIGHLY SIMPLIFIED and VULNERABLE example
char command[1024];
char *stream_name = get_stream_name_from_request(); // Get user input

// DANGEROUS: Direct concatenation without sanitization
snprintf(command, sizeof(command), "/usr/bin/my_script %s", stream_name);

system(command); // Execute the command
```

If `get_stream_name_from_request()` returns a malicious string like "`; rm -rf /;`", the resulting `command` becomes:

`/usr/bin/my_script ; rm -rf /;`

This will first execute `/usr/bin/my_script` (likely with no arguments, as the semicolon terminates the argument list), and *then* execute `rm -rf /`, potentially deleting the entire filesystem.

### 2.2. Vulnerable Configuration Examples

Here are several examples of vulnerable `nginx.conf` configurations, demonstrating different ways the `exec` directives can be misused:

**Example 1: Basic Command Injection**

```nginx
rtmp {
    server {
        listen 1935;
        application live {
            live on;
            exec /usr/bin/my_script $name;  # Vulnerable!
        }
    }
}
```

*   **Vulnerability:**  The `$name` variable (stream name) is directly inserted into the command.
*   **Exploit:**  Streaming to `rtmp://server/live/;evil_command;` will execute `evil_command`.

**Example 2:  Injection via Arguments**

```nginx
rtmp {
    server {
        listen 1935;
        application live {
            live on;
            exec /usr/bin/my_script arg1 $arg;  # Vulnerable!
        }
    }
}
```

*   **Vulnerability:** The `$arg` variable (passed as a query parameter in the RTMP URL) is directly inserted.
*   **Exploit:**  Streaming to `rtmp://server/live?arg=;evil_command;` will execute `evil_command`.

**Example 3:  `exec_push` Vulnerability**

```nginx
rtmp {
    server {
        listen 1935;
        application live {
            live on;
            exec_push /usr/bin/ffmpeg -i rtmp://localhost/$app/$name -c copy -f flv /tmp/$name.flv; # Vulnerable!
        }
    }
}
```

*   **Vulnerability:**  Both `$app` and `$name` are vulnerable to injection.  Even if the attacker can't control the entire command, they can inject options into `ffmpeg`, potentially leading to arbitrary file writes or other exploits.
*   **Exploit:**  Streaming to `rtmp://server/live/foo;--arbitrary-ffmpeg-option;` could trigger unexpected `ffmpeg` behavior.

**Example 4:  `exec_static` (Less Dynamic, Still Vulnerable)**

```nginx
rtmp {
    server {
        listen 1935;
        application live {
            live on;
            exec_static /usr/bin/my_script $app; # Vulnerable!
        }
    }
}
```
* Vulnerability: Although `exec_static` runs only once at startup, if `$app` is somehow configurable by an attacker (e.g., through a misconfigured web interface that modifies the nginx configuration), it's still vulnerable.

### 2.3. Edge Cases and Advanced Exploitation

*   **Shell Metacharacters:**  Attackers can use various shell metacharacters beyond semicolons (`;`) to achieve command injection.  These include:
    *   Backticks (`` ` ``): Execute a command and substitute its output.
    *   Dollar sign with parentheses (`$()`):  Similar to backticks.
    *   Pipes (`|`):  Redirect output to another command.
    *   Redirection (`>`, `<`, `>>`):  Redirect input/output to files.
    *   Ampersand (`&`):  Run a command in the background.
    *   Double ampersand (`&&`) and double pipe (`||`): Conditional execution.
*   **Escaping and Quoting Issues:**  Even if *some* escaping is attempted, it might be insufficient.  For example, simply escaping semicolons might not prevent injection if backticks or `$()` are used.  Incorrect quoting can also lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **Bypassing Whitelists:**  If a whitelist is implemented poorly (e.g., using regular expressions with flaws), attackers might be able to craft input that bypasses the whitelist.
*   **Time-Based Attacks:**  Even if direct command execution is prevented, attackers might be able to use time-based attacks to infer information about the system or cause denial of service.  For example, injecting a command that takes a long time to execute could reveal whether a certain file exists.
* **FFmpeg specific exploits:** If using `exec_push` with FFmpeg, attacker can use FFmpeg specific options to cause unexpected behavior, like writing to arbitrary files.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed Evaluation)

Let's revisit the mitigation strategies with a more critical eye:

1.  **Avoid `exec` if Possible (Strongest Recommendation):**
    *   **Pros:** Eliminates the attack surface entirely.  The most secure option.
    *   **Cons:**  May require significant code changes to implement alternative solutions (like HTTP callbacks).
    *   **Details:**  Use HTTP callbacks to a separate, secured application (e.g., a Python/Flask, Node.js, or Go application).  This application should handle any necessary processing and be designed with security in mind (input validation, parameterized queries, etc.).  The communication between nginx and the callback application should be secured (e.g., using HTTPS and authentication).

2.  **Strict Input Sanitization (if `exec` is unavoidable):**
    *   **Pros:**  Can reduce the risk if implemented correctly.
    *   **Cons:**  Extremely difficult to get right.  Prone to errors and bypasses.  Requires constant vigilance and updates.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Whitelist Approach (Mandatory):**  Define a *strict* whitelist of allowed characters or patterns for *each* input variable.  Reject *anything* that doesn't match the whitelist.  For example, if `$name` is expected to be an alphanumeric string, only allow `[a-zA-Z0-9]+`.
        *   **Escape *Everything* Else (as a Defense-in-Depth Measure):**  Even after whitelisting, escape any remaining characters that have special meaning in the shell (e.g., using a function like `escapeshellarg()` in PHP or equivalent in other languages).  This provides an extra layer of protection if the whitelist has flaws.
        *   **Regular Expression Caution:**  Be *extremely* careful when using regular expressions for whitelisting.  Complex regular expressions are often difficult to understand and can contain subtle vulnerabilities.  Keep them as simple as possible.
        *   **Context-Specific Sanitization:**  The sanitization rules must be tailored to the *specific* context of each input variable.  A single, generic sanitization function is unlikely to be sufficient.
        *   **Example (Conceptual - using a hypothetical `sanitize_alphanumeric` function):**
            ```c
            char *stream_name = get_stream_name_from_request();
            char *sanitized_name = sanitize_alphanumeric(stream_name); // Whitelist

            if (sanitized_name == NULL) {
                // Input is invalid; reject the request
                return;
            }

            char command[1024];
            snprintf(command, sizeof(command), "/usr/bin/my_script %s", sanitized_name);
            system(command);
            ```

3.  **Parameterization (Ideal, but Often Unsupported):**
    *   **Pros:**  The most secure way to execute external commands, as it prevents the shell from interpreting user input as code.
    *   **Cons:**  Often *not* directly supported by the `nginx-rtmp-module` or the called scripts.  Requires significant changes to both the module and the external scripts.
    *   **Details:**  This would involve using a system call like `execve()` (or a wrapper around it) that allows passing arguments as an array of strings, rather than a single command string.  The shell would *not* be involved in parsing the arguments.  This is the standard approach for preventing command injection in most programming languages (e.g., using `subprocess.run()` with a list of arguments in Python).  However, achieving this with the `nginx-rtmp-module` would likely require modifying the module's C code.

4.  **Least Privilege (nginx and script):**
    *   **Pros:**  Limits the damage an attacker can do if they successfully exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Cons:**  Does not prevent the vulnerability itself.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **nginx:** Run the nginx worker processes as a non-root user with minimal necessary permissions.  This can be configured in `nginx.conf` using the `user` directive.
        *   **External Scripts:**  Ensure that any scripts executed by the `exec` directives also run with minimal privileges.  Use a dedicated user account for these scripts, and grant only the necessary permissions (e.g., read access to specific files, execute permissions for specific commands).  Avoid running scripts as root.  Consider using `chroot` or containers to further isolate the scripts.

### 2.5. Best Practices

1.  **Prioritize HTTP Callbacks:**  The absolute best practice is to avoid using the `exec` directives entirely.  Use HTTP callbacks to a separate, secured application instead.
2.  **If `exec` is Unavoidable:**
    *   **Whitelist, Whitelist, Whitelist:**  Implement strict whitelisting for *all* user-supplied input.
    *   **Escape as a Second Line of Defense:**  Escape any remaining special characters, even after whitelisting.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Run nginx and any executed scripts with minimal privileges.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly review the `nginx.conf` configuration and any external scripts for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Keep Software Updated:**  Keep the `nginx-rtmp-module`, nginx, and the operating system up to date to benefit from security patches.
    *   **Consider WAF:** Use Web Application Firewall that can help prevent command injection attacks.
    *   **Monitor Logs:** Monitor logs for any suspicious activity, such as unusual stream names or error messages related to command execution.
3.  **Never Trust User Input:**  Treat *all* user-supplied data as potentially malicious.
4.  **Document Security Assumptions:** Clearly document any security assumptions made about the configuration and usage of the `nginx-rtmp-module`.
5. **FFmpeg specific:** If using FFmpeg, carefully review and restrict the allowed options. Avoid using user-supplied data to construct FFmpeg command-line options.

## 3. Conclusion

The command injection vulnerability associated with the `exec` directives in the `nginx-rtmp-module` is a serious security risk.  The best mitigation is to avoid using these directives altogether. If their use is unavoidable, meticulous input sanitization (using a whitelist approach), combined with the principle of least privilege, is essential.  Developers and system administrators must be extremely vigilant and proactive in addressing this vulnerability to prevent server compromise.  Regular security audits and updates are crucial for maintaining a secure system.
