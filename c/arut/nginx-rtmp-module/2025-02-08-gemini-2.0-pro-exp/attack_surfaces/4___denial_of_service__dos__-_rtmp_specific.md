# Deep Analysis: Denial of Service (DoS) - RTMP Specific (Attack Surface #4)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the potential for RTMP-specific Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against an application utilizing the `nginx-rtmp-module`.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities within the module's handling of the RTMP protocol, understand how attackers might exploit these vulnerabilities, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  This analysis will focus on attacks that directly leverage the RTMP protocol itself, rather than generic network-level DoS.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is limited to the `nginx-rtmp-module` and its interaction with the RTMP protocol.  It includes:

*   **RTMP Protocol Handling:**  How the module parses, processes, and manages RTMP connections, messages, and streams.
*   **Module-Specific Directives:**  Analysis of `nginx-rtmp-module` configuration directives related to resource management and timeouts.
*   **Interaction with nginx Core:**  How the module integrates with nginx's core functionality, particularly in areas relevant to DoS mitigation (e.g., connection limiting).
*   **Exclusion:** Generic network-level DoS attacks (e.g., SYN floods) are *out of scope*, as they are not specific to the RTMP protocol or the module.  We assume a baseline level of network security is in place.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  Examine the `nginx-rtmp-module` source code (available on GitHub) to identify potential vulnerabilities related to resource exhaustion, improper input validation, and inadequate error handling.  This is crucial for understanding the *internal* workings of the module.
*   **Configuration Analysis:**  Analyze the module's configuration directives and their impact on DoS resilience.  This includes identifying default values and recommended configurations.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Thoroughly review the official `nginx-rtmp-module` documentation to understand intended behavior and limitations.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  Search for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) and reports of past DoS attacks targeting the module or similar RTMP servers.
*   **Hypothetical Attack Scenario Development:**  Construct realistic attack scenarios based on the identified vulnerabilities and configuration weaknesses.
*   **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies against the identified attack scenarios.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

This section details the specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors related to RTMP-specific DoS attacks.

### 4.1. Connection Exhaustion

*   **Vulnerability:**  The module must maintain state for each active RTMP connection.  An attacker can initiate a large number of connections without completing the RTMP handshake or sending valid data, consuming server resources (memory, file descriptors).
*   **Attack Vector:**  A botnet initiates thousands of TCP connections to the RTMP port (typically 1935) but sends incomplete or malformed RTMP handshake messages.  The server allocates resources for each connection, waiting for a valid handshake that never arrives.
*   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the `ngx_rtmp_init_connection` and related handshake handling functions in the source code.  Look for areas where resources are allocated *before* full validation of the client's intent.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **`timeout` Directive:**  Set a *short* `timeout` value within the `rtmp` block.  This directive controls the overall connection timeout.  A value of 5-10 seconds is a good starting point.  This is the *most important* module-specific mitigation.
    *   **`limit_conn` (nginx):**  Use nginx's `limit_conn` directive to limit the number of concurrent connections from a single IP address.  This is a general nginx feature, but it's crucial for mitigating connection floods.  Define a zone in the `http` block and apply it to the `rtmp` server block.
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Implement firewall rules to block or rate-limit connections from suspicious IP addresses or networks.

### 4.2. Stream Creation Exhaustion

*   **Vulnerability:**  The module allocates resources for each active stream (published or played).  An attacker can attempt to create a large number of streams, even if they don't send any actual video data.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker rapidly sends `publish` commands with different stream names, attempting to exhaust the server's capacity to manage streams.
*   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the `ngx_rtmp_publish` and `ngx_rtmp_play` functions, focusing on how stream metadata is stored and managed.  Look for potential memory leaks or inefficient data structures.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **`max_streams` Directive:**  Set a reasonable `max_streams` value within the `rtmp` block.  This directive *directly* limits the number of concurrent streams the module will handle.  The appropriate value depends on the server's resources and expected load.
    *   **`on_publish` Callback (Authentication & Rate Limiting):**  Implement a robust `on_publish` callback script.  This script should:
        *   **Authenticate:** Verify the publisher's credentials *before* allowing the stream to be created.
        *   **Rate Limit:**  Limit the rate at which a single user or IP address can create new streams.  This is *crucial* for preventing stream exhaustion attacks.  Store rate-limiting data in a fast, external store (e.g., Redis).
        *   **Validate Stream Name:** Enforce a strict stream name policy to prevent attackers from creating excessively long or invalid stream names.
    *   **`publish_timeout` Directive:** Set a reasonable `publish_timeout`. If a publisher doesn't start sending data within this timeout, the connection is closed.

### 4.3. Slowloris-Style Attacks (RTMP Specific)

*   **Vulnerability:**  The RTMP protocol, like HTTP, can be vulnerable to slow-sending attacks.  An attacker can establish a connection and send RTMP data very slowly, keeping the connection open and consuming server resources for an extended period.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker establishes an RTMP connection and sends data at an extremely slow rate (e.g., a few bytes per second).  The server keeps the connection open, waiting for more data, consuming resources.
*   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the functions responsible for reading and buffering RTMP data (e.g., `ngx_rtmp_recv`).  Look for how the module handles incomplete or slow-arriving data.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **`timeout` Directive:**  Again, the `timeout` directive is crucial.  It sets the overall connection timeout, including the time allowed for receiving data.
    *   **`play_timeout` and `publish_timeout`:** These are more granular timeouts, specifically for playing and publishing.  Use these to enforce stricter time limits on data transfer.
    *   **Minimum Data Rate Enforcement (Advanced):**  This is a more complex mitigation that would likely require custom module development or integration with an external tool.  The idea is to monitor the data transfer rate and close connections that fall below a minimum threshold.

### 4.4. Invalid RTMP Command Flooding

*   **Vulnerability:** The module must parse and process each RTMP command received. An attacker can flood the server with invalid or malformed RTMP commands, consuming CPU resources.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a continuous stream of invalid RTMP commands (e.g., incorrect command names, invalid parameters, corrupted data).
*   **Code Review Focus:** Examine the RTMP command parsing logic (e.g., `ngx_rtmp_cmd_handler`). Look for potential vulnerabilities in how the module handles invalid input, such as excessive resource consumption or potential crashes.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Robust Input Validation (Module-Level):** While difficult to achieve completely within the nginx configuration, the module itself should have robust input validation to quickly reject invalid commands. This is primarily a responsibility of the module developers.
    *   **`on_publish` and `on_play` Callbacks:** Use these callbacks to perform early validation of the initial `publish` and `play` commands, rejecting connections before significant resources are consumed.
    *   **Fail2Ban (External):** Use Fail2Ban or a similar tool to monitor the nginx error logs for repeated invalid RTMP command errors and automatically block the offending IP addresses.

### 4.5. Resource Limits within `nginx-rtmp-module`

* **`max_connections`:** While nginx itself has a `worker_connections` directive, `nginx-rtmp-module` *does not* have a separate `max_connections` directive specifically for RTMP.  The overall nginx `worker_connections` limit applies.  This is important to understand: RTMP connections contribute to the overall connection limit.
* **Memory Management:** The module allocates memory for various data structures (connections, streams, buffers).  The code review should focus on identifying potential memory leaks or inefficient memory usage patterns that could be exploited by an attacker.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The `nginx-rtmp-module` is a powerful tool for building RTMP streaming servers, but it presents a significant attack surface for DoS attacks.  The most critical mitigation strategies are:

1.  **Aggressive Timeouts:**  Use `timeout`, `play_timeout`, and `publish_timeout` to enforce strict time limits on connections and data transfer.  These are the *first line of defense*.
2.  **`max_streams`:**  Limit the number of concurrent streams using the `max_streams` directive.
3.  **Robust `on_publish` Callback:**  Implement a secure and efficient `on_publish` callback script to authenticate publishers, rate-limit stream creation, and validate stream names.  This is the *most flexible* mitigation point.
4.  **`limit_conn` (nginx):**  Use nginx's built-in connection limiting to prevent connection floods from individual IP addresses.
5.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement robust monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to DoS attacks in real-time.  Monitor CPU usage, memory usage, connection counts, and error logs.
6.  **Regular Updates:** Keep the `nginx-rtmp-module` and nginx itself up-to-date to benefit from security patches and performance improvements.
7. **Consider a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can provide an additional layer of protection against application-layer attacks, including some forms of RTMP-specific DoS.

By implementing these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of RTMP-specific DoS attacks against their applications. Continuous security auditing and penetration testing are also recommended to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.
