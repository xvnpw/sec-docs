# Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Stream Playback (nginx-rtmp-module)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Unauthorized Stream Playback" attack surface, identify specific vulnerabilities within the context of the `nginx-rtmp-module`, and provide concrete, actionable recommendations to mitigate the risk.  We aim to move beyond a general description and delve into the technical details of *how* an attacker might exploit this surface and *precisely* how to configure the module and supporting systems to prevent it.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the unauthorized access to live streams served by the `nginx-rtmp-module`.  It encompasses:

*   The core RTMP playback functionality of the module.
*   The `on_play` callback mechanism and its critical role in authorization.
*   The interaction between the module and external authentication/authorization systems.
*   Common misconfigurations and attack vectors related to stream playback.
*   Token-based authentication strategies *as implemented in conjunction with* the `on_play` callback.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other attack surfaces of the `nginx-rtmp-module` (e.g., unauthorized publishing, DDoS).  These are separate attack surfaces requiring their own analyses.
*   Vulnerabilities in the external authentication/authorization system itself (e.g., SQL injection in the authentication backend).  We assume the external system, if properly integrated, is secure.
*   Network-level attacks (e.g., MITM) that are outside the scope of the module's configuration.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Identify specific ways the `nginx-rtmp-module`, in various configurations (including default), can be exploited to gain unauthorized stream access.
2.  **Technical Deep Dive:**  Explain the underlying mechanisms that enable the vulnerability, referencing the module's source code behavior (where relevant) and RTMP protocol specifics.
3.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Describe realistic scenarios where an attacker could leverage the vulnerability.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Analyze the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies (`on_play` callbacks and secure tokens), detailing *how* they prevent the identified vulnerabilities.
5.  **Configuration Examples:**  Provide concrete `nginx.conf` snippets and example callback server code (pseudocode or a specific language like Python) demonstrating proper implementation.
6.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Identify any remaining risks even after implementing the mitigations, and suggest further hardening measures.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1 Vulnerability Identification

The primary vulnerability stems from the `nginx-rtmp-module`'s default behavior: **it serves any requested stream without authentication unless explicitly configured to do otherwise.**  This is not a "bug" in the module; it's how RTMP servers traditionally operate.  The responsibility for access control lies with the server administrator.

Specific vulnerabilities include:

*   **Default Configuration:**  A barebones `nginx-rtmp-module` configuration with no `on_play` directive will allow *anyone* to connect and play *any* stream.
*   **Missing `on_play` Callback:**  If the `on_play` directive is absent, no authorization check occurs.
*   **Improperly Implemented `on_play` Callback:**  Even if `on_play` is present, the callback server might:
    *   Always return an "allow" response (effectively disabling authorization).
    *   Have vulnerabilities itself (e.g., SQL injection, allowing attackers to bypass authentication).
    *   Not properly validate tokens (e.g., accepting expired tokens, not checking signatures).
    *   Not handle errors correctly (e.g., failing open if the authentication server is unavailable).
*   **Predictable Stream Names:**  If stream names are easily guessable (e.g., "live1", "live2"), attackers can try various names until they find a valid stream.
*   **Lack of Tokenization:** Without tokens, an attacker who obtains a valid stream URL (even temporarily) can replay it indefinitely.

### 4.2 Technical Deep Dive

The RTMP protocol itself does not inherently include strong authentication mechanisms for playback.  It relies on the server to implement access control.  The `nginx-rtmp-module` handles the RTMP handshake and stream delivery.  When a client requests to play a stream, the module:

1.  Receives the "play" command from the client.
2.  Checks for an `on_play` directive.
3.  If `on_play` is present, it makes an HTTP request to the specified URL, passing relevant information (stream name, client IP, etc.).
4.  The external application (the callback server) processes the request and returns an HTTP status code:
    *   **2xx (e.g., 200 OK):**  The module allows playback.
    *   **Non-2xx (e.g., 403 Forbidden):** The module denies playback and closes the connection.
5.  If `on_play` is *not* present, the module proceeds directly to step 6.
6.  If playback is allowed, the module starts sending the stream data to the client.

The `on_play` callback is the *only* point within the module's core logic where authorization can be enforced.  The module itself does *not* generate, manage, or validate tokens.  Token handling *must* be implemented within the `on_play` callback logic.

### 4.3 Exploitation Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1: Default Configuration:** An attacker uses an RTMP client (e.g., VLC, OBS) to connect to `rtmp://yourserver/live/secret_stream`.  Because no `on_play` is configured, the module allows playback, and the attacker views the confidential stream.

*   **Scenario 2: Weak Callback:** An attacker connects to `rtmp://yourserver/live/stream?token=invalid`. The `on_play` callback is implemented, but the server-side code doesn't properly validate the token (e.g., it only checks if a token is present, not its validity).  The callback returns 200 OK, and the attacker gains access.

*   **Scenario 3: Callback Failure:** The authentication server is temporarily unavailable.  The `on_play` callback fails.  If the callback logic doesn't handle this gracefully (e.g., by failing closed), it might inadvertently return a 200 OK, allowing unauthorized access.

*   **Scenario 4:  Stolen Token:**  A legitimate user shares a stream URL containing a valid token.  An attacker intercepts this URL and uses it to access the stream, even if they weren't the intended recipient.  This highlights the need for short-lived, single-use tokens.

### 4.4 Mitigation Analysis

The combination of `on_play` callbacks and secure tokens, *when correctly implemented*, effectively mitigates the identified vulnerabilities:

*   **`on_play` Callbacks:**  Force *every* playback request to be explicitly authorized by an external application.  This prevents the default "allow all" behavior.  The callback server becomes the central point of access control.

*   **Secure Tokens:**  Provide a mechanism for the callback server to grant temporary, revocable access.  Proper token validation (including expiry checks, signature verification, and potentially one-time-use restrictions) prevents replay attacks and unauthorized sharing.

**Crucially, the security relies on the *correct implementation* of the callback server.**  The `nginx-rtmp-module` provides the *mechanism* (`on_play`), but the *logic* resides externally.

### 4.5 Configuration Examples

**nginx.conf:**

```nginx
rtmp {
    server {
        listen 1935;
        chunk_size 4096;

        application live {
            live on;
            record off;

            # on_play callback for authentication
            on_play http://auth_server:8000/auth;

            # Example of denying access based on URL parameters (requires callback logic)
            # This is NOT a built-in feature, but shows how to use the callback
            # to implement custom access control.
            # deny play if $arg_token is empty;  # This line alone won't work!
        }
    }
}
```

**Example Callback Server (Python/Flask - Pseudocode):**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/auth', methods=['POST'])
def auth():
    stream_name = request.form.get('name')
    client_ip = request.form.get('addr')
    token = request.args.get('token')  # Get token from query string

    # 1. Validate the token (THIS IS CRUCIAL)
    if not is_valid_token(token, stream_name, client_ip):
        return "Forbidden", 403

    # 2. (Optional) Check other conditions (e.g., user permissions)
    # ...

    # 3. If authorized, return 200 OK
    return "OK", 200

def is_valid_token(token, stream_name, client_ip):
    # - Check if the token exists in your database/token store.
    # - Verify the token's signature (if using signed tokens).
    # - Check if the token has expired.
    # - (Optional) Check if the token is associated with the stream_name.
    # - (Optional) Check if the token is associated with the client_ip (for single-use tokens).
    # - (Optional) Implement one-time-use logic (e.g., mark the token as used).
    # ... (Implementation details depend on your token system)
    # Return True if valid, False otherwise.
    pass # Replace with actual token validation logic

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
```

**Key points in the example:**

*   The `nginx.conf` uses `on_play` to direct all playback requests to the `/auth` endpoint of the callback server.
*   The Python code demonstrates the *essential* token validation logic.  It's a simplified example; a real-world implementation would likely involve database lookups, cryptographic signature verification, and more robust error handling.
*   The callback server returns a 403 Forbidden status if the token is invalid or missing, preventing playback.  It returns a 200 OK only if the token is valid *and* any other authorization checks pass.

### 4.6 Residual Risk Assessment

Even with properly implemented `on_play` callbacks and secure tokens, some residual risks remain:

*   **Vulnerabilities in the Callback Server:**  The security of the entire system hinges on the callback server.  Any vulnerability in the callback server (e.g., SQL injection, authentication bypass) can be exploited to gain unauthorized stream access.  Rigorous security testing and secure coding practices are essential for the callback server.

*   **Token Leakage:**  If tokens are transmitted insecurely (e.g., over HTTP instead of HTTPS), they can be intercepted.  Always use HTTPS for communication between the client, the `nginx-rtmp-module` server, and the callback server.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) on the Callback Server:**  An attacker could flood the callback server with requests, making it unavailable and potentially causing legitimate users to be denied access.  Rate limiting and other DoS mitigation techniques should be implemented on the callback server.

*   **Compromised Client:** If an attacker gains control of a legitimate user's machine, they could potentially access the stream even with token-based authentication. This is a broader security issue beyond the scope of the `nginx-rtmp-module`.

*  **Timing Attacks:** While unlikely in this specific scenario, extremely sophisticated attackers *might* attempt timing attacks against the token validation logic. Constant-time comparison functions should be used where appropriate.

**Further Hardening Measures:**

*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of both the `nginx-rtmp-module` configuration and the callback server code.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF in front of the callback server to protect against common web attacks.
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Use an IDS to monitor for suspicious activity on both the `nginx-rtmp-module` server and the callback server.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the callback server only the necessary permissions to perform its function.
*   **Short-Lived, One-Time Tokens:** Use the shortest possible token lifetimes and, where feasible, implement one-time-use tokens to minimize the impact of token leakage.
* **Client IP Binding:** Bind the token with client IP address.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Unauthorized Stream Playback" attack surface of the `nginx-rtmp-module` presents a significant risk if not properly addressed.  The module's default behavior allows unrestricted access, making it crucial to implement robust authorization mechanisms.  The `on_play` callback directive, combined with a securely implemented token validation system on an external server, is the primary defense.  However, the security of the entire system depends heavily on the security of the callback server itself.  Continuous monitoring, regular security audits, and adherence to secure coding practices are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
