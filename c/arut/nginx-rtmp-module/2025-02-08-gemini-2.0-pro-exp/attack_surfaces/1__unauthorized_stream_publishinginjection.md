# Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Stream Publishing/Injection in nginx-rtmp-module

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Unauthorized Stream Publishing/Injection" attack surface within applications leveraging the `nginx-rtmp-module`.  We aim to understand the specific vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors, and effective mitigation strategies, providing actionable guidance for developers to secure their RTMP streaming infrastructure.  This analysis focuses on preventing attackers from injecting unauthorized or malicious content into live streams.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is specifically focused on the `nginx-rtmp-module` and its role in handling RTMP publishing requests.  It covers:

*   The module's default behavior regarding publishing authorization.
*   The `on_publish` directive and its critical role in security.
*   Attack scenarios related to unauthorized stream publishing.
*   Recommended mitigation strategies, emphasizing practical implementation details.
*   The interaction between `nginx-rtmp-module` and external authentication/authorization systems.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General Nginx security best practices (e.g., file system permissions, SSL/TLS configuration) unless directly related to RTMP publishing.
*   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks *not* directly related to unauthorized publishing (e.g., network-level flooding).  While resource exhaustion is a *consequence* of unauthorized publishing, we focus on the *publishing* aspect itself.
*   Vulnerabilities in external authentication/authorization systems called by `on_publish`.  We assume these systems are securely implemented.
*   Client-side vulnerabilities in RTMP players.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis employs the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:** Examination of the `nginx-rtmp-module` documentation and relevant source code snippets (where publicly available and necessary for understanding) to understand its publishing mechanisms.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identification of potential attack scenarios based on the module's functionality and common attack patterns.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Assessment of the inherent risks associated with the module's default behavior and potential misconfigurations.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Recommendation of specific, actionable steps to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities, prioritizing the module's built-in features and best practices.
5.  **Documentation Review:**  Consulting the official `nginx-rtmp-module` documentation to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Unauthorized Stream Publishing/Injection

### 4.1.  Module's Default Behavior

By default, the `nginx-rtmp-module` *does not* enforce any authentication or authorization for incoming publishing requests.  This is a crucial point.  Unless explicitly configured otherwise, *any* client can connect to the RTMP server and begin publishing a stream.  This permissive default behavior is the root cause of the "Unauthorized Stream Publishing/Injection" attack surface.

### 4.2.  The `on_publish` Directive: The Key to Security

The `on_publish` directive is the *primary* mechanism provided by the `nginx-rtmp-module` to control access to publishing.  It allows you to specify a URL that Nginx will call (via an HTTP request) *before* allowing a stream to be published.  This callback mechanism is essential for implementing authentication and authorization.

**Example Configuration:**

```nginx
rtmp {
    server {
        listen 1935;
        application live {
            live on;
            on_publish http://localhost:8080/auth;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, when a client attempts to publish to the `live` application, Nginx will send an HTTP request to `http://localhost:8080/auth`.  The external application at that URL is responsible for:

1.  **Receiving the Request:**  The request will contain information about the publishing attempt, including the stream name, client IP address, and any arguments passed by the client.
2.  **Authentication:**  Verifying the identity of the publisher.  This might involve checking credentials against a database, validating a token, or using other authentication methods.
3.  **Authorization:**  Determining if the authenticated publisher is *allowed* to publish to the requested stream.  This might involve checking permissions, group memberships, or other authorization rules.
4.  **Responding to Nginx:**  The application must respond with an HTTP status code:
    *   **2xx (e.g., 200 OK):**  Allows the stream to be published.
    *   **Non-2xx (e.g., 403 Forbidden, 401 Unauthorized):**  Rejects the publishing attempt.  Nginx will then disconnect the client.

### 4.3. Attack Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1:  No `on_publish` configured:** An attacker connects to `rtmp://yourserver/live/malicious_stream` and starts broadcasting malicious content (e.g., illegal content, propaganda, or a disruptive video).  Since there's no authentication, the server accepts the stream.

*   **Scenario 2:  Weak Stream Keys (without proper `on_publish` validation):**  The server uses stream keys, but they are easily guessable (e.g., "stream1", "stream2").  An attacker tries various common stream keys until they find one that works.  Even if `on_publish` is configured, if it doesn't *validate* the stream key against a secure store, the attacker succeeds.

*   **Scenario 3:  `on_publish` Callback Failure:** The `on_publish` callback URL is unavailable or returns an error.  Depending on the Nginx configuration and the nature of the error, this *might* result in the stream being allowed (fail-open) or denied (fail-closed).  A fail-open scenario is a security risk.  The external auth service should be highly available.

*   **Scenario 4:  Bypassing `on_publish` (highly unlikely, but worth considering):**  If there's a vulnerability in Nginx itself or the `nginx-rtmp-module` that allows an attacker to bypass the `on_publish` callback entirely, they could publish unauthorized streams.  This is less likely than misconfiguration but highlights the importance of keeping Nginx and the module up-to-date.

* **Scenario 5: Replay attack on `on_publish` callback:** If the `on_publish` callback does not implement nonce or timestamp validation, an attacker could replay a previously valid authentication request to publish a stream at a later time.

### 4.4.  Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

1.  **Mandatory `on_publish` Callback:**  *Always* implement an `on_publish` callback.  This is non-negotiable for secure RTMP publishing.  The callback should:

    *   **Strong Authentication:**  Use robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    *   **Fine-Grained Authorization:**  Implement authorization logic that goes beyond simple authentication.  Check if the authenticated user has permission to publish to the *specific* stream they are requesting.
    *   **Secure Communication:**  Use HTTPS for the `on_publish` callback URL to protect the credentials and other sensitive information exchanged between Nginx and the authentication service.
    *   **Fail-Closed Behavior:**  Ensure that if the `on_publish` callback fails (e.g., the authentication service is unavailable), the publishing attempt is *rejected*.  This is crucial to prevent unauthorized streams from being published if the authentication system is down.
    * **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all input received from the client in the `on_publish` callback to prevent injection attacks.
    * **Nonce/Timestamp Validation:** Implement nonce or timestamp validation in the `on_publish` callback to prevent replay attacks.

2.  **Strong, Unique Stream Keys:**  Enforce the use of strong, unique stream keys.  These keys should be:

    *   **Long and Random:**  Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to create long, unpredictable keys.
    *   **Not Guessable:**  Avoid using sequential numbers, common words, or easily guessable patterns.
    *   **Managed Securely:**  Store stream keys securely (e.g., in a database, encrypted configuration file, or a secrets management system).
    *   **Validated in `on_publish`:**  The `on_publish` callback *must* validate the provided stream key against the securely stored keys.

3.  **Rate Limiting (within `on_publish` logic):**  While Nginx's `limit_req` directive can limit requests, it's more effective to control publishing *attempts* within the `on_publish` callback logic.  This allows you to:

    *   **Reject Unauthorized Attempts Early:**  Prevent unauthorized attempts from consuming resources by rejecting them *before* the stream starts.
    *   **Implement Custom Rate Limiting Logic:**  You can implement more sophisticated rate limiting rules based on the user, stream key, or other factors.  For example, you might limit the number of publishing attempts per user per hour.
    *   **Track Failed Attempts:**  Log and monitor failed publishing attempts to detect and respond to potential attacks.

4.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your RTMP infrastructure, including:

    *   **Code Reviews:**  Review the code of your `on_publish` callback application and any other custom code related to RTMP publishing.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform penetration testing to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Configuration Reviews:**  Regularly review your Nginx configuration to ensure that it is secure and up-to-date.

5.  **Keep Software Updated:**  Keep Nginx and the `nginx-rtmp-module` up-to-date to patch any security vulnerabilities.

6.  **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to suspicious activity, such as a large number of failed publishing attempts or unauthorized streams being published.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Unauthorized Stream Publishing/Injection" attack surface in `nginx-rtmp-module` is a significant security concern due to the module's default permissive behavior.  However, by diligently implementing the `on_publish` callback mechanism with strong authentication, authorization, and rate limiting, and by following the other mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can effectively secure their RTMP streaming infrastructure and prevent unauthorized content injection.  The `on_publish` directive is not just a feature; it's the *cornerstone* of secure RTMP publishing with this module.  Continuous monitoring and regular security audits are also crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
