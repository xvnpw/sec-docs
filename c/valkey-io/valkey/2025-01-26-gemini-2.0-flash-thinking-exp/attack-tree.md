## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Valkey Access Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/direct_valkey_access_exploitation__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to directly connect to the Valkey instance and exploit weaknesses without going through the application. This path is critical because it bypasses application-level security controls.

    *   **Network Exposure [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Valkey Instance Publicly Accessible [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **No Firewall/Network Segmentation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack:** Valkey is deployed in the same network segment as public-facing services without firewall restrictions, allowing direct internet access.
                *   **Impact:** High - Full compromise of Valkey instance.
                *   **Mitigation:** Implement network segmentation to isolate Valkey in a private network. Use firewalls to restrict access to Valkey port (default 6379) only from authorized internal networks or application servers.
            *   **Valkey Binding to Public Interface (0.0.0.0) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack:** Valkey is configured to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) instead of localhost (127.0.0.1) or a private network interface, making it accessible from any network it's connected to, including public networks if exposed.
                *   **Impact:** High - Full compromise of Valkey instance.
                *   **Mitigation:** Configure Valkey to bind to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) or a specific private network interface using the `bind` configuration directive in `valkey.conf`.

    *   **Authentication Bypass/Weakness [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **No Authentication Enabled [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Valkey Configured Without `requirepass` [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack:** Valkey is running without password authentication enabled (default setting if `requirepass` is not configured). This allows anyone who can connect to the Valkey port to execute commands without credentials.
                *   **Impact:** High - Full compromise of Valkey instance.
                *   **Mitigation:** **Always enable authentication** by setting a strong password using the `requirepass` directive in `valkey.conf`.
        *   **Weak `requirepass` (If Enabled) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Easily Guessable Password [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack:**  Even with `requirepass` enabled, if a weak or easily guessable password is used, attackers can brute-force or guess the password and gain unauthorized access.
                *   **Impact:** High - Full compromise of Valkey instance.
                *   **Mitigation:** Use a **strong, randomly generated password** for `requirepass`. Enforce password complexity policies and consider password rotation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Valkey Vulnerabilities (Software Bugs) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/valkey_vulnerabilities__software_bugs___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Valkey software itself. This path is critical because it directly targets the core Valkey service.

    *   **Exploiting Known Valkey CVEs [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Valkey Version Vulnerable to Publicly Known Exploits [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack:** Running an outdated version of Valkey that is vulnerable to publicly known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Attackers can use readily available exploit code to compromise the vulnerable Valkey instance.
            *   **Impact:** High -  Depending on the CVE, this could lead to full compromise, including data access, data manipulation, or even command execution on the Valkey server.
            *   **Mitigation:** **Maintain up-to-date Valkey instances.** Regularly check for and apply security patches and updates released by the Valkey project. Implement a vulnerability scanning process to identify outdated or vulnerable Valkey versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Valkey Configuration/Deployment Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/valkey_configurationdeployment_weaknesses__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from insecure configuration or deployment practices of the Valkey instance. This path is critical because misconfigurations are common and can easily expose Valkey.

    *   **Insecure Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Weak `requirepass` (If Enabled) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** (Repeated from Authentication section for emphasis as a configuration weakness)
            *   **Easily Guessable Password [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** (Repeated for emphasis)
                *   **Attack:**  Using a weak password for `requirepass` due to poor configuration practices.
                *   **Impact:** High - Full compromise of Valkey instance.
                *   **Mitigation:**  Enforce strong password policies during Valkey configuration. Use password managers or secure password generation tools to create and manage strong `requirepass` values.
        *   **Default Configuration Not Hardened [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Relying on Default Valkey Settings without Security Review [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack:** Deploying Valkey with default settings without reviewing and hardening the configuration. Default settings often prioritize ease of use over security and may leave vulnerabilities open.
                *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Increased vulnerability to various attacks due to unhardened settings.
                *   **Mitigation:** **Harden Valkey configuration** based on security best practices and hardening guides. Review the `valkey.conf` file and adjust settings to enhance security. Disable unnecessary features or modules.

    *   **Outdated Valkey Version [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** (Repeated from Software Vulnerabilities section for emphasis as a deployment weakness)
        *   **Running an Old Valkey Version with Known Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** (Repeated for emphasis)
            *   **Attack:** Deploying and running an outdated Valkey version due to lack of patching or maintenance processes.
            *   **Impact:** High -  Vulnerability to known exploits.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement a robust patch management process for Valkey instances. Schedule regular updates and patching cycles.

    *   **Misconfigured Network Settings [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Binding to Incorrect Interface [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Valkey Listening on Publicly Accessible Interface Instead of Localhost [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** (Repeated for emphasis)
                *   **Attack:** Misconfiguring the `bind` directive to listen on a public interface instead of localhost or a private network interface during deployment.
                *   **Impact:** High - Full compromise of Valkey instance.
                *   **Mitigation:** Double-check and verify the `bind` configuration during deployment to ensure Valkey is bound to the intended interface (ideally `127.0.0.1` or a private network interface).
        *   **Firewall Misconfiguration [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Firewall Rules Allowing Unnecessary Access to Valkey Port [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack:**  Incorrectly configured firewall rules that allow unauthorized access to the Valkey port (default 6379) from untrusted networks or the internet.
                *   **Impact:** High - Full compromise of Valkey instance if combined with other weaknesses like no authentication.
                *   **Mitigation:**  Carefully configure firewall rules to restrict access to the Valkey port only to authorized sources (e.g., application servers). Regularly review and audit firewall rules to ensure they are correctly configured and minimize unnecessary access.
