**Impact:**
*   **Confidentiality:** Sensitive data stored in Valkey could be exposed.
*   **Integrity:** Data within Valkey could be modified or deleted without authorization.
*   **Availability:** Valkey service could be disrupted or completely unavailable (DoS).
*   **System Compromise:** In severe cases, attacker could gain full control of the Valkey server.
**Valkey Component Affected:** Core Valkey server software.
**Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Patching:** Regularly update Valkey server to the latest stable version with security patches.
*   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to Valkey security advisories and monitor vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE).

**Impact:**
*   **Confidentiality:** Access to sensitive data beyond authorized permissions.
*   **Integrity:** Ability to perform unauthorized actions, potentially modifying or deleting data.
*   **Availability:** Potential to disrupt service by executing administrative commands.
**Valkey Component Affected:** ACL system.
**Risk Severity:** **High**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure ACLs to grant only the minimum necessary permissions to each user and application.
*   **Regular ACL Review:** Periodically review and audit Valkey ACL configurations to identify and correct misconfigurations.
*   **Testing ACLs:** Thoroughly test ACL configurations to ensure they function as intended and prevent unauthorized access.

## Threat: [Valkey Denial of Service (DoS) Attack](./threats/valkey_denial_of_service__dos__attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods Valkey with excessive requests, exploits resource-intensive commands, or triggers vulnerabilities to overload or crash the Valkey server, making it unavailable to legitimate users and the application.
**Impact:**
*   **Availability:** Valkey service disruption, leading to application unavailability or performance degradation.
**Valkey Component Affected:** Valkey server.
**Risk Severity:** **High**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on Valkey access to restrict the number of requests from a single source.
*   **Connection Limits:** Configure connection limits to prevent resource exhaustion from excessive connections.
*   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor Valkey resource usage (CPU, memory, network) and set up alerts for anomalies.
*   **Command Renaming/Disabling:** Rename or disable potentially dangerous commands (e.g., `DEBUG`, `CONFIG`) in production.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration from Valkey](./threats/data_exfiltration_from_valkey.md)

**Description:** An attacker, having gained unauthorized access to Valkey, extracts sensitive data stored within Valkey. This could be done using Valkey commands like `GET`, `SCAN`, `KEYS`, or by exploiting vulnerabilities to dump data.
**Impact:**
*   **Confidentiality:** Loss of sensitive data, potential regulatory compliance violations, reputational damage.
**Valkey Component Affected:** Data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
**Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Encryption at Rest (Application-Level):** Encrypt sensitive data at the application level before storing it in Valkey if Valkey's built-in encryption is not sufficient.
*   **Access Logging and Monitoring:** Monitor Valkey access logs for suspicious activity and data access patterns.

## Threat: [Insecure Valkey Replication](./threats/insecure_valkey_replication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts or manipulates Valkey replication traffic if it is not properly secured. This could involve man-in-the-middle attacks to eavesdrop on replicated data or inject malicious data into the replication stream.
**Impact:**
*   **Confidentiality:** Exposure of replicated data if traffic is intercepted.
*   **Integrity:** Data corruption or inconsistency if replication stream is manipulated.
*   **Availability:** Potential for replication disruption or DoS if replication is attacked.
**Valkey Component Affected:** Replication mechanism.
**Risk Severity:** **High**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **TLS/SSL Encryption for Replication:** Encrypt replication traffic using TLS/SSL, especially when replicating over untrusted networks.
*   **Replication Authentication:** Securely configure replication authentication mechanisms.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate replication traffic within secure network segments.

## Threat: [Lua Script Sandbox Escape (If Lua Scripting is Used)](./threats/lua_script_sandbox_escape__if_lua_scripting_is_used_.md)
