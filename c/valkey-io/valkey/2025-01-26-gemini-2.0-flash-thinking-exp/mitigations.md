# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for valkey-io/valkey

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Valkey](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_valkey.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to Security Announcements:** Monitor Valkey's official channels (GitHub repository, mailing lists, security advisories) for announcements of new releases and security patches specific to Valkey.
    2.  **Establish Update Schedule:** Define a regular schedule for checking and applying Valkey updates (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or immediately for critical security patches).
    3.  **Test Updates in Staging:** Before applying updates to production, thoroughly test them in a staging environment that mirrors your production Valkey setup. This helps identify potential compatibility issues or regressions with Valkey itself.
    4.  **Apply Updates to Production:**  Once testing is successful, apply the updates to your production Valkey instances during a planned maintenance window. Follow your standard deployment procedures for Valkey.
    5.  **Verify Update Success:** After applying updates, verify that Valkey is running correctly and that the updated version is reflected in Valkey's `INFO` output, confirming the Valkey update was successful.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Valkey Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Valkey software is susceptible to publicly known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access to Valkey, cause denial of service within Valkey, or steal data managed by Valkey.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Valkey Vulnerabilities:** High reduction in risk. Regularly updating patches known Valkey vulnerabilities, significantly reducing the attack surface of the Valkey instance itself.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. The development team is aware of the need for Valkey updates and checks for new versions occasionally, but a formal update schedule and staging environment testing specifically for Valkey updates are not consistently followed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formalize an update schedule specifically for Valkey and integrate it into the Valkey maintenance process.
        *   Establish a dedicated staging environment for testing Valkey updates before production deployment.
        *   Automate the process of checking for new Valkey releases and security advisories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden Valkey Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/harden_valkey_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `valkey.conf`:** Carefully examine the `valkey.conf` file and understand each Valkey configuration directive relevant to security.
    2.  **Disable Dangerous Commands:** Use `rename-command` in `valkey.conf` to rename or disable commands within Valkey like `FLUSHALL`, `FLUSHDB`, `CONFIG`, `EVAL`, `SCRIPT`, `DEBUG`, `KEYS`, `SHUTDOWN`, `REPLICAOF`, `CLUSTER`, `MODULE`, `FUNCTION`, `CLIENT`, `PSYNC`, `SYNC`, `BGREWRITEAOF`, `BGSAVE`, `SAVE`, `LASTSAVE`, `SLOWLOG`, `MONITOR`, `COMMAND`, `INFO`, `LATENCY`, `MEMORY`, `STATS`, `TIME`, `ROLE`, `PUBSUB`, `PFDEBUG`, `PFSELFTEST`, `PFCOUNT`, `PFADD`, `PFMERGE`, `BITOP`, `BITFIELD`, `GEOADD`, `GEORADIUS`, `GEORADIUSBYMEMBER`, `GEOPOS`, `GEODIST`, `GEOHASH`, `SORT`, `SCAN`, `SSCAN`, `HSCAN`, `ZSCAN`, `XINFO`, `XADD`, `XRANGE`, `XREVRANGE`, `XREAD`, `XREADGROUP`, `XDEL`, `XTRIM`, `XLEN`, `XCLAIM`, `XGROUP`, `XPENDING`, `STRALGO`, `STRALGO_LCS`, `STRALGO_LCS_LEN`, `STRALGO_LCS_IDX`, `STRALGO_RANK`, `STRALGO_BF`, `STRALGO_BF_ADD`, `STRALGO_BF_EXISTS`, `STRALGO_BF_MADD`, `STRALGO_BF_MEXISTS`, `STRALGO_CF`, `STRALGO_CF_ADD`, `STRALGO_CF_ADDNX`, `STRALGO_CF_COUNT`, `STRALGO_CF_DEL`, `STRALGO_CF_EXISTS`, `STRALGO_CF_INSERT`, `STRALGO_CF_INSERTNX`, `STRALGO_CF_LOADCHUNK`, `STRALGO_CF_MEXISTS`, `STRALGO_CF_MINSERT`, `STRALGO_CF_MINSERTNX`, `STRALGO_CF_SCANDUMP`, `STRALGO_CF_STORECHUNK`, `STRALGO_CMS`, `STRALGO_CMS_INCRBY`, `STRALGO_CMS_INFO`, `STRALGO_CMS_INITBYDIM`, `STRALGO_CMS_INITBYPROB`, `STRALGO_CMS_MERGE`, `STRALGO_CMS_QUERY`, `STRALGO_CMS_TOPK`, `STRALGO_CMS_TOPK_ADD`, `STRALGO_CMS_TOPK_COUNT`, `STRALGO_CMS_TOPK_INCRBY`, `STRALGO_CMS_TOPK_LIST`, `STRALGO_CMS_TOPK_QUERY`, `STRALGO_CMS_TOPK_RESERVE`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_ADD`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_BYRANK`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_BYREVRANK`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_CDF`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_CREATE`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_INFO`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_MAX`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_MERGE`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_MIN`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_QUANTILE`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_RANK`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_REVRANK`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_RESET`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_SAVE`, `STRALGO_TDIGEST_TRIMMED_MEAN`, `STRALGO_TOPK`, `STRALGO_TOPK_ADD`, `STRALGO_TOPK_COUNT`, `STRALGO_TOPK_INCRBY`, `STRALGO_TOPK_LIST`, `STRALGO_TOPK_QUERY`, `STRALGO_TOPK_RESERVE`. Only keep commands absolutely necessary for your application's interaction with Valkey.
    3.  **Restrict Network Binding:** Use the `bind` directive in `valkey.conf` to specify the network interfaces Valkey should listen on. Bind to specific internal IPs rather than `0.0.0.0` to limit Valkey's network exposure. Consider using `protected-mode yes` in `valkey.conf` for additional default access restrictions within Valkey.
    4.  **Implement Authentication:** Enable authentication in `valkey.conf` using `requirepass` or, preferably, configure ACLs (see dedicated mitigation strategy). Set a strong, randomly generated password or configure robust ACL rules within Valkey.
    5.  **Set Memory Limits:** Configure `maxmemory` in `valkey.conf` to limit Valkey's memory usage and choose an appropriate `maxmemory-policy` (e.g., `volatile-lru`, `allkeys-lru`) within Valkey to manage memory eviction.
    6.  **Disable Lua Scripting (If Unused):** If Lua scripting within Valkey is not required, disable it by renaming or disabling `EVAL` and `EVALSHA` commands in `valkey.conf`.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Valkey (High Severity):**  Default Valkey configurations might leave Valkey open to unauthorized access from the network.
        *   **Command Injection in Valkey (High Severity):**  Dangerous Valkey commands like `EVAL` or `SCRIPT` if misused can lead to command injection vulnerabilities within Valkey.
        *   **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation from Valkey (High Severity):**  Unrestricted access and commands can allow attackers to exfiltrate or manipulate sensitive data stored in Valkey.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Valkey (Medium Severity):**  Valkey commands like `FLUSHALL` or memory exhaustion can be used to cause DoS against the Valkey instance.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Valkey:** High reduction. Restricting network access to Valkey and enforcing authentication significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized entry into Valkey.
        *   **Command Injection in Valkey:** High reduction. Disabling or renaming dangerous Valkey commands eliminates a major vector for command injection attacks within Valkey.
        *   **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation from Valkey:** High reduction. Access control and command restrictions limit the ability of attackers to interact with data within Valkey.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Valkey:** Medium reduction. Memory limits and command restrictions make DoS attacks against Valkey harder to execute, but might not fully prevent them.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Network binding for Valkey is configured to internal IPs, and `requirepass` is set in Valkey configuration. However, command renaming within Valkey and detailed `maxmemory-policy` configuration for Valkey are missing. ACLs are not yet implemented in Valkey.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Implement command renaming in `valkey.conf` to disable unnecessary and potentially dangerous Valkey commands.
        *   Configure a more granular `maxmemory-policy` in `valkey.conf` based on application needs for Valkey.
        *   Migrate from `requirepass` to ACLs in Valkey for more robust access control within Valkey.
        *   Regularly review and update the `valkey.conf` hardening configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Access Control with ACLs](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_access_control_with_acls.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable ACLs in Valkey:** Ensure ACLs are enabled in your Valkey configuration (this is the default in newer versions, but verify `aclfile` setting in `valkey.conf`).
    2.  **Define Valkey Users:** Create dedicated Valkey users for each application or service that interacts with Valkey. Avoid using a single shared Valkey user. Use `ACL SETUSER` command or configure in `aclfile`.
    3.  **Define Valkey Roles:** Create roles within Valkey that represent different levels of access needed (e.g., `read-only`, `read-write`, `admin`). Use `ACL SETROLE` command or configure in `aclfile`.
    4.  **Assign Permissions to Roles:**  Grant specific permissions to each Valkey role using ACL rules. Permissions should be based on the principle of least privilege within Valkey.  For example, using `ACL SETROLE` or `aclfile`:
        *   `+get +set +del` for read-write access to keys.
        *   `+get` for read-only access.
        *   `+@all -@dangerous` for general access excluding dangerous commands.
    5.  **Assign Users to Roles:** Assign each Valkey user to the appropriate Valkey role(s). Use `ACL SETUSER` command or configure in `aclfile`.
    6.  **Test ACL Configuration:** Thoroughly test your Valkey ACL configuration to ensure users have the correct permissions within Valkey and that unauthorized access to Valkey is denied. Use `ACL WHOAMI` and `ACL DRYRUN` commands.
    7.  **Regularly Audit and Review ACLs:** Periodically review and audit your Valkey ACL rules to ensure they remain appropriate and haven't become overly permissive within Valkey. Use `ACL LIST` and `ACL CAT` commands.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Valkey (High Severity):**  Weak or shared passwords and lack of granular permissions to Valkey can lead to unauthorized access to Valkey.
        *   **Privilege Escalation within Valkey (Medium Severity):**  If Valkey users have overly broad permissions, they could potentially escalate privileges or perform actions beyond their intended scope within Valkey.
        *   **Lateral Movement (within Valkey context) (Medium Severity):** In case of compromise of one Valkey user, overly permissive access can facilitate lateral movement within the Valkey instance.
        *   **Insider Threats (within Valkey context) (Medium Severity):**  ACLs help limit the potential damage from malicious or negligent insiders by enforcing least privilege within Valkey.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Valkey:** High reduction. Valkey ACLs provide fine-grained control, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access to Valkey compared to a single password.
        *   **Privilege Escalation within Valkey:** Medium reduction.  Least privilege Valkey roles minimize the potential for privilege escalation within Valkey.
        *   **Lateral Movement (within Valkey context):** Medium reduction.  Restricting access within Valkey limits the impact of a compromised Valkey account on other parts of the Valkey system.
        *   **Insider Threats (within Valkey context):** Medium reduction.  Valkey ACLs limit the potential damage an insider can cause within Valkey.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. The project currently relies on `requirepass` for Valkey authentication, which is less granular than Valkey ACLs.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Design and implement an ACL-based access control system for Valkey.
        *   Define Valkey roles and permissions based on application needs and the principle of least privilege within Valkey.
        *   Migrate existing applications to use dedicated Valkey users and authenticate using Valkey ACLs.
        *   Establish a process for managing and auditing Valkey ACL configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Client Connections (TLS Encryption)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_client_connections__tls_encryption_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate TLS Certificates for Valkey:** Generate TLS certificates and private keys specifically for your Valkey server and clients that will connect to Valkey. Use strong key lengths and secure certificate generation practices. Consider using a Certificate Authority (CA) for easier certificate management for Valkey.
    2.  **Configure Valkey for TLS:**  In `valkey.conf`, configure TLS settings for Valkey:
        *   `tls-port <port>`: Specify a port for TLS connections to Valkey (e.g., 6380).
        *   `tls-cert-file <path/to/server.crt>`: Path to the server certificate file for Valkey.
        *   `tls-key-file <path/to/server.key>`: Path to the server private key file for Valkey.
        *   `tls-ca-cert-file <path/to/ca.crt>` (Optional but recommended for client authentication): Path to the CA certificate file if using client certificate authentication for Valkey.
        *   `tls-auth-clients yes` (Optional but recommended): Require clients to authenticate with TLS certificates when connecting to Valkey.
    3.  **Configure Clients for TLS to Valkey:**  Modify your application code and Valkey clients to connect to Valkey using TLS. Specify the TLS port and provide client certificates if required by the Valkey configuration.
    4.  **Enforce TLS Only for Valkey:** If possible, disable the non-TLS port for Valkey (default 6379) or use firewall rules to block access to it, ensuring only TLS-encrypted connections are allowed to Valkey.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Eavesdropping/Sniffing of Valkey Communication (High Severity):**  Unencrypted communication allows attackers to intercept sensitive data transmitted between the application and Valkey.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Valkey Connections (High Severity):**  Without encryption, attackers can intercept and potentially modify communication between the application and Valkey.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Eavesdropping/Sniffing of Valkey Communication:** High reduction. TLS encryption makes it extremely difficult for attackers to eavesdrop on communication with Valkey.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Valkey Connections:** High reduction. TLS provides authentication and encryption, making MitM attacks on Valkey connections significantly harder to execute.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Client connections to Valkey are currently unencrypted.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Generate TLS certificates for Valkey server and clients.
        *   Configure Valkey to enable TLS encryption and enforce TLS connections.
        *   Update application code and Valkey clients to use TLS for connections to Valkey.
        *   Implement certificate management and rotation procedures for Valkey TLS certificates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Valkey Logs and Metrics](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_valkey_logs_and_metrics.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Valkey Logging:** Ensure Valkey logging is enabled in `valkey.conf`. Configure an appropriate log level (e.g., `notice` or `warning`) to capture relevant security events within Valkey without excessive verbosity.
    2.  **Centralize Valkey Logs:** Configure Valkey to send logs to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, Graylog). This facilitates analysis of Valkey logs, alerting on Valkey events, and correlation with other system logs related to Valkey.
    3.  **Monitor Key Valkey Metrics:** Use Valkey's `INFO` command or monitoring tools to track key performance metrics of Valkey such as:
        *   Valkey CPU and memory usage.
        *   Valkey Connection counts.
        *   Valkey Command latency.
        *   Valkey Cache hit/miss ratio.
        *   Valkey Error counts.
    4.  **Set Up Alerts for Valkey:** Configure alerts in your monitoring system to trigger notifications when suspicious activity or anomalies are detected in Valkey logs or metrics. Examples of alerts specific to Valkey:
        *   Failed Valkey authentication attempts.
        *   Unusual Valkey command patterns (e.g., frequent `FLUSHALL` attempts).
        *   Sudden spikes in Valkey connection counts or command latency (potential DoS against Valkey).
        *   High Valkey error rates.
        *   Valkey memory usage approaching `maxmemory` limits.
    5.  **Regularly Review Valkey Logs and Metrics:** Periodically review Valkey logs and metrics to proactively identify potential security issues or performance bottlenecks within Valkey.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Security Breaches in Valkey (Medium Severity):**  Monitoring Valkey helps detect and respond to security breaches in Valkey in progress or after they have occurred.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks against Valkey (Medium Severity):** Monitoring Valkey can detect DoS attacks by observing unusual traffic patterns or resource exhaustion within Valkey.
        *   **Operational Issues in Valkey (Low Severity):** Monitoring Valkey helps identify performance problems and operational issues within Valkey that could indirectly impact security or availability.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Security Breaches in Valkey:** Medium reduction. Monitoring Valkey improves detection and response capabilities for Valkey-specific security incidents, reducing the dwell time of attackers and potential damage to Valkey.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks against Valkey:** Medium reduction. Monitoring Valkey enables faster detection and mitigation of DoS attacks targeting Valkey.
        *   **Operational Issues in Valkey:** Low reduction (indirect security impact). Monitoring Valkey improves overall Valkey stability and reduces the likelihood of security incidents caused by Valkey operational failures.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Valkey logs are enabled and written to local files, but centralized logging of Valkey logs and comprehensive metric monitoring of Valkey with alerting are missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Integrate Valkey logs into a centralized logging system.
        *   Implement comprehensive metric monitoring for Valkey using a monitoring tool.
        *   Configure alerts for security-relevant events and performance anomalies within Valkey.
        *   Establish a process for regularly reviewing Valkey logs and metrics.
