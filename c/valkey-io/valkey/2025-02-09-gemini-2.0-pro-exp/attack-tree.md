## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Valkey Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_valkey_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1.1 Buffer Overflow [CN]**
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability where carefully crafted input can overwrite memory buffers, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** High to Very High
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

*   **1.2 Module Command -> New/Modified Commands (Fork) [HR]**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within custom modules, specifically in new or modified commands introduced by the Valkey fork. These commands might have insufficient input validation or other security flaws.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (New code is more prone to vulnerabilities)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Depends on the complexity of the vulnerability)
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (Requires specific monitoring of module command execution)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_misconfigurations.md)

*   **2.1 Weak/Default Auth [HR][CN] -> No Auth (Default) [HR]**
    *   **Description:** Valkey deployed without authentication or with easily guessable credentials. This allows attackers to connect directly and issue commands.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Common misconfiguration)
    *   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access, potential for RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

*   **2.2 Exposed Admin Interface [HR][CN] -> Unprotected Port [HR]**
    *   **Description:** Valkey instance accessible on a network without proper access controls (e.g., firewall rules). Attackers can connect directly.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration)
    *   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access, potential for RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Dependencies/Fork-Specific Issues](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_dependenciesfork-specific_issues.md)

*   **3.1 New Vulnerability in Fork [HR][CN]**
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability introduced *specifically* by the Valkey fork, either in new features, modified code, or bug fixes. This is the most likely location for *new* vulnerabilities.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (New code is inherently riskier)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Could be RCE or other severe vulnerabilities)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires finding and exploiting a potentially unknown vulnerability)
    *   **Skill Level:** High to Very High
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Less likely to be detected by existing tools)
