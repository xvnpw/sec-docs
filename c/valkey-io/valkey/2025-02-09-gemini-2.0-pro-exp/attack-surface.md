# Attack Surface Analysis for valkey-io/valkey

## Attack Surface: [Network Exposure and Unauthenticated Access](./attack_surfaces/network_exposure_and_unauthenticated_access.md)

*   **1. Network Exposure and Unauthenticated Access**

    *   **Description:** Direct, unauthenticated access to the Valkey instance from untrusted networks.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes:** Valkey, by default, listens on a TCP port (6379) and may not have authentication enabled initially.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans for open port 6379 on public IP addresses and finds a Valkey instance without a password set.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data compromise (read, write, delete), potential for remote code execution (if certain modules are loaded and exploitable).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Place Valkey within a private network (VPC) accessible *only* to trusted application servers.  Never expose it directly to the public internet.
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Configure strict firewall rules to allow inbound connections to port 6379 *only* from the specific IP addresses of authorized application servers.
        *   **Authentication:**  *Always* enable authentication in Valkey using a strong, randomly generated password (`requirepass` directive in `valkey.conf`).
        *   **VPN/Bastion Host:** If remote administrative access is required, use a secure VPN or a bastion host with strong authentication and auditing.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Communication (Lack of TLS)](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_communication__lack_of_tls_.md)

*   **2. Unencrypted Communication (Lack of TLS)**

    *   **Description:** Data transmitted between the application and Valkey is not encrypted, allowing for interception.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes:** Valkey supports TLS, but it's not enabled by default.  The application must be configured to use it.
    *   **Example:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on the network between the application server and the Valkey instance, capturing sensitive data in transit.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage (credentials, cached data, application data), potential for data modification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable TLS:** Configure both Valkey and the application's client library to use TLS encryption for all communication.
        *   **Certificate Validation:** Ensure the client library properly validates the Valkey server's TLS certificate to prevent MitM attacks using forged certificates.
        *   **Strong Cipher Suites:** Use strong, modern cipher suites for TLS encryption.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/command_injection.md)

*   **3. Command Injection**

    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Valkey commands through unsanitized application input.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes:** Valkey executes commands sent by clients. If the application constructs commands using untrusted input without proper escaping, injection is possible.
    *   **Example:** An application uses user input directly in a `SET` command: `valkey.set(userInput, "value")`.  An attacker provides input like `"; FLUSHALL; "` to delete all data.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data modification, potential denial of service, potential for remote code execution (via `EVAL` or modules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Parameterized Commands:** Use client libraries that support parameterized commands (like prepared statements in SQL).  This treats all input as data, preventing command injection.
        *   **Input Validation/Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize *all* input used in constructing Valkey commands, even when using parameterized commands (defense-in-depth).
        *   **Disable Dangerous Commands:**  Use the `rename-command` directive in `valkey.conf` to disable or rename dangerous commands like `FLUSHALL`, `FLUSHDB`, `CONFIG`, and `EVAL` if they are not absolutely necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **4. Denial of Service (DoS)**

    *   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm the Valkey instance, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes:** Valkey is susceptible to resource exhaustion (memory, CPU, network) if not properly configured and protected.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of `SET` commands with very large values, consuming all available memory in the Valkey instance.  Or, an attacker repeatedly executes `KEYS *` on a large dataset.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, potential data loss (if persistence is not configured or is overwhelmed).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the application side or using a proxy to limit the number of requests per client/IP address.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure `maxmemory` in `valkey.conf` to limit the maximum memory Valkey can use.  Use `maxclients` to limit concurrent connections.
        *   **Avoid `KEYS *`:** Use `SCAN` instead of `KEYS *` for iterating over keys in production.
        *   **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic and server resource usage to detect and respond to DoS attacks.
        *   **Timeouts:** Configure appropriate timeouts on both the client and server sides.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Valkey Version or Client Library](./attack_surfaces/outdated_valkey_version_or_client_library.md)

*   **5. Outdated Valkey Version or Client Library**

    *   **Description:** Running an outdated version of Valkey or a vulnerable client library exposes the application to known vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes:** Like any software, Valkey and its client libraries can have security vulnerabilities that are patched in newer releases.
    *   **Example:** An older version of Valkey has a known remote code execution vulnerability.  An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the server.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from data leakage to complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Valkey and all client libraries up-to-date with the latest stable releases.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the Valkey instance and application dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to track dependencies and receive alerts about vulnerabilities.
