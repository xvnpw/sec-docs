# Threat Model Analysis for valkey-io/valkey

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access](./threats/unauthenticated_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker connects to a Valkey instance that has no authentication enabled (`requirepass` is not set). The attacker uses a standard Valkey client or a network scanning tool to discover the exposed instance. They then issue commands to read, write, or delete data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data compromise. The attacker can steal sensitive information (session data, cached credentials, API keys, etc.), modify application data, or delete all data, leading to application malfunction or data loss.
    *   **Valkey Component Affected:** Core server configuration; authentication mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configuration:** *Always* set a strong, randomly generated password using the `requirepass` directive in `valkey.conf`.
        *   **Network Security:** Restrict network access to the Valkey port (default 6379) using firewalls, allowing only trusted application servers to connect.

## Threat: [Weak Authentication](./threats/weak_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to brute-force the Valkey password using a dictionary attack or other password-guessing techniques. They repeatedly connect to the Valkey instance, trying different passwords until they find the correct one.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data compromise, identical to unauthenticated access. The attacker gains full control over the data stored in Valkey.
    *   **Valkey Component Affected:** Core server configuration; authentication mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Password Strength:** Use a long (at least 20 characters), complex (mixed-case letters, numbers, symbols), and randomly generated password. Avoid dictionary words or easily guessable patterns.
        *   **Password Management:** Use a password manager to generate and store the Valkey password securely.
        *   **Rate Limiting/Account Lockout:** Implement rate limiting or account lockout *with caution*.  While this can prevent brute-force attacks, it can also be abused by an attacker to lock out legitimate users.  A more sophisticated approach that temporarily blocks IPs based on failed attempts is preferable.

## Threat: [Network Eavesdropping (No TLS)](./threats/network_eavesdropping__no_tls_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker passively monitors network traffic between the application and the Valkey server. They use a network sniffer (e.g., Wireshark) to capture unencrypted data, including the authentication password (if sent in plain text) and any data being exchanged.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data compromise. The attacker can intercept the authentication password and all data transmitted between the application and Valkey.
    *   **Valkey Component Affected:** Network communication layer; client-server protocol.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **TLS Encryption:** *Always* enable TLS encryption for Valkey connections. Configure Valkey with valid TLS certificates and private keys.
        *   **Client Configuration:** Ensure the application's Valkey client library is configured to use TLS and to verify the server's certificate.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Valkey server and application servers on a separate, secure network segment to minimize the risk of eavesdropping.

## Threat: [Data Persistence Exposure (RDB/AOF without Encryption)](./threats/data_persistence_exposure__rdbaof_without_encryption_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the server's filesystem where Valkey's RDB snapshots or AOF files are stored.  This could be through a separate vulnerability (e.g., OS-level compromise, misconfigured file sharing). The attacker then directly reads the data from these files, bypassing Valkey's authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Data compromise. The attacker can access all data stored in Valkey, even if authentication is enabled.
    *   **Valkey Component Affected:** Persistence mechanisms (RDB and AOF).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Persistence (if possible):** If data persistence is not required, disable both RDB and AOF in `valkey.conf`.
        *   **Filesystem Encryption:** Use full-disk encryption (e.g., LUKS on Linux) to encrypt the entire filesystem where Valkey's data directory is located.
        *   **File Permissions:** Ensure that the Valkey data directory and its contents have strict file permissions, allowing access only to the user running the Valkey process.
        *   **Regular Backups and Secure Storage:** If using persistence, regularly back up the RDB/AOF files and store them securely in a separate, encrypted location.

## Threat: [`CONFIG GET *` Command Exposure](./threats/_config_get___command_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker connects to the Valkey instance and issues the `CONFIG GET *` command. This can expose sensitive configuration details, potentially including the `requirepass` password (if it was set via `CONFIG SET`).
    *   **Impact:** Information leakage, potentially including the authentication password.
    *   **Valkey Component Affected:** `CONFIG` command.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rename Command:** Rename the `CONFIG` command, or at least `CONFIG GET *`, using `rename-command` in `valkey.conf`.
        *   **ACLs (if supported):** Use ACLs to restrict access to the `CONFIG` command.
        * **Configuration Best Practices:** Avoid setting the `requirepass` password using `CONFIG SET`. Set it directly in the `valkey.conf` file.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (Memory) - Denial of Service](./threats/resource_exhaustion__memory__-_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests to Valkey, inserting large keys and values, or a large number of small keys and values. This consumes all available memory on the Valkey server, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability. The application relying on Valkey becomes unusable.
    *   **Valkey Component Affected:** Memory management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`maxmemory` Limit:** Set a reasonable `maxmemory` limit in `valkey.conf`.
        *   **`maxmemory-policy`:** Configure an appropriate `maxmemory-policy` (e.g., `allkeys-lru`, `volatile-lru`, `allkeys-random`) to evict keys when the memory limit is reached.
        *   **Application-Level Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the application side to prevent excessive data insertion into Valkey.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor Valkey's memory usage and set up alerts to detect potential memory exhaustion.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (Connections) - Denial of Service](./threats/resource_exhaustion__connections__-_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker opens a large number of connections to the Valkey server, exceeding the `maxclients` limit. This prevents legitimate clients from connecting.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability.
    *   **Valkey Component Affected:** Connection handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`maxclients` Limit:** Set a reasonable `maxclients` limit in `valkey.conf`.
        *   **Connection Pooling:** Use connection pooling on the application side to reuse existing connections and avoid exceeding the limit.
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Use firewall rules to limit the number of connections from a single IP address.

## Threat: [Slow Commands - Denial of Service](./threats/slow_commands_-_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker issues slow commands like `KEYS *`, `FLUSHALL`, or `FLUSHDB` (on large datasets). These commands can block the Valkey server, preventing it from processing other requests.
    *   **Impact:** Application slowdown or unavailability.
    *   **Valkey Component Affected:** Command processing; single-threaded nature of Valkey.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `KEYS *`:** Use `SCAN` instead of `KEYS *` in production code.
        *   **Rename/Disable `FLUSHALL`/`FLUSHDB`:** Use `rename-command` to rename or disable these commands.
        *   **Slowlog Monitoring:** Monitor slow commands using Valkey's slowlog feature and investigate any unusually slow operations.
        *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous operations in the application where possible to avoid blocking the main thread.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Modification](./threats/unauthorized_data_modification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Valkey instance (through any of the previously mentioned vulnerabilities) and issues commands to modify or delete data.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, application malfunction.
    *   **Valkey Component Affected:** All data storage components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Implement strong authentication (as described above).
        *   **TLS Encryption:** Use TLS encryption (as described above).
        *   **Data Validation:** Implement data validation on the application side to ensure that only valid data is written to Valkey.
        *   **Auditing:** Regularly audit Valkey's data for unauthorized changes.

## Threat: [Replication Issues (if used)](./threats/replication_issues__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If Valkey replication is used, an attacker compromises a replica instance. They then inject malicious data or commands that are replicated to the master instance.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption across the entire Valkey cluster.
    *   **Valkey Component Affected:** Replication mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Replicas:** Secure all replica instances with the same level of security as the master (authentication, TLS).
        *   **Replication Monitoring:** Monitor replication status and integrity.
        *   **Read-Only Replicas:** Configure replicas as read-only to prevent accidental or malicious writes.
        *   **Network Isolation:** Isolate replicas on a separate, secure network segment.
