# Threat Model Analysis for valkey-io/valkey

## Threat: [Network Eavesdropping on Valkey Communication](./threats/network_eavesdropping_on_valkey_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the Valkey server. They might use tools like Wireshark to capture packets and analyze the data being transmitted. If TLS is not enforced by Valkey, this data could be in plaintext.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored in or retrieved from Valkey, such as user credentials, application secrets, or business-critical information. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations.
    *   **Affected Valkey Component:** Network Communication Layer
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce TLS/SSL:** Configure Valkey to require TLS encryption for all client connections.
        *   **Secure Network Infrastructure:** Ensure the network infrastructure between the application and Valkey is secure and protected from unauthorized access.
        *   **Use VPN or Secure Tunnels:** If communication traverses untrusted networks, use VPNs or other secure tunneling mechanisms.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass](./threats/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Valkey's authentication mechanism (if enabled). This could involve exploiting flaws in password verification, token handling, or other authentication processes within Valkey itself.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Valkey data, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive information. This can lead to data breaches, data corruption, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Valkey Component:** Authentication Module (if enabled)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable and Enforce Strong Authentication:** Utilize Valkey's built-in authentication mechanisms and enforce strong password policies.
        *   **Regularly Update Valkey:** Keep Valkey updated to the latest version to patch known authentication vulnerabilities.
        *   **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** If supported by Valkey or the application's interaction with it, implement MFA for an added layer of security.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass](./threats/authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses Valkey's authorization controls, gaining access to data or operations they are not permitted to access within Valkey. This could involve exploiting flaws in Valkey's access control lists (ACLs).
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to specific data or functionalities within Valkey. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or privilege escalation within the Valkey instance.
    *   **Affected Valkey Component:** Authorization Module/ACLs
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configure Granular Access Controls:** Utilize Valkey's access control features to define fine-grained permissions for different users or applications.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to each user or application interacting with Valkey.
        *   **Regularly Review and Audit Permissions:** Periodically review and audit Valkey's access control configurations to ensure they are still appropriate and secure.

## Threat: [Exploiting Valkey Vulnerabilities for Information Disclosure](./threats/exploiting_valkey_vulnerabilities_for_information_disclosure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages a known or zero-day vulnerability within the Valkey codebase to extract sensitive information stored in the data store. This could involve memory leaks, buffer overflows, or other code-level flaws within Valkey.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored within Valkey, potentially leading to data breaches and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Valkey Component:** Various modules depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., Core Data Structures, Command Processing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if easily exploitable and leading to direct data access) to High (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Valkey Updated:** Regularly update Valkey to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Valkey.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting Valkey](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_targeting_valkey.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the Valkey server with a flood of requests or exploits a vulnerability within Valkey that causes excessive resource consumption, leading to service disruption and unavailability of the Valkey instance.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime and inability to access data stored in Valkey, impacting business operations and potentially causing financial losses.
    *   **Affected Valkey Component:** Network Communication Layer, Command Processing, Memory Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits and Throttling:** Configure Valkey to limit resource consumption and implement request throttling to prevent abuse.
        *   **Network Security Measures:** Utilize firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to filter malicious traffic targeting Valkey.
        *   **Consider Valkey Clustering:** Implement Valkey clustering for increased resilience and availability.

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Valkey Bugs](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_valkey_bugs.md)

*   **Description:** A bug within the Valkey codebase causes data corruption or inconsistencies within the data store. This could be triggered by specific commands, data patterns, or internal errors within Valkey.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of data integrity, leading to incorrect application behavior, unreliable data, and potential data loss.
    *   **Affected Valkey Component:** Core Data Structures, Persistence Mechanisms, Replication Modules
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Valkey Updated:** Regularly update Valkey to benefit from bug fixes.
        *   **Thorough Testing:** Implement comprehensive testing, including edge cases and stress testing, to identify potential data corruption issues within Valkey.
        *   **Regular Backups:** Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy for Valkey data.
        *   **Monitor Valkey Logs and Metrics:** Monitor Valkey logs and performance metrics for any signs of data corruption or unusual behavior.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Valkey Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_valkey_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Valkey relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to directly compromise Valkey.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for various security issues depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, including remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service affecting the Valkey instance.
    *   **Affected Valkey Component:** Dependency Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
