# Attack Tree Analysis for valkey-io/valkey

Objective: Compromise application that uses Valkey by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Valkey itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise Application Using Valkey
* **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Valkey Directly **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    * **[CRITICAL]** Gain Unauthorized Access to Valkey Instance **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Default Credentials **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * Access Valkey with default username/password
    * **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Valkey Vulnerabilities **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * **[CRITICAL]** Command Injection **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * Inject malicious commands via vulnerable Valkey commands or features
```


## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Valkey Directly [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_valkey_directly__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers bypass the application layer and directly interact with the Valkey instance. This often involves exploiting weaknesses in Valkey's authentication, authorization, or inherent vulnerabilities.
* **Why High-Risk:** Successful direct exploitation grants the attacker significant control over the data stored in Valkey, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or complete service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Gain Unauthorized Access to Valkey Instance [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__gain_unauthorized_access_to_valkey_instance__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to bypass Valkey's authentication mechanisms to gain access without legitimate credentials.
* **Why Critical:** This is a critical node because gaining unauthorized access is a prerequisite for many other high-impact attacks on Valkey. Once inside, attackers can execute commands, modify data, or exfiltrate sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Default Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_default_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers use commonly known default usernames and passwords that are often set during the initial installation of Valkey and not changed by administrators.
* **Why Critical and High-Risk:** This is a critical node and a high-risk path due to its relatively high likelihood (depending on deployment practices) and critical impact. It requires minimal effort and only novice-level skills, making it an easy target for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Valkey Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_valkey_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the Valkey software itself to execute malicious actions.
* **Why Critical and High-Risk:** Exploiting vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences, including command execution, data corruption, or information disclosure. While the likelihood of specific vulnerabilities might vary, the potential impact is significant.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Command Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__command_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers find a way to inject malicious operating system commands into Valkey, which are then executed by the Valkey process. This could be through vulnerable commands or features that don't properly sanitize input.
* **Why Critical and High-Risk:** This is a critical node and a high-risk path because successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Valkey. This can lead to complete server compromise, data breaches, and the ability to pivot to other systems.
