# Attack Surface Analysis for valkey-io/valkey

## Attack Surface: [Private Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/private_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the private keys used for signing container images.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Valkey's security directly depends on the integrity of these private keys. If compromised, Valkey will validate malicious images signed with the stolen key.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the key management system or gains access to a developer's machine where the private key is stored. They then sign a backdoored container image. Valkey, using the corresponding public key, incorrectly validates this malicious image.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the container image verification process. Attackers can deploy arbitrary malicious code disguised as legitimate applications.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust key management practices, including secure key generation, storage (e.g., Hardware Security Modules - HSMs, encrypted storage), access control (least privilege), and regular key rotation.
        *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for accessing key management systems.
        *   Implement auditing and monitoring of key access and usage.
        *   Consider using offline signing processes to minimize exposure of private keys.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Key Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_key_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Public keys (used by Valkey for verification) are stored insecurely, making them accessible to unauthorized parties.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Valkey needs access to public keys to perform verification. If these keys are tampered with, Valkey might accept malicious signatures or reject legitimate ones.
    *   **Example:** Public keys are stored in a publicly accessible Git repository or on a file system with overly permissive permissions. An attacker modifies a public key to match their own malicious signing key. Valkey now trusts images signed by the attacker.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypassing signature verification, leading to the deployment of untrusted images. Potential for denial of service if legitimate keys are replaced with invalid ones.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store public keys in a secure and controlled manner, such as a dedicated key management system or a secure configuration store with appropriate access controls.
        *   Regularly audit the storage locations and access controls for key material.
        *   Use checksums or other integrity checks to ensure the public keys haven't been tampered with.

## Attack Surface: [Signature Verification Bypass](./attack_surfaces/signature_verification_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in Valkey's signature verification logic allow attackers to craft malicious images with signatures that are incorrectly accepted as valid.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Valkey's core function is signature verification. Vulnerabilities in this process directly undermine its security guarantees.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a parsing vulnerability in Valkey's signature handling. They craft a malicious image with a specially crafted signature that exploits this vulnerability, causing Valkey to incorrectly validate it.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of malicious container images despite the intended security measures.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Valkey updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Thoroughly test Valkey's integration and configuration.
        *   Consider using static analysis and fuzzing tools on Valkey's codebase (if possible and relevant to your use case).
        *   Implement robust error handling and logging within Valkey's verification process to aid in identifying potential bypass attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of Valkey](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of_valkey.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured Valkey settings weaken its security posture, allowing malicious images to be accepted.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Valkey's flexibility in configuration can be a source of vulnerability if not managed properly.
    *   **Example:**  Valkey is configured with overly permissive trust policies, allowing signatures from untrusted sources. An attacker signs a malicious image with a key from one of these overly trusted sources, and Valkey accepts it.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing intended security controls, leading to the deployment of untrusted images.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow security best practices when configuring Valkey.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when defining trust policies.
        *   Regularly review and audit Valkey's configuration.
        *   Use infrastructure-as-code to manage Valkey's configuration and ensure consistency.
