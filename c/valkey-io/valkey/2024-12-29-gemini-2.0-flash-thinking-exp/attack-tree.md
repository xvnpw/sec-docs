## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Valkey instance it utilizes.

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to application data or functionality by leveraging vulnerabilities in the Valkey data store.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Valkey Configuration Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Access Valkey with Default Credentials:**
        *   The application is configured to connect to Valkey using the default username and password (if any exist by default or were not changed).
        *   An attacker obtains these default credentials through publicly available information, leaked configuration files, or by guessing.
        *   The attacker uses these credentials to authenticate to Valkey and execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Exploit Insecure Valkey Configuration:**
        *   Valkey is configured without requiring authentication (`requirepass` is not set or is commented out).
        *   Valkey is bound to all network interfaces (`bind 0.0.0.0`) making it accessible from outside the intended network.
        *   Other insecure settings are enabled, such as disabling protected mode or using weak default ports.
        *   An attacker identifies these insecure settings through network scanning or by accessing exposed configuration files.
        *   The attacker connects to the unsecured Valkey instance and executes arbitrary commands.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Valkey Protocol Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Command Injection via Application:**
        *   The application takes user input and directly incorporates it into Valkey commands without proper sanitization or validation.
        *   An attacker crafts malicious input that, when incorporated into the command, injects unintended Valkey commands.
        *   For example, if the application uses user input to set a key, an attacker might input `key value; CONFIG SET requirepass attacker_password` to change the Valkey password.
        *   The injected commands are executed by Valkey, potentially leading to data modification, unauthorized access, or denial of service.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Network Access to Valkey**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:**
        *   The communication channel between the application and Valkey is not encrypted (e.g., TLS is not enabled).
        *   An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and Valkey.
        *   The attacker can read sensitive data being exchanged, such as authentication credentials or application data.
        *   The attacker can also modify commands being sent to Valkey, potentially manipulating data or executing unauthorized actions.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Valkey Network Port:**
        *   The Valkey port (default 6379) is exposed on the network without proper firewall rules or network segmentation.
        *   An attacker scans the network and identifies the open Valkey port.
        *   The attacker directly connects to the Valkey instance without going through the application.
        *   If authentication is weak or non-existent, the attacker can execute arbitrary Valkey commands.

**Critical Node: Attacker gains access to the persistence files**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure File Permissions:** The AOF or RDB persistence files are stored with overly permissive file system permissions, allowing unauthorized users to read or write to them.
    *   **Compromised Server:** The server hosting the Valkey instance is compromised through other means, granting the attacker access to the file system.
    *   **Exposed Backups:** Backups of the persistence files are stored in an insecure location accessible to the attacker.
    *   **Exploiting Application Vulnerabilities:** Vulnerabilities in the application itself allow an attacker to gain file system access and manipulate the persistence files.
    *   Once access is gained, the attacker can modify the AOF file to inject malicious commands that will be executed when Valkey restarts, or modify the RDB file to inject or alter data.
