# Threat Model Analysis for valkey-io/valkey

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to Valkey using default credentials (e.g., 'default', 'password') or commonly used weak passwords. They might use brute-force techniques or rely on publicly known default credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Valkey instance, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Valkey Component:** Authentication Module
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Change the default password immediately upon deployment.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for Valkey users.
    *   Consider disabling default accounts if possible.
    *   Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.

## Threat: [Lack of Authentication](./threats/lack_of_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Valkey is deployed without any authentication mechanism enabled. An attacker on the network can directly connect to the Valkey instance and execute commands.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Valkey instance, including the ability to read, modify, or delete all data, and potentially execute arbitrary commands if Lua scripting is enabled.
*   **Affected Valkey Component:** Authentication Module, Network Listener
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable the `requirepass` configuration option to set a password for authentication.
    *   Utilize the `acl` (Access Control List) feature to define granular permissions for users and commands.
    *   Ensure Valkey is not exposed to public networks without proper network segmentation and firewall rules.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Controls](./threats/insufficient_access_controls.md)

*   **Description:**  Valkey's ACLs are not configured with the principle of least privilege in mind. Users or applications have more permissions than necessary, allowing them to perform actions beyond their intended scope.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion by compromised or malicious internal actors.
*   **Affected Valkey Component:** Access Control List (ACL) Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement fine-grained ACLs, granting only the necessary permissions to each user or application.
    *   Regularly review and audit ACL configurations.
    *   Utilize Valkey's role-based access control features if available.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in Valkey](./threats/authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities_in_valkey.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a previously unknown or unpatched vulnerability in Valkey's authentication implementation to bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Valkey instance and its data.
*   **Affected Valkey Component:** Authentication Module
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Valkey updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories from the Valkey project.
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to detect and block potential exploit attempts.

## Threat: [Data Exposure in Transit](./threats/data_exposure_in_transit.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and Valkey when the connection is not encrypted. They can then read sensitive data being transmitted.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive application data.
*   **Affected Valkey Component:** Network Communication
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS encryption for all connections between the application and Valkey.
    *   Configure Valkey to require TLS and reject unencrypted connections.
    *   Ensure proper certificate management.

## Threat: [Data Exposure at Rest](./threats/data_exposure_at_rest.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the server where Valkey's persistence files (RDB or AOF) are stored. If these files are not properly secured or encrypted, the attacker can read the data.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive application data.
*   **Affected Valkey Component:** Persistence (RDB/AOF) Module, File System
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encrypt Valkey's persistence files at rest using operating system-level encryption or dedicated encryption tools.
    *   Restrict access to the directories where persistence files are stored using file system permissions.
    *   Regularly back up persistence files to secure locations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities Leading to Data Corruption](./threats/vulnerabilities_leading_to_data_corruption.md)

*   **Description:** A bug within Valkey's data handling or storage mechanisms causes data to be corrupted or become inconsistent.
*   **Impact:** Application malfunction, data integrity issues, potential data loss.
*   **Affected Valkey Component:** Data Storage, Data Replication (if used)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Valkey updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Implement data validation checks in the application before storing data in Valkey.
    *   Utilize Valkey's persistence mechanisms (RDB or AOF) for data recovery.
    *   If using replication, monitor replication status and ensure data consistency across replicas.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests or commands to Valkey, consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, denial of service.
*   **Affected Valkey Component:** Network Listener, Command Processing
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure resource limits in Valkey (e.g., `maxmemory`).
    *   Implement connection limits and rate limiting at the network or application level.
    *   Use a firewall to block malicious traffic.
    *   Monitor Valkey's resource usage and set up alerts for abnormal activity.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities for DoS](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_for_dos.md)

    *   Monitor Valkey's stability and error logs.

## Threat: [Abuse of Lua Scripting (Command Injection)](./threats/abuse_of_lua_scripting__command_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** If Lua scripting is enabled, an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application's handling of user input or data passed to Lua scripts, allowing them to inject malicious Lua code that executes on the Valkey server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Valkey server, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Affected Valkey Component:** Lua Scripting Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable Lua scripting if it's not required.
    *   Carefully sanitize and validate all user input before incorporating it into Lua scripts.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to Lua scripts.
    *   Regularly audit Lua scripts for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Command Parsing (Command Injection)](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_command_parsing__command_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that exploits a vulnerability in Valkey's command parsing logic, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation, information disclosure, potential remote code execution.
*   **Affected Valkey Component:** Command Parsing
