# Attack Surface Analysis for valkey-io/valkey

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Network Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_network_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Valkey instances are directly accessible on the network without proper access controls, allowing unauthorized connections to the Valkey service itself.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes:** By default, Valkey listens on a specific port (typically 6379) and can accept connections from any source if not configured otherwise. This inherent behavior of opening a network port makes it a direct point of access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, potential data manipulation or deletion via Valkey commands, denial of service by overwhelming the Valkey instance, and the ability to execute arbitrary Valkey commands.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Lack of TLS/SSL Encryption](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_tlsssl_encryption.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and the Valkey instance is not encrypted, exposing Valkey communication to eavesdropping and potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes:** Valkey supports TLS/SSL encryption for client connections, but it is not enabled by default. The choice to not enforce encryption by default directly contributes to this attack surface.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach of data stored in or retrieved from Valkey, potential for credential theft if authentication details are transmitted unencrypted, and the ability for attackers to intercept and modify Valkey commands in transit.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** Valkey's authentication mechanisms are either disabled, use default credentials, or have weak configurations, allowing unauthorized access to the Valkey service.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes:** Valkey provides password-based authentication and Access Control Lists (ACLs). The security of the Valkey instance directly depends on the proper configuration and enforcement of these Valkey-provided features.
    *   **Impact:** Full unauthorized access to the Valkey instance, leading to data breaches, data manipulation or deletion via Valkey commands, and potential control over the application's data stored in Valkey.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Valkey Commands](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_valkey_commands.md)

*   **Description:** The application constructs Valkey commands using unsanitized user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands that are then executed by the Valkey server.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes:** Valkey's fundamental interaction model relies on sending commands with arguments. This command-based architecture makes it inherently vulnerable to injection if input is not handled carefully before being used in Valkey commands.
    *   **Impact:** Data manipulation within Valkey, information disclosure through crafted Valkey commands, potential for remote code execution on the Valkey server if Lua scripting is enabled and exploited, and denial of service by executing resource-intensive or crashing commands.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Lua Scripting Vulnerabilities (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/lua_scripting_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If Lua scripting is enabled in Valkey, vulnerabilities in custom scripts or the Lua environment itself can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the Valkey server.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes:** Valkey's feature of allowing server-side Lua scripting introduces a direct pathway for executing arbitrary code within the Valkey process.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Valkey server, potentially compromising the entire system and the data it holds. This allows attackers to bypass Valkey's intended security boundaries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Replication and Clustering Vulnerabilities (if used)](./attack_surfaces/replication_and_clustering_vulnerabilities__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If Valkey is used in a replication or clustering setup, vulnerabilities in the communication between Valkey instances can be exploited to compromise the data or the cluster itself.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes:** Valkey's replication and clustering features involve inter-node communication protocols. The security of these protocols directly impacts the overall security of the distributed Valkey environment.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption or loss across the replicated or clustered environment, data breaches due to interception of replication traffic, and potential for taking down the entire replicated or clustered environment by exploiting vulnerabilities in inter-node communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Valkey Software Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_valkey_software_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered or unpatched security vulnerabilities within the Valkey codebase can be directly exploited to compromise the Valkey instance.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes:** As a software application, Valkey's own codebase is a potential source of vulnerabilities. These are inherent to the software itself.
    *   **Impact:** Can range from denial of service and data breaches to remote code execution on the Valkey server, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. Exploiting vulnerabilities in Valkey directly targets the core of the service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Management Interface (e.g., `redis-cli`)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_management_interface__e_g____redis-cli__.md)

*   **Description:** Unrestricted access to Valkey's management interface allows attackers to directly interact with and control the Valkey instance, bypassing application-level controls.
    *   **How Valkey Contributes:** Valkey provides powerful management tools like `redis-cli`. The availability and accessibility of these tools directly contribute to the attack surface if not properly secured.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss through commands like `FLUSHALL`, configuration changes that weaken security, and the ability to execute arbitrary Valkey commands, potentially leading to further compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
