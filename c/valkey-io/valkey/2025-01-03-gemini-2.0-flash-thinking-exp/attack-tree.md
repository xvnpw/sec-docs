## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Valkey [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_valkey__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. It represents any successful exploitation of Valkey that leads to a compromise of the application using it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Valkey Functionality [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_valkey_functionality__critical_.md)

This category encompasses attacks that leverage the intended features of Valkey in unintended and malicious ways. It's critical because it directly targets the core functionalities of the service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Lua Scripting [CRITICAL] HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_lua_scripting__critical__high_risk_path.md)

Valkey, like Redis, allows the execution of Lua scripts. If enabled, this powerful feature can be abused to perform actions far beyond simple data manipulation.
    * **High Risk:** Due to the potential for arbitrary code execution and access to sensitive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Commands on Valkey Server [CRITICAL] HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_commands_on_valkey_server__critical__high_risk_path.md)

By injecting malicious Lua scripts, an attacker can leverage Valkey's ability to execute system commands on the underlying server. This can lead to complete server takeover.
    * **High Risk:** Direct path to full server compromise with devastating impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Lua Script (AND) HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_lua_script__and__high_risk_path.md)

This is the necessary step to execute arbitrary commands or access sensitive data via Lua scripting. It involves crafting and sending a Lua script containing malicious instructions to the Valkey server.
    * **High Risk:**  The core action enabling the abuse of Lua scripting.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Script Execution [CRITICAL] HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_input_sanitization_in_script_execution__critical__high_risk_path.md)

If the application doesn't properly sanitize inputs before incorporating them into Lua scripts executed on Valkey, an attacker can inject malicious code that gets executed.
    * **High Risk:** A common vulnerability that directly leads to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Valkey's `redis.call` or Similar Functionality HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_valkey's__redis_call__or_similar_functionality_high_risk_path.md)

Within Lua scripts, functions like `redis.call` allow interaction with Valkey's commands. Attackers can use this to execute privileged commands or manipulate data in ways that compromise the application or the server.
    * **High Risk:**  A powerful tool within Lua scripting that can be easily abused.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Valkey Configuration Weaknesses [CRITICAL] HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_valkey_configuration_weaknesses__critical__high_risk_path.md)

This category represents vulnerabilities arising from insecure configuration of the Valkey instance. These are often simple to exploit and have a high impact.
    * **High Risk:** Common misconfigurations provide easy entry points for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials [CRITICAL] HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials__critical__high_risk_path.md)

If the default password for the Valkey instance is not changed, attackers can gain immediate administrative access.
    * **High Risk:** Extremely easy to exploit with a very high impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Valkey Instance with Default Password HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/access_valkey_instance_with_default_password_high_risk_path.md)

This is the direct action of logging into Valkey using the unchanged default credentials.
    * **High Risk:** Trivial to execute and grants full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Authentication HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/weak_authentication_high_risk_path.md)

Using weak or easily guessable passwords makes the Valkey instance vulnerable to brute-force or dictionary attacks.
    * **High Risk:**  A common vulnerability that can be exploited with readily available tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-Force or Dictionary Attack on Valkey Password HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/brute-force_or_dictionary_attack_on_valkey_password_high_risk_path.md)

Attackers attempt to guess the Valkey password by trying a large number of possibilities. This is effective if weak passwords are used.
    * **High Risk:**  Relatively easy to execute, especially with automated tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Network Configuration HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_network_configuration_high_risk_path.md)

If the Valkey instance is accessible from unauthorized networks (e.g., the public internet without proper firewall rules), attackers can attempt to connect and exploit vulnerabilities.
    * **High Risk:** Exposes the Valkey instance to a broader range of potential attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Valkey Instance from Unauthorized Networks HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/access_valkey_instance_from_unauthorized_networks_high_risk_path.md)

This is the action of an attacker connecting to the Valkey instance from a network they should not have access to.
    * **High Risk:**  A prerequisite for many other attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Firewall Rules or Network Segmentation HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_firewall_rules_or_network_segmentation_high_risk_path.md)

The absence of proper firewall rules or network segmentation allows unauthorized network access to the Valkey instance, making it vulnerable to various attacks.
    * **High Risk:** A fundamental security flaw that significantly increases the attack surface.
