# RISK ASSESSMENT

* Critical Business Processes
 - Data Storage and Retrieval: The core function of Valkey is storing and retrieving data. Disruption or compromise of this process directly impacts applications relying on Valkey.
 - Application Performance: Many applications depend on Valkey for low-latency data access to maintain performance. Performance degradation or unavailability of Valkey can severely impact application performance and user experience.

* Data Sensitivity
 - Data Sensitivity Level: Data sensitivity depends heavily on the use case. Valkey can store highly sensitive data such as user credentials, personal information, financial data, or session data. In other cases, it might store less sensitive data like cached web pages or temporary counters.
