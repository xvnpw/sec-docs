# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for taosdata/tdengine

## Mitigation Strategy: [TDengine Internal Firewall and Connection Control](./mitigation_strategies/tdengine_internal_firewall_and_connection_control.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check for Feature Availability:** Consult the TDengine documentation for your *specific version* to determine if it includes a built-in firewall or connection control mechanism.  This might be part of the `taos.cfg` configuration or a separate utility.
    2.  **Configure Allowed IPs/Ranges:** If available, configure the internal firewall to allow connections *only* from the specific IP addresses or ranges of your authorized application servers and administrative hosts.  This acts as a second layer of defense *within* TDengine, even if the network-level firewall is misconfigured.
    3.  **Configure Connection Limits:** If the feature allows, set limits on the maximum number of concurrent connections from a single IP address or range. This can help mitigate some DoS attacks.
    4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update the internal firewall configuration to ensure it remains aligned with your network security policies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access via Network (Severity: Critical):** Provides an additional layer of protection against unauthorized connections, even if the external network firewall is bypassed or misconfigured.
    *   **Some DoS Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Connection limits can help mitigate some basic DoS attacks originating from a limited number of sources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced moderately (adds a layer of defense, but network segmentation is still primary).
    *   **DoS Attacks:** Risk reduced slightly.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example:  Need to investigate if TDengine version X.Y.Z has a built-in firewall. If so, it's not currently configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example:  Requires research into TDengine's feature set. If available, needs to be configured and tested.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS/SSL Encryption within TDengine](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tlsssl_encryption_within_tdengine.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate/Obtain Certificates:** Obtain valid TLS/SSL certificates (see previous description for details).
    2.  **Configure `taos.cfg` (or equivalent):** Modify the TDengine server configuration file (`taos.cfg` or the relevant file for your version) to:
        *   Specify the paths to the server's certificate and private key files.
        *   Enable TLS/SSL and *disable* any non-TLS connection options.  Look for parameters like `ssl` , `enableSSL`, `sslKeyFile`, `sslCertFile` (the exact names will vary).
    3.  **Client Configuration (TDengine-Specific):** Ensure that *all* TDengine client libraries and tools are configured to use TLS/SSL.  This often involves:
        *   Using the correct connection string or parameters that specify TLS/SSL.
        *   Providing the path to a trusted CA certificate file (or the self-signed CA, for testing) for certificate verification.  *Do not* disable certificate verification.  TDengine-specific client libraries might have their own configuration options for this.
    4.  **Test Connections:** Thoroughly test all connections to ensure TLS/SSL is working and certificate validation is enforced. Use TDengine's own tools (like `taos`) to verify.
    5.  **Certificate Rotation:** Establish a process for rotating certificates before they expire.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (Severity: Critical):** Prevents interception and eavesdropping on communication.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (Severity: Critical):** Protects sensitive data in transit.
    *   **Credential Sniffing (Severity: Critical):** Prevents capture of credentials.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MITM Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced significantly.
    *   **Credential Sniffing:** Risk reduced significantly.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: TLS/SSL is enabled in `taos.cfg`, but client-side verification is inconsistent across different applications using different TDengine client libraries.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Need to ensure *all* TDengine client libraries and tools are configured to enforce certificate verification.  Need to document the certificate rotation process within the context of TDengine.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TDengine Authentication and RBAC](./mitigation_strategies/tdengine_authentication_and_rbac.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Default Accounts:** If TDengine has any default accounts (besides "root"), disable them via TDengine's administrative commands.
    2.  **Strong Root Password:** Change the default "root" password using TDengine's password management commands (e.g., `ALTER USER`).
    3.  **Create Application-Specific Users:** Use TDengine's `CREATE USER` command to create separate user accounts for each application.
    4.  **Principle of Least Privilege (TDengine Commands):** Grant permissions using TDengine's `GRANT` command.  Be *extremely* specific:
        *   `GRANT SELECT ON db.table TO 'user'@'host';` (read-only access to a specific table)
        *   `GRANT INSERT ON db.table TO 'user'@'host';` (write-only access)
        *   *Avoid* granting `ALL PRIVILEGES` or database-wide permissions unless absolutely necessary.
        *   Use the `'host'` specifier to restrict connections from specific IP addresses/ranges, if possible (this reinforces network segmentation).
    5.  **Regular Review (TDengine Commands):** Use TDengine's commands (e.g., `SHOW GRANTS`) to periodically review user permissions and ensure they remain appropriate.
    6.  **Password Policies (if supported):** If TDengine supports password policies (length, complexity, expiration), configure them through TDengine's administrative commands.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access via Weak Credentials (Severity: Critical):**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):**
    *   **Insider Threats (Severity: Medium):**

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced significantly.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Risk reduced moderately.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Authentication is enabled, and the root password is changed.  No application-specific users or granular permissions are configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example:  Need to create users and grant permissions using TDengine's `CREATE USER` and `GRANT` commands, following the principle of least privilege.  Need to establish a regular review process using TDengine's `SHOW GRANTS` (or equivalent).

## Mitigation Strategy: [TDengine Resource Limits and Configuration Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/tdengine_resource_limits_and_configuration_hardening.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `taos.cfg`:** Carefully examine the `taos.cfg` file (or equivalent) for parameters related to resource limits and security.
    2.  **Connection Limits:** Set limits on the maximum number of connections (`maxConnections`, or similar).  This should be based on your expected workload and system capacity.
    3.  **Memory Limits:** Configure memory limits for various TDengine components (data nodes, management nodes) to prevent excessive memory consumption.  Look for parameters like `cache`, `blocks`, `memory`, etc.
    4.  **CPU Limits (if applicable):** If TDengine allows setting CPU limits, configure them appropriately.
    5.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  If you don't need certain TDengine features (e.g., the RESTful interface, specific connectors), disable them in `taos.cfg` to reduce the attack surface.
    6.  **Query Timeouts:** Set appropriate query timeouts to prevent long-running or malicious queries from consuming excessive resources.
    7. **Regular Review:** Periodically review and adjust these settings as your workload and system capacity change.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Resource limits can help mitigate some DoS attacks by preventing resource exhaustion.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Prevents a single client or query from consuming all available resources.
    *   **Configuration-Based Vulnerabilities (Severity: Varies):** Disabling unnecessary features reduces the attack surface.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS Attacks:** Risk reduced moderately.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced significantly.
    *   **Configuration Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced moderately.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Default `taos.cfg` settings are mostly in use.  No specific resource limits or feature disabling has been done.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example:  Need to thoroughly review `taos.cfg`, set appropriate resource limits (connections, memory, etc.), and disable any unnecessary features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TDengine Logging and Auditing](./mitigation_strategies/tdengine_logging_and_auditing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Audit Logging (if available):** Check the TDengine documentation for your version to see if it supports audit logging.  If so, enable it and configure it to capture:
        *   Successful and failed login attempts.
        *   Data modifications (inserts, updates, deletes).
        *   Schema changes (table creation, alteration, deletion).
        *   User management operations (user creation, modification, deletion).
    2.  **Configure Log Levels:** Set appropriate log levels for different TDengine components (error logs, warning logs, info logs).  Ensure that sufficient detail is captured for security monitoring.
    3.  **Log Rotation (TDengine Settings):** Configure log rotation within TDengine to prevent log files from growing indefinitely. This is often done in `taos.cfg`.
    4. **Review Logs (using TDengine tools if available):** If TDengine provides tools for querying or analyzing its own logs, use them to regularly review logs for suspicious activity.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Intrusion Detection (Severity: Varies):**
    *   **Forensic Analysis (Severity: Varies):**
    *   **Compliance (Severity: Varies):**

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Intrusion Detection:** Improved detection capabilities.
    *   **Forensic Analysis:** Significantly improved ability to investigate incidents.
    *   **Compliance:** Helps meet compliance requirements.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Basic error logging is enabled, but audit logging is not. Log rotation is configured with default settings.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Need to investigate if TDengine supports audit logging. If so, enable and configure it. Need to review and potentially adjust log rotation settings.
