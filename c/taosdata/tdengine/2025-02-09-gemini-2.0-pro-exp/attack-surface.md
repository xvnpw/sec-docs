# Attack Surface Analysis for taosdata/tdengine

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Data Access via Network (TDengine Ports/Protocol)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_data_access_via_network__tdengine_portsprotocol_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to TDengine data by directly exploiting vulnerabilities in TDengine's network services or its proprietary communication protocol.
    *   **How TDengine Contributes:** TDengine exposes network ports for client connections and inter-node communication.  The proprietary protocol, while optimized, is a potential target for attackers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers an open, unauthenticated TDengine port (due to firewall misconfiguration or a vulnerability in TDengine's authentication) and uses a custom client to send commands directly to the TDengine server, bypassing application-level security.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data exfiltration, potential for data manipulation or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Firewall Rules:** Implement *very* strict firewall rules (host-based and network-based) to allow *only* necessary connections to TDengine ports from *explicitly authorized* sources.  Deny all other traffic.
        *   **Change Default Ports:** Change TDengine's default ports to non-standard values.
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for *all* TDengine users.  Disable the default `root` user after creating a new administrative user.
        *   **TLS Encryption:** *Require* TLS encryption for *all* client-server and inter-node communication.  Use strong TLS ciphers and regularly update certificates.  Verify client certificates where possible.
        *   **VPN/Tunneling:** Mandate that all remote access to the TDengine cluster occurs through a VPN or secure tunnel.
        *   **Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention:** Deploy an IDS/IPS system configured to monitor for suspicious activity related to the TDengine protocol (if possible, with custom rules).

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in TDengine Code](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_tdengine_code.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in TDengine's core code (dnode, mnode), its proprietary protocol implementation, or its connectors (taosAdapter, JDBC, etc.) to gain control or access data.
    *   **How TDengine Contributes:** This is inherent to *any* software.  TDengine's specific codebase and components are the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A zero-day vulnerability is discovered in TDengine's handling of a specific data type, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious query that triggers a buffer overflow and executes arbitrary code on the TDengine server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE), data corruption, data exfiltration, complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediate Patching:** Implement a *rapid* patching process for TDengine.  Monitor security advisories *very* closely and apply updates *immediately* upon release.  Have a rollback plan in case of issues.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan for outdated or vulnerable versions of TDengine and its components.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run TDengine processes with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges.  *Never* run as root.
        *   **Security Hardening:** Harden the underlying operating system and network environment according to best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Targeting TDengine)](./attack_surfaces/denial-of-service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__targeting_tdengine_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm TDengine's internal resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, connections) with specifically crafted requests or queries, causing service disruption.
    *   **How TDengine Contributes:** TDengine's performance and stability are directly tied to its resource management.  Vulnerabilities or limitations in its resource handling can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of specially crafted queries designed to exploit a weakness in TDengine's query optimizer, causing excessive CPU consumption and making the server unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, data unavailability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **TDengine-Specific Resource Limits:** Configure *strict* resource limits *within TDengine* (using `taos.cfg` parameters like `max_connections`, `max_cpu_cores`, query timeouts, etc.) to prevent any single user or query from monopolizing resources.
        *   **Query Analysis and Optimization:** *Actively* monitor query performance and identify slow or resource-intensive queries.  Work with developers to optimize queries and prevent inefficient operations.  Use TDengine's built-in query analysis tools.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Network Level):** Implement rate limiting at the network level (firewall or reverse proxy) to control the number of connections and requests *specifically to TDengine ports*.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of TDengine's Access Control (RBAC)](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of_tdengine's_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured user roles and permissions within TDengine itself grant excessive access.
    *   **How TDengine Contributes:** TDengine's built-in RBAC system is the direct source of this risk.
    *   **Example:** A TDengine user is accidentally granted the `SUPER` privilege, allowing them to modify system settings or access data they shouldn't.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, data deletion, potential for denial-of-service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Least Privilege:** Enforce the principle of least privilege *meticulously* within TDengine's RBAC.  Grant *only* the absolute minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid using the `SUPER` privilege except for initial setup and essential administrative tasks.
        *   **Regular RBAC Audits:** Conduct regular, thorough audits of TDengine user roles and permissions.  Automate this process if possible.
        *   **Role-Based Templates:** Use predefined role templates to standardize permissions and reduce configuration errors.
