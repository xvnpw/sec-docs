## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via TDengine [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_tdengine__critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Successfully reaching this node signifies a complete compromise of the application through TDengine vulnerabilities.
* **Impact:** Full control over the application's data and functionality, potential for further attacks on connected systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Data Manipulation Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_data_manipulation_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** This category encompasses attacks that aim to manipulate data within the TDengine database to compromise the application.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, manipulation of application logic, denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. TDengine Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__tdengine_injection__critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL/TSQL code into queries executed by the application against TDengine.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Inject Malicious Statements [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__inject_malicious_statements__critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** The successful injection of malicious SQL/TSQL statements to perform unauthorized actions.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized data access, potential for command execution (though less common in databases directly).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Data Exfiltration via Query Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__data_exfiltration_via_query_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers craft queries to extract sensitive data they are not authorized to access.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1. Construct Queries to Extract This Data [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1__construct_queries_to_extract_this_data__critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** The successful construction and execution of malicious queries to retrieve sensitive information.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of confidential information.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Access Control Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_access_control_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** This category involves attacks that bypass or abuse TDengine's access control mechanisms.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and functionality, privilege escalation, data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Authentication Bypass [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__authentication_bypass__critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers circumvent TDengine's authentication process to gain unauthorized access.
* **Impact:** Full access to the database, potentially leading to complete application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Exploit Weak or Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__exploit_weak_or_default_credentials__critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers use easily guessable or default credentials to log in to TDengine.
* **Impact:** Full access to the database with the privileges of the compromised account.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Authorization Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__authorization_exploitation.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in TDengine's authorization model to gain privileges they shouldn't have or access data they are not permitted to see.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential for privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1. Access Data Outside Granted Permissions [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1__access_data_outside_granted_permissions__critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers successfully access data that their assigned roles and permissions should restrict.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of confidential information.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3. Credential Compromise [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3__credential_compromise__critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers obtain valid TDengine credentials through various means (e.g., sniffing, phishing, accessing configuration files).
* **Impact:** Full access to the database with the privileges of the compromised user.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit System Level Vulnerabilities within TDengine](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_system_level_vulnerabilities_within_tdengine.md)

* **Description:** This category focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the TDengine system itself.
* **Impact:** Service disruption, data corruption, potential for remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1. Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1__denial_of_service__dos___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers overwhelm TDengine with requests or exploit bugs to make it unavailable.
* **Impact:** Application downtime, loss of service availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2. Configuration Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2__configuration_exploitation__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit insecure default configurations or misconfigurations in TDengine.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2.1. Insecure Default Configurations [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_1__insecure_default_configurations__critical_node_.md)

* **Description:** TDengine is running with default settings that are known to be insecure.
* **Impact:** Easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities, potential for direct unauthorized access.
