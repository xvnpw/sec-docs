# Threat Model Analysis for taosdata/tdengine

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Weak or Default Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to the TDengine server using default credentials (e.g., `root:taosdata`) or easily guessable passwords. They might use brute-force attacks or rely on publicly known default credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Successful login grants the attacker full administrative control over the TDengine instance, allowing them to read, modify, or delete any data, create or drop databases and users, and potentially disrupt the service.
    *   **TDengine Component Affected:** `taosd` (authentication module).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Force strong password changes for default accounts upon initial setup.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all TDengine users.
        *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.
        *   Consider disabling or renaming the default `root` account.

## Threat: [Bypass of Authentication Mechanisms](./threats/bypass_of_authentication_mechanisms.md)

*   **Threat:** Bypass of Authentication Mechanisms
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the TDengine client libraries or the server itself to bypass the normal authentication process. This could involve exploiting bugs in the authentication protocol or implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the TDengine instance without providing valid credentials, leading to data breaches, manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **TDengine Component Affected:** `taosd` (authentication module), TDengine client libraries (e.g., `taosSql`, language-specific connectors).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the TDengine server and client libraries updated to the latest stable versions with security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories from the TDengine project.
        *   Implement network-level access controls to restrict access to the TDengine server.

## Threat: [SQL Injection (TDengine SQL)](./threats/sql_injection__tdengine_sql_.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection (TDengine SQL)
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries by injecting code into input fields or parameters that are not properly sanitized by the application before being passed to TDengine.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In some scenarios, depending on database configurations and permissions, it might be possible to execute arbitrary commands on the TDengine server.
    *   **TDengine Component Affected:** `taosd` (SQL query processing engine).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if command execution is possible)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with TDengine.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the application side.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege for database user permissions.

## Threat: [TDengine Software Vulnerabilities](./threats/tdengine_software_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** TDengine Software Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in the TDengine server software. This could be a buffer overflow, remote code execution, or other type of security flaw.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the TDengine server, denial of service, data breaches, or other forms of compromise.
    *   **TDengine Component Affected:** Various modules within `taosd` depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the TDengine server software up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories from the TDengine project and relevant security organizations.
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS).

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks against TDengine](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_against_tdengine.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks against TDengine
    *   **Description:** An attacker floods the TDengine server with a large number of requests, consuming resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and making the service unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime and disruption of services relying on TDengine.
    *   **TDengine Component Affected:** `taosd` (network communication, query processing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the application side or using network security devices.
        *   Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the TDengine server.
        *   Monitor TDengine server resources and performance for anomalies.
        *   Consider using a DDoS mitigation service.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on TDengine Components](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_tdengine_components.md)

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks on TDengine Components
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the TDengine installation packages, dependencies, or build process, injecting malicious code into the software before it is deployed.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the TDengine instance and potentially the entire application infrastructure.
    *   **TDengine Component Affected:** TDengine installation packages, build tools, dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download TDengine software from official and trusted sources.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or digital signatures.
        *   Implement software composition analysis (SCA) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
