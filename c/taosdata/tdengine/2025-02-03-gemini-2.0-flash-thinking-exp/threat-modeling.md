# Threat Model Analysis for taosdata/tdengine

## Threat: [Weak Default Credentials](./threats/weak_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker uses default usernames and passwords (if not changed) to gain unauthorized access to TDengine. They can then read, modify, or delete data, and potentially disrupt service.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, service disruption, complete compromise of TDengine instance.
*   **Affected TDengine Component:**  `taosd` (TDengine Server), Authentication Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Change default passwords immediately upon installation.
    *   Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, rotation).

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Control](./threats/insufficient_access_control.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits overly permissive user roles or misconfigured access control lists (ACLs) within TDengine to gain unauthorized access to data or perform privileged operations. They might escalate privileges or access sensitive data they are not supposed to.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized operations, potential privilege escalation.
*   **Affected TDengine Component:** `taosd` (TDengine Server), Authorization Module, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege within TDengine's RBAC.
    *   Carefully define roles and permissions based on user needs.
    *   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions in TDengine.

## Threat: [Insecure Data Storage (Data at Rest)](./threats/insecure_data_storage__data_at_rest_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains physical access to the TDengine server or storage media and accesses sensitive data stored on disk because data at rest encryption within TDengine is not enabled or properly configured.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, loss of confidentiality of sensitive data.
*   **Affected TDengine Component:** `taosd` (TDengine Server), Storage Engine, Data Encryption Module (if applicable)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and properly configure TDengine's data at rest encryption features.
    *   Use secure key management practices for encryption keys used by TDengine.

## Threat: [Data in Transit Vulnerabilities (Unencrypted Communication)](./threats/data_in_transit_vulnerabilities__unencrypted_communication_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and TDengine when communication is not encrypted using TLS/SSL. They can then read or modify sensitive data being transmitted to or from TDengine.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, loss of confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.
*   **Affected TDengine Component:** `taosd` (TDengine Server), Network Communication Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all communication between the application and TDengine.
    *   Configure TDengine to require encrypted connections.

## Threat: [Exploitation of TDengine Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_tdengine_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in TDengine software itself to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or compromise the database server.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, service disruption, potential remote code execution on the database server, complete compromise of TDengine instance.
*   **Affected TDengine Component:** `taosd` (TDengine Server), potentially any module depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if remote code execution or data breach is possible), High (for DoS or data manipulation).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with TDengine security patches and announcements.
    *   Regularly update TDengine to the latest stable version.
    *   Subscribe to security mailing lists or vulnerability databases related to TDengine.
    *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing focusing on TDengine specific aspects.
