# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for taosdata/tdengine

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies for TDengine Users](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies_for_tdengine_users.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure TDengine server settings to enforce password complexity requirements. This typically involves setting minimum password length, requiring a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Consult TDengine documentation for specific configuration parameters related to password policies.
    2.  Disable or remove default TDengine accounts that might have weak or default passwords. Create new accounts with strong, unique passwords for all users and applications accessing TDengine.
    3.  Educate all users and developers who interact with TDengine about the importance of strong passwords and password security best practices related to TDengine access.
    4.  Consider implementing password rotation policies, requiring users to change their passwords periodically (e.g., every 90 days) for TDengine accounts.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-force attacks (High Severity) - Attackers attempting to guess TDengine user passwords through repeated trials.
    *   Credential stuffing (High Severity) - Attackers using lists of compromised usernames and passwords from other breaches to gain access to TDengine.
    *   Unauthorized access to TDengine due to weak or default passwords (High Severity) - Malicious actors or internal users exploiting easily guessable TDengine passwords.
*   **Impact:** High reduction in risk for brute-force and credential stuffing attacks targeting TDengine. Medium reduction in risk for unauthorized access to TDengine overall, as password strength is one factor among others.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, password complexity is enforced on the TDengine server and documented in our security guidelines for TDengine access.
*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Fully Implemented for TDengine user accounts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in TDengine](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__in_tdengine.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define clear roles within your application that interact with TDengine and map them to TDengine roles (e.g., `data_reader`, `data_writer`, `admin`).
    2.  Within TDengine, create corresponding user roles and assign specific permissions to each role. Permissions should be granular within TDengine, allowing access only to necessary databases, tables, or operations within TDengine.
    3.  Assign TDengine users to the appropriate roles based on their job function and application needs, following the principle of least privilege within the TDengine context.
    4.  Regularly review and audit TDengine user roles and permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and that no user has excessive privileges within TDengine.
    5.  Document the TDengine RBAC model and user assignments for clarity and maintainability.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized data access within TDengine (High Severity) - Users accessing TDengine data they are not authorized to view or modify.
    *   Privilege escalation within TDengine (Medium Severity) - Lower-privileged TDengine users gaining higher-level access due to misconfigured permissions.
    *   Data breaches originating from TDengine due to compromised accounts (Medium Severity) - Limiting the impact of a compromised TDengine account by restricting its permissions within TDengine.
*   **Impact:** High reduction in risk for unauthorized data access within TDengine. Medium reduction in risk for privilege escalation and data breaches originating from TDengine by limiting the scope of potential damage within TDengine.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic TDengine roles (`data_reader`, `data_writer`) are defined, but granular permissions within TDengine databases and tables need further refinement.
