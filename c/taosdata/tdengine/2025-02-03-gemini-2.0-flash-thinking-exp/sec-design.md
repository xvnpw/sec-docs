# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, TDengine, aims to provide a high-performance, scalable, and cost-effective time-series database solution, primarily targeting Internet of Things (IoT), Industrial Internet, and energy sectors. The core business priority is to offer a database system that can efficiently handle massive volumes of time-series data generated by devices and sensors, enabling real-time analytics and insights.

Key business goals include:
- High ingestion and query performance for time-series data.
- Scalability to handle growing data volumes and user concurrency.
- Cost-effectiveness in terms of infrastructure and operational expenses.
- Ease of use and integration with existing systems.
- Reliability and data durability.
- Strong community support and adoption.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Data loss or corruption due to system failures or security breaches.
- Performance degradation under heavy load or complex queries.
- Security vulnerabilities leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.
- Lack of adoption and market competition from other TSDB solutions.
- Vendor lock-in and dependency on specific infrastructure.
- Compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) if handling personal data.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for managing user permissions (described in TDengine documentation).
- security control: Authentication mechanisms for user login (described in TDengine documentation).
- security control: Network encryption using TLS/SSL for communication between client and server (configurable option in TDengine).
- security control: Data encryption at rest (feature availability should be verified in documentation).
- security control: Regular security patching and updates (implied as standard software practice).

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on user configuration for enabling security features like TLS/SSL and data encryption. Misconfiguration can lead to vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by TDengine.
- accepted risk: Risk of insider threats with access to database systems.
- accepted risk: Denial-of-service attacks targeting database availability.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security vulnerability scanning in the software development lifecycle (SAST/DAST).
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address security weaknesses.
- security control: Implement security information and event management (SIEM) for monitoring and alerting on security events.
- security control: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access.
- security control: Implement data masking or anonymization techniques for sensitive data in non-production environments.
- security control: Establish incident response plan for security breaches.
- security control: Regularly review and update security configurations and access controls.

- Authentication:
  - Requirement: Secure authentication mechanism to verify user identity before granting access.
  - Requirement: Support for strong password policies and password rotation.
  - Requirement: Option for integration with external authentication providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth).

- Authorization:
  - Requirement: Granular role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for different users and roles.
  - Requirement: Principle of least privilege should be enforced, granting users only necessary permissions.
  - Requirement: Audit logging of authorization decisions and access attempts.

- Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Robust input validation on all data inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
  - Requirement: Input sanitization and encoding to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if web interfaces are involved.
  - Requirement: Data type validation and range checks to ensure data integrity.

- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms and protocols for data in transit (TLS/SSL).
  - Requirement: Option for data encryption at rest to protect data confidentiality.
  - Requirement: Secure key management practices for encryption keys.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Time-series data ingestion and storage: Ensuring continuous and reliable data collection from IoT devices and other sources.
- Query processing and data retrieval: Providing timely and accurate access to time-series data for monitoring, analytics, and visualization.
- System availability and reliability: Maintaining continuous operation of the TDengine database to support critical business applications.
- Data integrity and consistency: Ensuring data accuracy and preventing data corruption or loss.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Time-series data: Sensitivity depends on the application domain. In IoT and industrial contexts, this data can include:
    - Sensor readings (temperature, pressure, humidity, etc.): Generally low to medium sensitivity, but aggregated data can reveal business insights.
    - Machine telemetry data (performance metrics, error logs): Medium sensitivity, can impact operational efficiency and security if compromised.
    - Energy consumption data: Medium sensitivity, can impact cost management and resource optimization.
    - Industrial control system data: High sensitivity, potential safety and operational risks if compromised.
    - Personal data (in some IoT applications): High sensitivity, subject to data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).
- Metadata: Medium sensitivity, includes database schema, user accounts, and configuration. Compromise can lead to unauthorized access and data manipulation.
- Audit logs: Medium sensitivity, crucial for security monitoring and incident investigation.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the specific data sensitivity levels for the intended use cases of TDengine?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that TDengine needs to adhere to?
- What are the performance and scalability requirements for the project?
- What are the specific deployment environments being considered (cloud, on-premises, hybrid)?
- Is data encryption at rest currently implemented in TDengine? If so, what are the details of the implementation?
- What are the existing security testing practices for TDengine (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning)?
- What is the incident response plan for security breaches?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a high-performance and scalable time-series database for IoT and industrial applications. Security is a critical concern but balanced with performance and usability.
- SECURITY POSTURE: TDengine includes basic security features like RBAC and authentication. Further security controls are recommended to enhance the security posture. Secure software development lifecycle and secure deployment practices are important.
- DESIGN: TDengine follows a distributed architecture with core engine, meta server, management nodes, and data nodes. REST API and client drivers are used for external access. Cloud-based deployment on Kubernetes is a relevant deployment scenario. GitHub Actions is used for CI/CD and build automation.
