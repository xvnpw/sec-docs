# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for taosdata/tdengine

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Authentication for TDengine Users](./mitigation_strategies/strong_authentication_for_tdengine_users.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strong Authentication for TDengine Users
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Password Complexity:** Configure TDengine server settings within the `taos.cfg` file to require passwords to meet complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, mix of character types). Adjust parameters like `min_password_length` and `password_regex`.
    2.  **Regular Password Rotation:** Establish a policy for regular password changes for all TDengine user accounts. Utilize TDengine's `ALTER USER` command to enforce password changes or integrate with external password management systems if applicable.
    3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Create dedicated TDengine user accounts using `CREATE USER` for the application with only the necessary permissions granted via `GRANT` statements. Avoid using the default `root` or `taosd` administrative accounts for application access.
    4.  **Disable Default Accounts (if applicable):** If default accounts with known credentials exist and are not necessary, disable or remove them. Review TDengine documentation for default account information and use `DROP USER` if appropriate.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):**  Reduces the likelihood of attackers guessing passwords through repeated attempts against TDengine user accounts.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (High Severity):** Makes stolen credentials from other breaches less effective against TDengine user accounts.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from directly accessing and manipulating TDengine data through compromised or weak TDengine credentials.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** High Reduction
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** High Reduction
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Password complexity requirements are partially implemented. The `taos.cfg` file has been modified to enforce minimum password length, but character type requirements are not fully enforced.
    *   Regular password rotation policy is documented but not strictly enforced through automated TDengine mechanisms.
    *   Principle of least privilege is partially implemented. Dedicated application users exist, but some services might still use overly permissive TDengine accounts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Fully enforce password complexity requirements in `taos.cfg` by configuring appropriate `password_regex`.
    *   Explore using TDengine's `ALTER USER` command for password rotation enforcement or integrate with external identity management solutions for centralized TDengine user management.
    *   Conduct a thorough review of all services and applications accessing TDengine to ensure they are using least privilege TDengine accounts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in TDengine](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac__in_tdengine.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Leverage TDengine's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles:** Identify different user roles based on application functionalities and access needs. Use `CREATE ROLE` in TDengine to define these roles (e.g., `data_reader`, `data_writer`, `admin_user`).
    2.  **Grant Permissions to Roles:** Assign specific permissions to each role using `GRANT` statements. Permissions should be granular, allowing access only to necessary databases, tables, or actions within TDengine (e.g., `GRANT SELECT ON database.table TO data_reader`).
    3.  **Assign Roles to Users:** Assign appropriate roles to TDengine users using `GRANT ROLE` statements. Users inherit the permissions associated with their assigned roles.
    4.  **Regularly Review Roles and Permissions:** Periodically review defined roles and their associated permissions to ensure they remain aligned with application needs and security best practices. Use `SHOW GRANTS FOR ROLE role_name` and `SHOW GRANTS FOR USER user_name` to audit permissions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Limits access to TDengine data and operations based on user roles, preventing unauthorized actions.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of users gaining excessive privileges by enforcing least privilege through roles.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Minimizes the potential damage from compromised accounts by restricting their access to only necessary data and operations within TDengine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High Reduction
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches:** Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic roles (`data_reader`, `data_writer`) are defined in TDengine.
    *   Permissions are granted to these roles for specific databases and tables.
    *   Users are assigned roles upon creation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Granularity of roles can be improved. More specific roles should be defined to further restrict access based on application modules.
    *   A formal process for reviewing and updating roles and permissions is missing. Implement a scheduled review process.
    *   Documentation of roles and permissions is incomplete. Create comprehensive documentation for all defined roles and their associated permissions in TDengine.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TLS/SSL Encryption for TDengine Client-Server Communication](./mitigation_strategies/tlsssl_encryption_for_tdengine_client-server_communication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable TLS/SSL Encryption for Client-Server Communication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure TDengine Server for TLS:** Enable TLS/SSL encryption on the TDengine server by configuring the `ssl` parameter to `1` and specifying the paths to the SSL certificate (`sslCert`) and private key (`sslKey`) files in the `taos.cfg` file. Generate or obtain valid SSL/TLS certificates for the TDengine server.
    2.  **Enable TLS in Client Connections:** Configure the TDengine client applications and connectors to use TLS/SSL when connecting to the TDengine server. This usually involves specifying connection parameters or options in the client connection string or configuration (e.g., using `ssl=true` in JDBC connection string or Python connector).
    3.  **Verify Server Certificate (Recommended):** Configure clients to verify the TDengine server's certificate to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. This ensures that the client is connecting to the legitimate TDengine server and not a rogue server.  This is typically configured in the client connection parameters.
    4.  **Enforce TLS Only Connections (Optional but Recommended):**  If security is paramount, configure TDengine to only accept TLS/SSL encrypted connections and reject unencrypted connections by setting `force_ssl_mode` in `taos.cfg`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and reading sensitive data transmitted between the application and the TDengine server over the network.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and manipulating communication between the application and the TDengine server by ensuring secure and authenticated communication channels.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping:** High Reduction - Encrypts data in transit, making it unreadable to eavesdroppers.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Medium to High Reduction -  With certificate verification, significantly reduces the risk of MITM attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   TLS/SSL encryption is enabled on the TDengine server using self-signed certificates for internal communication within the development environment. `ssl=1`, `sslCert`, and `sslKey` are configured in `taos.cfg`.
    *   Client applications are configured to connect using TLS (`ssl=true` in connection strings), but certificate verification is currently disabled for ease of development.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Obtain and install valid, trusted SSL/TLS certificates from a Certificate Authority (CA) for production environments and configure `sslCert` and `sslKey` accordingly.
    *   Enable and enforce server certificate verification in all client applications and connectors connecting to TDengine, especially in production. Configure client-side certificate verification parameters.
    *   Consider enforcing TLS-only connections on the TDengine server in production by setting `force_ssl_mode` to `1` in `taos.cfg` to further enhance security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure TDengine Resource Limits](./mitigation_strategies/configure_tdengine_resource_limits.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure TDengine Resource Limits
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Resource Limits:** Review TDengine configuration parameters in `taos.cfg` related to resource limits, such as `max_connections`, `max_mem_size`, `query_timeout`, `max_queries_per_second`, and `max_cpu_cores`.
    2.  **Set Appropriate Limits:**  Set appropriate values for these parameters based on your server resources, application workload, and performance requirements. Start with conservative limits and adjust based on monitoring and performance testing.
    3.  **Monitor Resource Usage:** Regularly monitor TDengine server resource consumption (CPU, memory, connections, query performance) using TDengine monitoring tools or system monitoring utilities.
    4.  **Adjust Limits as Needed:**  Adjust resource limits in `taos.cfg` as needed based on monitoring data and changes in application usage patterns. Restart the TDengine server after modifying `taos.cfg` for changes to take effect.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming TDengine with excessive requests or resource-intensive queries, causing service disruption or performance degradation by limiting resource consumption.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Protects TDengine resources (CPU, memory, connections) from being exhausted by legitimate but excessive usage or poorly optimized application behavior by enforcing limits.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Medium to High Reduction - Significantly reduces the impact of resource exhaustion based DoS attacks.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** High Reduction - Helps prevent resource exhaustion due to excessive usage by enforcing predefined limits within TDengine.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic resource limits are configured in `taos.cfg`, including `max_connections` and `max_mem_size` with default or slightly adjusted values.
    *   Monitoring of TDengine resource usage is performed periodically but not continuously.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Fine-tune resource limits in `taos.cfg` based on thorough performance testing and capacity planning for the application workload.
    *   Implement continuous monitoring of TDengine resource usage and set up alerts for exceeding predefined thresholds.
    *   Establish a process for regularly reviewing and adjusting resource limits based on monitoring data and application growth.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular TDengine Updates and Patching](./mitigation_strategies/regular_tdengine_updates_and_patching.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update TDengine to the Latest Stable Version
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Update Schedule:** Define a regular schedule for checking for and applying TDengine updates (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
    2.  **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to TDengine's official channels (mailing lists, website, GitHub releases) for security advisories and release notes.
    3.  **Test Updates in Staging:** Before applying updates to production, thoroughly test them in a staging TDengine environment that mirrors the production setup. Verify functionality and performance after the update.
    4.  **Apply Updates to Production:** Once testing is successful, apply the updates to the production TDengine environment during a planned maintenance window. Follow TDengine's official update procedures.
    5.  **Verify Update Success:** After applying updates, verify that the update was successful and that TDengine is functioning correctly. Monitor TDengine logs for any errors or issues post-update.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Critical to High Severity):**  Patches known security vulnerabilities in TDengine software, preventing attackers from exploiting these vulnerabilities to compromise the TDengine system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High Reduction - Directly addresses and eliminates known vulnerabilities within TDengine software.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   TDengine updates are applied reactively when a critical vulnerability is publicly disclosed. There is no proactive schedule for regular updates.
    *   Updates are tested in a staging TDengine environment before production deployment.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a proactive and regular schedule for checking and applying TDengine updates, even if no critical vulnerabilities are immediately apparent.
    *   Implement automated update notification and tracking to ensure timely patching of TDengine software.
    *   Document the TDengine update process and assign responsibility for regular TDengine patching.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Monitor TDengine Audit Logs](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_monitor_tdengine_audit_logs.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable and Monitor TDengine Audit Logs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Audit Logging:** Configure TDengine to enable audit logging by setting `enable_auditlog` to `1` in `taos.cfg`. Specify the audit log file path using `auditlogdir` parameter.
    2.  **Configure Audit Log Level (Optional):** Adjust the audit log level (if configurable in TDengine, check documentation) to capture relevant security events without excessive logging.
    3.  **Centralize Log Collection:** Configure TDengine to send audit logs to a centralized logging system (SIEM) for long-term storage, analysis, and correlation with other system logs. Use tools like Fluentd, Logstash, or rsyslog to forward logs.
    4.  **Monitor Audit Logs:** Regularly monitor and analyze TDengine audit logs for suspicious activities, security incidents, or policy violations. Set up alerts for critical security events detected in the logs (e.g., failed login attempts, unauthorized access attempts, schema changes).
    5.  **Secure Audit Logs:** Ensure the security and integrity of audit logs. Restrict access to audit log files and the centralized logging system to authorized personnel only. Implement log rotation and retention policies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access Detection (Medium to High Severity):** Enables detection of unauthorized access attempts or successful breaches by logging login attempts, query execution, and data modifications within TDengine.
    *   **Security Incident Response (Medium Severity):** Provides valuable audit trail for investigating security incidents, identifying the scope of compromise, and understanding attacker actions within TDengine.
    *   **Compliance and Auditing (Medium Severity):** Supports compliance requirements by providing auditable logs of database activities for regulatory or internal audits.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access Detection:** Medium to High Reduction - Significantly improves detection capabilities for unauthorized activities within TDengine.
    *   **Security Incident Response:** Medium Reduction - Provides crucial information for effective incident response and forensic analysis.
    *   **Compliance and Auditing:** High Reduction - Facilitates compliance with security and regulatory requirements related to data access logging.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   TDengine audit logging is enabled by setting `enable_auditlog = 1` in `taos.cfg`. Audit logs are written to the default location.
    *   Basic monitoring of audit logs is performed manually on the TDengine server.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Configure centralized collection of TDengine audit logs to a SIEM or dedicated logging system.
    *   Implement automated monitoring and alerting for security-relevant events in TDengine audit logs.
    *   Define and implement log retention and rotation policies for TDengine audit logs.
    *   Secure access to TDengine audit logs and the centralized logging system to prevent tampering or unauthorized access to audit data.
