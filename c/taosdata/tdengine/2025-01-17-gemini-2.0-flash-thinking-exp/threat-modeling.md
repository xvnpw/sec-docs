# Threat Model Analysis for taosdata/tdengine

## Threat: [Weak Default Credentials](./threats/weak_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in to TDengine using default credentials (e.g., `root`/`taosdata`). If successful, they gain full administrative access to the TDengine instance.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the TDengine instance, including access to all data, ability to modify or delete data, and potentially disrupt service.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Immediately change the default passwords for all TDengine administrative accounts upon installation.
* Enforce strong password policies for TDengine users.

## Threat: [Insufficient Privilege Separation](./threats/insufficient_privilege_separation.md)

**Description:** An attacker who has compromised a TDengine user account with overly broad permissions could access or modify data beyond their intended scope, potentially leading to data breaches or integrity issues within TDengine.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data within TDengine, data modification or deletion, potential for privilege escalation within the TDengine instance.

**Affected Component:** Authorization Module, User Management

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement granular role-based access control (RBAC) in TDengine.
* Assign users only the necessary privileges required for their tasks within TDengine.
* Regularly review and audit TDengine user permissions.

## Threat: [TDengine-Specific SQL Injection](./threats/tdengine-specific_sql_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious TDengine SQL code through application inputs that are not properly sanitized. This could allow them to execute arbitrary SQL commands within TDengine, potentially leading to data extraction, modification, or denial of service.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access within TDengine, data manipulation, potential for remote code execution on the TDengine server (depending on the severity of the vulnerability).

**Affected Component:** Query Processing Engine

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all interactions with TDengine.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the application side before passing data to TDengine queries.
* Follow secure coding practices to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities specific to TDengine's SQL dialect.

## Threat: [Lack of Encryption at Rest](./threats/lack_of_encryption_at_rest.md)

**Description:** If the underlying storage where TDengine data is stored is compromised, an attacker could gain access to sensitive time-series data if TDengine's storage is not encrypted.

**Impact:** Exposure of confidential time-series data managed by TDengine, potentially leading to privacy breaches or regulatory non-compliance.

**Affected Component:** Storage Engine

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize TDengine's built-in encryption at rest features if available (refer to TDengine documentation for current capabilities).
* Implement full-disk encryption on the storage volumes where TDengine data resides.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Malicious Queries](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_malicious_queries.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft specific TDengine queries that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, I/O) within the TDengine instance, causing performance degradation or service unavailability for legitimate users.

**Impact:** Disruption of application functionality relying on TDengine, potential downtime, and impact on business operations.

**Affected Component:** Query Processing Engine, Resource Management

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement query timeouts and resource limits within TDengine.
* Monitor TDengine resource usage and identify potentially malicious queries.

## Threat: [Exploiting TDengine Clustering Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_tdengine_clustering_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the application uses TDengine clustering, vulnerabilities in the cluster communication protocols or consensus mechanisms within TDengine could be exploited by an attacker to disrupt the cluster, potentially leading to data loss or service unavailability.

**Impact:** Loss of data availability within the TDengine cluster, potential data corruption, and complete failure of the time-series database service.

**Affected Component:** Cluster Management, Data Replication

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep TDengine cluster components updated with the latest security patches.
* Secure the network communication between TDengine cluster nodes.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for TDengine cluster management operations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in TDengine Authentication Mechanisms](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_tdengine_authentication_mechanisms.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in TDengine's authentication protocols to bypass authentication or impersonate legitimate TDengine users. This requires staying updated with TDengine security advisories.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to TDengine, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay informed about TDengine security advisories and promptly apply security patches.
* Consider using strong authentication methods if supported by TDengine.

## Threat: [Improper Backup and Recovery Procedures](./threats/improper_backup_and_recovery_procedures.md)

**Description:** If backup and recovery processes for TDengine are not secure, backups could be compromised, or the recovery process could be manipulated by an attacker, leading to data loss or the restoration of compromised TDengine data.

**Impact:** Loss of critical time-series data managed by TDengine, inability to recover from failures or attacks, potential restoration of compromised data.

**Affected Component:** Backup and Recovery Tools

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Securely store TDengine backups in an isolated and encrypted location.
* Implement access controls for TDengine backup and recovery operations.
* Regularly test the TDengine backup and recovery process to ensure its effectiveness.
