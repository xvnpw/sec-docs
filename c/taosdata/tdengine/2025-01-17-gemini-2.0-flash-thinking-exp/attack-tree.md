## Attack Tree Path: [Access Data Without Proper Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/access_data_without_proper_permissions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages weaknesses in TDengine's authorization mechanisms or the application's implementation of access controls to directly access data they are not supposed to. This could involve exploiting missing or misconfigured role-based access control (RBAC), bypassing permission checks, or exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application queries data.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**  Combines a moderate likelihood (if authorization is not rigorously implemented) with a high impact (direct data breach or manipulation).

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection (TDengine Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__tdengine_specific_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into queries that the application sends to TDengine. This is possible when the application constructs SQL queries dynamically based on user input without proper sanitization or the use of parameterized queries.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**  SQL injection is a well-known and frequently exploited vulnerability. It has a high impact, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data, and in some cases, even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Queries](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_malformed_queries.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends specially crafted, malformed, or excessively resource-intensive queries to TDengine. These queries can overwhelm the database server, consuming excessive CPU, memory, or I/O resources, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**  While the effort might be relatively low, the impact of making the application unavailable is significant. The likelihood is moderate if input validation and query limits are not in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Unencrypted Communication (if configured)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_unencrypted_communication__if_configured_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the communication between the application and TDengine is not encrypted using TLS/SSL, an attacker can eavesdrop on the network traffic and intercept sensitive data being transmitted, such as credentials or application data.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**  The impact is a direct data breach. The likelihood is high if encryption is not enforced, and the effort for an attacker is low (basic network sniffing tools).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in TDengine Version](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_tdengine_version.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies the specific version of TDengine being used by the application and then exploits publicly known vulnerabilities associated with that version. Exploit code for these vulnerabilities may be readily available.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**  The impact can be severe, depending on the vulnerability. The likelihood is moderate if the application doesn't have a robust patching and update process. The effort can be low if exploits are readily available.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials (if any)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__if_any_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker attempts to log in to TDengine using default, unchanged credentials (usernames and passwords).
    *   **Why Critical:** Provides a very easy entry point with potentially full access to the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a specific flaw in TDengine's authentication mechanism to bypass the login process without needing valid credentials.
    *   **Why Critical:**  Completely circumvents security controls, granting unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Elevate Privileges](./attack_tree_paths/elevate_privileges.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with limited access to TDengine exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain higher-level privileges, allowing them to perform actions they are not authorized for.
    *   **Why Critical:**  Allows attackers to access more sensitive data and functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL to Read Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_to_read_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  A specific outcome of SQL injection where the attacker crafts malicious SQL to retrieve data they should not have access to.
    *   **Why Critical:** Direct data breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL to Modify Data](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_to_modify_data.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** A specific outcome of SQL injection where the attacker crafts malicious SQL to alter or corrupt data within TDengine.
    *   **Why Critical:**  Compromises data integrity and can lead to application malfunction.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL to Execute Arbitrary Commands (if supported by TDengine or via UDFs)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_to_execute_arbitrary_commands__if_supported_by_tdengine_or_via_udfs_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** A severe outcome of SQL injection where the attacker can execute operating system commands on the TDengine server (if the database supports it directly or through vulnerable User Defined Functions).
    *   **Why Critical:**  Leads to complete server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration via TDengine Features](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration_via_tdengine_features.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker abuses legitimate TDengine features (like export functionalities) to extract sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Why Critical:**  Direct data breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Backup/Restore Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/backuprestore_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises backup files or the restore process to gain access to sensitive data or manipulate the database state. This could involve accessing unprotected backup files or exploiting vulnerabilities in the restore mechanism.
    *   **Why Critical:** Backups often contain complete copies of sensitive data, and manipulating the restore process can have significant consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposure of Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/exposure_of_configuration_files.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains access to TDengine configuration files, which may contain sensitive information like database credentials, connection strings, or other security-related settings.
    *   **Why Critical:**  Exposed credentials can lead to further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via UDFs](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_udfs.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses User Defined Functions (UDFs) in TDengine, an attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in these custom functions to inject and execute malicious code on the TDengine server.
    *   **Why Critical:**  Leads to complete server compromise.
