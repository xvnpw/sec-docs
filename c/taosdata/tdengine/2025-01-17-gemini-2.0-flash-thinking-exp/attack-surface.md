# Attack Surface Analysis for taosdata/tdengine

## Attack Surface: [Direct Exposure of TDengine Client Port](./attack_surfaces/direct_exposure_of_tdengine_client_port.md)

* **Description:** The TDengine client port (default 6030) is directly accessible from untrusted networks.
* **How TDengine Contributes:** TDengine listens on this port for client connections using its proprietary protocol. If exposed, it becomes a target for direct connection attempts.
* **Example:** An attacker scans open ports and finds the TDengine port exposed. They attempt to connect and exploit potential vulnerabilities in the client protocol handling.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the TDengine instance, potential data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Network Segmentation: Isolate the TDengine server within a private network and restrict access using firewalls. Only allow connections from trusted application servers.
    * VPN/SSH Tunneling:  Require clients to connect through a VPN or SSH tunnel to reach the TDengine server.
    * Disable Direct External Access: If external access is absolutely necessary, implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms at the network level.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured TDengine HTTP REST API](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_tdengine_http_rest_api.md)

* **Description:** The TDengine HTTP REST API is enabled without proper authentication or authorization.
* **How TDengine Contributes:** TDengine provides an HTTP REST API for management and data access. If not secured, it allows anyone to interact with the database.
* **Example:** An attacker discovers the REST API endpoint and can execute commands to create databases, users, or query sensitive data without providing credentials.
* **Impact:** Full control over the TDengine instance, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
* **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Enable Authentication: Configure authentication for the TDengine REST API. Use strong passwords and manage user permissions effectively.
    * HTTPS/TLS: Enforce HTTPS for all communication with the REST API to encrypt data in transit and prevent eavesdropping.
    * Restrict Access: Use network firewalls or access control lists to limit access to the REST API to authorized clients only.
    * Disable if Unused: If the REST API is not required, disable it entirely in the TDengine configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Weak TDengine User Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_tdengine_user_credentials.md)

* **Description:** TDengine user accounts are configured with default or easily guessable passwords.
* **How TDengine Contributes:** TDengine relies on user credentials for authentication. Weak credentials make it easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access.
* **Example:** An attacker uses common password lists or brute-force techniques to guess the credentials for a TDengine user account.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the TDengine instance, potential data breaches, data manipulation.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Strong Password Policy: Enforce a strong password policy requiring complex and unique passwords.
    * Regular Password Rotation: Encourage or enforce regular password changes for TDengine user accounts.
    * Avoid Default Credentials: Never use default usernames and passwords. Change them immediately upon installation.
    * Account Lockout: Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Attack Surface: [TDengine SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/tdengine_sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** User-provided input is not properly sanitized before being used in TDengine SQL queries.
* **How TDengine Contributes:** TDengine uses a SQL-like language for querying data. Improper handling of input can lead to injection attacks.
* **Example:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when incorporated into a TDengine query, allows them to bypass security checks, retrieve unauthorized data, or even modify data.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, potential for command execution depending on the application's interaction with TDengine.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements whenever possible to separate SQL code from user-provided data.
    * Input Validation and Sanitization:  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in TDengine queries.
    * Principle of Least Privilege: Grant TDengine users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks, limiting the impact of a successful injection attack.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in TDengine Client Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_tdengine_client_libraries.md)

* **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist in the TDengine client libraries used by the application.
* **How TDengine Contributes:** Applications interact with TDengine through client libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited.
* **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in a TDengine client library could be exploited by sending specially crafted data, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the application server.
* **Impact:** Compromise of the application server, potential data breaches, denial of service.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Keep Client Libraries Updated: Regularly update TDengine client libraries to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    * Monitor Security Advisories: Stay informed about security advisories related to TDengine and its client libraries.
    * Secure Development Practices: Follow secure coding practices when using the client libraries to avoid introducing new vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TDengine Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tdengine_configuration.md)

* **Description:** TDengine is configured with insecure settings.
* **How TDengine Contributes:** TDengine's configuration options can impact its security posture. Insecure settings can create vulnerabilities.
* **Example:** Leaving default administrative passwords unchanged, disabling important security features, or misconfiguring access controls.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Follow Security Hardening Guides: Consult the official TDengine documentation and security hardening guides for recommended configurations.
    * Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of the TDengine configuration to identify and remediate potential weaknesses.
    * Principle of Least Privilege (Configuration): Only enable necessary features and services. Disable any unnecessary or insecure options.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in TDengine User-Defined Functions (UDFs)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_tdengine_user-defined_functions__udfs_.md)

* **Description:** If the application utilizes custom UDFs within TDengine, vulnerabilities in these functions can be exploited.
* **How TDengine Contributes:** TDengine allows the creation of UDFs, which extend its functionality. Poorly written UDFs can introduce security risks.
* **Example:** A UDF might have a buffer overflow vulnerability or might execute arbitrary commands on the server.
* **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the TDengine server, data breaches, denial of service.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure UDF Development: Follow secure coding practices when developing UDFs.
    * Code Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews of all UDFs before deployment.
    * Sandboxing/Isolation: If possible, explore options for sandboxing or isolating UDF execution to limit the impact of vulnerabilities.
    * Principle of Least Privilege (UDFs): Grant UDFs only the necessary permissions.
