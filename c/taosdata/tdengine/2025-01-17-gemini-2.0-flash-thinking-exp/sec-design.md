## 4. Data Flow

This section details the typical pathways and processes involved in data movement within the TDengine system.

### 4.1. Data Ingestion Flow

1. A client application initiates a data ingestion request, sending time-series data to the TDengine server via one of the available client interfaces.
2. The **Client Connection Handler** receives the incoming request and establishes a connection with the client.
3. The **Authentication & Authorization** component verifies the client's identity and permissions to ingest data into the target database and table.
4. The **Request Router** directs the data ingestion request to the **Data Ingestion Processor**.
5. The **Data Ingestion Processor** validates the incoming data against the table schema and performs any necessary transformations.
6. The data is written to the **WAL (Write-Ahead Log)** by the **Storage Manager** to ensure durability.
7. The **Storage Manager** then writes the data to the appropriate **Data Files** managed by the **Data Block Manager**.
8. The **Metadata Manager** is updated with any relevant metadata changes resulting from the data ingestion.
9. The client receives an acknowledgment indicating the success or failure of the data ingestion operation.

### 4.2. Query Processing Flow

1. A client application submits a SQL query to the TDengine server through one of the client interfaces.
2. The **Client Connection Handler** receives the query and establishes a connection with the client.
3. The **Authentication & Authorization** component verifies the client's identity and permissions to execute the requested query.
4. The **Request Router** forwards the SQL query to the **SQL Parser & Analyzer**.
5. The **SQL Parser & Analyzer** parses the query to validate its syntax and semantics.
6. The **Query Optimizer** generates an efficient execution plan for the query.
7. The **Query Execution Engine** executes the optimized plan, potentially retrieving data from the **Cache Manager** first.
8. If the data is not in the cache, the **Query Execution Engine** retrieves the necessary data from the **Data Files** via the **Storage Manager** and **Data Block Manager**.
9. The retrieved data is processed and formatted according to the query requirements.
10. The results are returned to the client through the **Client Connection Handler**.

## 5. Security Considerations (For Threat Modeling)
