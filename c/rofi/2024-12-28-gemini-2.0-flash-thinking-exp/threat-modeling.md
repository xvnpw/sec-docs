### High and Critical Rofi Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the `rofi` application:

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via Unsanitized Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when used to construct a `rofi` command (e.g., within the `-e` or `-p` options, or when using custom scripts executed by `rofi`), is interpreted by the underlying shell as additional commands. The attacker might inject commands to execute arbitrary code, modify files, or exfiltrate data. This could happen if the application directly incorporates user-provided text into a shell command used with `rofi` without proper sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service, privilege escalation depending on the user context running the application and `rofi`.
    *   **Affected Rofi Component:** Command-line arguments passed to `rofi` (specifically options like `-e`, `-p`, or within custom scripts executed by `rofi`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into `rofi` commands. Use appropriate escaping mechanisms provided by the programming language or shell.
        *   **Avoid Direct Shell Execution:** If possible, avoid constructing shell commands directly. Explore alternative ways to achieve the desired functionality without relying on shell interpretation of user input.
        *   **Parameterization:** If constructing commands is necessary, use parameterized commands or functions that prevent direct shell interpretation of user input.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application and `rofi` with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful attack.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal/Arbitrary File Access via File Browser
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the file path input when using `rofi`'s file browser (`-show filebrowser`) to navigate to and potentially interact with files or directories outside the intended scope. The attacker might access sensitive configuration files, application data, or even system files.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, modification of critical files, potential for privilege escalation if executable files are accessed and run.
    *   **Affected Rofi Component:** `-show filebrowser` functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Starting Directory:** When using `-show filebrowser`, explicitly set the starting directory to a safe and restricted location.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement checks on the selected file paths to ensure they fall within the expected boundaries.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:** If the application doesn't require the full file browsing capabilities, consider alternative methods or restrict the available actions within the file browser.

*   **Threat:** Configuration Tampering Leading to Malicious Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the `rofi` configuration file used by the application (e.g., `config.rasi`). They modify the configuration to execute malicious commands when `rofi` is invoked by the application. This could involve binding key combinations to harmful scripts or altering the behavior of specific modes.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the application.
    *   **Affected Rofi Component:** `rofi` configuration file (`config.rasi`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure File Permissions:** Ensure the `rofi` configuration file is only writable by the user running the application and not by other potentially malicious users or processes.
        *   **Configuration Management:**  If the application needs to customize `rofi` behavior, manage the configuration programmatically instead of relying on a user-writable file.
        *   **Regular Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the `rofi` configuration file.

*   **Threat:** Execution of Malicious Custom Rofi Scripts
    *   **Description:** If the application uses custom `rofi` scripts (e.g., with `-script`), and these scripts are sourced from untrusted locations or are not properly vetted, they could contain malicious code that is executed when `rofi` is invoked.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the application.
    *   **Affected Rofi Component:** `-script` option and the execution of external scripts by `rofi`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Trusted Script Sources:** Only use custom `rofi` scripts from trusted and verified sources.
        *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the code of any custom scripts before using them in the application.
        *   **Sandboxing (Limited):** Explore if there are any mechanisms to limit the capabilities of scripts executed by `rofi` (though this might be limited by `rofi`'s design).
