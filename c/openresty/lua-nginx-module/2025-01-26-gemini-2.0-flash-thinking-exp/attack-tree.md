## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Lua-Nginx-Module [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_lua-nginx-module__critical_node_.md)

This is the root goal. Success means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access, control, or disruption of the application due to vulnerabilities related to Lua-Nginx-Module.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lua Code Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lua_code_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_.md)

This category encompasses vulnerabilities arising from the Lua code written for the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lua Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/lua_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious Lua code through user-controlled input that is then executed by the application (e.g., using `ngx.eval`, `loadstring`, or string concatenation).
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors in Lua Code [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_in_lua_code__high-risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in the application's business logic implemented in Lua (e.g., authentication bypass, authorization flaws, insecure data handling).
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, application manipulation, unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Lua Libraries [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_lua_libraries__high-risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party Lua libraries used by the application.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, data breach, depending on the library vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Lua [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_lua__high-risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Crafting malicious requests that trigger resource-intensive Lua operations (e.g., infinite loops, excessive memory allocation) leading to server overload.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Nginx Configuration Issues (Lua Related) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nginx_configuration_issues__lua_related___high-risk_.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations in Nginx that are specific to its interaction with Lua-Nginx-Module.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure `lua_package_path`/`lua_package_cpath` [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure__lua_package_path__lua_package_cpath___high-risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If `lua_package_path` or `lua_package_cpath` points to writable directories, attackers can upload malicious Lua modules and force the application to load and execute them.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposing Internal APIs via Lua [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exposing_internal_apis_via_lua__high-risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Unintentionally exposing Nginx internal APIs (e.g., `ngx.config`, `ngx.shared.DICT`) through Lua scripts, allowing attackers to access sensitive information or manipulate Nginx internals.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (Nginx configuration, shared data), configuration manipulation, potentially leading to further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured `content_by_lua*`, `access_by_lua*`, etc. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured__content_by_lua____access_by_lua___etc___critical_node___high-risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Incorrect or overly permissive usage of Nginx directives like `content_by_lua*`, `access_by_lua*`, etc., such as directly executing untrusted Lua code or bypassing intended security controls.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, access control bypass, potentially full application control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Execution [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/code_execution__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical node representing the achievement of arbitrary code execution on the server. It is the highest impact outcome for many attack paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Lua Code on Server [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_lua_code_on_server__critical_node_.md)

This is the specific action that leads to Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Goal Achieved: Code Execution [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/goal_achieved_code_execution__critical_node_.md)

This marks the successful achievement of the Code Execution goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Unavailability [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/application_unavailability__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical node representing the state of the application being unavailable due to a successful Denial of Service attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Goal Achieved: DoS [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/goal_achieved_dos__critical_node_.md)

This marks the successful achievement of the Denial of Service goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Control [CRITICAL NODE] (under Misconfigured `content_by_lua*`)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_control__critical_node___under_misconfigured__content_by_lua__.md)

This node represents the attacker gaining control over the application due to misconfigurations, which can manifest as Code Execution or Access Control Bypass.
