### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Application via Lua-Nginx-Module

This section details potential attack vectors that fall under the "Compromise Application via Lua-Nginx-Module" attack path.

#### 4.1. Lua Code Injection Vulnerabilities

**Description:** If Lua code within the application processes user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation, attackers can inject malicious Lua code. When executed by Lua-Nginx-Module, this injected code can manipulate application logic, access sensitive data, or even execute system commands on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unsafe `eval()` or `loadstring()` usage:**  If Lua code uses functions like `eval()` or `loadstring()` directly on user input, it becomes highly vulnerable to Lua code injection.
    ```lua
    -- Vulnerable Lua code example
    local user_code = ngx.var.user_input
    local func = loadstring(user_code) -- Directly loading user input as code
    if func then
        func()
    end
    ```
*   **String concatenation without proper escaping:** Building Lua code strings dynamically using user input without proper escaping can lead to injection.
    ```lua
    -- Vulnerable Lua code example
    local filename = ngx.var.user_filename
    local lua_code = "dofile('/path/to/scripts/" .. filename .. ".lua')" -- Unsafe concatenation
    local func = loadstring(lua_code)
    if func then
        func()
        -- Attacker can inject "../" to escape directory and include arbitrary files
    end
    ```

**Impact:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary Lua code on the server, potentially leading to full server compromise.
*   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data stored in memory, files, or databases accessible by the Lua code.
*   **Application Logic Manipulation:**  Bypassing security checks, altering application behavior, and performing unauthorized actions.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Avoid `eval()` and `loadstring()` on user input:**  Never directly execute user-provided strings as Lua code.
*   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs before using them in Lua code. Use whitelisting and escaping techniques.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run Lua code with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running Nginx worker processes as root if possible.
*   **Code Review:**  Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential Lua injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While CSP primarily targets browser-side attacks, it can offer some indirect protection by limiting the sources from which scripts can be loaded, potentially hindering the exploitation of some injection scenarios.

#### 4.2. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Lua-Nginx-Module

**Description:** If Lua code makes external HTTP requests based on user-controlled input without proper validation, attackers can exploit this to perform SSRF attacks. They can force the server to make requests to internal resources, external websites, or cloud metadata services, potentially bypassing firewalls and gaining access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unvalidated URL parameters in `ngx.location.capture` or `ngx.location.redirect`:** If URLs used in these functions are constructed using user input without validation, SSRF is possible.
    ```lua
    -- Vulnerable Lua code example
    local target_url = ngx.var.user_url
    local res = ngx.location.capture(target_url) -- Unvalidated URL
    if res then
        ngx.say(res.body)
    end
    ```
*   **Unvalidated URLs in Lua HTTP libraries (e.g., `resty.http`):** Similar to `ngx.location.capture`, using user input directly in URLs for external HTTP requests using libraries like `resty.http` can lead to SSRF.
    ```lua
    -- Vulnerable Lua code example using resty.http
    local http = require "resty.http"
    local cli = http.new()
    local url = ngx.var.user_url
    local res, err = cli:request_uri(url) -- Unvalidated URL
    if res then
        ngx.say(res.body)
    end
    ```

**Impact:**

*   **Access to Internal Resources:** Attackers can access internal services, databases, or APIs that are not directly accessible from the internet.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Retrieving sensitive data from internal systems or cloud metadata services.
*   **Port Scanning and Service Discovery:**  Scanning internal networks to identify open ports and running services.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Overloading internal services or external websites by making a large number of requests.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **URL Whitelisting:**  Maintain a whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns for external requests. Only allow requests to URLs that match the whitelist.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize user-provided URLs to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious characters or schemes.
*   **URL Scheme Restriction:**  Restrict allowed URL schemes to `http` and `https` and disallow schemes like `file://`, `gopher://`, etc.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF attacks by restricting access from the Nginx server to internal resources.
*   **Disable or Restrict `ngx.location.capture` and `ngx.location.redirect`:** If these functions are not necessary, consider disabling or restricting their usage, especially with user-controlled input.
*   **Use a dedicated HTTP client library with SSRF protection:** Some HTTP client libraries might offer built-in SSRF protection mechanisms.

#### 4.3. Authentication and Authorization Bypass via Lua Logic Flaws

**Description:** If Lua code is responsible for handling authentication or authorization logic, flaws in the Lua code can lead to bypasses, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Logic errors in authentication checks:**  Incorrect implementation of authentication logic in Lua, such as flawed password verification, session management issues, or improper handling of authentication tokens.
    ```lua
    -- Vulnerable Lua code example (simplified)
    local username = ngx.var.http_username
    local password = ngx.var.http_password

    -- Insecure password check - always allows access if username is provided
    if username then
        ngx.say("Authentication successful")
        -- ... grant access ...
    else
        ngx.status = ngx.HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED
        ngx.say("Authentication failed")
    end
    ```
*   **Authorization bypass due to flawed role-based access control (RBAC) in Lua:**  Incorrect implementation of RBAC logic in Lua, allowing users to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized for.
    ```lua
    -- Vulnerable Lua code example (simplified RBAC)
    local user_role = get_user_role(ngx.var.cookie_session_id) -- Assume this function retrieves user role
    local requested_resource = ngx.var.uri

    -- Insecure authorization check - allows access if role is "admin" OR resource is "/public"
    if user_role == "admin" or requested_resource == "/public" then
        ngx.say("Authorization successful")
        -- ... grant access ...
    else
        ngx.status = ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN
        ngx.say("Authorization failed")
    end
    ```
*   **Session hijacking or fixation vulnerabilities in Lua session management:**  If Lua code manages sessions, vulnerabilities in session handling can lead to session hijacking or fixation attacks.

**Impact:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms to access protected resources and functionalities.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining access to higher privilege levels than intended.
*   **Data Breach and Manipulation:**  Accessing and modifying sensitive data due to unauthorized access.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Robust Authentication and Authorization Libraries:**  Utilize well-vetted and secure libraries for authentication and authorization in Lua, rather than implementing custom logic from scratch.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary privileges required for their roles.
*   **Secure Session Management:**  Implement secure session management practices, including using strong session IDs, secure session storage, and proper session invalidation.
*   **Thorough Testing and Code Review:**  Rigorous testing and code reviews specifically focused on authentication and authorization logic in Lua are crucial.
*   **Consider using Nginx's built-in authentication modules:**  If possible, leverage Nginx's built-in authentication modules (e.g., `auth_basic`, `auth_request`) for basic authentication tasks, and use Lua for more complex or application-specific authorization logic.

#### 4.4. Denial of Service (DoS) via Lua-Nginx-Module

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Lua code or misconfigurations of Lua-Nginx-Module can be exploited to cause Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Resource exhaustion in Lua code:**  Lua code that consumes excessive CPU, memory, or file descriptors can lead to DoS. Examples include:
    *   **Infinite loops or computationally expensive operations:**  Unintentional or malicious loops or algorithms that consume excessive CPU time.
    *   **Memory leaks:**  Lua code that allocates memory without releasing it, leading to memory exhaustion.
    *   **File descriptor leaks:**  Opening files or sockets without closing them properly, leading to file descriptor exhaustion.
    ```lua
    -- Vulnerable Lua code example (infinite loop)
    while true do
        -- ... some operation ...
    end
    ```
*   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Lua:**  Using inefficient regular expressions in Lua code that can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption.
*   **Misconfiguration of Lua-Nginx-Module limits:**  Incorrectly configured limits for Lua execution time, memory usage, or request processing can lead to DoS or performance degradation.
*   **Abuse of `ngx.sleep()` or `ngx.req.socket:receive`:**  Malicious Lua code can use these functions to hold connections open for extended periods, potentially exhausting server resources.

**Impact:**

*   **Application Unavailability:**  The application becomes unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Service Degradation:**  Performance degradation and slow response times for legitimate users.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) are exhausted, potentially affecting other services running on the same server.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Resource Limits in Lua:**  Implement resource limits within Lua code to prevent excessive CPU or memory consumption. Use Lua's built-in mechanisms or external libraries for resource management.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Write efficient and well-optimized Lua code to avoid resource exhaustion. Avoid infinite loops, computationally expensive operations, and memory leaks.
*   **Regular Expression Optimization:**  Use efficient regular expressions and test them for ReDoS vulnerabilities. Consider using alternative string processing methods if regular expressions are not strictly necessary.
*   **Nginx Configuration Limits:**  Configure Nginx limits for request processing, connection timeouts, and worker processes to prevent DoS attacks.
*   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**  Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms in Nginx or Lua to limit the number of requests from a single IP address or user.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor server resources (CPU, memory, network) and application performance to detect and respond to DoS attacks promptly.

#### 4.5. Misconfiguration of Lua-Nginx-Module

**Description:** Incorrect or insecure configuration of Lua-Nginx-Module itself or related Nginx directives can introduce vulnerabilities and weaken the application's security posture.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Exposing sensitive information in Lua code or Nginx configuration:**  Accidentally exposing API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive information in Lua code comments, error messages, or Nginx configuration files.
*   **Insecure file permissions for Lua scripts:**  Incorrect file permissions for Lua scripts, allowing unauthorized users to read or modify them.
*   **Disabled security features in Nginx or Lua-Nginx-Module:**  Disabling or misconfiguring security features like access control, rate limiting, or input validation in Nginx or Lua-Nginx-Module.
*   **Using outdated or vulnerable versions of Lua-Nginx-Module or Lua:**  Using outdated versions of Lua-Nginx-Module or Lua that contain known security vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  Exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
