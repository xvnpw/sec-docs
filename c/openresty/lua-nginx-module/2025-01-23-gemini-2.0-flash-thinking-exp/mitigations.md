# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for openresty/lua-nginx-module

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization in Lua](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_in_lua.md)

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization in Lua

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization in Lua
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Lua Input Points:**  Pinpoint all locations in your Lua code (executed within Nginx via `lua-nginx-module`) where external data from Nginx requests enters the Lua application. This includes accessing request parameters (`ngx.req.get_uri_args()`, `ngx.req.get_post_args()`), headers (`ngx.req.get_headers()`), and body (`ngx.req.get_body_data()`).
    2.  **Define Lua Validation Rules:** For each input point in Lua, define strict validation rules based on the expected data type, format, length, and allowed characters *within your Lua code*. Use Lua's string manipulation functions or libraries for validation.
    3.  **Implement Lua Validation Logic:** Write Lua code to check each input against the defined validation rules *before* any further processing in Lua or interaction with Nginx APIs. Use Lua's conditional statements to enforce validation.
    4.  **Sanitize Input in Lua:** If validation passes in Lua, sanitize the input *within Lua* to remove or escape potentially harmful characters *before* using it in Lua logic or passing it to other Nginx functions.  For example, escape characters if constructing strings for `ngx.log` or other Nginx directives.
    5.  **Handle Invalid Input in Lua:** If validation fails in Lua, reject the input *within Lua* and use Nginx directives (e.g., `ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_BAD_REQUEST)`) to return an appropriate error response directly from Nginx. Log the invalid input attempt using `ngx.log` for security monitoring. *Do not* proceed with processing invalid input in Lua or passing it to further Nginx processing.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** If Lua code interacts with databases (via `ngx.socket.tcp` or similar), unsanitized input *processed in Lua* can be injected into SQL queries.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity):** If Lua code generates dynamic content based on user input and doesn't sanitize it *within Lua* before being sent as Nginx response body, attackers can inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** If Lua code executes system commands (via `ngx.pipe` or `ngx.exec`, which should be heavily restricted), unsanitized input *processed in Lua* can be injected to execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Path Traversal (Medium Severity):** If Lua code handles file paths based on user input and uses Nginx file serving directives (e.g., `ngx.exec` with file paths), unsanitized input *processed in Lua* can allow attackers to access files outside the intended directory.
    *   **Lua Code Injection (High Severity):**  In extreme cases, if Lua code dynamically constructs and executes Lua code based on unsanitized input (e.g., using `loadstring`), it can lead to Lua code injection.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** High risk reduction. Lua-level input validation and sanitization effectively prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities originating from Lua code.
    *   **XSS:** High risk reduction. Lua-level sanitization tailored to the output context significantly reduces XSS risks in Lua-generated content.
    *   **Command Injection:** High risk reduction (if system commands are minimized and Lua input is strictly validated). Best practice is to avoid system commands from Lua entirely.
    *   **Path Traversal:** High risk reduction. Lua-level input validation and sanitization of file paths effectively prevent path traversal vulnerabilities when Lua interacts with file paths.
    *   **Lua Code Injection:** High risk reduction. Avoiding dynamic Lua code execution and strict input validation in Lua prevents Lua code injection.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the authentication Lua module (`nginx/lua/auth.lua`). Input validation is present for username and password fields, checking for length and allowed characters *in Lua*. Sanitization is basic *in Lua*, primarily focused on preventing obvious SQL injection attempts.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Input validation and sanitization are missing in the routing Lua module (`nginx/lua/routing.lua`) which handles URL parameters and forwards requests to backend services.  Specifically, URL parameters processed by Lua are not validated or sanitized *within Lua*. Response headers generated by Lua are also not currently sanitized *in Lua*, potentially leading to header injection vulnerabilities if Lua directly sets headers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Lua Code within Nginx](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_lua_code_within_nginx.md)

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege for Lua Code within Nginx

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Lua Code within Nginx
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required `ngx.*` APIs per Lua Module:** For each Lua module or function executed by `lua-nginx-module`, meticulously analyze which `ngx.*` APIs are *absolutely* necessary for its intended functionality within the Nginx context.
    2.  **Restrict Lua API Usage:**  Avoid using powerful or potentially dangerous `ngx.*` APIs in Lua unless strictly required for the specific task within Nginx.  For example, avoid `ngx.pipe`, `ngx.exec`, `ngx.req.socket`, `ngx.timer.*`, `ngx.thread.*` if simpler, less privileged alternatives exist within the Nginx ecosystem or Lua itself.
    3.  **Minimize Lua Permissions:** Within the Lua code, only grant the minimum necessary permissions to access Nginx resources or perform actions through `ngx.*` APIs.  For instance, if a Lua module only needs to read request headers using `ngx.req.get_headers()`, it should not use APIs that can modify response headers (`ngx.header.HEADER = value`) or interact with sockets (`ngx.socket.tcp`).
    4.  **Code Review for `ngx.*` API Usage:** During code reviews of Lua modules, specifically scrutinize the usage of *every* `ngx.*` API call.  Question the necessity of each API call in the Nginx context and ensure it strictly adheres to the principle of least privilege.
    5.  **Regularly Re-evaluate Lua Permissions:** As the application evolves and Lua modules are modified, periodically review the `ngx.*` API usage in Lua code and ensure that the granted permissions are still necessary, minimal, and justified within the Nginx environment.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Nginx (High Severity):** If Lua code running within Nginx has excessive privileges through `ngx.*` APIs, vulnerabilities in the Lua code can be exploited to gain higher privileges *within the Nginx worker process* or potentially impact other Nginx functionalities.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Nginx APIs (Medium to High Severity):** Overly permissive Lua code might be able to access sensitive information *exposed through `ngx.*` APIs* that it shouldn't have access to, leading to information leaks from the Nginx environment.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Nginx (Medium to High Severity):**  Unrestricted access to resource-intensive `ngx.*` APIs (e.g., those related to timers, threads, or external processes) could be exploited from Lua to cause resource exhaustion and DoS attacks *against the Nginx worker process*.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Nginx Sockets (Medium to High Severity):**  If Lua code has unnecessary network access through `ngx.socket.*` APIs, it could be exploited for SSRF attacks *originating from the Nginx server*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Nginx:** High risk reduction. Limiting Lua privileges within Nginx significantly reduces the impact of vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation *within the Nginx context*.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Nginx APIs:** Medium to High risk reduction. Restricting Lua access to sensitive Nginx APIs reduces the potential for information leaks *from the Nginx environment*.
    *   **DoS against Nginx:** Medium risk reduction. Limiting Lua access to resource-intensive Nginx APIs makes DoS attacks harder to execute *through Lua vulnerabilities impacting Nginx resources*.
    *   **SSRF via Nginx Sockets:** Medium to High risk reduction. Restricting Lua network access through `ngx.socket.*` APIs mitigates SSRF risks *originating from the Nginx server via Lua*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. The authentication module (`nginx/lua/auth.lua`) primarily uses `ngx.req.*` APIs for request handling and `ngx.log` for logging, which are relatively less privileged. It generally avoids more powerful APIs like `ngx.pipe` or `ngx.exec`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** The routing module (`nginx/lua/routing.lua`) currently uses `ngx.location.capture` for internal redirects, which is necessary for its functionality but is a more powerful API. A thorough review is needed to confirm if this is the *most* least-privileged way to achieve routing within Nginx using Lua.  A formal, documented review of all `ngx.*` API usage across *all* Lua modules against the principle of least privilege within the Nginx context is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Secrets and Credentials Accessed by Lua in Nginx](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_secrets_and_credentials_accessed_by_lua_in_nginx.md)

### 3. Secure Handling of Secrets and Credentials Accessed by Lua in Nginx

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Handling of Secrets and Credentials Accessed by Lua in Nginx
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Secrets Used by Lua:** List all secrets that Lua code running within Nginx needs to access. This includes database credentials for Lua database interactions, API keys for Lua-initiated requests to backend services, encryption keys used in Lua for session management or data protection, and any other sensitive information Lua needs.
    2.  **Eliminate Hardcoding in Lua and Nginx Configs:**  Absolutely remove all hardcoded secrets from Lua code files and Nginx configuration files that are directly accessible or processed by `lua-nginx-module`.
    3.  **Utilize Nginx Environment Variables for Lua:** Store secrets as environment variables that are accessible to the Nginx worker process. Access these environment variables in Lua code using `os.getenv()` and in Nginx configuration using `${ENV_VARIABLE}`. This leverages Nginx's environment variable handling.
    4.  **Consider Nginx `lua_shared_dict` for Cached Secrets (with caution):** For secrets that need to be frequently accessed by Lua across multiple Nginx worker processes, consider using Nginx's `lua_shared_dict`. However, store *encrypted* secrets in `lua_shared_dict` and decrypt them in Lua only when needed. Be extremely cautious about storing secrets in shared memory, even encrypted, and carefully consider access control to the shared dictionary.
    5.  **Restrict Access to Environment Variables/Secrets Storage:** Limit access to the environment variables or any secrets management system used by Nginx and Lua to only authorized personnel and processes at the OS level.
    6.  **Avoid Logging Secrets in Lua/Nginx Logs:**  Ensure that Lua code *never* logs secrets directly using `ngx.log` or any other logging mechanism.  Configure Nginx logging to also avoid inadvertently capturing secrets from requests or responses processed by Lua.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Theft from Lua Code/Nginx Configs (High Severity):** Hardcoded secrets in Lua code or Nginx configuration files are easily discovered by attackers who gain access to code repositories, configuration files, or server file systems.
    *   **Unauthorized Access via Stolen Lua-Accessed Credentials (High Severity):** Stolen credentials that are used by Lua to access backend systems can be used to gain unauthorized access to databases, APIs, and other sensitive resources *that Lua interacts with*.
    *   **Data Breach via Compromised Lua-Accessed Credentials (High Severity):** Compromised credentials used by Lua can lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive information *from systems Lua connects to*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Theft from Lua/Nginx:** High risk reduction. Eliminating hardcoded secrets in Lua and Nginx configs significantly reduces the risk of credential theft from static code analysis or file system access.
    *   **Unauthorized Access via Lua Credentials:** High risk reduction. Securely managed secrets accessed by Lua make it much harder for attackers to obtain valid credentials *used by Lua*.
    *   **Data Breach via Lua Credentials:** High risk reduction. By protecting credentials *used by Lua*, the likelihood of data breaches due to compromised Lua-related credentials is significantly reduced.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Database credentials for the authentication module are currently stored as environment variables accessed in the Nginx configuration file and then passed to Lua.
*   **Missing Implementation:** API keys for backend services used by the routing module are still hardcoded in the Lua routing module (`nginx/lua/routing.lua`). Encryption keys used for session management (if any, and potentially used by Lua) are also potentially hardcoded or insecurely managed.  The use of `lua_shared_dict` for secret caching is not implemented (and should be carefully considered before implementation). A comprehensive secrets management strategy *specifically for secrets accessed by Lua within Nginx* needs to be fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management for Lua Libraries Used with lua-nginx-module](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_for_lua_libraries_used_with_lua-nginx-module.md)

### 4. Dependency Management for Lua Libraries Used with lua-nginx-module

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Dependency Management for Lua Libraries Used with lua-nginx-module
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inventory Lua Dependencies for Nginx Modules:** Create a detailed list of *all* Lua libraries used by your Lua modules that are executed by `lua-nginx-module`. Document the library name, version, source (e.g., LuaRocks, custom library within the project), and purpose within the Nginx context.
    2.  **Utilize LuaRocks for Nginx Lua Modules (Recommended):** Implement LuaRocks as the primary dependency management tool for Lua libraries used in your Nginx modules. LuaRocks simplifies installation, version tracking, and updates of Lua libraries.
    3.  **Pin Library Versions for Nginx Lua Modules:**  Within your LuaRocks configuration (e.g., `LuaRocksfile` if using LuaRocks), specify *exact* versions of Lua libraries. Avoid using version ranges or "latest" to ensure consistent and reproducible builds of your Nginx Lua modules across different environments.
    4.  **Regularly Update Lua Libraries for Nginx Modules:** Establish a process for regularly checking for updates to Lua libraries used by your Nginx modules. Monitor security advisories and release notes specifically for these Lua libraries for known vulnerabilities that could impact your Nginx application.
    5.  **Vulnerability Scanning for Nginx Lua Libraries:** Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into your development pipeline to automatically scan the Lua libraries used by your Nginx modules for known vulnerabilities. Focus on tools that can scan LuaRocks packages or custom Lua libraries.
    6.  **Secure Library Sources for Nginx Lua Modules:**  Obtain Lua libraries for your Nginx modules from trusted and reputable sources, ideally the official LuaRocks repository or verified GitHub repositories. Avoid using libraries from unknown or untrusted sources, as these could introduce malicious code into your Nginx environment.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Lua Dependencies in Nginx (Medium to High Severity):** Using outdated or vulnerable Lua libraries *within your Nginx modules* can introduce known security vulnerabilities directly into your Nginx application.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Lua Libraries in Nginx (Medium to High Severity):**  Compromised or malicious Lua libraries from untrusted sources can introduce malware or backdoors *into your Nginx worker processes*, potentially compromising the entire Nginx server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Lua Dependencies in Nginx:** High risk reduction. Regularly updating and patching Lua libraries used in Nginx modules significantly reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities *within the Nginx context*.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Lua Libraries in Nginx:** Medium risk reduction. Using trusted sources and verifying the integrity of Lua libraries used in Nginx modules reduces the risk of supply chain attacks *targeting your Nginx server*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Lua libraries are currently manually downloaded and placed in the project directory for use with `lua-nginx-module`. There is no formal dependency management system in place for Lua libraries used in Nginx.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Dependency management *specifically for Lua libraries used with `lua-nginx-module`* needs to be implemented. This includes setting up LuaRocks (or a similar system), creating a dependency manifest (e.g., `LuaRocksfile`), pinning library versions, and establishing a process for regular updates and vulnerability scanning of Lua libraries used in Nginx.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Nginx Configuration for lua-nginx-module](./mitigation_strategies/secure_nginx_configuration_for_lua-nginx-module.md)

### 5. Secure Nginx Configuration for lua-nginx-module

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Nginx Configuration for lua-nginx-module
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Apply General Nginx Security Hardening:** Implement standard Nginx security hardening measures *in addition to Lua-specific configurations*. This includes running Nginx as a non-privileged user, disabling unnecessary Nginx modules, limiting worker processes, configuring appropriate timeouts, and setting secure HTTP headers.
    2.  **Restrict Access to Nginx Configuration Files (Including Lua Directives):** Protect *all* Nginx configuration files, including those containing Lua-related directives (`lua_package_path`, `lua_package_cpath`, `content_by_lua_block`, etc.), from unauthorized access. Use appropriate file permissions and access control mechanisms at the OS level.
    3.  **Carefully Review Lua-Specific Nginx Directives:**  Thoroughly review *all* Lua-related directives in the Nginx configuration (`lua_package_path`, `lua_package_cpath`, `content_by_lua_block`, `access_by_lua_block`, etc.). Ensure they are configured securely and do not introduce vulnerabilities *specifically related to Lua integration*.
    4.  **Limit `lua_package_path` and `lua_package_cpath` for Nginx Lua Modules:** Restrict the directories specified in `lua_package_path` and `lua_package_cpath` to the *absolute minimum necessary* locations for loading Lua modules used by `lua-nginx-module`. Avoid including world-writable directories or directories outside of the project's direct control. Use absolute paths and avoid relative paths that could be misinterpreted.
    5.  **Ensure `lua_code_cache on` in Production Nginx:**  Verify that `lua_code_cache` is explicitly set to `on` in production Nginx configurations. Disabling code cache in production can expose Lua source code (if Nginx configuration is misconfigured) and potentially introduce performance and security issues.
    6.  **Regularly Audit Nginx Configuration (Including Lua Parts):** Periodically review and audit the *entire* Nginx configuration, with a specific focus on Lua-related directives and configurations, for security misconfigurations and adherence to best practices for `lua-nginx-module`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Configuration Errors in Nginx Lua Integration (Medium to High Severity):** Misconfigured Nginx directives, *especially Lua-related ones*, can introduce vulnerabilities like information disclosure (e.g., exposing Lua source code), bypasses of security controls implemented in Lua, or DoS conditions.
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Nginx Lua Module Loading (Medium to High Severity):**  Insecure `lua_package_path` or `lua_package_cpath` configurations could potentially be exploited for LFI attacks if combined with vulnerabilities in Lua code or Nginx itself, allowing attackers to load and execute arbitrary Lua code from the file system *within the Nginx worker process*.
    *   **Information Disclosure of Lua Source Code (Medium Severity):**  Leaving `lua_code_cache off` in production Nginx can expose Lua source code if Nginx configuration allows direct access to Lua files, potentially revealing sensitive logic or implementation details.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Configuration Errors in Nginx Lua:** Medium to High risk reduction. Secure Nginx configuration *specifically for Lua integration* significantly reduces the risk of vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations in how `lua-nginx-module` is set up.
    *   **LFI via Nginx Lua Module Loading:** Medium risk reduction. Restricting `lua_package_path` and `lua_package_cpath` mitigates potential LFI risks related to how Nginx loads Lua modules, making it harder for attackers to inject malicious Lua code via file paths.
    *   **Information Disclosure of Lua Source Code:** Medium risk reduction. Enabling `lua_code_cache` in production prevents accidental or intentional exposure of Lua source code through misconfigured Nginx setups.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. General Nginx security best practices are mostly followed. Access to configuration files is restricted. `lua_code_cache` is enabled in production Nginx.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A formal, documented security review of Lua-specific Nginx directives (`lua_package_path`, `lua_package_cpath`) is needed to ensure they are securely configured *for `lua-nginx-module`*.  Regular configuration audits, specifically focusing on the security aspects of Lua integration in Nginx, are not currently performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Coding Practices in Lua for Nginx Modules](./mitigation_strategies/secure_coding_practices_in_lua_for_nginx_modules.md)

### 6. Secure Coding Practices in Lua for Nginx Modules

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Coding Practices in Lua for Nginx Modules
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Adhere to General Secure Coding Principles in Lua:** Follow established secure coding principles *specifically when writing Lua code that will run within Nginx via `lua-nginx-module`*. This includes principles like input validation, output sanitization, least privilege, secure error handling, and avoiding hardcoded secrets.
    2.  **Avoid Common Lua Vulnerabilities in Nginx Context:** Be aware of common Lua vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited *within the Nginx environment*. This includes insecure handling of string formatting (e.g., `string.format` without proper format specifiers), improper error handling that might leak sensitive information *through Nginx logs or responses*, and logic flaws that can lead to security bypasses *in the Nginx application*.
    3.  **Implement Access Control and Authorization in Lua (if applicable):** If your Lua modules handle access control or authorization logic *within Nginx*, implement these mechanisms securely. Ensure that authorization decisions are consistently enforced in Lua and are not easily bypassed.
    4.  **Minimize Dynamic Code Execution in Lua within Nginx:** Minimize or completely avoid the use of dynamic code execution functions in Lua (e.g., `loadstring`, `loadfile`, `module.load`) *within your Nginx modules*. Dynamic code execution introduces significant security risks if not extremely carefully controlled and validated, especially in a server environment like Nginx. If dynamic code execution is absolutely necessary, implement rigorous input validation and sandboxing.
    5.  **Secure Error Handling in Lua for Nginx:** Implement robust error handling in your Lua code to gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent application crashes or information leaks *through Nginx error responses or logs*. Ensure error messages are generic and do not expose sensitive internal details or system information. Use `ngx.log` for controlled error logging.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lua Code Vulnerabilities Exploitable in Nginx (High Severity):** General vulnerabilities in Lua code, when running within Nginx, can be exploited to compromise the Nginx worker process, bypass security controls, or cause application failures.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Lua Errors in Nginx (Medium Severity):** Improper error handling in Lua can lead to information disclosure through Nginx error responses or logs, potentially revealing sensitive data or internal application details.
    *   **Bypass of Lua-Implemented Security Controls (Medium to High Severity):** Logic flaws or vulnerabilities in Lua code that implements access control or authorization *within Nginx* can lead to bypasses of these security mechanisms.
    *   **Lua Code Injection (High Severity):** Uncontrolled dynamic code execution in Lua can lead to Lua code injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary Lua code within the Nginx worker process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Lua Code Vulnerabilities in Nginx:** High risk reduction. Adhering to secure coding practices in Lua significantly reduces the likelihood of introducing exploitable vulnerabilities in Lua modules running in Nginx.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Lua Errors:** Medium risk reduction. Secure error handling in Lua prevents information leaks through Nginx error responses and logs.
    *   **Bypass of Lua Security Controls:** Medium to High risk reduction. Secure implementation of access control and authorization in Lua minimizes the risk of bypasses.
    *   **Lua Code Injection:** High risk reduction. Minimizing or eliminating dynamic code execution in Lua prevents Lua code injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic secure coding practices are generally followed in Lua modules, but there is no formal secure coding guideline or training specifically for Lua development within the Nginx context.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A formal set of secure coding guidelines *specifically for Lua development for `lua-nginx-module`* needs to be created and enforced. Code reviews should specifically focus on secure coding practices in Lua. Static analysis tools for Lua (if available and applicable to the Nginx context) should be explored and integrated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Reviews and Static Analysis for Lua Nginx Modules](./mitigation_strategies/code_reviews_and_static_analysis_for_lua_nginx_modules.md)

### 7. Code Reviews and Static Analysis for Lua Nginx Modules

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Code Reviews and Static Analysis for Lua Nginx Modules
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Mandatory Code Reviews for Lua Modules:** Establish a mandatory code review process for *all* Lua code changes intended for deployment in Nginx via `lua-nginx-module`. Code reviews should be performed by security-conscious developers with expertise in both Lua and web application security, and ideally with some understanding of `lua-nginx-module` specifics.
    2.  **Focus Code Reviews on Security Aspects of Lua in Nginx:**  During code reviews, specifically focus on security aspects relevant to Lua code running within Nginx. This includes: input validation and sanitization, secure coding practices, `ngx.*` API usage, secret handling, error handling, and potential vulnerabilities specific to Lua in the Nginx context.
    3.  **Utilize Static Analysis Tools for Lua (if available):** Explore and utilize static analysis tools specifically designed for Lua code. Evaluate if these tools can be effectively integrated into your development workflow to automatically detect potential security flaws, coding style issues, and vulnerabilities in your Lua modules *before deployment to Nginx*.
    4.  **Integrate Static Analysis into CI/CD Pipeline (if feasible):** If suitable static analysis tools for Lua are found, integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically perform static analysis checks on every code change. Fail the build process if critical security issues are detected by the static analysis tools.
    5.  **Regularly Update Static Analysis Tools:** If using static analysis tools, ensure they are regularly updated to the latest versions to benefit from improved vulnerability detection capabilities and bug fixes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Undetected Lua Code Vulnerabilities in Nginx (High Severity):** Without code reviews and static analysis, security vulnerabilities in Lua modules running in Nginx may go undetected until exploited in production.
    *   **Human Error in Lua Security (Medium to High Severity):** Code reviews help catch human errors and oversights in Lua code that could lead to security vulnerabilities, even by experienced developers.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Lua Libraries (Medium to High Severity):** Static analysis tools can help identify the use of vulnerable Lua libraries (if they have vulnerability databases) or highlight potential issues in custom Lua code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Undetected Lua Code Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Code reviews and static analysis significantly increase the likelihood of detecting and fixing security vulnerabilities in Lua modules *before they are deployed to Nginx*.
    *   **Human Error in Lua Security:** Medium to High risk reduction. Code reviews act as a second pair of eyes to catch errors and improve the overall security of Lua code.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Lua Libraries:** Medium risk reduction (depending on the capabilities of static analysis tools). Static analysis can help proactively identify and address known vulnerabilities in Lua dependencies.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Code reviews are performed for major code changes, but security aspects of Lua code in Nginx are not always a primary focus. Static analysis tools for Lua are not currently used.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Mandatory, security-focused code reviews for *all* Lua code changes for Nginx modules need to be formally implemented. Exploration and integration of static analysis tools for Lua are missing. Integration of static analysis into the CI/CD pipeline is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to `ngx.*` APIs in Lua Nginx Modules](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to__ngx___apis_in_lua_nginx_modules.md)

### 8. Restrict Access to `ngx.*` APIs in Lua Nginx Modules

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Access to `ngx.*` APIs in Lua Nginx Modules
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Default Deny for `ngx.*` APIs in Lua:** Adopt a "default deny" approach to `ngx.*` API usage in Lua modules. Assume that Lua code should *not* have access to any `ngx.*` API unless explicitly and demonstrably required for its specific functionality within Nginx.
    2.  **Explicitly Justify and Document `ngx.*` API Usage:** For every `ngx.*` API used in Lua code, explicitly justify its necessity and document *why* that specific API is required and how it is used securely. This documentation should be part of the code comments and design documentation.
    3.  **Categorize `ngx.*` APIs by Risk Level:** Categorize `ngx.*` APIs based on their potential security risk. Identify high-risk APIs (e.g., `ngx.pipe`, `ngx.exec`, `ngx.req.socket`, `ngx.timer.*`, `ngx.thread.*`) and require extra scrutiny and justification for their use in Lua modules.
    4.  **Minimize Usage of High-Risk `ngx.*` APIs:** Actively minimize the usage of high-risk `ngx.*` APIs in Lua code. Explore alternative approaches that do not require these APIs or use less privileged Nginx functionalities whenever possible.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Audit `ngx.*` API Usage in Lua:** Periodically review and audit the usage of `ngx.*` APIs in all Lua modules. Ensure that the justifications for API usage are still valid, that the APIs are used securely, and that there are no opportunities to further reduce API privileges.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Abuse of Powerful `ngx.*` APIs in Lua (High Severity):** Unnecessary or insecure usage of powerful `ngx.*` APIs in Lua modules can create significant security vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to exploit these APIs for malicious purposes within the Nginx environment.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via `ngx.*` APIs (High Severity):** Overly permissive access to `ngx.*` APIs in Lua can enable privilege escalation vulnerabilities, where attackers can leverage Lua code to gain higher privileges within the Nginx worker process or the underlying system.
    *   **Information Disclosure via `ngx.*` APIs (Medium to High Severity):** Unrestricted access to `ngx.*` APIs can allow Lua code to access sensitive information exposed through these APIs, leading to information leaks from the Nginx server or backend systems.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via `ngx.*` APIs (Medium to High Severity):**  Abuse of resource-intensive `ngx.*` APIs in Lua can be exploited to cause resource exhaustion and DoS attacks against the Nginx worker process or backend systems.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Abuse of Powerful `ngx.*` APIs:** High risk reduction. Restricting and carefully controlling access to `ngx.*` APIs significantly reduces the attack surface and limits the potential for abuse of these APIs.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via `ngx.*` APIs:** High risk reduction. Limiting Lua access to privileged `ngx.*` APIs mitigates the risk of privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
    *   **Information Disclosure via `ngx.*` APIs:** Medium to High risk reduction. Restricting access to information-revealing `ngx.*` APIs reduces the potential for information leaks.
    *   **DoS via `ngx.*` APIs:** Medium risk reduction. Limiting access to resource-intensive `ngx.*` APIs makes DoS attacks harder to execute through Lua vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. There is an awareness of the power of `ngx.*` APIs, but there is no formal policy or process for restricting and justifying their usage in Lua modules.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A formal policy of "default deny" for `ngx.*` APIs in Lua needs to be established and documented. A categorization of `ngx.*` APIs by risk level is missing. A process for explicitly justifying and documenting `ngx.*` API usage in Lua modules needs to be implemented and enforced during code reviews. Regular audits of `ngx.*` API usage in Lua are also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Management and Limits in Lua Nginx Modules](./mitigation_strategies/resource_management_and_limits_in_lua_nginx_modules.md)

### 9. Resource Management and Limits in Lua Nginx Modules

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Management and Limits in Lua Nginx Modules
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Timeouts in Lua for Nginx Operations:** Implement timeouts in Lua code for operations that might take a long time or potentially hang, such as network requests using `ngx.socket.tcp`, external process execution via `ngx.pipe` or `ngx.exec` (if used), or complex computations within Lua itself. Use Lua's `ngx.timer.at` or similar mechanisms to enforce timeouts.
    2.  **Limit Lua Memory Usage (if possible):** Explore if there are mechanisms within `lua-nginx-module` or Lua itself to limit the memory consumption of Lua code running in Nginx. While direct memory limits might be challenging, focus on writing efficient Lua code that avoids unnecessary memory allocations and leaks.
    3.  **Control Lua CPU Usage (indirectly):** Be mindful of CPU-intensive operations in Lua code. Avoid uncontrolled loops, computationally expensive algorithms, or regular expressions that could consume excessive CPU resources in the Nginx worker process. Optimize Lua code for performance to minimize CPU impact.
    4.  **Monitor Nginx Resource Usage (CPU, Memory) for Lua Modules:** Implement monitoring of Nginx worker process resource usage (CPU, memory) specifically for requests that execute Lua modules. This allows you to detect if Lua code is causing excessive resource consumption or potential resource exhaustion issues.
    5.  **Set Nginx Worker Process Limits (general Nginx hardening):** Configure general Nginx worker process limits (e.g., `worker_processes`, `worker_connections`) as part of overall Nginx hardening. These limits indirectly help manage resource consumption even if Lua code becomes resource-intensive.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Lua Resource Exhaustion (Medium to High Severity):** Uncontrolled resource consumption by Lua code (CPU, memory, network connections, etc.) can lead to DoS attacks against the Nginx worker process or backend systems.
    *   **Resource Starvation in Nginx (Medium Severity):** Resource-intensive Lua code can starve other Nginx functionalities or requests of resources, impacting overall Nginx performance and availability.
    *   **Slowloris-style Attacks via Lua (Medium Severity):** If Lua code initiates network connections or external processes without proper timeouts, it could be exploited to create slowloris-style attacks by holding connections open indefinitely and exhausting server resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Lua Resource Exhaustion:** Medium to High risk reduction. Implementing timeouts and resource management in Lua makes DoS attacks via Lua resource exhaustion harder to execute.
    *   **Resource Starvation in Nginx:** Medium risk reduction. Controlling Lua resource usage helps prevent resource starvation and ensures fair resource allocation within Nginx.
    *   **Slowloris-style Attacks via Lua:** Medium risk reduction. Timeouts in Lua network operations mitigate the risk of slowloris-style attacks originating from Lua code.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic timeouts might be present in some Lua network operations, but there is no systematic resource management strategy for Lua modules in Nginx. Monitoring of Nginx resource usage is in place, but not specifically focused on Lua modules.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematic implementation of timeouts in Lua for all potentially long-running operations is missing. Formal guidelines for resource-efficient Lua coding for Nginx modules are needed. Resource monitoring specifically for Lua modules needs to be enhanced. Exploration of Lua memory limiting mechanisms (if available) is missing.

### 10. Error Handling and Logging in Lua Nginx Modules

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Error Handling and Logging in Lua Nginx Modules
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Robust Error Handling in Lua:** Implement comprehensive error handling in Lua code to gracefully handle unexpected situations, exceptions, and errors that might occur during Lua execution within Nginx. Use Lua's `pcall` (protected call) to catch errors and prevent Lua code from crashing the Nginx worker process.
    2.  **Avoid Exposing Sensitive Information in Lua Error Messages:** Ensure that Lua error messages, whether logged or returned in Nginx responses, do *not* expose sensitive internal details, system information, or secrets. Error messages should be generic and informative enough for debugging but not reveal security-sensitive information.
    3.  **Use `ngx.log` for Controlled Lua Logging:** Use `ngx.log` API for logging relevant events, errors, and security-related information from Lua code. Configure Nginx logging levels appropriately to control the verbosity of Lua logs.
    4.  **Log Security-Relevant Events from Lua:** Specifically log security-relevant events from Lua code, such as invalid input attempts, authorization failures, suspicious activity, and errors that might indicate security issues. Ensure these security logs are reviewed regularly.
    5.  **Centralized Logging for Lua Nginx Modules:** Configure centralized logging for Nginx and Lua logs, sending logs to a dedicated logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk). This facilitates security monitoring, incident response, and analysis of Lua-related events.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Lua Error Messages (Medium Severity):** Verbose or poorly handled Lua error messages can inadvertently disclose sensitive information to attackers through Nginx error responses or logs.
    *   **Application Instability due to Lua Errors (Medium Severity):** Unhandled errors in Lua code can lead to application instability, crashes of Nginx worker processes, or unpredictable behavior.
    *   **Delayed Security Incident Detection (Medium Severity):** Lack of proper logging of security-relevant events from Lua modules can delay the detection and response to security incidents or attacks targeting Lua-based functionalities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Lua Error Messages:** Medium risk reduction. Secure error handling and generic error messages prevent information leaks through Lua errors.
    *   **Application Instability due to Lua Errors:** Medium risk reduction. Robust error handling in Lua improves application stability and prevents crashes caused by Lua code errors.
    *   **Delayed Security Incident Detection:** Medium risk reduction. Proper logging of security-relevant events from Lua modules enables faster detection and response to security incidents.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic error handling is present in some Lua modules, but it is not consistently robust across all Lua code. Logging using `ngx.log` is used, but security logging is not systematically implemented. Centralized logging for Nginx is in place, but Lua logs might not be fully integrated or analyzed for security events.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematic and robust error handling needs to be implemented in all Lua modules. Guidelines for secure error message generation in Lua are needed. Security logging from Lua modules needs to be systematically implemented and integrated into centralized logging and security monitoring systems.
