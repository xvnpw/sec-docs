Mandatory reviews and automated analysis significantly increase the likelihood of identifying and fixing these vulnerabilities.
*   **Human Error in Lua Security (Medium to High Severity):** **Strongly Mitigated.** Code reviews act as a second pair of eyes to catch human errors and oversights. Static analysis tools can also detect common coding errors and security flaws that might be missed by human reviewers.
*   **Known Vulnerabilities in Lua Libraries (Medium to High Severity):** **Partially Mitigated.** Static analysis tools *can* help identify the use of vulnerable Lua libraries if they have vulnerability databases or rules to detect known vulnerable patterns. However, the effectiveness depends on the capabilities of the specific tools used and the availability of vulnerability information for Lua libraries. Code reviews can also help identify the use of outdated or potentially vulnerable libraries if reviewers are aware of common vulnerabilities.

#### 4.3. Impact Evaluation

The claimed impact on risk reduction is realistic and achievable:

*   **Undetected Lua Code Vulnerabilities:** **High risk reduction.**  The combination of code reviews and static analysis provides a robust defense against undetected vulnerabilities.
*   **Human Error in Lua Security:** **Medium to High risk reduction.** Code reviews are particularly effective at mitigating human error. Static analysis provides an additional layer of automated error detection.
*   **Known Vulnerabilities in Lua Libraries:** **Medium risk reduction.**  The impact is medium because the effectiveness depends on the specific static analysis tools and their capabilities in detecting library vulnerabilities. Manual code reviews can supplement this, but require reviewers to be aware of library vulnerabilities.

#### 4.4. Current Implementation and Missing Implementation

The current implementation status ("Partially implemented") highlights the need for improvement.  The missing implementations are critical for maximizing the effectiveness of this mitigation strategy:

*   **Mandatory, Security-Focused Code Reviews for *all* Lua code changes:** This is a crucial missing piece.  Moving from "major code changes" to *all* changes and explicitly focusing on security is essential for comprehensive coverage.
*   **Exploration and Integration of Static Analysis Tools for Lua:** This is a significant gap.  Implementing static analysis will automate vulnerability detection and improve efficiency.
*   **Integration of Static Analysis into the CI/CD pipeline:** This is necessary to ensure continuous and automated security checks, enabling shift-left security.
