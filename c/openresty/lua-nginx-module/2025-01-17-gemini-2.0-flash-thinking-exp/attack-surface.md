# Attack Surface Analysis for openresty/lua-nginx-module

## Attack Surface: [Lua Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/lua_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Lua code into the application through user-supplied data, which is then executed by the Nginx worker process.
    *   **How Lua-Nginx-Module Contributes:** The module allows embedding and executing Lua code within the Nginx configuration and request lifecycle, making it susceptible to injection if input is not properly sanitized before being used in Lua contexts (e.g., `ngx.eval`, `loadstring`).
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable application might use `ngx.var.arg_name` directly in `ngx.eval` without sanitizing `arg_name`. An attacker could send a request with `name='os.execute("rm -rf /")'` to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Allows for arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never use `ngx.eval` or `loadstring` with untrusted input.**
        *   **Sanitize and validate all user-supplied data** before using it in Lua code.
        *   **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements** if interacting with databases from Lua.
        *   **Employ a secure coding review process** to identify potential injection points.
        *   **Consider using a Lua security sandbox** if dynamic code execution is absolutely necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Lua Code Loading and Execution](./attack_surfaces/insecure_lua_code_loading_and_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious Lua code is loaded and executed by the Nginx worker process due to insecure configuration or lack of access controls.
    *   **How Lua-Nginx-Module Contributes:** The module relies on loading and executing Lua files specified in the Nginx configuration. If these files are writable by unauthorized users or loaded from untrusted sources, attackers can inject malicious code.
    *   **Example:** An application might load Lua files from a directory writable by the web server user. An attacker could replace a legitimate Lua file with a malicious one, which would then be executed by Nginx.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Allows for arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure Lua files are owned by the appropriate user (e.g., root) and are not writable by the Nginx worker process user.**
        *   **Restrict access to directories containing Lua files** using file system permissions.
        *   **Avoid loading Lua code from untrusted sources or user uploads.**
        *   **Implement code signing or integrity checks** for Lua files.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious or poorly written Lua scripts consume excessive server resources, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **How Lua-Nginx-Module Contributes:** The module allows executing arbitrary Lua code within the Nginx worker process. Inefficient or malicious scripts can consume excessive CPU, memory, or block worker processes, impacting the server's ability to handle legitimate requests.
    *   **Example:** A Lua script with an infinite loop or one that allocates a large amount of memory could freeze the Nginx worker process, preventing it from serving requests.
    *   **Impact:** High. Can render the application unavailable, causing significant disruption and financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement timeouts and resource limits** within Lua scripts to prevent runaway processes.
        *   **Thoroughly test Lua scripts for performance and resource usage** before deployment.
        *   **Monitor server resource usage** and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        *   **Consider using the `ngx.timer` API for non-blocking operations** to avoid blocking worker processes.
        *   **Implement rate limiting** to prevent attackers from triggering resource-intensive scripts repeatedly.

## Attack Surface: [Bypass of Security Controls Implemented in Lua](./attack_surfaces/bypass_of_security_controls_implemented_in_lua.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in custom authentication or authorization logic implemented in Lua can lead to security bypasses.
    *   **How Lua-Nginx-Module Contributes:** The module allows developers to implement custom security logic within Lua scripts. Flaws in this logic can undermine the intended security measures.
    *   **Example:** A custom authentication script might have a logic error that allows bypassing authentication checks under certain conditions, granting unauthorized access to protected resources.
    *   **Impact:** High. Can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Follow secure coding practices when implementing security logic in Lua.**
        *   **Thoroughly test and review custom authentication and authorization code.**
        *   **Consider using well-established and vetted authentication and authorization mechanisms** instead of custom implementations where possible.
        *   **Implement proper error handling and logging** to detect and investigate potential bypass attempts.
