# Threat Model Analysis for openresty/lua-nginx-module

## Threat: [Unsafe Lua Code Injection](./threats/unsafe_lua_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious Lua code by exploiting vulnerabilities where user-supplied data is directly incorporated into Lua code executed by functions like `ngx.eval` or `loadstring` without proper sanitization. The attacker might manipulate input fields, URL parameters, or headers to inject code that performs unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution within the Nginx worker process. This could allow the attacker to gain full control over the server, access sensitive data, modify configurations, or pivot to other systems.
*   **Affected Component:** `ngx.eval`, `loadstring`, `content_by_lua_block`, `access_by_lua_block`, `header_filter_by_lua_block`, `body_filter_by_lua_block`, `log_by_lua_block` directives.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using `ngx.eval` and `loadstring` with unsanitized user input.
    *   If dynamic code execution is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization.
    *   Consider using sandboxing techniques or running Lua code in a restricted environment.
    *   Employ parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases from Lua.

## Threat: [Exploiting Lua Library Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_lua_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could leverage known vulnerabilities in external Lua libraries used by the application (via `require`). This could involve sending specific requests or providing crafted input that triggers a bug in the library, leading to unexpected behavior or code execution.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or other security breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** `require` function, any external Lua libraries used by the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep all Lua libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Regularly audit the dependencies of your Lua code for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use reputable and well-maintained Lua libraries.
    *   Consider using a dependency management tool to track and update library versions.

## Threat: [Lua VM Resource Exhaustion](./threats/lua_vm_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could send requests that trigger computationally expensive or memory-intensive operations within the Lua VM. This could involve crafting requests that cause infinite loops, excessive memory allocation, or the creation of a large number of objects within the Lua code.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service. The Nginx worker process could become unresponsive, consuming excessive CPU or memory, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Affected Component:** Lua VM, any Lua code executed within the Nginx context.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement timeouts and resource limits within the Lua code to prevent runaway processes.
    *   Carefully review Lua code for potential performance bottlenecks and resource-intensive operations.
    *   Monitor resource usage of Nginx worker processes.
    *   Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from sending a large number of malicious requests.

## Threat: [Abuse of Nginx API for Internal Redirection](./threats/abuse_of_nginx_api_for_internal_redirection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate Lua code that uses `ngx.location.capture` or `ngx.redirect` to redirect requests to internal, unintended locations. This could bypass authentication or authorization checks, granting access to sensitive resources or functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal resources, potential data breaches, or manipulation of application logic.
*   **Affected Component:** `ngx.location.capture`, `ngx.redirect`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully validate the target location in `ngx.location.capture` and `ngx.redirect` calls.
    *   Avoid using user-supplied data directly in the target location without thorough sanitization and validation.
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms at the Nginx level, independent of Lua logic where possible.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration of Lua Module Paths](./threats/insecure_configuration_of_lua_module_paths.md)

*   **Description:** If `lua_package_path` and `lua_package_cpath` directives are not configured securely, an attacker could potentially inject their own malicious Lua modules into the search path. When the application uses `require`, the attacker's module could be loaded and executed.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution if a malicious module is loaded and executed.
*   **Affected Component:** `lua_package_path`, `lua_package_cpath` directives.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure `lua_package_path` and `lua_package_cpath` to point only to trusted directories.
    *   Avoid using relative paths or wildcard characters that could allow access to unintended locations.
    *   Restrict write access to the directories specified in these paths.

## Threat: [Blocking Operations in `content_by_lua*`](./threats/blocking_operations_in__content_by_lua_.md)

*   **Description:** Performing blocking operations (e.g., long-running network requests without proper timeouts) within the `content_by_lua*` context can tie up Nginx worker processes, making them unavailable to handle other requests. An attacker could exploit this by sending requests that trigger these blocking operations.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `content_by_lua_block`, `content_by_lua_file`, Lua code performing blocking operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid performing blocking operations within the `content_by_lua*` context.
    *   Use non-blocking I/O or asynchronous operations where possible (e.g., using `ngx.socket.tcp`).
    *   Implement timeouts for any external network requests made from Lua.
    *   Consider using a dedicated worker pool for handling long-running tasks.
