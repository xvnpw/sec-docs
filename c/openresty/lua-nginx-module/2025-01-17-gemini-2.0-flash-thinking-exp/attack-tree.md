## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Lua Code (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_lua_code__critical_node_.md)

*   This represents the broad category of attacks that target flaws in the Lua code itself. If the Lua code contains vulnerabilities, attackers can leverage them to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerable Code Path (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerable_code_path__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the crucial step where an attacker successfully manipulates the application to execute the vulnerable section of the Lua code. This often involves crafting specific inputs or requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers exploit vulnerabilities where user-controlled input is used to construct and execute system commands without proper sanitization.
*   If Lua code uses functions like `os.execute` or `io.popen` with unsanitized input, attackers can inject arbitrary commands.
*   Example:  A Lua script using `os.execute("ping -c 4 " .. user_provided_host)` is vulnerable if `user_provided_host` is not sanitized. An attacker could input `; rm -rf /`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Arbitrary File Write (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/arbitrary_file_write__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers exploit vulnerabilities where they can control the path and content of files written by the Lua application.
*   If Lua code uses functions like `io.open(user_provided_path, "w")` with unsanitized `user_provided_path` and `content`, attackers can write to arbitrary locations.
*   Example: An attacker could overwrite configuration files or inject malicious code into web server directories.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lua Sandbox Escape (If Applicable) (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/lua_sandbox_escape__if_applicable___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   If a custom Lua sandbox is implemented to restrict the capabilities of the Lua code, attackers may attempt to bypass these restrictions.
*   This involves finding vulnerabilities in the sandbox implementation itself or exploiting weaknesses in the Lua interpreter.
*   Successful sandbox escape can grant the attacker full control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Security Controls (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Start)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_security_controls__critical_node__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   Attackers exploit flaws in custom authentication or authorization logic implemented in Lua.
*   This could involve incorrect logic, missing checks, or vulnerabilities in the custom security scheme.
*   Successful bypass allows attackers to access resources or functionalities they should not have access to.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Handling of External Data (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Start)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_handling_of_external_data__critical_node__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This category covers vulnerabilities arising from the Lua application's interaction with external data sources like databases or APIs.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection (If Database Interaction) (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__if_database_interaction___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers exploit vulnerabilities where user-controlled input is used to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   This allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   Example: A Lua script constructing a query like `ngx.location.capture("/api/users?name=" .. user_provided_name)` and then using that in a database query without proper escaping is vulnerable. An attacker could input `' OR '1'='1`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection (If Interacting with External Systems) (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection__if_interacting_with_external_systems___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Similar to the first Command Injection, but specifically focuses on scenarios where the Lua application interacts with external systems (not just the local OS) and uses unsanitized external data to construct commands.
*   Example: If Lua code uses data from an API to construct a command to send to another server without proper sanitization, it's vulnerable.
