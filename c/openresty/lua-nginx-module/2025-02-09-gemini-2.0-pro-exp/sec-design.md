Okay, let's create a design document for the `lua-nginx-module` project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Enable dynamic scripting and customization of Nginx behavior without requiring recompilation of Nginx itself.
*   Provide a high-performance, low-latency scripting environment within Nginx.
*   Extend Nginx's functionality with custom logic written in Lua, covering areas like request processing, response modification, authentication, and more.
*   Offer a more accessible and flexible alternative to native Nginx C modules for extending functionality.
*   Maintain compatibility with existing Nginx configurations and features.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities introduced by custom Lua scripts could compromise the Nginx server and potentially the entire system.
*   Performance degradation due to poorly written or inefficient Lua scripts could impact the overall performance of Nginx.
*   Instability or crashes in the Lua environment could lead to Nginx service disruptions.
*   Incompatibility with future Nginx versions or other modules could break existing deployments.
*   Lack of proper sandboxing or resource limits for Lua scripts could allow malicious scripts to consume excessive resources or interfere with other processes.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Nginx's core security features: The module operates within the context of Nginx, inheriting its core security features like request filtering, rate limiting, and SSL/TLS termination. Described in Nginx documentation.
*   security control: Lua sandbox (limited): Lua provides a degree of sandboxing, restricting access to certain system resources. However, this sandboxing is not absolute and can be bypassed with sufficient effort. Described in Lua documentation.
*   security control: Nginx worker process isolation: Nginx uses separate worker processes, providing some isolation between requests and limiting the impact of crashes. Described in Nginx documentation.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in custom Lua scripts: The primary risk is that users can write insecure Lua code that introduces vulnerabilities. This is inherent to the nature of the module, which allows arbitrary code execution.
*   accepted risk: Limited sandboxing of the Lua environment: While Lua offers some sandboxing, it's not a complete security boundary.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on Nginx's core security: The module's security heavily relies on the correct configuration and security of the underlying Nginx server.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Strict input validation and sanitization within Lua scripts: All user-provided input should be rigorously validated and sanitized before being used in any sensitive operations.
*   security control: Resource limits for Lua scripts: Implement mechanisms to limit CPU usage, memory allocation, and execution time for Lua scripts to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
*   security control: Code review and security testing of Lua scripts: Before deploying any custom Lua scripts, they should undergo thorough code review and security testing.
*   security control: Regular security audits of the Nginx configuration and Lua scripts: Conduct periodic audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Use a dedicated, non-privileged user account for running Nginx worker processes.
*   security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of Nginx to provide an additional layer of security.
*   security control: Monitor Nginx and Lua logs for suspicious activity.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   If Lua scripts handle authentication, they must use secure methods like checking credentials against a secure store (e.g., a database or LDAP) and using strong password hashing algorithms.
    *   Avoid storing credentials directly in Lua scripts.
    *   Implement proper session management with secure, randomly generated session IDs and appropriate timeouts.
*   Authorization:
    *   If Lua scripts implement authorization logic, they must enforce access controls based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions to each user.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All input from clients, other modules, and external sources must be strictly validated and sanitized.
    *   Use whitelisting (allowing only known-good input) rather than blacklisting (blocking known-bad input) whenever possible.
    *   Validate data types, lengths, formats, and ranges.
*   Cryptography:
    *   If Lua scripts handle sensitive data, they must use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
    *   Use secure random number generators for generating keys and nonces.
    *   Store cryptographic keys securely, outside of the Lua scripts themselves.
    *   Use established cryptographic libraries (e.g., LuaCrypto) rather than implementing custom cryptographic routines.

## BUILD

Build Process:

1.  Developer writes Lua scripts and Nginx configuration.
2.  Code is committed to a version control system (e.g., Git).
3.  A Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is triggered (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
4.  The CI pipeline performs the following steps:
    *   Checks out the code.
    *   Runs static analysis tools (e.g., luacheck) on the Lua scripts to identify potential code quality issues.
    *   Runs security linters (if available) to detect potential security vulnerabilities in the Lua scripts.
    *   Builds a Docker image containing Nginx, the lua-nginx-module, and the custom Lua scripts.  This uses a multi-stage Dockerfile to minimize the final image size and attack surface. The base image should be a minimal, secure base image (e.g., Alpine Linux).
    *   Pushes the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry).
    *   Optionally, runs integration tests against the built Docker image.
5.  The Docker image is then deployed to the target environment (e.g., Kubernetes).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Serving web content and applications: Nginx with lua-nginx-module is likely used to serve critical web content or applications.
*   Dynamic request handling: Lua scripts may be used for critical dynamic request processing, such as authentication, authorization, or routing.
*   API gateway functionality: Nginx may be acting as an API gateway, with Lua scripts handling API requests.

Data Sensitivity:

*   User data: Lua scripts may handle sensitive user data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), authentication credentials, or financial data.  Sensitivity: High
*   Session data: Nginx and Lua scripts may manage session data. Sensitivity: Medium to High
*   Configuration data: Nginx configuration and Lua scripts themselves may contain sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials. Sensitivity: High
*   Application data: Data processed by backend applications accessed through Nginx. Sensitivity: Varies depending on the application.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific types of user data will be handled by Lua scripts?
*   What external services will Lua scripts interact with, and what data will be exchanged?
*   What are the specific performance requirements for the Nginx server and Lua scripts?
*   What is the existing security infrastructure (e.g., firewalls, WAFs) in place?
*   What is the process for deploying updates to Lua scripts and Nginx configuration?
*   Are there any existing security policies or guidelines that need to be followed?
*   What level of logging and monitoring is required?
*   What are the specific authentication and authorization requirements for Lua scripts?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The organization has a moderate risk appetite, balancing the need for flexibility and customization with the need for security.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The organization has some basic security controls in place, but there is room for improvement.
*   DESIGN: The deployment environment will be a Kubernetes cluster, and the build process will use a CI pipeline with Docker.  Nginx will be used as a reverse proxy and potentially as an API gateway. Lua scripts will be used for non-trivial request processing and may interact with external services.
