# Deep Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Lua in `lua-nginx-module`

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanisms by which an SSRF attack can be executed through Lua code within an Nginx environment using `lua-nginx-module`.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and the potential impact of a successful attack.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations for developers to prevent and mitigate SSRF vulnerabilities.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on SSRF vulnerabilities arising from the use of Lua scripting within Nginx, leveraging the capabilities of `lua-nginx-module`.  It covers:

*   **Lua Code:**  Analysis of Lua code that makes HTTP requests, including:
    *   `ngx.location.capture()` and `ngx.location.capture_multi()`
    *   Third-party Lua HTTP client libraries (e.g., `lua-http`, `luasocket`).
    *   Custom Lua code that interacts with network resources.
*   **Input Vectors:**  Identification of potential input sources that could be manipulated to trigger SSRF, such as:
    *   HTTP request headers (e.g., `Host`, custom headers).
    *   Query parameters.
    *   Request body data (e.g., JSON, XML, form data).
    *   Data retrieved from external sources (e.g., databases, APIs).
*   **Nginx Configuration:**  Examination of Nginx configuration directives that might influence or exacerbate SSRF vulnerabilities.  This is *secondary* to the Lua code analysis, but relevant.
* **Attack Scenarios:** Exploration of different attack scenarios.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   SSRF vulnerabilities unrelated to Lua scripting (e.g., vulnerabilities in Nginx core modules).
*   General Nginx security hardening (beyond its direct relevance to SSRF).
*   Vulnerabilities in external systems accessed *legitimately* by the Lua code (we focus on the *initiation* of the malicious request).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of Lua code snippets and example configurations to identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities.  This includes searching for patterns known to be risky, such as direct use of user input in URL construction.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  Conceptualizing how dynamic analysis tools (e.g., fuzzers) could be used to test for SSRF vulnerabilities.  We won't perform actual dynamic analysis, but we'll describe the approach.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Applying threat modeling principles to identify attack vectors and potential impact scenarios.
4.  **Best Practices Research:**  Reviewing established security best practices for preventing SSRF in web applications and adapting them to the `lua-nginx-module` context.
5.  **Vulnerability Pattern Analysis:** Identifying common coding patterns that lead to SSRF.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 4.1. Attack Vectors and Vulnerable Code Patterns

The core of the SSRF vulnerability lies in Lua code that constructs and executes HTTP requests based on attacker-controlled input.  Here are specific attack vectors and vulnerable code patterns:

*   **Direct User Input in `ngx.location.capture()`:**

    ```lua
    -- VULNERABLE CODE
    local user_provided_url = ngx.var.arg_url  -- Get URL from query parameter
    local res = ngx.location.capture(user_provided_url)
    ```

    An attacker could provide a URL like `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` (AWS metadata service) or `http://localhost:8080/internal-api` to access internal resources.

*   **Insufficient Validation of User Input:**

    ```lua
    -- VULNERABLE CODE
    local user_provided_host = ngx.var.arg_host
    local res = ngx.location.capture("/some/path?host=" .. user_provided_host)
    ```
    Even if the path is fixed, an attacker can control the `host` part, leading to SSRF.  Simple string checks (e.g., checking for "http://" prefix) are easily bypassed.

*   **Using Third-Party Libraries Without Proper Sanitization:**

    ```lua
    -- VULNERABLE CODE (assuming lua-http is used)
    local http = require("http")
    local user_provided_url = ngx.req.get_headers()["X-Target-URL"]
    local response = http.request("GET", user_provided_url)
    ```

    If the third-party library doesn't perform robust URL validation, the attacker can inject malicious URLs via headers.

*   **Indirect Input via Database or External API:**

    ```lua
    -- VULNERABLE CODE (conceptual)
    -- 1. Fetch a URL from a database (which might have been populated by an attacker)
    local url_from_db = fetch_url_from_database()
    -- 2. Use the fetched URL in ngx.location.capture()
    local res = ngx.location.capture(url_from_db)
    ```

    Even if the immediate user input is sanitized, if the data originates from an untrusted source (like a database that could be subject to SQL injection), SSRF is still possible.

*   **Protocol Smuggling:**

    An attacker might try to use schemes other than `http://` or `https://`, such as `file://`, `gopher://`, or `dict://`, to interact with local files or other services.  Lua libraries might not handle these schemes securely by default.

*  **DNS Rebinding:**
    An attacker can use a domain name that they control, which initially resolves to a safe IP address (passing any initial validation), but then quickly changes to resolve to an internal IP address after the validation check but before the request is made.

### 4.2. Impact Scenarios

A successful SSRF attack can have severe consequences:

*   **Access to Internal Services:**  The attacker can access internal APIs, databases, and other services that are not exposed to the public internet.  This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Cloud Metadata Exposure:**  On cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), the attacker can access instance metadata services (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/`) to retrieve sensitive information, including credentials.
*   **Port Scanning:**  The attacker can scan the internal network to identify open ports and running services, providing valuable information for further attacks.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker can cause the Nginx server to make requests to a large number of internal or external resources, potentially overwhelming the server or the target systems.
*   **Bypassing Firewalls:**  SSRF can be used to bypass firewall rules that restrict outbound traffic, as the request originates from the trusted Nginx server.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  While SSRF primarily focuses on *making* requests, clever attackers might find ways to exfiltrate data through the response headers or body, especially if the Lua code processes the response.

### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The following mitigation strategies are crucial for preventing SSRF in `lua-nginx-module`:

*   **1. Strict Input Validation (Whitelist Approach):**

    *   **Principle:**  Instead of trying to blacklist malicious inputs (which is error-prone), define a whitelist of allowed URLs or URL components (hosts, schemes, paths).
    *   **Implementation:**
        ```lua
        -- SAFE CODE (Whitelist)
        local allowed_hosts = {
            ["api.example.com"] = true,
            ["data.example.net"] = true,
        }

        local user_provided_host = ngx.var.arg_host

        if allowed_hosts[user_provided_host] then
            local res = ngx.location.capture("/api?host=" .. user_provided_host)
            -- ... process response ...
        else
            ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Invalid host: " .. user_provided_host)
            ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN)
        end
        ```
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   Maintain the whitelist carefully.  Any additions should be thoroughly reviewed.
        *   Use a table (hash) for efficient lookup (O(1) complexity).
        *   Consider using a dedicated configuration file for the whitelist, making it easier to manage and update.

*   **2. Avoid User-Controlled URLs (Proxy Pattern):**

    *   **Principle:**  Instead of allowing users to specify arbitrary URLs, provide a limited set of predefined endpoints or actions.  The Lua code then maps these user choices to safe, hardcoded URLs.
    *   **Implementation:**
        ```lua
        -- SAFE CODE (Proxy Pattern)
        local endpoints = {
            ["data1"] = "http://internal-api.example.com/data1",
            ["data2"] = "http://internal-api.example.com/data2",
        }

        local user_choice = ngx.var.arg_endpoint

        if endpoints[user_choice] then
            local res = ngx.location.capture(endpoints[user_choice])
            -- ... process response ...
        else
            ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Invalid endpoint: " .. user_choice)
            ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN)
        end
        ```
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   This approach is highly effective but requires careful design to ensure it meets the application's requirements.
        *   It's suitable when the set of possible destinations is known and limited.

*   **3. Network Segmentation and Firewall Rules:**

    *   **Principle:**  Limit the network access of the Nginx server to the minimum required.  Use network segmentation (e.g., VLANs, subnets) and firewall rules to prevent the server from accessing sensitive internal resources directly.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Configure the operating system firewall (e.g., `iptables`, `firewalld`) to block outbound connections from the Nginx server except to explicitly allowed destinations and ports.
        *   Use network namespaces or containers (e.g., Docker) to isolate the Nginx process and its network access.
        *   Place the Nginx server in a DMZ or a separate network segment from critical internal systems.
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   This is a defense-in-depth measure.  It doesn't prevent SSRF itself, but it limits the impact of a successful attack.
        *   Requires careful network planning and configuration.

*   **4. URL Parsing and Validation Libraries:**

    *   **Principle:** Use robust URL parsing libraries to validate and normalize URLs before using them.  Avoid relying on simple string manipulation.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Consider using a well-vetted Lua URL parsing library (if available).  Unfortunately, the Lua ecosystem is less mature than some others in this regard.  You might need to carefully evaluate and potentially adapt existing libraries.
        *   If a suitable library isn't available, implement thorough validation logic that checks:
            *   **Scheme:**  Allow only `http` and `https`.
            *   **Host:**  Validate against a whitelist or use a regular expression that strictly enforces valid hostname formats (RFC 1123).  *Avoid* simple checks like `string.find(url, "http://")`.
            *   **Port:**  Restrict to allowed ports (e.g., 80, 443).
            *   **Path, Query, Fragment:**  Sanitize these components to remove potentially dangerous characters or sequences.
    * **Considerations:**
        *   Thorough URL validation is complex and error-prone if done manually.  Prioritize using a library if possible.
        *   Regular expressions for URL validation can be tricky to get right.  Use well-tested regex patterns.

*   **5. Disable Unnecessary URL Schemes:**

    *   **Principle:** If your application only needs to make HTTP/HTTPS requests, explicitly disable support for other URL schemes (e.g., `file://`, `gopher://`) in your Lua code and any libraries you use.
    *   **Implementation:** This depends on the specific Lua HTTP client library being used.  Look for options to restrict allowed schemes or protocols.  If using `ngx.location.capture()`, you're limited to HTTP/HTTPS, which is good.  However, be cautious with third-party libraries.

*   **6.  Request Timeouts:**

    *   **Principle:**  Set reasonable timeouts for all HTTP requests made by the Lua code.  This prevents attackers from causing the server to hang indefinitely by making requests to unresponsive targets.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Use the `timeout` option in `ngx.location.capture()` (if available).
        *   Use the timeout settings provided by third-party Lua HTTP client libraries.
        *   Example (using a hypothetical `http` library):
            ```lua
            local http = require("http")
            local response = http.request("GET", url, { timeout = 5000 }) -- 5-second timeout
            ```

*   **7.  Monitoring and Alerting:**

    *   **Principle:**  Implement monitoring and alerting to detect potential SSRF attempts.  Log any suspicious URLs or failed validation attempts.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Use `ngx.log()` to log relevant information, including the user-provided input, the validated URL, and the result of the validation.
        *   Configure a log aggregation and analysis system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) to monitor for suspicious patterns.
        *   Set up alerts to notify administrators of potential SSRF attempts.

* **8.  Least Privilege:**

    * **Principle:** Run the Nginx worker processes with the least privileges necessary.  Avoid running Nginx as root.
    * **Implementation:**
        * Use the `user` directive in the Nginx configuration to specify a non-root user for the worker processes.
        * Ensure that the user has only the necessary permissions to access required files and directories.

* **9.  Regular Updates:**

    * **Principle:** Keep `lua-nginx-module`, Lua itself, Nginx, and any third-party Lua libraries up to date to benefit from security patches.
    * **Implementation:** Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly.

* **10. DNS Resolution Control (Advanced):**

    * **Principle:** To mitigate DNS rebinding attacks, you can implement custom DNS resolution logic within your Lua code. This allows you to cache the resolved IP address and ensure that subsequent requests use the same IP, even if the DNS record changes.
    * **Implementation:** This is a complex mitigation and requires careful consideration. You might use a Lua library for DNS resolution (e.g., `luasocket`) and implement your own caching and validation logic.  You would need to resolve the hostname *before* passing it to `ngx.location.capture()` or a third-party library, and then use the resolved IP address directly.  This is generally *not recommended* unless you have a very specific need and understand the complexities involved.  It's better to rely on network-level protections (firewalls, DNS filtering) for DNS rebinding.

### 4.4. Example of Improved Code

Let's revisit the first vulnerable example and show a significantly improved version:

```lua
-- SAFE CODE (Whitelist and URL Parsing)

-- Define a whitelist of allowed hosts and paths
local allowed_endpoints = {
  ["api.example.com"] = {
    ["/data"] = true,
    ["/status"] = true,
  },
  ["internal.service.local"] = {
      ["/metrics"] = true
  }
}

local function is_valid_url(url)
  -- Use a (hypothetical) URL parsing library
  local parsed_url = url_parser.parse(url)

  if not parsed_url then
    return false, "Invalid URL format"
  end

  -- Check scheme
  if parsed_url.scheme ~= "http" and parsed_url.scheme ~= "https" then
    return false, "Invalid scheme: " .. parsed_url.scheme
  end

  -- Check host against whitelist
  if not allowed_endpoints[parsed_url.host] then
    return false, "Invalid host: " .. parsed_url.host
  end

    -- Check path against whitelist for the given host
  if not allowed_endpoints[parsed_url.host][parsed_url.path] then
      return false, "Invalid path: " .. parsed_url.path .. " for host: " .. parsed_url.host
  end

  -- (Optional) Check port if needed
  -- if parsed_url.port and parsed_url.port ~= 80 and parsed_url.port ~= 443 then
  --   return false, "Invalid port: " .. parsed_url.port
  -- end

  return true, nil -- URL is valid
end

local user_provided_url = ngx.var.arg_url

local is_valid, error_message = is_valid_url(user_provided_url)

if is_valid then
  local res = ngx.location.capture(user_provided_url)
  -- ... process response ...
else
  ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "SSRF attempt detected: " .. error_message .. ", URL: " .. user_provided_url)
  ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN)
end

```

This improved example demonstrates:

*   **Whitelist:**  A clear whitelist of allowed hosts and paths.
*   **URL Parsing:**  Uses a hypothetical `url_parser` library (which you would need to find or implement) to break down the URL into its components.
*   **Scheme Validation:**  Explicitly checks for allowed schemes.
*   **Host and Path Validation:**  Checks the host and path against the whitelist.
*   **Error Handling:**  Logs detailed error messages and returns a 403 Forbidden response.
* **Defense in Depth:** Even if one check is bypassed, others are in place.

## 5. Conclusion

SSRF vulnerabilities in `lua-nginx-module` are a serious threat, but they can be effectively mitigated through a combination of strict input validation, careful coding practices, and network-level security measures.  The key is to *never* trust user-supplied data directly when constructing URLs.  By implementing the strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of SSRF attacks and protect their applications and infrastructure.  Regular security audits and code reviews are also essential to ensure that these mitigations remain effective over time.
