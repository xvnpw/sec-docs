# Deep Analysis: Lua Code Injection via User Input in lua-nginx-module

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics of Lua code injection vulnerabilities within applications using the `lua-nginx-module`.  This includes identifying common attack vectors, understanding the potential impact, and developing concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigation and prevention.  We aim to provide developers with the knowledge necessary to build secure applications that are resilient to this critical threat.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on Lua code injection vulnerabilities arising from the misuse of user-supplied input within the context of the `lua-nginx-module`.  It covers:

*   **Vulnerable Nginx Directives:**  `content_by_lua_block`, `access_by_lua_block`, `rewrite_by_lua_block`, `header_filter_by_lua_block`, `body_filter_by_lua_block`, and any other directives that allow execution of Lua code.
*   **Vulnerable Lua Functions:**  Functions that read user input, including `ngx.req.get_uri_args()`, `ngx.req.get_post_args()`, `ngx.req.get_headers()`, `ngx.req.read_body()`, and any custom functions that handle user data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Common methods attackers might use to inject malicious Lua code, including direct injection, indirect injection (e.g., through database interactions), and exploitation of flawed input validation.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Both general principles and specific techniques for preventing Lua code injection, including input validation, sanitization, safe string handling, and secure coding practices.
* **Exclusions:** This analysis does *not* cover:
    *   Vulnerabilities in the `lua-nginx-module` itself (assuming it's kept up-to-date).
    *   General Nginx configuration vulnerabilities unrelated to Lua.
    *   Operating system-level vulnerabilities.
    *   Other types of injection attacks (e.g., command injection) that are not directly related to Lua code execution.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 4.1. Threat Modeling Review (Recap)

*   **Threat:** Lua Code Injection via User Input
*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious Lua code through user-supplied input, gaining control of the Nginx worker process.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data breaches, service disruption, lateral movement.
*   **Affected Components:**  Lua directives processing user input (`content_by_lua_block`, etc.) and functions reading user input (`ngx.req.get_uri_args()`, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

### 4.2. Vulnerability Analysis

The core vulnerability lies in the dynamic execution of Lua code that incorporates unsanitized or improperly validated user input.  Here are some common scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Direct Code Construction (Most Dangerous)**

```lua
-- VULNERABLE CODE
local user_input = ngx.req.get_uri_args().evil_param
local command = "ngx.say('" .. user_input .. "')"  -- Concatenating user input directly
ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Executing: ", command)
loadstring(command)() -- Executing the constructed string
```

*   **Explanation:**  This code directly concatenates user input into a Lua string, which is then executed using `loadstring()`.  An attacker providing `evil_param=');os.execute('rm -rf /');--` would execute arbitrary shell commands.  `loadstring()` (and the equivalent `load()`) are extremely dangerous when used with untrusted input.
* **Attack Vector:** An attacker can send request like this: `http://example.com/?evil_param=');os.execute('rm -rf /');--`

**Scenario 2: Indirect Code Construction (Less Obvious)**

```lua
-- VULNERABLE CODE
local user_input = ngx.req.get_uri_args().data
local data = {}
data[user_input] = "some_value" -- Using user input as a table key

-- Later, the table is iterated and used in a way that might be vulnerable
for k, v in pairs(data) do
    if k == "dangerous_key" then
        -- ... some operation that could be manipulated ...
        ngx.say(v)
    end
end
```

*   **Explanation:**  While not directly constructing a Lua command string, the user input controls a table key.  If the code later uses this key in a sensitive operation (e.g., accessing a file, constructing another string), it could be vulnerable.  This is harder to exploit but still dangerous.
* **Attack Vector:** An attacker can send request like this: `http://example.com/?data=dangerous_key`

**Scenario 3:  Flawed Input Validation (Common Mistake)**

```lua
-- VULNERABLE CODE
local user_input = ngx.req.get_uri_args().username

-- Weak validation: only checks for length
if #user_input > 10 then
    ngx.say("Username too long")
    return
end

local command = "ngx.say('Hello, " .. user_input .. "')"
loadstring(command)()
```

*   **Explanation:**  The code only checks the length of the input, not its content.  An attacker could still inject malicious code within the 10-character limit (e.g., `');ngx.exit(`).  This highlights the importance of *whitelisting* over *blacklisting*.
* **Attack Vector:** An attacker can send request like this: `http://example.com/?username=');ngx.exit(`

**Scenario 4: Database Interaction (Indirect Injection)**

```lua
-- VULNERABLE CODE (assuming a hypothetical database library)
local user_input = ngx.req.get_uri_args().comment
local db = require("mydb")
local result = db.query("SELECT * FROM comments WHERE text = '" .. user_input .. "'") -- SQL Injection!

-- ... later, the result might be used in Lua code ...
if result and result[1] then
    local command = "ngx.say('" .. result[1].text .. "')" -- Potential Lua injection
    loadstring(command)()
end
```

*   **Explanation:**  This code is vulnerable to SQL injection.  If an attacker can inject SQL code that modifies the `text` column of a comment, they can then indirectly inject Lua code when that comment is retrieved and used.  This demonstrates the importance of using parameterized queries.
* **Attack Vector:** An attacker can send request like this: `http://example.com/?comment='); UPDATE comments SET text = "');os.execute('rm -rf /');--"; --`

### 4.3. Attack Vector Exploration

Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through various input vectors:

*   **URL Query Parameters:**  `ngx.req.get_uri_args()`
*   **POST Request Body:**  `ngx.req.get_post_args()`, `ngx.req.read_body()`
*   **HTTP Headers:**  `ngx.req.get_headers()`
*   **Cookies:**  While not directly accessible through `ngx.req`, cookies can be read and used in Lua, potentially leading to injection.
*   **Uploaded Files:**  If the Lua code processes the content of uploaded files, this is another potential injection vector.
*   **Database Content:**  As shown in Scenario 4, compromised database content can lead to indirect Lua code injection.
* **WebSockets:** If application is using WebSockets, attacker can try to inject code via WebSocket messages.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive

The following mitigation strategies are crucial for preventing Lua code injection:

1.  **Never Construct Lua Code from User Input (Primary Defense):**

    *   **Explanation:**  This is the most important rule.  Avoid *any* situation where user input is directly or indirectly concatenated into a Lua code string that is then executed using `loadstring()`, `load()`, or similar functions.
    *   **Code Example (Safe):**
        ```lua
        local user_input = ngx.req.get_uri_args().name
        -- Instead of: local command = "ngx.say('" .. user_input .. "')"
        -- Do this:
        ngx.say("Hello, ", user_input) -- Separate arguments, no code construction
        ```

2.  **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Essential):**

    *   **Explanation:**  Implement rigorous input validation to ensure that user input conforms to expected formats, lengths, and character sets.  Use *whitelisting* (allowing only known-good characters) whenever possible.  Sanitize input by escaping or removing potentially dangerous characters.
    *   **Code Example (Whitelisting):**
        ```lua
        local user_input = ngx.req.get_uri_args().username
        -- Allow only alphanumeric characters and underscores
        local sanitized_input = string.gsub(user_input, "[^%w_]", "")

        if sanitized_input ~= user_input then
            ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Invalid username: ", user_input)
            ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_BAD_REQUEST)
            return
        end

        ngx.say("Hello, ", sanitized_input)
        ```
    *   **Code Example (Escaping - Use with Caution):**  Escaping is generally less reliable than whitelisting, but it can be necessary in some cases.  Lua's `string.format` with `%q` can be used for basic escaping, but it's not a complete solution for all injection scenarios.  Consider using a dedicated escaping library if available.
        ```lua
          local user_input = ngx.req.get_uri_args().message
          local escaped_input = string.format("%q", user_input)
          -- Use escaped_input carefully, understanding its limitations.
        ```

3.  **Parameterized Queries (for Database Interactions):**

    *   **Explanation:**  If your Lua code interacts with a database, *always* use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection.  SQL injection can lead to indirect Lua code injection.
    *   **Code Example (Hypothetical Parameterized Query):**
        ```lua
        local db = require("mydb")
        local user_input = ngx.req.get_uri_args().comment
        local result = db.query("SELECT * FROM comments WHERE text = ?", user_input) -- Parameterized!
        -- ... process the result safely ...
        ```

4.  **Safe String Concatenation (If Absolutely Necessary):**

    *   **Explanation:**  If you *must* dynamically construct strings that incorporate user input (and you've thoroughly considered alternatives), use safe string concatenation methods.  Avoid simple string concatenation (`..`) with untrusted input.  Lua's `string.format` can be helpful, but it's not a silver bullet.
    * **Code Example:**
    ```lua
      local user_name = ngx.req.get_uri_args().name
      local age = ngx.req.get_uri_args().age
      -- Validate that age is a number
      if tonumber(age) == nil then
          ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_BAD_REQUEST)
          return
      end
      local message = string.format("User %s is %d years old.", user_name, tonumber(age))
      ngx.say(message)
    ```

5. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Explanation:** Run Nginx worker processes with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can do if they successfully inject code.  Avoid running Nginx as root.

6. **Regular Expression Validation:**
    * **Explanation:** Use regular expressions to validate the format of user input.  This is particularly useful for validating things like email addresses, phone numbers, and other structured data.
    * **Code Example:**
    ```lua
    local email = ngx.req.get_uri_args().email
    if not string.match(email, "^[%w._-]+@[%w._-]+%.[%w]+$") then
        ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Invalid email address: ", email)
        ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_BAD_REQUEST)
        return
    end
    ```

7. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Explanation:** While CSP primarily protects against client-side attacks (like XSS), it can also provide some defense-in-depth against Lua code injection by restricting the sources from which Lua code can be loaded.  This is more relevant if you're using `lua_package_path` or `lua_package_cpath` to load external Lua modules.

8. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * **Explanation:** A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests that attempt to exploit Lua code injection vulnerabilities.  However, a WAF should be considered a secondary layer of defense, not a replacement for secure coding practices.

### 4.5. Tooling and Automation

*   **Static Analysis:**  Tools like `luacheck` can be used to statically analyze Lua code for potential vulnerabilities, including the use of `loadstring` and other dangerous functions.  Integrate `luacheck` into your CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Dynamic analysis tools can be used to test running applications for vulnerabilities.  This can involve fuzzing (sending malformed input) and monitoring for unexpected behavior.
*   **Fuzzing:**  Fuzzing tools like `afl` (American Fuzzy Lop) can be adapted to test Nginx configurations with Lua code.  This involves generating a large number of random inputs and observing the application's response.
*   **Code Review:**  Regular code reviews are essential for identifying potential vulnerabilities.  Ensure that all Lua code is reviewed by at least one other developer.
* **Security Linters:** Use security-focused linters that can specifically identify potential injection vulnerabilities.

### 4.6. Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Prevention:**  Focus on preventing Lua code injection through secure coding practices, rather than relying solely on detection and mitigation.
2.  **Input Validation is Key:**  Implement strict input validation and sanitization for *all* user-supplied data.  Use whitelisting whenever possible.
3.  **Avoid `loadstring` and `load`:**  Never use `loadstring` or `load` with untrusted input.  Find alternative ways to achieve your goals.
4.  **Use Parameterized Queries:**  Always use parameterized queries when interacting with databases.
5.  **Automate Security Checks:**  Integrate static analysis, dynamic analysis, and fuzzing into your development workflow.
6.  **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
7.  **Stay Up-to-Date:**  Keep the `lua-nginx-module` and all other dependencies up-to-date to ensure you have the latest security patches.
8.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Nginx with minimal privileges.
9. **Educate Developers:** Ensure all developers working with `lua-nginx-module` are aware of the risks of Lua code injection and the best practices for preventing it.
10. **Test Thoroughly:**  Test your application thoroughly, including penetration testing, to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.

By following these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of Lua code injection vulnerabilities in applications using the `lua-nginx-module`. This threat is critical, but with careful coding and proactive security measures, it can be effectively mitigated.
