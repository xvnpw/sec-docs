Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Exploit Lua Code Injection" attack tree path, tailored for an application using the `lua-nginx-module` from OpenResty.

## Deep Analysis: Exploit Lua Code Injection in `lua-nginx-module`

### 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Exploit Lua Code Injection" attack path, identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors within the context of `lua-nginx-module`, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to harden the application against this class of attack.  The ultimate goal is to prevent attackers from executing arbitrary Lua code within the Nginx worker processes.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on vulnerabilities that allow for Lua code injection within an application utilizing the `lua-nginx-module`.  We will consider:

*   **Input Vectors:**  All potential sources of user-supplied data that could be used to inject Lua code. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   HTTP request headers (e.g., `User-Agent`, custom headers)
    *   HTTP request body (e.g., POST data, JSON, XML)
    *   Query parameters in the URL
    *   Cookies
    *   Data retrieved from external sources (e.g., databases, APIs) that is subsequently used in Lua scripts without proper sanitization.
    *   Uploaded files (if the application processes file content or metadata in Lua).
    *   WebSockets messages.
*   **Vulnerable `lua-nginx-module` Directives and Lua APIs:**  We will examine specific directives and Lua functions that, if misused or improperly configured, could create injection vulnerabilities.
*   **OpenResty/Nginx Configuration:**  We will consider how the overall Nginx configuration, including `location` blocks, `rewrite` rules, and other directives, might contribute to or mitigate injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Application Logic:**  We will analyze how the application's Lua code handles user input and interacts with the `lua-nginx-module` APIs.

We will *not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities unrelated to Lua code injection (e.g., DDoS attacks, SQL injection in a backend database *unless* the result is used unsafely in Lua).
*   Generic Nginx security best practices that are not directly related to `lua-nginx-module` (e.g., file system permissions).
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party Lua modules *unless* they are commonly used with `lua-nginx-module` and pose a significant injection risk.

### 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will (hypothetically, as we don't have the actual application code) examine the application's Lua code and Nginx configuration files for potential injection vulnerabilities.  This includes searching for:
    *   Direct use of user input in `ngx.say`, `ngx.print`, `ngx.redirect`, `content_by_lua_block`, `access_by_lua_block`, etc., without proper escaping or validation.
    *   Use of `eval`-like functions (if any custom ones are implemented) with unsanitized input.
    *   Dynamic generation of Lua code based on user input.
    *   Improper handling of data retrieved from external sources.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities and common exploit patterns related to `lua-nginx-module` and Lua code injection in general.  This includes reviewing:
    *   CVE databases (e.g., NIST NVD)
    *   Security advisories from OpenResty and Nginx
    *   Blog posts, articles, and presentations on Lua security
    *   GitHub issues and discussions related to `lua-nginx-module`
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will consider various attacker scenarios and how they might attempt to exploit potential vulnerabilities.  This helps us identify less obvious attack vectors.
4.  **Best Practices Analysis:**  We will compare the application's implementation against established security best practices for using `lua-nginx-module` and writing secure Lua code.
5. **Fuzzing (Hypothetical):** While we won't perform actual fuzzing, we will describe how fuzzing could be used to identify potential injection vulnerabilities. Fuzzing involves sending malformed or unexpected input to the application and monitoring for crashes or unexpected behavior.

### 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path: "Exploit Lua Code Injection"

This section breaks down the attack path into specific scenarios and provides detailed analysis and mitigation strategies.

**4.1.  Direct Input Concatenation in `ngx.say` / `ngx.print` (and similar output functions)**

*   **Scenario:** The application uses user-supplied data directly in `ngx.say` or `ngx.print` without any sanitization.  For example:

    ```lua
    -- Vulnerable Code
    local user_input = ngx.var.arg_input  -- Get input from query parameter
    ngx.say("Hello, " .. user_input)
    ```

    An attacker could provide a payload like: `?input=';ngx.exit(ngx.OK);--`  This would result in the following Lua code being executed:

    ```lua
    ngx.say("Hello, ';ngx.exit(ngx.OK);--")
    ```
    Which would terminate the current request, but more importantly, demonstrates the ability to inject arbitrary Lua code.  A more malicious payload could read files, make network requests, or even execute shell commands (if `io.popen` or similar functions are available and not sandboxed).

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Never directly concatenate user input into output functions.**
    *   **Use a templating engine:**  Employ a secure templating engine (like `lua-resty-template`) that automatically escapes output.
    *   **Manual Escaping:** If you must manually construct output, use a dedicated escaping function to sanitize the input.  While Lua doesn't have a built-in HTML escaping function, you can easily create one or use a library.  Crucially, the escaping must be context-aware (e.g., HTML escaping, URL encoding, etc., depending on where the output is used).
    * **Strict whitelisting:** If the expected input is highly constrained (e.g., only alphanumeric characters), use a whitelist to allow only those characters and reject anything else.

**4.2.  Unsafe Use of `ngx.var`**

*   **Scenario:**  The application uses `ngx.var` to access request variables (headers, query parameters, etc.) and then uses these variables in a way that allows for code injection.  This is often a variation of the previous scenario, but it highlights the importance of treating *all* `ngx.var` values as potentially tainted.

    ```lua
    --Vulnerable
    local user_agent = ngx.var.http_user_agent
    if string.match(user_agent, "evil_pattern") then
        ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Potential attack detected!") -- Log the ENTIRE user agent
    end
    ```
    An attacker could inject Lua code into the User-Agent header. While logging might seem harmless, if the log file is later processed by another script (e.g., a log analyzer) that doesn't properly handle Lua code, this could lead to a secondary injection vulnerability.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Treat all `ngx.var` values as untrusted.**
    *   **Sanitize and validate `ngx.var` values before using them in any context that could lead to code execution.** This includes logging, database queries (if used within Lua), and any other operations that involve string concatenation or interpretation.
    *   **Use regular expressions carefully:** When using `string.match` or similar functions with `ngx.var` values, ensure that the regular expressions themselves are not vulnerable to injection (e.g., ReDoS - Regular Expression Denial of Service).  Avoid overly complex regular expressions and test them thoroughly.

**4.3.  Dynamic Code Generation**

*   **Scenario:** The application dynamically generates Lua code based on user input. This is extremely dangerous and should be avoided whenever possible.

    ```lua
    -- EXTREMELY VULNERABLE - DO NOT DO THIS
    local user_input = ngx.var.arg_code
    local func = loadstring("return function() " .. user_input .. " end")
    if func then
        local f = func()
        f()
    end
    ```
    This code allows an attacker to provide *any* Lua code as a query parameter, which will then be executed by the server.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Avoid dynamic code generation whenever possible.**  Rethink the application's design to eliminate the need for this.
    *   **If absolutely necessary, use a highly restricted sandbox:**  If dynamic code generation is unavoidable, use a robust sandboxing solution to limit the capabilities of the generated code.  This is a complex topic and requires careful consideration of the specific Lua environment and available sandboxing techniques.  `lua-resty-sandbox` might be a starting point, but it's crucial to understand its limitations.  Even with sandboxing, there's a high risk of vulnerabilities.
    * **Strict Input Validation and Whitelisting:** Implement extremely strict input validation and whitelisting to limit the attacker's control over the generated code.  This is a last resort and should only be used in conjunction with sandboxing.

**4.4.  Vulnerabilities in Custom Lua Modules or Libraries**

*   **Scenario:** The application uses custom Lua modules or third-party libraries that contain injection vulnerabilities.  This could be due to poor coding practices in the module or a previously unknown vulnerability.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Thoroughly vet all third-party Lua modules and libraries before using them.**  Review the code for potential vulnerabilities, check for known security issues, and consider the reputation and maintenance status of the library.
    *   **Keep all modules and libraries up to date.**  Regularly update to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Implement a dependency management system:**  Use a tool like LuaRocks to manage dependencies and ensure that you're using the correct versions of libraries.
    *   **Isolate critical code:** If possible, isolate critical code from less trusted modules to limit the impact of a potential vulnerability.

**4.5.  Misuse of `eval`-like Functions (Custom Implementations)**

* **Scenario:** While `lua-nginx-module` doesn't directly provide an `eval` function, developers might attempt to create their own, or use functions like `loadstring` in an unsafe manner (as shown in 4.3).

* **Mitigation:**
    * **Avoid creating custom `eval`-like functions.** There are almost always better and safer ways to achieve the desired functionality.
    * **If `loadstring` is absolutely necessary, treat it with extreme caution.**  Ensure that the input to `loadstring` is *never* derived from user input, even indirectly.  Use it only with trusted, hardcoded strings.

**4.6.  Injection via External Data Sources**

*   **Scenario:** The application retrieves data from an external source (e.g., a database, an API, a message queue) and uses this data in Lua code without proper sanitization.  If the external source is compromised, it could be used to inject malicious Lua code.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Treat data from external sources as untrusted, just like user input.**
    *   **Sanitize and validate data from external sources before using it in any context that could lead to code execution.**
    *   **Implement strong security measures for all external data sources.**  This includes proper authentication, authorization, and input validation on the data source itself.

**4.7. Uploaded Files**
* **Scenario:** If the application processes file content or metadata using Lua, an attacker might upload a file containing malicious Lua code disguised as a different file type.

* **Mitigation:**
    * **Validate file types rigorously:** Don't rely solely on file extensions. Use a library that can determine the actual file type based on its content (e.g., `lua-resty-mime`).
    * **Restrict file uploads:** Limit uploads to only necessary file types and sizes.
    * **Store uploaded files outside the web root:** Prevent direct execution of uploaded files by storing them in a directory that is not accessible via the web server.
    * **Sanitize file content and metadata:** If you need to process file content or metadata in Lua, sanitize it thoroughly before use, just like any other user input.

**4.8. WebSockets Messages**
* **Scenario:** If the application uses WebSockets, an attacker might send malicious Lua code within WebSocket messages.

* **Mitigation:**
    * **Treat WebSocket messages as untrusted input.**
    * **Sanitize and validate all data received via WebSockets before using it in any context that could lead to code execution.**
    * **Implement a robust protocol for WebSocket communication:** Define a clear message format and validate that all messages conform to this format.

### 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

Lua code injection is a serious vulnerability that can have severe consequences.  By following the mitigation strategies outlined above, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack.  The key takeaways are:

*   **Treat all user input (and data from external sources) as untrusted.**
*   **Never directly concatenate user input into Lua code or output functions.**
*   **Use a secure templating engine or manual escaping to sanitize output.**
*   **Avoid dynamic code generation whenever possible.**
*   **Thoroughly vet and update all third-party Lua modules and libraries.**
*   **Implement a robust input validation and sanitization strategy.**
*   **Regularly review and update the application's security posture.**

This deep analysis provides a strong foundation for securing the application against Lua code injection.  Continuous monitoring, security testing (including penetration testing and fuzzing), and staying informed about new vulnerabilities are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
