## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker Achieves RCE via lua-nginx-module](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_achieves_rce_via_lua-nginx-module.md)

- **Description:** This is the ultimate objective of the attacker â€“ gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Likelihood:** N/A (This is the goal, not a step)
- **Impact:** High (Complete server compromise)
- **Effort:** N/A
- **Skill Level:** N/A
- **Detection Difficulty:** N/A

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lua Code Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lua_code_injection.md)

- **Description:** The attacker successfully injects malicious Lua code into the application's execution context.

## Attack Tree Path: [==HIGH-RISK PATH== (under Exploit Lua Code Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/==high-risk_path==__under_exploit_lua_code_injection_.md)

- **Description:** This path represents a likely and impactful sequence of actions involving either unsafe evaluation of code or path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Eval](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_eval.md)

- **Description:** The application uses functions like `loadstring` (or similar) to execute Lua code that is constructed, at least in part, from user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (Direct RCE)
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Skill Level:** Medium
- **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Dynamic Code Generation (under Unsafe Eval)](./attack_tree_paths/dynamic_code_generation__under_unsafe_eval_.md)

- **Description:** The application dynamically generates Lua code based on user input. If this input is not carefully controlled, an attacker can inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal.md)

- **Description:** The application uses Lua to read or write files, and the file path is constructed using user-supplied input without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to access or modify files outside the intended directory.
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (File overwrite, data leak, potential RCE)
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Skill Level:** Medium
- **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Read/Write Files Outside Allowed Paths (under Path Traversal)](./attack_tree_paths/readwrite_files_outside_allowed_paths__under_path_traversal_.md)

- **Description:** The attacker successfully manipulates the file path to access or modify files outside of the intended directory, often using sequences like "../"

## Attack Tree Path: [==HIGH-RISK PATH== (under Path Traversal)](./attack_tree_paths/==high-risk_path==__under_path_traversal_.md)

- **Description:** This path represents the successful exploitation of a path traversal vulnerability, leading to unauthorized file access or modification.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Lua-Resty Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_lua-resty_library_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in commonly used `lua-resty-*` libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [==HIGH-RISK PATH== (under Abuse Lua-Resty Library Vulnerabilities)](./attack_tree_paths/==high-risk_path==__under_abuse_lua-resty_library_vulnerabilities_.md)

- **Description:** This path represents a likely and impactful sequence of actions involving either known CVEs or unsafe deserialization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Known CVE in Resty Lib](./attack_tree_paths/known_cve_in_resty_lib.md)

- **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of a `lua-resty-*` library that has a publicly known vulnerability (with a CVE identifier) that can be exploited.
- **Likelihood:** Low (Assuming patching is done)
- **Impact:** High (Depends on the CVE, but often RCE or other serious issues)
- **Effort:** Low (Exploits are often publicly available)
- **Skill Level:** Low (Often requires minimal skill)
- **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Vulnerability scanners can detect this)

## Attack Tree Path: [e.g., CVE-2021-24750 (lua-resty-lrucache) (under Known CVE in Resty Lib)](./attack_tree_paths/e_g___cve-2021-24750__lua-resty-lrucache___under_known_cve_in_resty_lib_.md)

- **Description:** A specific example of a known CVE in a popular library. While this particular CVE is for a DoS, it illustrates the concept.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_deserialization.md)

- **Description:** The application uses a library (e.g., `lua-cjson`) to deserialize data from an untrusted source. If the library has vulnerabilities related to unsafe object creation during deserialization, an attacker can potentially achieve RCE.
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (Potential RCE)
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Skill Level:** Medium
- **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Input (under Unsafe Deserialization)](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_input__under_unsafe_deserialization_.md)

- **Description:** The attacker provides specially crafted input to the deserialization function that triggers the vulnerability.
