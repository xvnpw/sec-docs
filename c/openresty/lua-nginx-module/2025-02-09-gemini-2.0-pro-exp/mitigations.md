# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for openresty/lua-nginx-module

## Mitigation Strategy: [LuaJIT Sandboxing and `lua-nginx-module` Directives](./mitigation_strategies/luajit_sandboxing_and__lua-nginx-module__directives.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Configure `lua-nginx-module` directives and LuaJIT settings to enforce a strict sandbox.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`lua_package_path` and `lua_package_cpath`:**
        *   Within your Nginx configuration (e.g., `nginx.conf`, or included files), set these directives to *absolute* paths pointing to a dedicated, *read-only* directory containing *only* the necessary, vetted Lua modules.  *Never* use relative paths.  Example:
            ```nginx
            lua_package_path '/opt/my_app/lua/?.lua;;';
            lua_package_cpath '/opt/my_app/lua/?.so;;';
            ```
        *   Ensure the directory (e.g., `/opt/my_app/lua/`) has appropriate permissions (read-only for the Nginx worker user).
    2.  **`lua_code_cache`:**
        *   During development: `lua_code_cache off;`
        *   In production: `lua_code_cache on;`  *Must* be combined with a deployment process that clears the Nginx cache on Lua code updates (e.g., `nginx -s reload`).
    3.  **Timeouts (Directives):**
        *   Use these `lua-nginx-module` directives to set timeouts for various operations:
            *   `lua_socket_connect_timeout`:  Timeout for establishing socket connections.
            *   `lua_socket_send_timeout`: Timeout for sending data over a socket.
            *   `lua_socket_read_timeout`: Timeout for receiving data over a socket.
            *   `lua_socket_keepalive_timeout`: Timeout for idle keep-alive connections.
            *   `lua_regex_match_limit`:  Limit the number of steps the regex engine can take.
            *   `lua_regex_cache_max_entries`: Limit the size of the regex cache.
        *   Set reasonable values for these timeouts (e.g., a few seconds) based on your application's needs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Resource Access (Medium to High Severity):**  Restricting `package.path` and `package.cpath` prevents Lua scripts from loading unauthorized modules, which could be used to access system resources or execute malicious code.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):**  Timeouts prevent Lua scripts from hanging indefinitely on network operations or regular expressions, which could lead to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Code Injection (via cached code) (High Severity):**  Proper `lua_code_cache` management prevents attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in older, cached versions of Lua code.
    *   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (Medium Severity):** `lua_regex_match_limit` mitigates ReDoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Resource Access:**  Significantly reduces the risk of Lua scripts accessing unauthorized resources.
    *   **DoS:**  Reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by long-running or hanging Lua scripts.
    *   **Code Injection:** Eliminates the risk of exploiting cached, vulnerable code.
    *   **ReDoS:** Prevents attackers from crafting regular expressions that cause excessive CPU usage.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Likely Partially Implemented:**  Some projects may have basic timeout settings.  `lua_code_cache` is often set to `on` in production.
    *   **Location:**  Check `nginx.conf` and any included configuration files.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Likely Missing:**  Strict control of `lua_package_path` and `lua_package_cpath`, comprehensive timeout configurations (for all relevant directives), and a robust cache-clearing mechanism on code updates are often overlooked.
    *   **Location:**  Review the Nginx configuration files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled `ffi` Usage (Within Lua Code, Managed by `lua-nginx-module`)](./mitigation_strategies/controlled__ffi__usage__within_lua_code__managed_by__lua-nginx-module__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Minimize and strictly control the use of LuaJIT's `ffi` library *within* Lua code executed by `lua-nginx-module`.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize `ffi`:**  Avoid `ffi` if possible.  Use Lua libraries or `lua-resty-*` libraries instead.
    2.  **Strict Input Validation (for `ffi` calls):**  If `ffi` *must* be used, implement extremely rigorous input validation *within the Lua code* for *any* data passed to C functions.  This is *before* the data reaches the C code.
        *   Use Lua's type checking (`type()`) and length constraints to ensure data validity.
    3.  **Code Review (Focused on `ffi`):**  Any Lua code using `ffi` should be subject to intense code review, with a focus on the data passed to C functions and the potential for vulnerabilities in the C code.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical Severity):**  Vulnerabilities in C functions called via `ffi` (e.g., buffer overflows) can lead to arbitrary code execution.  Lua-side input validation helps prevent these.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):**  If the C function has access to higher privileges, a vulnerability could be exploited to gain those privileges.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Minimizing `ffi` and implementing strict Lua-side input validation significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Reduces the potential for attackers to gain higher privileges.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Likely Partially Implemented:**  Some projects may avoid `ffi` altogether.  Others may use it with some basic input validation.
    *   **Location:**  Search the Lua code for `ffi.cdef` and `ffi.new`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Likely Missing:**  Comprehensive, Lua-side input validation specifically tailored to the C functions being called is often missing.
    *   **Location:**  Review all instances of `ffi` usage in the Lua code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe External Interaction Libraries (Using `lua-resty-*` within Lua)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_external_interaction_libraries__using__lua-resty-__within_lua_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Utilize the `lua-resty-*` libraries provided for `lua-nginx-module` for safe interaction with external resources.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer `lua-resty-*` Libraries:**  Instead of using generic Lua libraries or attempting to roll your own solutions, use the `lua-resty-*` libraries (e.g., `lua-resty-http`, `lua-resty-mysql`, `lua-resty-redis`, `lua-resty-memcached`) for interacting with external services. These libraries are specifically designed for use within `lua-nginx-module` and are generally more secure and performant.
    2.  **Use Parameterized Queries:** When interacting with databases (e.g., using `lua-resty-mysql`), always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  The `lua-resty-*` libraries typically provide mechanisms for this.
    3. **Keep Libraries Updated:** Ensure that you are using the latest versions of the `lua-resty-*` libraries to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Using parameterized queries in `lua-resty-mysql` (or similar libraries) prevents SQL injection.
    *   **Other Injection Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Using safe libraries for other external services (HTTP, Redis, etc.) prevents various injection vulnerabilities specific to those services.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** `lua-resty-*` libraries often have built-in timeout and connection pooling mechanisms, which can help prevent DoS attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk of various injection attacks by using safe, purpose-built libraries.
    *   **DoS:** Improves resilience to DoS attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Likely Partially Implemented:** Many projects will use *some* `lua-resty-*` libraries.
    *   **Location:** Check the Lua code for imports and usage of `lua-resty-*` libraries.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Likely Missing:** Consistent use of `lua-resty-*` libraries for *all* external interactions, and ensuring they are kept up-to-date, are often areas for improvement.
    *   **Location:** Review all Lua code that interacts with external resources.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Logging with `ngx.log` (Within Lua Code)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_logging_with__ngx_log___within_lua_code_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Use `ngx.log` within your Lua code to securely log security-relevant events to the Nginx error log.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `ngx.log`:** Within your Lua scripts, use the `ngx.log` function to write log messages.  This ensures that log entries are properly handled by Nginx's logging infrastructure. Example:
        ```lua
        ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Error: Invalid input received from ", ngx.var.remote_addr)
        ```
    2.  **Log Security-Relevant Events:** Log errors, unexpected behavior, access to sensitive resources, input validation failures, and any other events that could indicate a security issue.
    3.  **Include Context:** Include relevant context in log messages, such as user IDs, request IDs, timestamps, and IP addresses.
    4.  **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Do *not* log sensitive data, such as passwords, API keys, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly in the logs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All Attacks (Variable Severity):**  Logging provides visibility into attacks, allowing for detection and response. It doesn't *prevent* attacks, but it's crucial for incident response.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Detection and Response:** Improves your ability to detect and respond to attacks quickly.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Likely Partially Implemented:** Some projects may use `ngx.log` for basic error logging.
    *   **Location:** Check the Lua code for `ngx.log` calls.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Likely Missing:** Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events, including sufficient context, and avoiding logging sensitive data are often areas for improvement.
    *   **Location:** Review all Lua code and ensure that `ngx.log` is used appropriately.
