* **Inject malicious Lua code through HTTP headers/body/query parameters (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * Utilizing HTTP requests to deliver malicious Lua code to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage `loadstring` or similar functions with user-controlled input **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_`loadstring`_or_similar_functions_with_user-controlled_input_(critical_node,_high-risk_path).md)

    * **Leverage `loadstring` or similar functions with user-controlled input (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        * Directly using functions like `loadstring` or similar with user-provided data allows the execution of arbitrary Lua code supplied by the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit insecure use of `eval` or similar constructs **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_use_of_`eval`_or_similar_constructs_(critical_node,_high-risk_path).md)

    * **Exploit insecure use of `eval` or similar constructs (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *  Similar to `loadstring`, insecure use of `eval` or related constructs can execute attacker-supplied Lua code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors in Lua Code **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_in_lua_code_(high-risk_path).md)

* **Logic Errors in Lua Code (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * Flaws in the application's Lua logic that can be exploited to bypass security measures or gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/authenticationauthorization_bypass_(high-risk_path).md)

    * **Authentication/Authorization Bypass (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Interaction Between Lua and Nginx](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_interaction_between_lua_and_nginx.md)

* **Exploit Interaction Between Lua and Nginx:**
    * Vulnerabilities arising from the way Lua code interacts with the underlying Nginx web server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse `ngx.location.capture` and Similar Directives **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_`ngx.location.capture`_and_similar_directives_(high-risk_path).md)

    * **Abuse `ngx.location.capture` and Similar Directives (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

        * **Internal Request Forgery (via `ngx.location.capture`) (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            * Tricking the application into making internal requests to sensitive endpoints with attacker-controlled parameters, potentially bypassing authentication or authorization checks meant for external requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Handling within Lua **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_handling_within_lua_(high-risk_path).md)

* **Exploit Data Handling within Lua (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * Vulnerabilities related to how the Lua code processes and manages data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Handling of Sensitive Data **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_handling_of_sensitive_data_(high-risk_path).md)

    * **Insecure Handling of Sensitive Data (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *  Improper practices for managing sensitive information within the Lua code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Storing secrets in plain text within Lua code or Nginx variables accessed by Lua **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/storing_secrets_in_plain_text_within_lua_code_or_nginx_variables_accessed_by_lua_(critical_node,_high-risk_path).md)
