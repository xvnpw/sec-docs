## Deep Analysis: Internal Request Forgery (via `ngx.location.capture`) - HIGH-RISK PATH

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Internal Request Forgery (via `ngx.location.capture`)" attack path within an application utilizing the `lua-nginx-module`. This is identified as a **HIGH-RISK PATH** due to its potential for significant security breaches and unauthorized access.

**1. Understanding the Vulnerability: Internal Request Forgery (IRF)**

Internal Request Forgery (IRF), also sometimes referred to as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in an internal context, occurs when an attacker can induce the application server to make requests to internal resources or endpoints. This is particularly dangerous when these internal endpoints are not designed to be accessed directly from external sources and might lack the same level of security controls (authentication, authorization) as public-facing endpoints.

**2. The Role of `ngx.location.capture`**

The `ngx.location.capture` function in the `lua-nginx-module` allows Lua code running within the Nginx context to make internal subrequests. This is a powerful feature used for various purposes, including:

* **Authentication and Authorization:**  Delegating authentication checks to a dedicated internal service.
* **Data Aggregation:**  Fetching data from multiple internal sources and combining it into a single response.
* **Internal Redirection:**  Routing requests internally based on specific logic.
* **Service Discovery:**  Querying internal services for their availability or configuration.

While powerful, `ngx.location.capture` introduces a potential vulnerability if the destination and parameters of these internal requests are influenced by user-controlled input.

**3. Deconstructing the Attack Path: Tricking the Application**

The core of this attack lies in manipulating the application logic to construct an internal request via `ngx.location.capture` with attacker-controlled parameters. This can be achieved through various means:

* **Direct Parameter Manipulation:** If the target URI, query parameters, headers, or request body used in `ngx.location.capture` are directly derived from user input without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker can inject malicious values.
* **Indirect Parameter Manipulation:**  The attacker might influence the application's state or data in a way that indirectly affects the parameters used in the `ngx.location.capture` call. This could involve manipulating database entries, session data, or other application logic.

**4. Potential Attack Vectors and Scenarios**

Here are specific examples of how an attacker might exploit this vulnerability:

* **Accessing Internal Admin Panels:** An attacker could manipulate the `uri` parameter to target internal administration panels or configuration endpoints that are not publicly accessible. For example, if the application uses `ngx.location.capture("/internal/admin")` based on some user input, the attacker might be able to force a request to this sensitive location.
* **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization:**  Internal endpoints might rely on the fact that requests originate from within the network and might have weaker authentication mechanisms. By forcing an internal request, the attacker could bypass external authentication checks. For instance, an internal service might trust requests originating from the main application server, but not external requests.
* **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker could force the application to make requests to internal databases or services containing sensitive information and then retrieve the response through the `ngx.location.capture` mechanism.
* **Internal Service Abuse:**  An attacker could leverage internal services for unintended purposes. For example, if an internal service allows sending emails, the attacker might be able to use the application to send arbitrary emails.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By forcing the application to make numerous internal requests to resource-intensive endpoints, the attacker could potentially overload internal services and cause a denial of service.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  If an internal endpoint allows modifying user permissions or roles, an attacker could potentially escalate their privileges within the application.

**5. Code Examples (Illustrative - Vulnerable)**

While specific code depends on the application's logic, here are illustrative examples of vulnerable code patterns:

```lua
-- Vulnerable example: Direct use of user input in uri
local user_provided_path = ngx.var.arg_internal_path
local res = ngx.location.capture("/internal/" .. user_provided_path)

-- Vulnerable example: User input influencing query parameters
local user_id = ngx.var.arg_id
local res = ngx.location.capture("/internal/user_data", { args = { id = user_id } })

-- Vulnerable example: User input in headers
local custom_header = ngx.var.http_custom_header
local res = ngx.location.capture("/internal/debug", { headers = { ["X-Custom-Info"] = custom_header } })
```

**6. Impact Assessment (HIGH-RISK)**

This attack path is considered **HIGH-RISK** due to the following potential impacts:

* **Confidentiality Breach:** Accessing sensitive data stored in internal systems.
* **Integrity Violation:** Modifying data or configurations within internal systems.
* **Availability Disruption:** Causing denial of service by overloading internal resources.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of trust due to security breaches.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to meet regulatory requirements for data protection.

**7. Mitigation Strategies**

To mitigate the risk of Internal Request Forgery via `ngx.location.capture`, the development team should implement the following strategies:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before using it to construct the `uri`, `args`, `method`, `body`, or `headers` parameters of `ngx.location.capture`. Use whitelisting approaches to ensure only expected values are used.
* **Least Privilege Principle for Internal Endpoints:**  Restrict access to internal endpoints based on the principle of least privilege. Ensure that only authorized services and components can access specific internal resources.
* **Explicit Allowlisting of Target URIs:**  Instead of dynamically constructing URIs based on user input, maintain a predefined list of allowed internal locations. Map user actions or inputs to specific, safe internal endpoints.
* **Strong Authentication and Authorization for Internal Endpoints:**  Even for internal requests, enforce authentication and authorization mechanisms to verify the identity and permissions of the requesting entity. Don't rely solely on the fact that the request originates internally.
* **Parameterization of Internal Requests:**  When constructing internal requests, use parameterized queries or similar techniques to avoid direct injection of user-controlled data into the request parameters.
* **Security Headers for Internal Responses:**  Even for internal responses, consider using security headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`, and `X-Content-Type-Options` to prevent potential cross-site scripting (XSS) or other vulnerabilities if the internal responses are ever inadvertently exposed.
* **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting for internal requests to prevent abuse and potential denial-of-service attacks.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application's usage of `ngx.location.capture` and other internal request mechanisms.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**  Educate developers on the risks associated with internal request forgery and promote secure coding practices.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of internal requests made via `ngx.location.capture`. This can help detect suspicious activity and identify potential attacks.

**8. Conclusion**

The "Internal Request Forgery (via `ngx.location.capture`)" attack path represents a significant security risk for applications using the `lua-nginx-module`. By carefully analyzing the potential attack vectors and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation. Prioritizing input validation, least privilege, and explicit allowlisting for internal requests are crucial steps in securing the application against this type of vulnerability. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
