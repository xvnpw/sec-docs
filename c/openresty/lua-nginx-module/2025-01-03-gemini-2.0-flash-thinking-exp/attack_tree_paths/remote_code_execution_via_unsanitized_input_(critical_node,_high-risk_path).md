## Deep Analysis: Remote Code Execution via Unsanitized Input in OpenResty/Lua-Nginx

This analysis focuses on the attack tree path "Remote Code Execution via unsanitized input" within an application leveraging the OpenResty/lua-nginx-module. This path is flagged as **CRITICAL** and **HIGH-RISK** due to its potential for complete system compromise.

**Understanding the Threat:**

The core vulnerability lies in the ability of an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary Lua code within the Nginx worker process. OpenResty's power comes from its ability to embed Lua directly into the request processing lifecycle. However, this power becomes a significant risk if user-controlled input is not rigorously sanitized before being used in Lua code that can be evaluated or executed.

**Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

* **Entry Point:** The attacker exploits a point in the application where user-provided input is directly or indirectly used within Lua code without proper validation or sanitization. This could be:
    * **Directly in `ngx.eval()` or `loadstring()`:**  If user input is directly passed to these functions, it will be interpreted and executed as Lua code.
    * **Within `content_by_lua_block`, `access_by_lua_block`, etc.:**  If user input is concatenated into strings that are later evaluated or used in functions that can execute code.
    * **Through template engines:** If the application uses a Lua-based template engine and user input is inserted without proper escaping, it might be interpreted as code during template rendering.
    * **In configuration files loaded dynamically:** If user input influences the content of configuration files that are subsequently loaded and processed by Lua.
    * **Through database interactions:**  While less direct, if user input is used to construct database queries that return code or data that is then evaluated by Lua.

* **Mechanism of Exploitation:** The attacker crafts malicious input containing Lua code designed to perform actions such as:
    * **Executing system commands:** Using Lua's `os.execute()` or `io.popen()`.
    * **Reading or writing arbitrary files:** Accessing sensitive data or modifying system configurations.
    * **Establishing reverse shells:** Gaining persistent access to the server.
    * **Downloading and executing further payloads:**  Expanding the attack and potentially compromising other systems.
    * **Manipulating application logic:**  Bypassing security checks or altering intended functionality.

* **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have catastrophic consequences:
    * **Complete Server Compromise:** The attacker gains full control of the Nginx worker process, potentially leading to control of the entire server.
    * **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive application data, user credentials, and other confidential information.
    * **Service Disruption (DoS):**  Crashing the Nginx process or overloading the server.
    * **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust and negative impact on the organization's image.
    * **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other internal systems.

**Specific Vulnerabilities in OpenResty/Lua-Nginx Context:**

* **Direct use of `ngx.eval()` with user input:** This is the most blatant and dangerous scenario. If user input is directly passed to `ngx.eval()`, it will be executed as Lua code within the Nginx context.
    ```lua
    -- Vulnerable example:
    local user_input = ngx.var.arg_command
    ngx.eval(user_input) -- If user_input is 'os.execute("rm -rf /")' - disaster!
    ```

* **Concatenating user input into Lua code strings:**  Building Lua code dynamically with user input without proper escaping can lead to injection.
    ```lua
    -- Vulnerable example:
    local filename = "/tmp/" .. ngx.var.arg_filename
    local file = io.open(filename, "r") -- Attacker can inject "../../../etc/passwd"
    ```

* **Unsafe use of template engines:** If the template engine doesn't properly escape user input before rendering, malicious code can be injected.
    ```lua
    -- Vulnerable example (assuming a custom template engine):
    local template = "<h1>Welcome, {{username}}</h1>"
    local username = ngx.var.arg_username
    local rendered_html = render_template(template, { username = username })
    ngx.say(rendered_html) -- Attacker can inject '<script>...</script>'
    ```

* **Dynamic loading of modules or configuration based on user input:** If user input dictates which Lua modules are loaded or influences the content of loaded configuration files, attackers can inject malicious code.

**Mitigation Strategies (Crucial for Development Team):**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization (Primary Defense):**
    * **Whitelist Approach:** Define what constitutes valid input and reject anything that doesn't conform. This is the most secure approach.
    * **Blacklist Approach (Less Recommended):**  Identify and block known malicious patterns. This is less effective as attackers can find new ways to bypass filters.
    * **Escaping and Encoding:**  Properly escape or encode user input before using it in Lua code or displaying it in web pages. For example, escape HTML entities, SQL injection characters, and Lua metacharacters.
    * **Use Secure Libraries:**  Leverage well-vetted libraries for tasks like parsing JSON or XML, which often have built-in sanitization mechanisms.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Avoid running Nginx worker processes as root.** This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they gain code execution.
    * **Restrict file system access for the Nginx user.**  Limit the directories the Nginx process can read and write to.

* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Avoid using `ngx.eval()` or `loadstring()` with user-controlled input.**  If absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict validation and sandboxing.
    * **Use parameterized queries for database interactions.** This prevents SQL injection, which can sometimes be leveraged for code execution in conjunction with Lua.
    * **Regularly review and audit Lua code for potential vulnerabilities.**  Employ static analysis tools and manual code reviews.

* **Security Headers:** Implement security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can sometimes be a precursor to RCE.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to detect and block malicious requests before they reach the application. Configure the WAF with rules specific to Lua injection attempts.

* **Regular Security Updates:** Keep OpenResty, LuaJIT, and all dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.

* **Monitoring and Logging:**
    * **Log all user input and application activity.** This helps in identifying and investigating potential attacks.
    * **Monitor for unusual process activity or network connections originating from the Nginx worker process.**

**Detection Strategies for this Attack Path:**

* **Suspicious Lua Function Calls in Logs:** Look for calls to `os.execute()`, `io.popen()`, `require()`, `dofile()`, `loadstring()`, or `ngx.eval()` where the arguments appear to be user-controlled or contain unusual characters.
* **Unexpected File System Access:** Monitor for the Nginx worker process accessing files or directories it shouldn't be.
* **Outbound Network Connections:** Detect unusual outbound connections from the server, especially to unknown or suspicious IP addresses.
* **Increased CPU or Memory Usage:**  Malicious code execution can sometimes lead to increased resource consumption.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Alerts:** The WAF should be configured to detect and alert on attempts to inject Lua code.
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Network-based and host-based IDS can detect malicious activity associated with RCE attempts.

**Example Scenario and Remediation:**

Let's say a web application allows users to specify a sorting order for a list of items via a URL parameter `sort_by`. The Lua code might look like this:

```lua
-- Vulnerable code:
local sort_by = ngx.var.arg_sort_by
local query = "SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY " .. sort_by
-- Execute the query (assuming a database interaction)
```

An attacker could inject malicious SQL or even Lua code if this `sort_by` parameter is not sanitized. For example, `sort_by=id; os.execute('rm -rf /tmp/*') --` could lead to code execution.

**Remediation:**

1. **Input Validation:**  Implement a whitelist of allowed sorting fields (e.g., "id", "name", "price"). Reject any input that doesn't match this whitelist.
2. **Parameterized Queries:**  If the sorting is done in the database, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
3. **Avoid Direct String Concatenation:**  Instead of directly concatenating user input into code strings, use safer methods or avoid dynamic code generation altogether if possible.

**Conclusion:**

Remote Code Execution via unsanitized input is a critical vulnerability in applications using OpenResty/lua-nginx-module. The tight integration of Lua within the request processing pipeline makes this attack path particularly dangerous. A multi-layered defense strategy focusing on robust input validation, secure coding practices, and continuous monitoring is essential to mitigate this risk. The development team must prioritize secure coding principles and understand the potential dangers of directly using user input in Lua code. Regular security assessments and penetration testing are crucial to identify and address such vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
