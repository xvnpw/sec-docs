## Deep Analysis: Compromise Application via lua-nginx-module

As a cybersecurity expert working with your development team, let's delve into a deep analysis of the attack tree path: **Compromise Application via lua-nginx-module**.

This single node, marked as critical, represents a broad category of attacks that leverage the `lua-nginx-module` to gain unauthorized access or control over the application. While it's a high-level goal, understanding the potential attack vectors within this node is crucial for effective security.

**Understanding the Context: lua-nginx-module**

The `lua-nginx-module` embeds the Lua scripting language into the Nginx web server. This allows developers to extend Nginx's functionality, handle complex logic, and interact with backend services directly within the Nginx configuration. While powerful, this integration introduces potential security risks if not implemented carefully.

**Breaking Down the "Compromise Application via lua-nginx-module" Node:**

This critical node can be further decomposed into various attack vectors. Here's a detailed analysis of potential methods an attacker might employ:

**1. Lua Code Injection:**

* **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how user input or external data is processed within the Lua scripts executed by Nginx. By injecting malicious Lua code, they can manipulate the application's behavior.
* **Attack Scenarios:**
    * **Unsanitized User Input:** If Lua scripts directly use user-provided data (e.g., from request parameters, headers, cookies) in functions like `loadstring` or `dofile` without proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary Lua code.
    * **Database Queries:** If Lua scripts construct database queries dynamically using unsanitized input, SQL injection vulnerabilities can be exploited through the Lua layer.
    * **External Data Sources:** If Lua scripts process data from untrusted external sources (e.g., APIs, files) without validation, malicious code embedded within that data can be executed.
* **Impact:**
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially gaining full control.
    * **Data Breach:** Access and exfiltration of sensitive application data.
    * **Application Takeover:** Modification of application logic, leading to complete compromise.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Execution of resource-intensive Lua code to overload the server.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided and external data before using it in Lua scripts.
    * **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases from Lua.
    * **Avoid `loadstring` and `dofile` with Untrusted Input:**  Minimize the use of these functions with external data. If necessary, implement robust sandboxing or code analysis.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the Nginx worker process and the Lua scripts have the minimum necessary permissions.

**2. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**

* **Description:** Attackers leverage Lua's ability to make outbound HTTP requests (e.g., using `ngx.location.capture`, `ngx.socket.tcp`) to access internal resources or external services that are not directly accessible from the outside.
* **Attack Scenarios:**
    * **Accessing Internal APIs:** Bypassing firewall rules to access internal APIs or services.
    * **Scanning Internal Networks:** Probing internal network infrastructure for vulnerabilities.
    * **Interacting with Cloud Metadata APIs:** Potentially gaining access to cloud provider credentials.
    * **Exploiting Vulnerable External Services:** Using the application as a proxy to attack other internet-facing services.
* **Impact:**
    * **Unauthorized Access to Internal Resources:** Gaining access to sensitive internal systems and data.
    * **Data Breach:** Exfiltration of data from internal systems.
    * **Lateral Movement:** Using the compromised application as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Restrict Outbound Requests:** Implement strict whitelisting of allowed destination URLs or IP ranges for outbound requests from Lua scripts.
    * **Input Validation for URLs:** Validate and sanitize URLs used in outbound requests to prevent manipulation.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Outbound Request Functionality:** If the application doesn't require outbound requests, disable the relevant Lua functions or modules.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Nginx server and the application within a segmented network.

**3. File System Access Vulnerabilities:**

* **Description:** Attackers exploit Lua's ability to interact with the file system (e.g., reading configuration files, writing temporary files) to gain access to sensitive information or manipulate application behavior.
* **Attack Scenarios:**
    * **Reading Sensitive Configuration Files:** Accessing configuration files containing database credentials, API keys, etc.
    * **Writing Malicious Files:** Creating or modifying files on the server to inject malicious code or overwrite critical application components.
    * **Path Traversal:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in file path handling to access files outside the intended directory.
* **Impact:**
    * **Credential Theft:** Obtaining sensitive credentials stored in configuration files.
    * **Remote Code Execution:** Writing malicious scripts to the file system and then executing them.
    * **Application Tampering:** Modifying application code or data.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the Nginx worker process and Lua scripts the minimum necessary file system permissions.
    * **Secure File Path Handling:** Use secure methods for constructing file paths and avoid using user-provided input directly in file paths.
    * **Regular File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement tools to detect unauthorized modifications to critical application files.

**4. Denial of Service (DoS) via Lua:**

* **Description:** Attackers craft requests that cause the Lua scripts to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network), leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
* **Attack Scenarios:**
    * **Resource-Intensive Lua Code:** Triggering execution of poorly written or intentionally malicious Lua code that consumes excessive resources.
    * **Infinite Loops or Recursion:** Crafting input that causes Lua scripts to enter infinite loops or recursive calls.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a Lua script used to process user profiles. If the script directly uses user-provided data from a URL parameter to construct a file path for retrieving a profile picture without proper sanitization:

```lua
local filename = ngx.var.arg_profile_pic
local file = io.open("/var/www/app/uploads/" .. filename, "r")
```

An attacker could craft a URL like `?profile_pic=../../../../etc/passwd` to potentially read the server's password file, demonstrating a **file system access vulnerability** due to **lack of input validation**.
