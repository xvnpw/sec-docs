* **Attack Surface: Lua Code Injection**
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious Lua code that is then executed by the Nginx server.
    * **How lua-nginx-module Contributes:** The module allows embedding and executing Lua code within the Nginx request processing lifecycle. If user input is not properly sanitized before being used in `ngx.eval()` or similar functions, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Example:** A web application takes a filename as input and uses it in a Lua script to read the file content:
        ```lua
        -- Vulnerable code
        local filename = ngx.var.input_filename
        local f = io.open(filename, "r")
        if f then
            local content = f:read("*all")
            f:close()
            ngx.say(content)
        end
        ```
        An attacker could provide an input like `"; os.execute('rm -rf /');"` which, when evaluated, would execute a dangerous command on the server.
    * **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Never use `ngx.eval()` with unsanitized user input.
        * Avoid dynamically generating Lua code based on user input.
        * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases from Lua.
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data.
        * Principle of least privilege: Run Nginx worker processes with minimal necessary permissions.

* **Attack Surface: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Lua**
    * **Description:** An attacker can induce the server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.
    * **How lua-nginx-module Contributes:** Lua's networking capabilities (e.g., `ngx.socket.tcp()`, `resty.http`) allow making outbound requests. If the target URL or parameters are influenced by user input without proper validation, SSRF vulnerabilities can arise.
    * **Example:** A Lua script fetches content from a URL provided by the user:
        ```lua
        -- Vulnerable code
        local url = ngx.var.target_url
        local http = require "resty.http"
        local res, err = http.request_uri(url)
        if res then
            ngx.say(res.body)
        end
        ```
        An attacker could provide an internal IP address or a sensitive internal service URL as `target_url`, potentially exposing internal resources.
    * **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided URLs.
        * Implement allow-lists for allowed destination hosts or IP ranges.
        * Avoid using user input directly in URL construction for outbound requests.
        * Consider using a dedicated library or function for making external requests with built-in security features.
        * Disable or restrict access to Lua networking libraries if not strictly necessary.

* **Attack Surface: Insecure Interaction with External Systems**
    * **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from how Lua scripts interact with external databases, APIs, or other services.
    * **How lua-nginx-module Contributes:** Lua's ability to interact with external systems (e.g., using `ngx.socket.tcp()`, `resty.http`, database connectors) introduces new attack vectors if these interactions are not secured.
    * **Example:** SQL injection vulnerability when constructing SQL queries in Lua:
        ```lua
        -- Vulnerable code
        local username = ngx.var.input_username
        local query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" .. username .. "'"
        local db, err = db:query(query)
        ```
    * **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to external systems, compromise of other services.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.
        * Validate and sanitize data before sending it to external APIs.
        * Implement proper authentication and authorization when interacting with external services.
        * Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in Lua code; use secure configuration management.
        * Follow security best practices for the specific external systems being interacted with.
