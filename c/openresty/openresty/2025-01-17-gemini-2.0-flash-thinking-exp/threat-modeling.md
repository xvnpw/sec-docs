# Threat Model Analysis for openresty/openresty

## Threat: [Lua Code Injection](./threats/lua_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits insufficient input sanitization when user-supplied data is incorporated into Lua scripts. They inject malicious Lua code that gets executed by the OpenResty worker process.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain full control, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.
*   **Affected Component:** LuaJIT runtime, specifically when using functions like `eval`, `loadstring`, or directly embedding user input in Lua code.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never directly embed user input into Lua code.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases from Lua.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within Lua scripts, escaping special characters and validating data types.
    *   Consider using templating engines that automatically handle escaping.

## Threat: [Lua Sandbox Escape](./threats/lua_sandbox_escape.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker finds a vulnerability in the LuaJIT sandbox implementation or exploits FFI (Foreign Function Interface) calls to break out of the restricted Lua environment and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the OpenResty worker process.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute any command, access any data, or install malware.
*   **Affected Component:** LuaJIT runtime, FFI library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep OpenResty and LuaJIT updated to the latest stable versions, which include security patches.
    *   Be extremely cautious when using FFI calls and thoroughly vet any external libraries or code accessed through FFI.
    *   Minimize the use of FFI if possible.
    *   Consider using security auditing tools to identify potential sandbox escape vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Lua Script](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_lua_script.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts or injects a Lua script that consumes excessive CPU, memory, or network resources, leading to a denial of service. This could involve infinite loops, excessive memory allocation, or flooding external services.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation for other services on the same server, potential server crash.
*   **Affected Component:** LuaJIT runtime, specifically the execution of Lua scripts.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement resource limits within Lua scripts (e.g., timeouts for operations, limits on memory allocation).
    *   Thoroughly test Lua scripts for performance and resource usage under various load conditions.
    *   Monitor resource consumption of OpenResty worker processes.
    *   Implement rate limiting or request throttling to prevent abuse.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in OpenResty Modules](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_openresty_modules.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a specific OpenResty module (e.g., `ngx_http_lua_module`, `lua-resty-*` libraries). This could involve sending specially crafted requests or data to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, or bypassing security controls.
*   **Affected Component:** Specific OpenResty modules (e.g., `ngx_http_lua_module`, `lua-resty-redis`, `lua-resty-mysql`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep OpenResty and all its modules updated to the latest stable versions.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for OpenResty and its modules.
    *   Carefully review the documentation and security considerations for each module being used.
    *   Avoid using modules with known security vulnerabilities or those that are no longer maintained.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Lua Scripts or Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_lua_scripts_or_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or internal paths, is inadvertently hardcoded or logged within Lua scripts or Nginx configuration files. An attacker gaining access to these files can retrieve this information.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of other systems or data, unauthorized access to internal resources.
*   **Affected Component:** Lua scripts, Nginx configuration files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in code or configuration files.
    *   Use environment variables or secure configuration management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to store and manage secrets.
    *   Implement secure logging practices, ensuring sensitive information is not logged.
    *   Restrict access to configuration files and Lua scripts.
