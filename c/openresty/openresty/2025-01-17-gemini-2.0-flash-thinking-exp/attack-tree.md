## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH - CRITICAL NODE Exploit Nginx Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_-_critical_node_exploit_nginx_core_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Goal:** To compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying Nginx core.
* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Trigger Known Nginx Vulnerability:** This involves identifying a known vulnerability in the specific Nginx version used by OpenResty and crafting a malicious request to trigger that vulnerability.
        * **CRITICAL NODE: Craft request to trigger vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, integer overflow):** This is the crucial step where the attacker leverages their knowledge of the vulnerability to send a specially crafted request that exploits the flaw. Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE Exploit LuaJIT Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_luajit_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Goal:** To compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities within the LuaJIT virtual machine.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Trigger LuaJIT VM Vulnerability:** This involves identifying a vulnerability in the LuaJIT implementation and crafting specific Lua code or input that triggers this vulnerability.
        * **CRITICAL NODE: Craft Lua code or input to trigger VM vulnerability (e.g., JIT spraying, type confusion):** This requires a deep understanding of LuaJIT internals to craft code that exploits weaknesses in the JIT compilation process, potentially leading to RCE.
    * **Exploit FFI (Foreign Function Interface) Misuse:** This involves exploiting insecure usage of LuaJIT's Foreign Function Interface, which allows calling external C functions.
        * **CRITICAL NODE: Provide malicious input to FFI call to execute arbitrary code or access restricted resources:** If Lua code passes unsanitized or attacker-controlled input to an FFI call, it can lead to vulnerabilities like buffer overflows in the called C function, potentially resulting in RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH - CRITICAL NODE Exploit OpenResty Specific Modules/APIs](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_-_critical_node_exploit_openresty_specific_modulesapis.md)

* **Goal:** To compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities or misuse of OpenResty's specific modules and APIs.
* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Exploit `resty.*` Libraries Vulnerabilities:** This involves identifying and exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party Lua libraries (e.g., `resty.http`, `resty.redis`) used by the application.
        * **HIGH RISK PATH - CRITICAL NODE: Leverage known vulnerabilities in these libraries (e.g., HTTP request smuggling in `resty.http`):** If the application uses a vulnerable version of a `resty.*` library, an attacker can leverage publicly known exploits to compromise the application. For example, a vulnerable `resty.http` library might be susceptible to HTTP request smuggling attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH - CRITICAL NODE Exploit Server-Side Lua Injection (SSLI)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_-_critical_node_exploit_server-side_lua_injection__ssli_.md)

* **Goal:** To gain arbitrary code execution on the server by injecting malicious Lua code.
* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Identify Input Points Processed by Lua:** This involves analyzing the application's Lua code to find where user-provided input is processed.
        * **CRITICAL NODE: Identify input parameters that are directly used in Lua code execution (e.g., `eval()`, `loadstring()`):** This is a critical vulnerability point where user input is directly used in functions that execute Lua code dynamically.
    * **CRITICAL NODE: Craft Malicious Lua Payload:** Once a vulnerable input point is identified, the attacker crafts a malicious Lua payload.
        * **Inject Lua code into vulnerable input parameters:** The attacker injects the malicious Lua code into the identified input parameter.
        * **Execute arbitrary Lua code on the server, potentially leading to RCE:** If the injection is successful, the server will execute the attacker's Lua code, granting them significant control over the application and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH - CRITICAL NODE Exploit Dependencies of OpenResty](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_-_critical_node_exploit_dependencies_of_openresty.md)

* **Goal:** To compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries that OpenResty depends on.
* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Trigger Vulnerability in Dependency:** This involves identifying a known vulnerability in a dependency like PCRE or OpenSSL and crafting input or triggering a condition that exploits this vulnerability within the OpenResty context.
        * **CRITICAL NODE: Craft input or trigger a condition that exploits the vulnerability in the underlying dependency:** This requires knowledge of the specific vulnerability in the dependency and how to trigger it through the OpenResty application. Successful exploitation can lead to various impacts, including RCE or DoS.
