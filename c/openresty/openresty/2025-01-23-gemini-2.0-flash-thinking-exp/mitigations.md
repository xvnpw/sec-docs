# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for openresty/openresty

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization in Lua](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_in_lua.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Lua Input Points:** Pinpoint all locations within your Lua code running in OpenResty where user-provided data enters the application. This includes `ngx.req.get_uri_args()`, `ngx.req.get_post_args()`, `ngx.req.get_headers()`, and data from upstream services accessed via `ngx.location.capture` or `resty.http`.
    2.  **Lua Validation Logic:** Implement validation logic directly in Lua using string manipulation functions, regular expressions (`ngx.re`), or Lua validation libraries. Ensure validation occurs *before* data is used in any sensitive operations (database queries, system commands, output generation).
    3.  **Lua Sanitization Functions:** Utilize Lua functions to sanitize inputs. For web output, use HTML encoding libraries in Lua. For database interactions, use parameterized queries or Lua database libraries that handle escaping. For system commands (if absolutely necessary), use strict whitelisting and escaping within Lua.
    4.  **OpenResty Error Handling:**  Use `ngx.log` to log invalid inputs for security monitoring.  Return controlled error responses via `ngx.say` or `ngx.status` from Lua, avoiding verbose error messages that could leak information.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   SQL Injection (High Severity) - Prevents SQL injection when Lua code interacts with databases using libraries like `lua-resty-mysql` or `lua-resty-postgres`.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity) - Prevents XSS when Lua generates dynamic web content using `ngx.say` or template engines, by sanitizing data before output.
        *   Command Injection (High Severity) - Prevents command injection if Lua code uses `ngx.pipe` or `os.execute` (discouraged) with unsanitized input.
        *   Path Traversal (Medium Severity) - Prevents path traversal if Lua code handles file paths based on user input, especially when using `ngx.exec` or `ngx.include` with dynamic paths.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   SQL Injection: High - Significantly reduces risk when using Lua for database interactions within OpenResty.
        *   XSS: High - Significantly reduces risk when using Lua to generate dynamic web content in OpenResty.
        *   Command Injection: High - Critical if Lua code in OpenResty interacts with the system shell.
        *   Path Traversal: Medium - Important if Lua code in OpenResty handles file system operations.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic input validation using `ngx.re` is present in `lua/handlers/user_login.lua` for username/password.
        *   HTML encoding is used in `lua/templates/user_profile.html` using a custom Lua function.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Comprehensive input validation is missing in Lua API endpoints (`lua/api/*`) that handle data via `ngx.req.get_post_args()`.
        *   No Lua-based sanitization is implemented for file uploads handled by `lua/handlers/upload_file.lua` before processing or storage.
        *   Input validation and sanitization are not consistently applied across all Lua modules interacting with external services via `resty.http`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Coding Practices in OpenResty Lua](./mitigation_strategies/secure_coding_practices_in_openresty_lua.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Dynamic Lua Code:** Avoid `loadstring` or `load` in Lua within OpenResty, especially with external or user-controlled input. If dynamic code is needed, strictly sandbox execution using Lua sandboxing libraries and validate input rigorously.
    2.  **Lua Principle of Least Privilege:** Design Lua modules in OpenResty to operate with minimal necessary privileges. Avoid granting excessive permissions to Lua scripts that are not required for their function within the OpenResty context.
    3.  **Secure Lua Libraries:** Carefully select and audit third-party Lua libraries used in OpenResty. Prefer well-maintained libraries from trusted sources. Keep libraries updated and consider vendoring to control dependencies.
    4.  **OpenResty Error Handling & Logging:** Use `ngx.log` for secure logging in Lua. Avoid exposing sensitive data in error responses returned via `ngx.say` or `ngx.status`. Implement robust error handling using `pcall` in Lua to prevent crashes and information leaks.
    5.  **Lua Code Reviews & Static Analysis:** Conduct regular security code reviews of Lua scripts in OpenResty. Explore static analysis tools specifically designed for Lua to automate vulnerability detection within the OpenResty Lua codebase.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Severity) - Prevents RCE through insecure dynamic Lua code execution within OpenResty.
        *   Privilege Escalation (High Severity) - Prevents Lua scripts in OpenResty from gaining unauthorized access to system resources or Nginx functionalities due to excessive privileges.
        *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity) - Prevents leakage of sensitive information through verbose Lua error messages exposed by OpenResty or insecure logging via `ngx.log`.
        *   Logic Bugs in Lua (Medium Severity) - Improves overall Lua code quality within OpenResty, reducing exploitable logic flaws.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution: High - Critical for preventing server compromise via Lua code in OpenResty.
        *   Privilege Escalation: Medium - Important for maintaining security boundaries within OpenResty and Nginx.
        *   Information Disclosure: Medium - Reduces risk of data leaks from Lua code in OpenResty.
        *   Logic Bugs in Lua: Medium - Improves the reliability and security of Lua-driven OpenResty applications.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic error handling using `pcall` is used in some Lua modules within OpenResty.
        *   Code reviews are performed for major feature additions involving Lua code in OpenResty.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Dynamic Lua code loading in `lua/modules/dynamic_config.lua` needs to be secured or refactored to avoid `loadstring` with potentially untrusted data.
        *   Principle of least privilege for Lua modules in OpenResty needs a systematic review and implementation.
        *   Secure Lua library management and dependency auditing are not formally implemented.
        *   Static analysis for Lua code in OpenResty is not integrated into the development pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Lua Configuration within OpenResty Nginx](./mitigation_strategies/secure_lua_configuration_within_openresty_nginx.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict `lua_package_path` and `lua_package_cpath`:** Carefully control the directories specified in `lua_package_path` and `lua_package_cpath` directives in your Nginx configuration. Limit these paths to only necessary and trusted locations to prevent loading malicious Lua modules.
    2.  **Secure `lua_shared_dict` Access:** If using `lua_shared_dict` for inter-process communication in OpenResty, ensure proper access control. Avoid storing sensitive data directly in shared dictionaries if possible. If necessary, implement encryption and access control mechanisms within Lua to manage data in shared dictionaries securely.
    3.  **Limit Lua Module Exposure:**  Minimize the exposure of sensitive Lua modules or functions to external access. Design your Lua code and Nginx configuration to restrict access to internal Lua functionalities from untrusted sources.
    4.  **Configuration File Permissions:** Protect Nginx configuration files (including those with Lua directives) with appropriate file system permissions to prevent unauthorized modification of Lua-related settings.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Severity) - Malicious Lua modules could be loaded if `lua_package_path` is misconfigured, leading to RCE.
        *   Data Tampering (High Severity) - Unauthorized access to `lua_shared_dict` could lead to data tampering and application compromise.
        *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity) - Misconfigured `lua_shared_dict` or exposed Lua modules could lead to information disclosure.
        *   Configuration Tampering (High Severity) - Unauthorized modification of Nginx configuration files with Lua directives can lead to various security breaches.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution: High - Critical for preventing RCE via malicious Lua module loading in OpenResty.
        *   Data Tampering: High - Significant impact if `lua_shared_dict` is used for critical data in OpenResty.
        *   Information Disclosure: Medium - Potential for sensitive data leaks through misconfigured Lua shared dictionaries or modules.
        *   Configuration Tampering: High - Can lead to widespread compromise of the OpenResty application.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `lua_package_path` and `lua_package_cpath` are set to specific project directories in `nginx.conf`.
        *   `lua_shared_dict` is used for rate limiting, but access control within Lua is basic.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   More granular access control for `lua_shared_dict` data is needed, especially if sensitive data is stored. Consider encryption or more robust Lua-based access management.
        *   Systematic review of Lua module exposure and access restrictions is needed.
        *   Automated checks for Nginx configuration file permissions and Lua-related directives are not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Considerations for `ngx.pipe` and `ngx.req.socket` in OpenResty Lua](./mitigation_strategies/security_considerations_for__ngx_pipe__and__ngx_req_socket__in_openresty_lua.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Usage:** Limit the use of `ngx.pipe` and `ngx.req.socket` in Lua code within OpenResty to only essential functionalities. These modules provide low-level access and can introduce security risks if misused.
    2.  **Validate Pipe/Socket Data:** When using `ngx.pipe` or `ngx.req.socket`, rigorously validate and sanitize any data read from or written to pipes or sockets. Treat data from these sources as potentially untrusted.
    3.  **Implement Access Control:** If `ngx.pipe` or `ngx.req.socket` are used to interact with internal services or resources, implement strict access control and authorization mechanisms within Lua to ensure only authorized requests are processed.
    4.  **Secure Communication Channels:** If communicating over sockets, use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL for TCP sockets) where appropriate to protect data in transit.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Command Injection (High Severity) - If `ngx.pipe` is used to execute system commands based on external input without proper sanitization.
        *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High Severity) - If `ngx.req.socket` is used to make outbound network connections based on user-controlled data without proper validation and restrictions.
        *   Data Injection/Manipulation (Medium Severity) - If data exchanged via pipes or sockets is not properly validated and sanitized, leading to application logic bypass or data corruption.
        *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity) - If sensitive data is transmitted over insecure sockets without encryption.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Command Injection: High - Critical if `ngx.pipe` is used insecurely in OpenResty.
        *   Server-Side Request Forgery: High - Significant risk if `ngx.req.socket` is misused in OpenResty.
        *   Data Injection/Manipulation: Medium - Can lead to application vulnerabilities and data integrity issues.
        *   Information Disclosure: Medium - Risk of leaking sensitive data over insecure socket connections.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `ngx.pipe` is used in `lua/modules/image_processing.lua` for interacting with an external image processing service. Basic validation of command parameters is present.
        *   `ngx.req.socket` is not currently used in the project.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   More rigorous validation and sanitization of data passed to and from the external image processing service via `ngx.pipe` is needed.
        *   Access control mechanisms for the image processing service interaction via `ngx.pipe` are basic and should be strengthened.
        *   If `ngx.req.socket` is introduced in the future, security considerations should be thoroughly reviewed and implemented from the design phase.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Prevention in OpenResty Lua](./mitigation_strategies/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__prevention_in_openresty_lua.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Lua URL Whitelisting:** Implement a whitelist in Lua code for allowed destination URLs or domains when using OpenResty's HTTP client capabilities (`ngx.location.capture`, `resty.http`). Only permit outbound requests to URLs matching the whitelist.
    2.  **Lua URL Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any URLs used in Lua's HTTP client functions. Use Lua string functions and regular expressions (`ngx.re`) to ensure URLs are valid and conform to expected formats before making requests.
    3.  **Avoid User Data in Lua Outbound URLs:** Minimize or eliminate incorporating user-provided data directly into URLs for outbound requests in Lua. If user data is necessary, sanitize and validate it rigorously within Lua and use safe encoding methods.
    4.  **OpenResty Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to isolate the OpenResty application from internal networks. Use firewalls to restrict outbound network access from OpenResty servers to only whitelisted destinations and ports, complementing Lua-level whitelisting.
    5.  **Disable Lua Redirect Following (if possible):** Configure Lua HTTP client libraries (like `resty.http`) to disable automatic following of URL redirects. This prevents attackers from bypassing Lua URL whitelists using redirects.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High Severity) - Prevents SSRF vulnerabilities when Lua code in OpenResty makes outbound HTTP requests.
        *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity) - Prevents access to sensitive internal resources or data via SSRF through Lua code in OpenResty.
        *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity) - In some scenarios, SSRF via Lua code could be used to access internal services with elevated privileges.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): High - Significantly reduces SSRF risk in OpenResty Lua applications.
        *   Information Disclosure: Medium - Reduces risk of data leaks via SSRF from Lua code.
        *   Privilege Escalation: Medium - Mitigates potential privilege escalation through SSRF in OpenResty.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic URL validation is present in `lua/modules/http_client.lua` to check for `http://` or `https://` schemes before outbound requests.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Lua-based URL whitelisting is not implemented. Outbound requests from Lua are not restricted to specific domains or URLs.
        *   User-controlled data is used in URLs in `lua/modules/image_proxy.lua` without sufficient Lua-level sanitization or whitelisting for outbound requests.
        *   Network segmentation and firewall rules are not specifically configured to restrict outbound access from OpenResty servers based on a whitelist.
        *   Redirect following in `resty.http` is not explicitly disabled.
