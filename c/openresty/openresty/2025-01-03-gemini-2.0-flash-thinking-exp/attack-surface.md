# Attack Surface Analysis for openresty/openresty

## Attack Surface: [Lua Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/lua_code_injection.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Lua code that gets executed by the OpenResty application.
* **How OpenResty Contributes:** OpenResty's core feature is the integration of LuaJIT. If user input is directly used in Lua code execution (e.g., via `loadstring`, `eval`), it creates a direct injection point.
* **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL parameter that gets interpolated into a Lua `loadstring` call, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
* **Impact:** Critical. Full control of the server, data breaches, denial of service.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Avoid using `loadstring` or `eval` with user-controlled input.**
    * If dynamic code execution is absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization.
    * Consider using sandboxing techniques for executing untrusted Lua code (though this can be complex).
    * Employ parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases from Lua.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in OpenResty Bundled Nginx Modules](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_openresty_bundled_nginx_modules.md)

* **Description:** Security flaws exist in the specific versions of Nginx modules that are bundled with OpenResty.
* **How OpenResty Contributes:** OpenResty ships with a curated set of Nginx modules. Vulnerabilities in these specific versions can be exploited if not patched.
* **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a specific version of the `ngx_http_image_filter_module` that OpenResty bundles. An attacker sends a specially crafted image to trigger the overflow, potentially leading to code execution.
* **Impact:** High to Critical, depending on the vulnerability. Can lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regularly update OpenResty to the latest stable version.** This includes updates to the bundled Nginx modules.
    * Monitor security advisories for OpenResty and its bundled modules.
    * If a specific vulnerable module is not needed, consider disabling it during compilation.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Lua Code](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_lua_code.md)

* **Description:** Malicious or poorly written Lua code consumes excessive server resources, leading to denial of service.
* **How OpenResty Contributes:** OpenResty allows complex logic to be implemented in Lua, which, if not carefully managed, can lead to resource exhaustion.
* **Example:** A Lua script in a request handler enters an infinite loop or allocates excessive memory, causing the OpenResty worker process to become unresponsive.
* **Impact:** High. Denial of service, impacting the availability of the application.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Implement timeouts and resource limits within Lua scripts.**
    * Carefully review and test Lua code for potential performance issues and resource leaks.
    * Use tools for profiling and monitoring Lua code execution.
    * Consider implementing rate limiting and request queuing at the OpenResty level.
