## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE**: Exploit Nginx Vulnerabilities (Inherited by OpenResty)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_nginx_vulnerabilities__inherited_by_openresty_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting inherent security flaws in the underlying Nginx web server that OpenResty is built upon.
**How it works:** Attackers identify known vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows, module-specific flaws) in the specific Nginx version used by OpenResty. They then craft malicious requests or network packets to trigger these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH**: Exploit Buffer Overflow in Nginx Core](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_buffer_overflow_in_nginx_core.md)

**Attack Vector:** Overwriting memory buffers within the Nginx process by sending more data than the buffer can hold.
**How it works:** Attackers send specially crafted requests with excessive data to overflow a buffer in Nginx's memory. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, including the instruction pointer, allowing the attacker to redirect execution flow and execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH**: Exploit Vulnerability in Nginx Modules (e.g., HTTP/2, Stream)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_vulnerability_in_nginx_modules__e_g___http2__stream_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Targeting specific security flaws within enabled Nginx modules.
**How it works:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities present in individual Nginx modules (e.g., flaws in the HTTP/2 implementation or stream processing). This can be achieved by sending module-specific malicious requests or by exploiting logic errors in the module's code, potentially leading to DoS or RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH**: Send Malicious HTTP Request](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_send_malicious_http_request.md)

**Attack Vector:** Crafting HTTP requests to exploit vulnerabilities in Nginx or OpenResty.
**How it works:** Attackers create specially formatted HTTP requests designed to trigger specific vulnerabilities. This could involve oversized headers, malformed content, or requests that exploit parsing errors, leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE**: Abuse Lua Integration within OpenResty](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_abuse_lua_integration_within_openresty.md)

**Attack Vector:** Leveraging the integration of Lua scripting within OpenResty to execute malicious code or manipulate server behavior.
**How it works:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how Lua scripts are written or how they interact with the OpenResty environment. This can involve injecting malicious Lua code, exploiting insecure function calls, or abusing access to Nginx APIs.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH**: Exploit Insecure Lua Coding Practices](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_insecure_lua_coding_practices.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities introduced by poor coding practices in Lua scripts.
**How it works:** Developers might introduce vulnerabilities by using unsafe functions, failing to sanitize user input, or making errors in logic. Attackers can then exploit these flaws to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or disrupt the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH**: Inject Malicious Code via User Input Passed to `eval()` or `loadstring()`](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_inject_malicious_code_via_user_input_passed_to__eval____or__loadstring___.md)

**Attack Vector:** Directly executing attacker-controlled code by using `eval()` or `loadstring()` on unsanitized input.
**How it works:** If Lua code uses `eval()` or `loadstring()` to process user-provided input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary Lua code that will be executed by the server, granting them significant control.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH**: Exploit Insecure Handling of External Data (e.g., file reads, database queries)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_insecure_handling_of_external_data__e_g___file_reads__database_queries_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of data from external sources.
**How it works:** If Lua scripts read files or perform database queries without properly sanitizing user-provided input that influences these operations, attackers can inject malicious commands or paths, leading to information disclosure, data manipulation, or even remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH**: Execute System Commands via `os.execute()` or similar (if enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_execute_system_commands_via__os_execute____or_similar__if_enabled_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Directly executing system commands on the server through Lua's `os.execute()` function.
**How it works:** If the `os.execute()` function (or similar functions that allow system command execution) is enabled in the Lua environment and can be influenced by attacker input, they can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system, leading to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate or Exploit OpenResty Configuration **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_or_exploit_openresty_configuration_high_risk_path.md)

**Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to or modifying OpenResty's configuration files to compromise the application.
**How it works:** Attackers aim to access and alter OpenResty's configuration files (e.g., `nginx.conf`). By modifying these files, they can redirect traffic, disable security features, inject malicious Lua code, or configure backends to point to attacker-controlled servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE**: Gain Unauthorized Access to Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_gain_unauthorized_access_to_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** Obtaining unauthorized access to the OpenResty configuration files.
**How it works:** Attackers attempt to access the server's file system to read the OpenResty configuration files. This can be achieved through various means, such as exploiting file system vulnerabilities, leveraging weak file permissions, or through insider access.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH**: Exploit Weak Permissions on Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_weak_permissions_on_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting improperly set file permissions on OpenResty configuration files.
**How it works:** If the configuration files have overly permissive read or write permissions, attackers can directly access and modify them without needing to exploit more complex vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH**: Inject Malicious Lua Code into Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_inject_malicious_lua_code_into_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** Embedding malicious Lua code directly within the OpenResty configuration files.
**How it works:** Attackers, having gained access to the configuration files, insert malicious Lua code within the configuration blocks. This code will be executed when OpenResty starts or reloads the configuration, providing a persistent backdoor or allowing for immediate code execution.
