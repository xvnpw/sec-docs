# Threat Model Analysis for openresty/openresty

## Threat: [Lua Code Injection via Unsanitized Input to `eval()`](./threats/lua_code_injection_via_unsanitized_input_to__eval___.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides malicious input that is directly passed to the Lua `eval()` function or similar dynamic code execution mechanisms within an OpenResty Lua script. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary Lua code on the server.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, including access to sensitive data, modification of data, and potential execution of system commands.

**Affected Component:** Lua scripting environment (within OpenResty), specifically the `eval()` function or similar dynamic execution functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using `eval()` or similar dynamic code execution functions with user-supplied input.
*   If dynamic code execution is absolutely necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious code.
*   Adopt secure coding practices and perform thorough code reviews.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `ngx.location.capture` or `resty.http` with Unvalidated Input](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via__ngx_location_capture__or__resty_http__with_unvalidated_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates user-provided input that is used as a URL in OpenResty's `ngx.location.capture` or `resty.http` modules without proper validation. This allows the attacker to force the OpenResty server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.

**Impact:** Access to internal services not exposed to the internet, information disclosure from internal systems, potential for further attacks on internal infrastructure, and abuse of external services.

**Affected Component:** `ngx.location.capture` module (OpenResty), `resty.http` library (OpenResty).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict validation and sanitization of URLs before using them in `ngx.location.capture` or `resty.http`.
*   Use a whitelist approach to restrict the allowed destination URLs.
*   Consider using network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF attacks.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Lua Scripts](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_lua_scripts.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that exploits inefficient regular expressions used in OpenResty Lua scripts. Processing this input can cause excessive CPU consumption, leading to denial of service.

**Impact:** Application slowdown, service unavailability, and potential server crashes due to resource exhaustion.

**Affected Component:** Lua scripting environment (within OpenResty), specifically regular expression matching functions (e.g., `string.match`, `ngx.re.match`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design and test regular expressions for efficiency and vulnerability to ReDoS.
*   Avoid overly complex or nested quantifiers in regular expressions.
*   Implement timeouts for regular expression matching operations.
*   Consider using alternative string processing methods if regular expressions are not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [Insecure Defaults or Misconfigurations in OpenResty Modules](./threats/insecure_defaults_or_misconfigurations_in_openresty_modules.md)

**Description:**  Using OpenResty modules with insecure default configurations or misconfiguring modules can introduce vulnerabilities. For example, an improperly configured caching module might expose sensitive data, or a poorly configured proxy module might allow for open proxy abuse.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the module and misconfiguration, but can include information disclosure, unauthorized access, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Various OpenResty modules (e.g., `ngx_http_proxy_module`, `ngx_http_cache_module`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Review the documentation and security considerations for each OpenResty module used.
*   Avoid using default configurations and explicitly configure modules with security in mind.
*   Regularly review and audit OpenResty configurations.
