## Deep Dive Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `ngx.location.capture` or `resty.http` with Unvalidated Input in OpenResty

This document provides a detailed analysis of the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) threat identified in our application, specifically focusing on its exploitation through OpenResty's `ngx.location.capture` module and `resty.http` library when handling unvalidated user input.

**1. Understanding the Vulnerability in Detail:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the lack of trust placed on user-provided data when constructing URLs for internal or external requests initiated by the OpenResty server. Both `ngx.location.capture` and `resty.http` are powerful tools for making subrequests. However, if the destination URL is directly derived from user input without rigorous validation, an attacker can manipulate this input to force the server to make requests to unintended targets.

* **`ngx.location.capture`:** This OpenResty directive allows a request to be internally redirected and processed by another location block within the same OpenResty instance. While intended for internal routing, it can be abused if the target location's URI is controlled by the attacker. This can lead to accessing internal APIs or resources not meant to be exposed.

* **`resty.http`:** This library provides a more general-purpose HTTP client within the Lua environment. It allows making arbitrary HTTP requests to external or internal services. If the URL passed to `resty.http.request` is derived from user input without validation, the server can be coerced into interacting with attacker-controlled or internal sensitive endpoints.

**Key Factors Contributing to the Vulnerability:**

* **Direct Use of User Input:** The most critical factor is directly incorporating user-provided data (e.g., query parameters, request body data, headers) into the URL string used by `ngx.location.capture` or `resty.http`.
* **Insufficient Validation:** Lack of proper checks to ensure the URL points to an intended and safe destination. This includes failing to validate the scheme, hostname, port, and path.
* **Trusting User Input:**  The application implicitly trusts that the user-provided URL is benign, which is a fundamental security flaw.

**2. Detailed Attack Scenarios and Exploitation Techniques:**

An attacker can leverage this SSRF vulnerability in several ways:

* **Internal Port Scanning:** The attacker can provide a range of IP addresses and ports in the URL to probe for open services on the internal network. This allows them to map the internal infrastructure and identify potential targets for further attacks. Example: `http://192.168.1.10:8080`.

* **Accessing Internal Services:** If internal services are not exposed to the internet but are accessible from the OpenResty server, an attacker can use SSRF to interact with them. This could include:
    * **Configuration Management Systems:**  Accessing internal configuration panels or APIs.
    * **Databases:**  Potentially executing queries or accessing sensitive data if authentication is weak or bypassed.
    * **Message Queues:**  Interacting with internal messaging systems.
    * **Cloud Metadata APIs:**  Accessing cloud provider metadata services (e.g., AWS EC2 metadata at `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`) to retrieve sensitive information like instance roles, security credentials, and network configurations.

* **Information Disclosure:** By making requests to internal resources, the attacker can retrieve sensitive information that would otherwise be inaccessible. This could include:
    * **Internal Documentation:** Accessing internal wikis or documentation servers.
    * **Source Code:**  In some cases, misconfigured internal systems might expose source code.
    * **API Keys and Secrets:**  Accidentally exposed within internal services.

* **Abuse of External Services:** The attacker can force the OpenResty server to make requests to external services, potentially:
    * **Launching Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:**  Flooding external targets with requests originating from the server's IP address.
    * **Bypassing IP-Based Access Controls:**  Using the server as a proxy to access external resources that might block requests from the attacker's IP.
    * **Email Abuse:**  Sending emails through internal SMTP servers.

* **Exploiting Internal Vulnerabilities:**  If the attacker discovers vulnerable internal services through port scanning or other means, they can use the SSRF vulnerability to exploit those vulnerabilities from the seemingly trusted OpenResty server.

**Example Exploitation Flows:**

**Scenario 1: Exploiting `ngx.location.capture` for Internal Access**

1. The application has a feature where users can provide a "redirect URL" which is then used in an internal redirect using `ngx.location.capture`.
2. An attacker provides a malicious URL like `/internal_admin_panel`.
3. The OpenResty server, without validation, executes `ngx.location.capture("/internal_admin_panel")`.
4. If the `/internal_admin_panel` location block is accessible internally but not externally, the attacker gains unauthorized access.

**Scenario 2: Exploiting `resty.http` for Accessing Cloud Metadata**

1. The application uses `resty.http` to fetch data from a user-provided URL.
2. An attacker provides the URL `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/admin-role/`.
3. The OpenResty server executes `resty.http.request("GET", "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/admin-role/")`.
4. The server retrieves the AWS credentials associated with its instance, potentially allowing the attacker to escalate privileges within the cloud environment.

**3. Technical Deep Dive and Code Examples:**

**Vulnerable Code Examples:**

```lua
-- Vulnerable example using ngx.location.capture
local redirect_url = ngx.var.arg_target_url -- User-provided URL from query parameter
ngx.location.capture(redirect_url)

-- Vulnerable example using resty.http
local http = require "resty.http"
local client = http.new()
local target_url = ngx.var.arg_api_url -- User-provided URL from query parameter
local res, err = client:request(target_url)
if err then
  ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Error making request: ", err)
  return
end
-- Process the response
```

**Exploitation Examples:**

*   **`ngx.location.capture`:**  An attacker could craft a URL like `https://your-app.com/some_endpoint?target_url=http://internal-service:8080/admin`.
*   **`resty.http`:** An attacker could craft a URL like `https://your-app.com/another_endpoint?api_url=file:///etc/passwd`. (Note: Accessing local files might be restricted by OpenResty's configuration, but this illustrates the principle).

**4. Detailed Impact Assessment:**

The potential impact of this SSRF vulnerability is significant and can have severe consequences:

* **Confidentiality Breach:** Accessing sensitive internal data, configuration files, API keys, and cloud credentials can lead to significant data breaches.
* **Integrity Compromise:**  Manipulating internal systems, modifying data, or altering configurations can compromise the integrity of the application and its underlying infrastructure.
* **Availability Disruption:** Launching DoS attacks against internal or external targets can disrupt the availability of services.
* **Reputation Damage:**  A successful SSRF attack leading to data breaches or service disruptions can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Financial Loss:**  Remediation costs, legal fees, regulatory fines, and loss of business due to security incidents can result in significant financial losses.
* **Legal and Regulatory Penalties:** Depending on the nature of the accessed data and the industry, breaches resulting from SSRF can lead to legal and regulatory penalties (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
* **Supply Chain Risks:** If the application interacts with external services, an attacker could potentially use SSRF to compromise those services, leading to supply chain attacks.

**5. Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies:**

Beyond the initially suggested strategies, a robust defense against SSRF requires a multi-layered approach:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Mandatory):**
    * **URL Parsing and Decomposition:**  Parse the user-provided URL to extract its components (scheme, hostname, port, path).
    * **Scheme Whitelisting:**  Only allow specific, safe schemes (e.g., `http`, `https`). Block `file://`, `gopher://`, `ftp://`, `data://`, etc., which can be used for more complex attacks.
    * **Hostname Whitelisting (Highly Recommended):**  Maintain a whitelist of allowed destination hostnames or IP addresses. This is the most effective way to prevent access to arbitrary internal or external resources.
    * **Regular Expression Matching:**  Use regular expressions to enforce the expected format of the URL components.
    * **Input Length Limits:**  Restrict the maximum length of the URL to prevent excessively long or malformed URLs.
    * **Canonicalization:**  Ensure the URL is in a standard format to prevent bypasses using URL encoding or other obfuscation techniques.

* **Network Segmentation (Essential):**
    * **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to restrict outbound traffic from the OpenResty server to only necessary destinations. Deny all outbound traffic by default and explicitly allow access to whitelisted services.
    * **Internal Network Isolation:**  Segment the internal network to limit the reach of potential SSRF attacks. Place sensitive internal services on separate networks with restricted access.

* **Least Privilege Principle (Important):**
    * **Restrict Outbound Access:**  The OpenResty server should only have network access to the specific internal and external services it needs to interact with.
    * **User Permissions:**  If the application involves user authentication, ensure that user roles and permissions are appropriately configured to limit access to sensitive functionalities.

* **Centralized Request Handling and Proxying (Consider):**
    * **Dedicated Proxy Service:**  Route all outgoing requests through a dedicated proxy service that enforces security policies, including URL validation and access controls. This centralizes security management and reduces the risk of vulnerabilities in individual application components.

* **Rate Limiting and Throttling (Helpful for Mitigation):**
    * **Limit Outbound Requests:** Implement rate limiting on outbound requests from the OpenResty server to prevent attackers from using SSRF to launch large-scale attacks.

* **Disable Unnecessary Protocols and Features (Security Hardening):**
    * **Disable Unused Modules:** If certain protocols or functionalities are not required, disable them in the OpenResty configuration to reduce the attack surface.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing (Crucial):**
    * **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities in the application logic.
    * **Static and Dynamic Analysis:** Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to automatically detect potential security flaws.
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security experts to perform penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities.

* **Security Headers (Indirectly Helpful):**
    * While not directly preventing SSRF, security headers like `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) can help mitigate the impact of successful attacks by restricting the resources the browser can load.

* **Monitoring and Logging (Essential for Detection):**
    * **Log Outbound Requests:** Log all outbound requests made by `ngx.location.capture` and `resty.http`, including the destination URL.
    * **Anomaly Detection:** Implement monitoring systems to detect unusual outbound traffic patterns, such as requests to unexpected internal IP addresses or ports.
    * **Alerting:**  Set up alerts for suspicious activity to enable rapid response to potential attacks.

**6. Detection and Monitoring Strategies:**

Effective detection and monitoring are crucial for identifying and responding to SSRF attacks:

* **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitor outbound network traffic for unusual patterns, such as connections to internal IP addresses or ports that are not typically accessed.
* **Log Analysis:** Analyze OpenResty logs for requests made by `ngx.location.capture` and `resty.http` with suspicious URLs or unusual destinations. Look for patterns indicating attempts to access internal resources or external services that the application shouldn't be interacting with.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** Integrate OpenResty logs with a SIEM system to correlate events and detect potential SSRF attacks based on predefined rules and anomaly detection algorithms.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy network-based IDS/IPS solutions to monitor network traffic for known SSRF attack patterns and block malicious requests.
* **Honeypots:** Deploy honeypots within the internal network to attract attackers and detect unauthorized access attempts.

**7. Prevention in the Development Lifecycle:**

Preventing SSRF vulnerabilities requires incorporating secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle:

* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers about the risks of SSRF and other common web application vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Coding Guidelines:** Establish and enforce secure coding guidelines that explicitly address SSRF prevention.
* **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where user input is used to construct URLs.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities in the code.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Perform DAST during testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify runtime vulnerabilities.
* **Dependency Management:** Keep OpenResty and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.

**Conclusion:**

The Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability via unvalidated input in `ngx.location.capture` and `resty.http` poses a significant risk to our application and its underlying infrastructure. A comprehensive mitigation strategy involving strict input validation, network segmentation, the principle of least privilege, and robust monitoring is essential. By understanding the attack vectors, potential impact, and implementing the recommended preventative and detective measures, we can significantly reduce the risk of successful SSRF exploitation and protect our application and sensitive data. This analysis should serve as a guide for the development team to prioritize and implement the necessary security controls.
