# Deep Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in OpenResty

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks targeting an OpenResty-based application, identify specific vulnerabilities within the OpenResty configuration and Lua scripting environment, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  We aim to provide developers with practical guidance to prevent SSRF vulnerabilities.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on SSRF vulnerabilities arising from the use of OpenResty, including:

*   **`proxy_pass` directive:**  How user-supplied data can influence the target of `proxy_pass`, leading to unintended requests.
*   **Lua HTTP Clients:**  Vulnerabilities within Lua scripts using libraries like `resty.http`, `lua-resty-http`, or `cosocket` to make HTTP requests based on user input.
*   **Interaction with other OpenResty features:** How features like `access_by_lua_block`, `content_by_lua_block`, and custom modules might introduce SSRF risks.
*   **DNS Resolution:** The role of DNS resolution in SSRF attacks and how to mitigate related risks.
*   **Bypassing of naive mitigations:** Common mistakes that lead to ineffective SSRF protection.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General web application vulnerabilities unrelated to SSRF.
*   Vulnerabilities in underlying operating system components (unless directly relevant to OpenResty's SSRF risk).
*   Attacks that do not involve OpenResty making unintended requests.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential attack scenarios and vectors specific to OpenResty's features.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  Analyze common OpenResty configuration patterns and Lua code snippets for SSRF vulnerabilities.  We'll create *hypothetical* examples, as we don't have access to the specific application code.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Examine known SSRF vulnerabilities and bypass techniques relevant to OpenResty and Nginx.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose detailed, practical mitigation strategies, including code examples and configuration recommendations.
5.  **Testing Considerations:** Outline how to test for SSRF vulnerabilities in an OpenResty environment.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1. Threat Modeling: SSRF Attack Scenarios

Here are some specific SSRF attack scenarios in an OpenResty context:

*   **Scenario 1: `proxy_pass` Manipulation:**
    *   **Attacker Goal:** Access an internal metadata service (e.g., AWS metadata endpoint `169.254.169.254`).
    *   **Vulnerable Configuration:**
        ```nginx
        location /proxy {
            proxy_pass http://$arg_url;  # Vulnerable: Directly uses user-supplied argument
        }
        ```
    *   **Attack:**  The attacker sends a request like `/proxy?url=169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`. OpenResty proxies the request to the internal metadata service.

*   **Scenario 2: Lua HTTP Client Abuse:**
    *   **Attacker Goal:**  Scan internal network ports.
    *   **Vulnerable Lua Code:**
        ```lua
        local http = require("resty.http")
        local httpc = http.new()
        local target_url = ngx.var.arg_url  -- Vulnerable: Directly uses user-supplied argument

        local res, err = httpc:request_uri(target_url, {
            method = "GET",
            connect_timeout = 1000,  -- Short timeout to speed up scanning
        })

        if res then
            ngx.say("Port open")
        else
            ngx.say("Port closed or error: ", err)
        end
        ```
    *   **Attack:** The attacker sends requests like `/scan?url=http://internal-server:80`, `/scan?url=http://internal-server:22`, etc., to probe for open ports.

*   **Scenario 3:  DNS Rebinding:**
    *   **Attacker Goal:** Bypass a whitelist that checks hostnames.
    *   **Vulnerable Configuration:**  A whitelist allows `example.com`, but the attacker controls the DNS for `example.com`.
    *   **Attack:**
        1.  The attacker initially points `example.com` to a public IP address they control.
        2.  The OpenResty server resolves `example.com` and validates it against the whitelist.
        3.  The attacker *changes* the DNS record for `example.com` to point to an internal IP address (e.g., `127.0.0.1`).
        4.  OpenResty, using a cached DNS entry (or due to a short TTL), now proxies the request to the internal IP.

*   **Scenario 4:  Protocol Smuggling:**
    *   **Attacker Goal:** Access internal services that use different protocols (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
    *   **Vulnerable Configuration:**  OpenResty proxies to a backend that can handle multiple protocols, and the attacker can inject protocol-specific commands.
    *   **Attack:** The attacker crafts a URL that, when parsed by the backend, triggers unintended behavior.  For example, using `gopher://` or `dict://` URLs to interact with internal services.  This is particularly dangerous if the backend server interprets the request body.

### 4.2. Code Review (Hypothetical Examples)

Let's examine some more hypothetical code examples and identify vulnerabilities:

*   **Bad Example 1:  Indirect `proxy_pass` Control:**

    ```nginx
    location /image-proxy {
        set $backend_host "images.internal"; # Default backend

        if ($arg_external == "true") {
            set $backend_host $arg_host;  # Vulnerable: User controls $backend_host
        }

        proxy_pass http://$backend_host;
    }
    ```
    This is vulnerable because the attacker can set `$arg_external` to "true" and then control `$backend_host` via `$arg_host`.

*   **Bad Example 2:  Insufficient URL Parsing in Lua:**

    ```lua
    local url = ngx.var.arg_url
    local parsed_url = ngx.parse_uri(url) -- Only parses basic components

    if parsed_url.host == "example.com" then  -- Vulnerable: Only checks the host
        local http = require("resty.http")
        local httpc = http.new()
        local res, err = httpc:request_uri(url)
        -- ...
    end
    ```
    This is vulnerable because the attacker could use `http://example.com@attacker.com/` or `http://example.com#@127.0.0.1/` to bypass the host check.  `ngx.parse_uri` doesn't fully validate the URL.

*   **Good Example 1:  Whitelist with `map`:**

    ```nginx
    map $arg_backend $upstream_server {
        default "";  # No upstream by default
        "images" "http://images.internal:8080";
        "videos" "http://videos.internal:8081";
    }

    location /proxy {
        if ($upstream_server = "") {
            return 403;  # Forbidden if no valid backend
        }
        proxy_pass $upstream_server;
    }
    ```
    This is much safer because the user can only select from a predefined set of backends.

*   **Good Example 2:  Strict URL Validation in Lua:**

    ```lua
    local function is_valid_url(url)
        -- Use a robust URL parsing library (e.g., a custom implementation or a third-party library)
        -- 1. Check the scheme (must be http or https)
        -- 2. Check the host (must be in a whitelist)
        -- 3. Check for suspicious characters or patterns
        -- 4. Consider using a dedicated URL parsing library for thorough validation.
        -- ... (Implementation omitted for brevity, but MUST be comprehensive)
        return true -- Or false if invalid
    end

    local url = ngx.var.arg_url
    if url and is_valid_url(url) then
        -- ... (Make the request)
    else
        ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Invalid URL: ", url)
        ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN)
    end
    ```
    This emphasizes the need for *robust* URL validation, going beyond simple string comparisons.

### 4.3. Vulnerability Research: Bypass Techniques

Attackers are constantly finding new ways to bypass SSRF protections.  Here are some common techniques:

*   **URL Encoding:**  Using URL encoding (e.g., `%2e%2e%2f` for `../`) to bypass string-based filters.
*   **Double Encoding:**  Encoding characters multiple times (e.g., `%252e%252e%252f`).
*   **IP Address Variations:**  Using different representations of IP addresses (e.g., decimal, octal, hexadecimal) to bypass filters that only check for dotted-decimal notation.  For example, `127.0.0.1` can be represented as `2130706433` (decimal) or `0177.0.0.1` (octal).
*   **CNAME Chaining:**  Using a chain of CNAME records to eventually resolve to an internal IP address.
*   **HTTP Redirects:**  Exploiting 3xx redirects to redirect the request to an internal service.  The initial request might pass validation, but the redirect could point to a forbidden target.  (Mitigation: Limit or disable following redirects in Lua HTTP clients.)
*   **Using IPv6 Addresses:** If IPv6 is enabled, attackers might try to use IPv6 addresses or IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses to bypass IPv4-specific filters.

### 4.4. Detailed Mitigation Strategies

Here are more detailed and actionable mitigation strategies:

1.  **Never Trust User Input:**  This is the fundamental principle.  Assume *all* user-supplied data is potentially malicious.

2.  **Strict Input Validation (Beyond Basic Checks):**
    *   **Use a Robust URL Parsing Library:**  Don't rely solely on `ngx.parse_uri`.  Consider a dedicated URL parsing library (potentially a custom Lua implementation or a third-party library) that handles all the nuances of URL parsing and validation, including:
        *   Scheme validation (only allow `http` and `https`).
        *   Host validation against a whitelist (see below).
        *   Path validation (prevent directory traversal).
        *   Query parameter validation.
        *   Handling of special characters and encodings.
        *   Rejection of unusual URL schemes (e.g., `file://`, `gopher://`).
    *   **Validate IP Addresses Carefully:**  If you need to allow IP addresses, validate them against a whitelist and handle all possible representations (decimal, octal, hexadecimal, IPv6).  Use a library function for IP address validation if possible.

3.  **Whitelist Allowed Hosts/IPs (Strict Enforcement):**
    *   **Use `map` for `proxy_pass`:**  The `map` directive provides a clean and efficient way to implement a whitelist for `proxy_pass`.
    *   **Hardcode the Whitelist:**  Avoid loading the whitelist from external files or databases, as this could introduce new attack vectors.
    *   **Regularly Review the Whitelist:**  Ensure the whitelist only contains necessary entries.

4.  **Avoid User-Controlled `proxy_pass` (Fundamental Rule):**
    *   **Restructure Logic:**  Refactor your application logic to avoid situations where user input directly determines the `proxy_pass` target.
    *   **Use Predefined Upstreams:**  Define upstream blocks for all allowed backends and use a `map` or other logic to select the appropriate upstream based on *validated* user input.

5.  **Network Segmentation and Firewalls:**
    *   **Restrict Outbound Connections:**  Use a firewall (e.g., `iptables`, `nftables`) to limit the outbound connections that OpenResty can make.  Only allow connections to specific IP addresses and ports that are absolutely necessary.
    *   **Isolate OpenResty:**  Run OpenResty in a dedicated network segment or container to limit the impact of a successful SSRF attack.

6.  **Dedicated DNS Resolver (Critical for Security):**
    *   **Configure a Local Resolver:**  Configure OpenResty to use a local DNS resolver (e.g., `unbound`, `dnsmasq`) that is configured to *not* resolve internal hostnames.
    *   **Prevent DNS Rebinding:**  Configure the DNS resolver with a short TTL (Time-To-Live) for external domains and consider using DNSSEC to prevent DNS spoofing.
    *   **`resolver` Directive in Nginx:** Use the `resolver` directive in your Nginx configuration to specify the DNS resolver:
        ```nginx
        resolver 127.0.0.1 valid=30s;  # Use local resolver, cache for 30 seconds
        ```

7.  **Control HTTP Redirects:**
     * **Limit Redirects:** In your Lua HTTP client code, set a maximum number of redirects to follow (e.g., `max_redirects = 0` or a small number).
     * **Validate Redirect URLs:** If you must follow redirects, validate the URL of each redirect against your whitelist *before* following it.

8.  **Disable Unnecessary Protocols/Features:**
    *   **Review OpenResty Modules:**  Disable any OpenResty modules that you don't need, as they could potentially introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Limit Lua Libraries:**  Only use trusted and well-vetted Lua libraries.

9.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Regularly review your OpenResty configuration and Lua code for SSRF vulnerabilities.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and exploit potential SSRF vulnerabilities.

10. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Log Suspicious Requests:** Log any requests that fail validation or trigger security alerts.
    *   **Monitor Outbound Traffic:** Monitor OpenResty's outbound network traffic for unusual patterns.

### 4.5. Testing Considerations

Testing for SSRF vulnerabilities in OpenResty requires a combination of techniques:

*   **Black-Box Testing:**  Attempt to exploit SSRF vulnerabilities by sending crafted requests to the application.  Try various bypass techniques (URL encoding, IP address variations, etc.).
*   **White-Box Testing:**  Review the OpenResty configuration and Lua code to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Fuzzing:**  Use a fuzzer to generate a large number of variations of input URLs and test how the application handles them.
*   **Automated Scanning:**  Use a web application security scanner that includes SSRF detection capabilities.
*   **DNS Rebinding Testing:**  Use a tool specifically designed to test for DNS rebinding vulnerabilities.
* **Out-of-Band (OOB) Techniques:** Use a service like Burp Collaborator or a custom-built server to detect if OpenResty is making requests to unintended destinations. This is particularly useful for "blind" SSRF, where the response is not directly returned to the attacker.

## 5. Conclusion

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a serious vulnerability that can have severe consequences in an OpenResty environment.  By understanding the attack vectors, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and regularly testing for vulnerabilities, developers can significantly reduce the risk of SSRF attacks.  The key takeaways are:

*   **Never trust user input.**
*   **Use a whitelist approach whenever possible.**
*   **Implement strict and comprehensive URL validation.**
*   **Use a dedicated DNS resolver that cannot resolve internal hostnames.**
*   **Employ network segmentation and firewalls to limit outbound connections.**
*   **Regularly audit and test your application for SSRF vulnerabilities.**

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive framework for addressing SSRF vulnerabilities in OpenResty applications.  By following these guidelines, developers can build more secure and resilient systems.
