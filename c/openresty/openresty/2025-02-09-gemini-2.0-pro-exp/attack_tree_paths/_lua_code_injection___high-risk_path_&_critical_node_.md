Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Lua Code Injection" attack tree path, tailored for an OpenResty application, presented in Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Lua Code Injection in OpenResty

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Lua Code Injection" attack vector within the context of an OpenResty application.  This includes identifying common vulnerabilities, assessing the potential impact, proposing mitigation strategies, and outlining detection methods.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to prevent this critical vulnerability.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on Lua code injection vulnerabilities within the OpenResty environment.  It considers:

*   **OpenResty-specific features:**  How features like `ngx.var`, `ngx.req.get_body_data`, `ngx.req.get_uri_args`, and custom Lua modules contribute to or mitigate the risk.
*   **Common OpenResty use cases:**  API gateways, reverse proxies, load balancers, and web application firewalls (WAFs) are considered, as these are frequent deployment scenarios.
*   **Interaction with Nginx:**  How Nginx configuration directives and core functionalities interact with Lua code execution and potential injection points.
*   **Third-party Lua modules:**  The analysis will consider the potential for vulnerabilities introduced by commonly used third-party Lua modules.
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis *does not* cover general Nginx vulnerabilities unrelated to Lua scripting, nor does it delve into operating system-level security issues outside the direct control of the OpenResty application.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Identify common patterns and code constructs in OpenResty that are susceptible to Lua code injection. This includes reviewing OpenResty documentation, common Lua libraries, and known vulnerability reports.
2.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  Create realistic exploit scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could leverage identified vulnerabilities.  This will involve crafting example payloads and demonstrating their impact.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Quantify the potential impact of successful Lua code injection, considering factors like data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies to prevent Lua code injection.  This will include code-level recommendations, configuration changes, and security best practices.
5.  **Detection Method Definition:**  Outline methods for detecting Lua code injection attempts, both proactively (through code analysis) and reactively (through intrusion detection).
6.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  Compile the findings into a clear and concise report, suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path: Lua Code Injection

### 2.1 Vulnerability Identification

Lua code injection in OpenResty typically arises from the following scenarios:

*   **Dynamic Lua Code Generation with Unvalidated Input:** The most common vulnerability.  This occurs when user-supplied data (from query parameters, request bodies, headers, etc.) is directly concatenated into a Lua code string that is then executed using `loadstring` or `dofile`.

    *   **Example (Vulnerable):**
        ```lua
        local user_input = ngx.var.arg_input
        local code = "return " .. user_input
        local func, err = loadstring(code)
        if func then
            local result = func()
            ngx.say(result)
        else
            ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Error loading code: ", err)
        end
        ```
        If `user_input` is `os.execute('rm -rf /')`, this results in RCE.

*   **Unsafe Use of `ngx.var`:**  While `ngx.var` itself isn't inherently vulnerable, directly using user-controlled variables within Lua code without proper escaping or validation can lead to injection.  This is particularly dangerous if the variable is later used in a context where it's interpreted as Lua code.

    *   **Example (Vulnerable):**
        ```nginx
        location / {
            set $my_var $arg_input;  # User-controlled input
            content_by_lua_block {
                -- ... some code that eventually uses $my_var in a way
                -- that treats it as Lua code (e.g., indirect eval)
                local code = "print(" .. ngx.var.my_var .. ")"
                loadstring(code)()
            }
        }
        ```

*   **Vulnerable Third-Party Lua Modules:**  If the application uses third-party Lua modules, those modules might contain their own injection vulnerabilities.  It's crucial to vet any external dependencies.

*   **Misconfigured `lua_package_path` and `lua_package_cpath`:**  If these Nginx directives are misconfigured to include directories writable by an attacker, the attacker could upload malicious Lua modules that are then loaded by the application.

*   **Using `eval`-like functions without proper sanitization:** Some Lua libraries might offer functions that behave similarly to `eval`, taking a string and executing it as code.  These functions are just as dangerous as `loadstring` if used with unsanitized input.

### 2.2 Exploit Scenario Development

**Scenario:** An API gateway built with OpenResty uses a Lua script to dynamically generate SQL queries based on user input.

**Vulnerable Code (Simplified):**

```lua
local user_id = ngx.var.arg_user_id
local query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " .. user_id
-- ... (code to execute the query using a Lua database library) ...
```

**Exploit Payload:**

The attacker provides the following value for the `user_id` parameter:

`1; os.execute('cat /etc/passwd') --`

**Result:**

The Lua code constructs the following string:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1; os.execute('cat /etc/passwd') --`

The `os.execute` command is executed, revealing the contents of `/etc/passwd`.  This demonstrates RCE.  A more sophisticated attacker could use this to install backdoors, exfiltrate data, or pivot to other systems.

### 2.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of successful Lua code injection in OpenResty is **Very High** and can lead to:

*   **Complete System Compromise (RCE):**  The attacker gains full control over the server running OpenResty.
*   **Data Breaches:**  Sensitive data processed by the application (e.g., user credentials, API keys, database contents) can be stolen.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker can disrupt the application's functionality, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  The compromised server can be used as a launching point for attacks against other systems within the network.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization.

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategy Development

The following mitigation strategies are crucial to prevent Lua code injection:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Primary Defense):**
    *   **Strict Whitelisting:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters and patterns for each input field.  Reject any input that doesn't conform to the whitelist.  This is far more secure than blacklisting.
    *   **Type Validation:**  Ensure that input data matches the expected data type (e.g., integer, string, email address).
    *   **Length Limits:**  Enforce reasonable length limits on input fields to prevent excessively long payloads.
    *   **Context-Specific Sanitization:**  If you *must* incorporate user input into Lua code (which should be avoided whenever possible), use context-specific escaping functions.  For example, if generating SQL queries, use a database library that provides parameterized queries or prepared statements.  *Never* directly concatenate user input into SQL.
    *   **Lua Sandboxing (Advanced):** Consider using a Lua sandbox (like the one provided by `lua-resty-sandbox`) to restrict the capabilities of executed Lua code. This can limit the damage an attacker can cause even if they achieve injection.

*   **Avoid Dynamic Code Generation:**  Whenever possible, avoid generating Lua code dynamically based on user input.  Instead, use pre-defined Lua functions and pass user input as parameters.

*   **Secure Configuration:**
    *   **Restrict `lua_package_path` and `lua_package_cpath`:**  Ensure these directives point only to trusted directories that are not writable by the web server user or any unprivileged user.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Nginx Modules:**  If you're not using certain Nginx modules, disable them to reduce the attack surface.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Focus on areas where user input is handled.

*   **Dependency Management:**  Carefully vet any third-party Lua modules for security vulnerabilities.  Keep modules updated to the latest versions.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the OpenResty worker processes with the least privileges necessary.  Avoid running as root.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Use a WAF (either a dedicated appliance or a module like `lua-resty-waf`) to filter malicious requests.  However, don't rely solely on a WAF; it's a defense-in-depth measure, not a silver bullet.

### 2.5 Detection Method Definition

*   **Static Code Analysis:**
    *   **Manual Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the codebase, paying close attention to how user input is handled and incorporated into Lua code.
    *   **Automated Code Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., linters, security scanners) to automatically identify potential injection vulnerabilities.  While there may not be tools specifically designed for OpenResty Lua code injection, general-purpose security scanners can often flag suspicious patterns.
    *   **Regular Expression Analysis:** Develop regular expressions to search for patterns indicative of dynamic code generation with user input (e.g., `loadstring(.*ngx.var.*)`, `dofile(.*ngx.var.*)`).

*   **Dynamic Analysis:**
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing techniques to send a large number of malformed requests to the application and monitor for unexpected behavior or crashes.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to conduct penetration testing to actively attempt to exploit potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
    *   **Signature-Based Detection:**  Configure IDS/IPS rules to detect known Lua injection payloads.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Use anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns of requests that might indicate an injection attempt.
    *   **Log Monitoring:**  Monitor Nginx and OpenResty logs for suspicious activity, such as errors related to Lua code execution, unexpected system commands, or unusual file access.

*   **Runtime Monitoring:**
    *   **Lua Sandboxing (Detection):**  If using a Lua sandbox, monitor its logs for any attempts to violate the sandbox restrictions.
    *   **System Call Monitoring:**  Monitor system calls made by the OpenResty worker processes to detect any unexpected or unauthorized activity.

### 2.6 Conclusion and Recommendations

Lua code injection is a critical vulnerability in OpenResty applications that can lead to complete system compromise.  The primary defense is **strict input validation and sanitization**, combined with avoiding dynamic code generation whenever possible.  A layered security approach, including secure configuration, regular audits, dependency management, and robust detection mechanisms, is essential to mitigate this risk.  The development team should prioritize implementing the mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis and continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities and attack techniques.  Training developers on secure coding practices for OpenResty and Lua is also highly recommended.
