# Threat Model Analysis for openresty/openresty

## Threat: [Lua Code Injection](./threats/lua_code_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Lua Code Injection
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when processed by a Lua script within OpenResty, is interpreted as Lua code and executed. This typically occurs when user-supplied data is directly concatenated into Lua strings or used in dynamic code evaluation functions (like `loadstring`) without proper sanitization. The attacker can inject arbitrary Lua code, leading to complete control over the OpenResty worker process.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data exfiltration, arbitrary command execution (on the server), denial of service, modification of application behavior.
*   **Affected Component:** Lua scripts (`.lua` files) used within OpenResty, particularly those interacting with user input via `ngx.req.get_body_data()`, `ngx.req.get_uri_args()`, `ngx.req.get_headers()`, or similar functions.  Also affects any use of `loadstring` or similar dynamic code execution functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation & Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize *all* user-supplied data *before* it is used in any Lua code.  Use whitelisting (allowing only known-good characters) whenever possible.  Never directly embed user input into Lua code.
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** When interacting with databases from Lua, *always* use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection via Lua.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Generation:** Minimize or eliminate the use of `loadstring` and similar functions. If unavoidable, ensure the generated code is constructed from *completely trusted* sources and is still heavily sanitized.
    *   **Least Privilege (Lua):** Run Lua scripts with the minimum necessary privileges.  Restrict access to sensitive OpenResty APIs and system resources.
    *   **Code Review & Static Analysis:** Regularly review Lua code for potential injection vulnerabilities. Use static analysis tools designed for Lua security.

## Threat: [Lua Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/lua_resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Lua Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)
*   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted requests designed to trigger poorly written or computationally expensive Lua code. This causes excessive CPU usage, memory consumption, or exhaustion of other resources (e.g., file descriptors, cosockets) within the OpenResty worker processes. This leads to unresponsiveness or crashes, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, potential for complete server unresponsiveness.
*   **Affected Component:** Lua scripts (`.lua` files) within OpenResty, particularly those handling request processing (`content_by_lua_block`, `access_by_lua_block`, etc.). Also affects long-running timers or background tasks implemented in Lua.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement strict timeouts for Lua script execution using `ngx.timer.at` or similar mechanisms. Terminate long-running scripts to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce limits on memory usage and other resources within Lua scripts.
    *   **Efficient Code:** Write efficient and well-optimized Lua code. Avoid unnecessary loops, large data structures, and computationally expensive operations. Profile Lua code to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement robust rate limiting and request throttling (using OpenResty's built-in features or Lua modules) to prevent a single user or IP address from triggering excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Graceful Degradation:** Design the application to gracefully handle resource exhaustion. Use `ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE)` or similar to return an error response without crashing the worker process.

## Threat: [Lua Logic Errors (Security Bypass)](./threats/lua_logic_errors__security_bypass_.md)

*   **Threat:** Lua Logic Errors (Security Bypass)
*   **Description:** Flaws in the Lua code implementing authentication, authorization, or other security-critical logic create vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit these flaws to bypass security checks, gain unauthorized access to resources, or escalate privileges. Examples include incorrect access control checks, improper session management, or flawed input validation *within the Lua logic itself*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality, privilege escalation, data modification or deletion.
*   **Affected Component:** Lua scripts (`.lua` files) implementing security-critical logic (authentication, authorization, access control, session management).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test Lua code implementing security logic. Use unit tests, integration tests, and *focused* penetration testing to verify correct behavior and identify edge cases.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices for Lua, including proper error handling, input validation, and secure data handling.
    *   **Defense-in-Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security. Don't rely *solely* on Lua-based security checks. Use Nginx's built-in security features (e.g., `auth_basic`, `auth_request`) in conjunction with Lua-based checks.
    *   **Code Review:** Conduct regular, thorough code reviews, with a specific focus on the security-critical aspects of the Lua code.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Nginx Directives](./threats/misconfigured_nginx_directives.md)

*   **Threat:** Misconfigured Nginx Directives
*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured Nginx directives within the `nginx.conf` file (or included configuration files) can expose sensitive information, allow unauthorized access, or create other security weaknesses. This *specifically* includes misconfigured OpenResty directives like `access_by_lua_block`, `content_by_lua_block`, `rewrite_by_lua_block`, and improperly configured `location` blocks that interact with Lua code. A misconfigured `location` block might expose internal APIs or files intended to be protected.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the misconfiguration, ranging from information disclosure to complete server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `nginx.conf` file and any included configuration files. Specifically, directives related to OpenResty (e.g., `*_by_lua_block`, `*_by_lua_file`) and general Nginx security directives (e.g., `location`, `auth_basic`, `limit_req`) that are used in conjunction with OpenResty.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific misconfiguration)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Least Privilege:** Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring *all* Nginx directives. Grant only the absolutely necessary permissions to Lua scripts and users.
    *   **Configuration Review:** Regularly review and audit the entire `nginx.conf` file for security misconfigurations, paying close attention to OpenResty-related directives.
    *   **Configuration Management:** Use a configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to ensure consistent and secure configurations across all OpenResty instances.
    *   **Staging Environment:** *Always* validate configuration changes in a staging environment that mirrors production *before* deploying to production.
    *   **Documentation:** Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation of the Nginx configuration and its security implications.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies (OpenResty/Nginx/Lua Modules)](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies__openrestynginxlua_modules_.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Dependencies (OpenResty/Nginx/Lua Modules)
*   **Description:** OpenResty itself, the underlying Nginx core, or any third-party Lua modules used may contain known vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the server. This is a *direct* threat because OpenResty relies on these components.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to complete server compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, or other impacts.
*   **Affected Component:** OpenResty core, Nginx core, third-party Lua modules (installed via LuaRocks or other means).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability and its exploitability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep OpenResty, Nginx, and *all* Lua modules up to date with the latest security patches. This is the *most critical* mitigation.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to identify and track vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (including Lua modules).
    *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories and mailing lists for OpenResty, Nginx, and LuaRocks (and any other package managers used).
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., LuaRocks) to manage Lua module dependencies and ensure they are up to date.
    *   **Module Vetting:** Carefully vet any third-party Lua modules *before* using them in a production environment. Review the module's code, reputation, and security history.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks (Lua Modules)](./threats/supply_chain_attacks__lua_modules_.md)

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks (Lua Modules)
    *   **Description:**  An attacker compromises a Lua module repository (e.g., LuaRocks) or injects malicious code into a legitimate Lua module. When the compromised module is installed and used within OpenResty, the attacker's code is executed on the server. This is a direct threat because OpenResty relies on external Lua modules.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete server compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Third-party Lua modules installed via LuaRocks or other package managers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Trusted Repositories:** Use trusted package managers (e.g., LuaRocks) and official repositories whenever possible.
        *   **Module Verification:**  Verify the integrity of downloaded modules using checksums or digital signatures (if available from the repository or module author).
        *   **Code Auditing:**  Regularly audit the code of third-party Lua modules for potential vulnerabilities or malicious code, especially before major updates.
        *   **Vendoring/Mirroring:**  Consider vendoring (copying the source code of) critical Lua modules into your own repository or mirroring the LuaRocks repository to reduce reliance on external sources and gain more control over updates.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:**  Pin the versions of Lua modules in your project's dependencies to prevent unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code.
