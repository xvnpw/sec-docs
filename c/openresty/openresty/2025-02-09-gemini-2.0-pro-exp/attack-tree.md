## Attack Tree Path: [!!!Gain Unauthorized RCE on OpenResty Server!!! (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/!!!gain_unauthorized_rce_on_openresty_server!!!__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the attacker's ultimate objective: to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server running the OpenResty application. RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the OpenResty worker process, effectively giving them complete control over the application and potentially the underlying server.
*   **Likelihood:** Not applicable (This is the goal, not an attack step).
*   **Impact:** `Very High` - Complete system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and any other action the attacker chooses.
*   **Effort:** Not applicable.
*   **Skill Level:** Not applicable.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Not applicable.

## Attack Tree Path: [[***Exploit Lua Vulnerabilities***] (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_lua_vulnerabilities___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the overall strategy of exploiting vulnerabilities within the Lua scripting environment that OpenResty heavily relies on.  The attacker leverages weaknesses in how Lua code is handled, parsed, or executed to achieve their goal.
*   **Likelihood:** `Medium to High` - OpenResty's reliance on Lua makes it a prime target for attacks if secure coding practices are not followed meticulously.
*   **Impact:** `Very High` - Successful exploitation often leads directly to RCE.
*   **Effort:** `Variable` - Depends on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Skill Level:** `Intermediate to Expert` - Requires understanding of Lua and potential security pitfalls.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** `Medium to Hard` - Requires code analysis, intrusion detection, and potentially dynamic analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [[***Lua Code Injection***] (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_lua_code_injection___high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a specific type of vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious Lua code into the application. This typically occurs when user-supplied data is directly incorporated into Lua code without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Likelihood:** `Medium` - If input validation is weak or absent, this is a highly probable attack vector.
*   **Impact:** `Very High` - Direct path to RCE.
*   **Effort:** `Low` - Simple payloads can often achieve RCE if injection is possible.
*   **Skill Level:** `Intermediate` - Requires understanding of Lua syntax and how to craft malicious payloads.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** `Medium` - Can be detected with code analysis and intrusion detection systems, but sophisticated injections might be harder.

## Attack Tree Path: [[***Dynamic Evaluation***] (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_dynamic_evaluation___high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most dangerous form of Lua code injection, involving the use of functions like `loadstring`, `dofile`, or similar mechanisms that dynamically execute Lua code from a string. If this string contains unsanitized user input, the attacker can directly inject and execute arbitrary Lua code.
*   **Likelihood:** `Medium` (If dynamic evaluation is used with user input, it's highly exploitable. The likelihood depends on *if* it's used this way.)
*   **Impact:** `Very High` - Direct and immediate RCE.
*   **Effort:** `Low` - Very simple payloads can achieve RCE.
*   **Skill Level:** `Intermediate` - Requires basic understanding of Lua and the `loadstring` function (or equivalent).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** `Medium` - Can be detected with static code analysis (looking for `loadstring` and similar functions) and dynamic analysis (monitoring for suspicious code execution).  However, obfuscation can make detection harder.
