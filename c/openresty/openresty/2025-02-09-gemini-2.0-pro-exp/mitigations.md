# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for openresty/openresty

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Audit `nginx.conf` (Focus on OpenResty Directives)](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_audit__nginx_conf___focus_on_openresty_directives_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Schedule Regular Audits:**  As before, establish a recurring schedule.
2.  **OpenResty-Specific Checklist:**  Focus the checklist on OpenResty-related directives:
    *   Correct usage of `*_by_lua`, `*_by_lua_block`, and `*_by_lua_file` directives.
    *   Proper configuration of `lua_package_path` and `lua_package_cpath`.
    *   Secure use of shared dictionaries (`lua_shared_dict`).
    *   Appropriate settings for `lua_code_cache`.
    *   Correct use of OpenResty-specific modules (e.g., `lua-resty-*` libraries).
3.  **Automate (OpenResty Focus):**  Use tools that understand OpenResty configurations. While general Nginx linters are helpful, look for tools that can specifically analyze Lua code embedded within `nginx.conf`.
4.  **Version Control:**  As before, use version control.
5.  **Documentation:**  Document the purpose of all OpenResty-specific directives and Lua code blocks.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium to High):** Misconfigured OpenResty directives can leak information through Lua code.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium to High):**  Inefficient Lua code or improper use of shared dictionaries can lead to resource exhaustion.
*   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):**  Incorrectly implemented access control logic within Lua code can be bypassed.
*   **Code Injection (Severity: High):** Vulnerabilities in Lua code embedded in `nginx.conf` can be exploited.

**Impact:** (Similar to the previous, full audit, but focused on OpenResty-related risks)

**Currently Implemented:** *[Example:  Basic nginx.conf review, no specific OpenResty checks]*
**Missing Implementation:** *[Example:  Checklist items for OpenResty directives, tools for analyzing embedded Lua code]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Exposed Directives and Modules (OpenResty Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_exposed_directives_and_modules__openresty_focus_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Essential OpenResty Modules:**  Determine the minimum set of `lua-resty-*` modules needed.
2.  **Disable Unnecessary Modules:**  Remove or comment out any unused `lua-resty-*` modules from your `nginx.conf` and Lua code.  This often involves removing `require` statements in your Lua code.
3.  **Review OpenResty Directives:**  Examine directives like `lua_shared_dict` and `lua_code_cache` to ensure they are only used when necessary and configured securely.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploitation of Module Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium to High):** Reduces the attack surface by limiting the number of potentially vulnerable `lua-resty-*` modules.

**Impact:** (Similar to before, but focused on OpenResty modules)

**Currently Implemented:** *[Example:  Using a few lua-resty-* libraries, no systematic review]*
**Missing Implementation:** *[Example:  Comprehensive review of all required lua-resty-* modules, removal of unused ones]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to Sensitive Locations (Using OpenResty for Access Control)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_sensitive_locations__using_openresty_for_access_control_.md)

**Description:**
1. **Identify Sensitive Locations:** As before.
2. **`access_by_lua*` for Access Control:** Use the `access_by_lua*` directives (or `access_by_lua_block`, `access_by_lua_file`) to implement access control logic in Lua. This allows for more complex and dynamic access control than standard Nginx directives.
3. **Implement Authentication/Authorization in Lua:** Write Lua code within the `access_by_lua*` block to perform authentication (verify user identity) and authorization (check user permissions). This might involve:
    * Checking user credentials against a database (using a non-blocking OpenResty database library).
    * Validating JWTs (JSON Web Tokens).
    * Implementing role-based access control (RBAC).
    * Integrating with external authentication providers.
4. **`ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN)`:** Use `ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN)` (or other appropriate HTTP status codes) within the Lua code to deny access if the user is not authorized.
5. **Regular Review:** Periodically review the Lua code implementing access control to ensure it's still secure and effective.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive resources, enforced by Lua logic.
*   **Bypass of Access Controls (Severity: High):** More robust access control logic in Lua can be harder to bypass than simple Nginx directives.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly reduces the risk, providing more flexible and dynamic control than basic Nginx directives.
*   **Bypass of Access Controls:** Makes it more difficult for attackers to circumvent security measures.

**Currently Implemented:** *[Example: Using `access_by_lua_file` for basic authentication, but no authorization logic]*
**Missing Implementation:** *[Example: Implement role-based authorization in Lua, integrate with a more secure authentication system (e.g., JWT)]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep LuaJIT Updated (as part of OpenResty)](./mitigation_strategies/keep_luajit_updated__as_part_of_openresty_.md)

**Description:** (Same as before, but emphasize updating OpenResty itself, as that's how you typically get LuaJIT updates in this context).
1.  **Monitor OpenResty Releases:**  Focus on monitoring for new OpenResty releases, as these bundle LuaJIT.
2.  **Update OpenResty:**  Update the entire OpenResty installation, not just LuaJIT separately.
3.  **Automated Updates (if possible):** Automate the OpenResty update process.
4.  **Rollback Plan:**  Have a plan to roll back the entire OpenResty installation.

**Threats Mitigated:** (Same as before)
*   **Exploitation of LuaJIT Vulnerabilities (Severity: High):**

**Impact:** (Same as before)

**Currently Implemented:** *[Example:  Manual OpenResty updates, no defined process]*
**Missing Implementation:** *[Example:  Automated OpenResty update process, monitoring for security advisories, rollback plan]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Blocking Operations in Lua Code (OpenResty-Specific APIs)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_blocking_operations_in_lua_code__openresty-specific_apis_.md)

**Description:** (Focus on using OpenResty's non-blocking APIs)
1.  **Identify Blocking Operations:**  As before.
2.  **Use OpenResty's Non-Blocking APIs:**  *This is the core OpenResty-specific part*.  Prioritize using:
    *   **`ngx.socket.tcp` and `ngx.socket.udp`:**  For all network I/O.
    *   **`ngx.sleep`:**  For delays.
    *   **`ngx.timer.at`:** For scheduling tasks without blocking.
    *   **OpenResty-compatible libraries:**  Use libraries like `lua-resty-mysql`, `lua-resty-redis`, etc., which are designed for non-blocking operation within OpenResty.  *Avoid* standard Lua libraries that might perform blocking I/O.
3.  **Cosockets (with Caution):**  Understand the limitations of cosockets.  Use them for concurrency, but avoid excessive creation or long-running operations within cosockets.
4. **Asynchronous techniques:** Use asynchronous programming with OpenResty APIs.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):**

**Impact:** (Same as before)

**Currently Implemented:** *[Example:  Using ngx.socket.tcp for some network operations, but still using a blocking Redis library]*
**Missing Implementation:** *[Example:  Replace the blocking Redis library with lua-resty-redis, review all Lua code for any remaining blocking calls]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Only Trusted and Well-Maintained Modules (Focus on `lua-resty-*` Modules)](./mitigation_strategies/use_only_trusted_and_well-maintained_modules__focus_on__lua-resty-__modules_.md)
