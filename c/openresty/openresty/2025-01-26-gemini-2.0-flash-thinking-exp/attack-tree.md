## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Known Nginx CVE [HR]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_known_nginx_cve__hr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in the Nginx core that OpenResty relies upon.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow in Nginx Core [CR]:**  Exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities to gain control of the server.
    *   **Integer Overflow in Nginx Core [CR]:** Exploiting integer overflow vulnerabilities, potentially leading to memory corruption or unexpected behavior.
    *   **HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting [HR]:** Manipulating HTTP requests to bypass security controls or access unauthorized resources due to discrepancies in how Nginx and backend applications parse requests.
    *   **Exploit Undisclosed Nginx Vulnerability [CR]:** Exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Nginx, which is unknown to the public and potentially unpatched.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. LuaJIT JIT Compiler Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/2__luajit_jit_compiler_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting bugs within the LuaJIT Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which is a core component of OpenResty for performance optimization.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **JIT Code Execution via Crafted Input [CR]:** Crafting specific inputs that trigger a bug in the JIT compiler, leading to arbitrary code execution within the OpenResty process.
    *   **Memory Corruption via JIT Bug [CR]:** Triggering memory corruption vulnerabilities through JIT compiler bugs, potentially leading to crashes, denial of service, or code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Vulnerability in Third-Party Lua Libraries [HR]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__vulnerability_in_third-party_lua_libraries__hr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities present in third-party Lua libraries used by the OpenResty application. This includes libraries installed via LuaRocks or bundled with OpenResty but not directly maintained by the core team.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Vulnerability in Third-Party Lua Libraries [HR]:**  Any exploitable flaw in a third-party Lua library that can be leveraged to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Lua FFI (Foreign Function Interface) Misuse [HR]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__lua_ffi__foreign_function_interface__misuse__hr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from the use of Lua Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to interact with external C libraries. Incorrect usage or lack of proper validation at the FFI boundary can introduce security flaws.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Lua FFI (Foreign Function Interface) Misuse [HR]:**  Vulnerabilities stemming from improper or insecure use of Lua FFI, leading to potential memory corruption, code execution, or other issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Lua Code Injection [HR] [CR]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__lua_code_injection__hr___cr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious Lua code into the application through unsanitized user inputs, which are then executed within the OpenResty Lua context.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Inject Lua Code via HTTP Parameters/Headers [HR] [CR]:** Injecting Lua code through HTTP GET or POST parameters or HTTP headers.
    *   **Inject Lua Code via Cookies [HR] [CR]:** Injecting Lua code through HTTP cookies.
    *   **Inject Lua Code via External Data Sources (e.g., database, files) [HR] [CR]:** Injecting Lua code by manipulating data in external sources (databases, files) that are then processed by the Lua application without proper sanitization.
    *   **Execute Arbitrary Lua Code [CR]:** Successfully executing injected Lua code within the OpenResty environment.
    *   **Gain Code Execution within OpenResty Context [CR]:** Achieving arbitrary code execution, leading to potential full compromise of the application and server.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Misconfiguration of OpenResty Directives [HR]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__misconfiguration_of_openresty_directives__hr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities caused by insecure or incorrect configuration of OpenResty-specific directives, particularly Lua-related directives.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Insecure Directives Usage [HR]:** General misconfiguration of OpenResty directives leading to vulnerabilities.
    *   **`access_by_lua*`, `content_by_lua*`, etc. Misuse [HR]:** Specifically misusing Lua directives like `access_by_lua_file`, `content_by_lua_block`, etc., which can lead to bypasses, information disclosure, or other security issues.
    *   **Insecure File Handling in Lua [HR]:** Misconfiguring file access permissions or improperly handling file paths within Lua scripts, leading to path traversal or unauthorized file access.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Specific to OpenResty [HR]:](./attack_tree_paths/7__denial_of_service__dos__attacks_specific_to_openresty__hr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Launching Denial of Service attacks that specifically target OpenResty's Lua scripting capabilities or amplify traditional Nginx DoS vectors through Lua.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Lua Script Resource Exhaustion [HR]:** Causing DoS by triggering resource-intensive Lua scripts that consume excessive CPU, memory, or block Nginx worker processes.
        *   **CPU Exhaustion via Lua Script [HR]:**  Specifically exhausting CPU resources through computationally intensive Lua code.
        *   **Memory Exhaustion via Lua Script [HR]:** Specifically exhausting memory resources through Lua scripts that leak memory or allocate excessive amounts.
        *   **Blocking Operations in Lua (e.g., synchronous I/O) [HR]:** Causing DoS by introducing blocking operations in Lua request handlers, tying up Nginx worker processes and preventing them from handling new requests.
    *   **Nginx DoS amplified by Lua [HR]:** Using Lua logic to amplify traditional Nginx DoS attacks, making them more effective.
        *   **Slowloris/Slow HTTP DoS via Lua [HR]:** Implementing Slowloris or Slow HTTP DoS attacks using Lua scripting to maintain slow connections and exhaust server resources.
        *   **Amplified Request Processing via Lua Logic [HR]:** Designing Lua logic that performs computationally expensive operations for each request, amplifying the impact of a high volume of requests and leading to DoS.

These High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes represent the most significant threats to an OpenResty application based on likelihood and impact. Focusing mitigation efforts on these areas will provide the most effective security improvements.
