# Threat Model Analysis for openresty/openresty

## Threat: [Lua Injection](./threats/lua_injection.md)

Description: An attacker injects malicious Lua code by manipulating user input that is directly incorporated into Lua scripts. This allows execution of arbitrary Lua code on the server.
Impact: Critical - Full server compromise, arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
Affected OpenResty Component: `ngx_http_lua_module`, Lua scripting environment, `ngx.eval`.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    Input Sanitization: Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs before using them in Lua code.
    Parameterization: Avoid dynamic code construction based on user input.
    Principle of Least Privilege: Run OpenResty with minimal necessary privileges.
    Code Review: Conduct regular code reviews for Lua injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Lua Libraries](./threats/vulnerable_lua_libraries.md)

Description: Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in Lua libraries used by the OpenResty application by triggering vulnerable code paths within these libraries.
Impact: High - Can range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the library vulnerability.
Affected OpenResty Component: Lua scripting environment, third-party Lua libraries, core Lua libraries.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Dependency Management: Maintain an inventory of Lua libraries.
    Regular Updates: Keep Lua libraries updated to patch vulnerabilities.
    Vulnerability Scanning: Regularly scan Lua libraries for known vulnerabilities.
    Reputable Sources: Use libraries from trusted sources.

## Threat: [Logic Flaws in Lua Code](./threats/logic_flaws_in_lua_code.md)

Description: Attackers exploit logical errors or bugs in the application's Lua code to bypass security controls or gain unauthorized access by manipulating requests to trigger unintended behavior.
Impact: High - Can lead to access control bypasses, data manipulation, information disclosure, or denial of service.
Affected OpenResty Component: Lua scripting environment, application-specific Lua code.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Secure Coding Practices: Implement secure coding practices in Lua.
    Thorough Testing: Conduct comprehensive security testing.
    Code Review: Perform regular code reviews by security-conscious developers.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Lua](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_lua.md)

Description: An attacker crafts requests that trigger resource-intensive Lua code, leading to excessive CPU, memory, or file descriptor consumption and causing denial of service.
Impact: High - Denial of Service, application unavailability, performance degradation.
Affected OpenResty Component: Lua scripting environment, application-specific Lua code, `ngx_http_lua_module`, `ngx.sleep`.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Resource Limits in Lua: Implement resource limits within Lua code.
    Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting at the Nginx or Lua level.
    Input Validation: Validate inputs to prevent resource-intensive code paths.
    Code Review (Performance): Review Lua code for performance bottlenecks.
    Monitoring and Alerting: Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Nginx Directives with Lua](./threats/misconfiguration_of_nginx_directives_with_lua.md)

Description: Incorrectly configured Nginx directives interacting with Lua modules can create security vulnerabilities, bypassing security measures or exposing sensitive information.
Impact: High - Can lead to access control bypasses, information disclosure, denial of service.
Affected OpenResty Component: Nginx configuration, `ngx_http_lua_module`, Nginx core directives, `location` blocks.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Configuration Review: Thoroughly review Nginx configurations involving Lua.
    Principle of Least Privilege (Configuration): Apply least privilege in Nginx configuration.
    Configuration Management: Use configuration management tools for consistency.
    Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of Nginx configurations.

## Threat: [Bypassing Nginx Security Features via Lua](./threats/bypassing_nginx_security_features_via_lua.md)

Description: Lua code might inadvertently or intentionally bypass security features built into Nginx, such as rate limiting or access control lists, weakening the intended security posture.
Impact: High - Access Control Bypass, Denial of Service, weakened security.
Affected OpenResty Component: Nginx configuration, `ngx_http_lua_module`, Nginx core security modules, request processing order.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Understand Request Processing Order: Understand Nginx and Lua request processing order.
    Use Nginx Security Modules: Leverage Nginx's built-in security modules.
    Careful Lua Module Placement: Place Lua modules appropriately in Nginx configuration.
    Security Testing (Integration): Test Lua and Nginx security feature integration.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Lua](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_lua.md)

Description: If Lua code makes external HTTP requests based on user input without validation, attackers can perform SSRF attacks to access internal resources or external systems.
Impact: High - Information Disclosure (internal resources), Internal Network Access, Potential RCE on internal systems.
Affected OpenResty Component: Lua scripting environment, `ngx_http_lua_module`, `ngx.location.capture`, `ngx.socket.tcp`.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Input Validation (URLs): Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided URLs.
    URL Parsing and Validation Libraries: Use robust URL parsing libraries in Lua.
    Restrict Outbound Network Access: Restrict outbound network access from OpenResty server.
    Avoid User-Controlled URLs: Minimize use of user-controlled URLs in Lua HTTP requests.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in OpenResty Core Modules](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_openresty_core_modules.md)

Description: Bugs and vulnerabilities within the core OpenResty modules themselves (C code) can be exploited by crafted requests or specific conditions.
Impact: Critical to High - Can range from denial of service to remote code execution.
Affected OpenResty Component: OpenResty core modules (e.g., `ngx_http_lua_module`, `ngx_stream_lua_module`), C code of OpenResty.
Risk Severity: Critical to High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Regular Updates (OpenResty): Keep OpenResty updated to patch core module vulnerabilities.
    Security Monitoring (OpenResty): Monitor OpenResty security advisories.
    Minimize Custom Modules: Minimize use of custom third-party Nginx modules.

## Threat: [Third-Party Module Vulnerabilities](./threats/third-party_module_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities in third-party Nginx modules compiled with OpenResty can be exploited by targeting known module vulnerabilities.
Impact: High - Can range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the module vulnerability.
Affected OpenResty Component: Third-party Nginx modules, C code of third-party modules.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Module Selection: Carefully select third-party modules from reputable sources.
    Vulnerability Scanning (Modules): Scan third-party modules for vulnerabilities.
    Regular Updates (Modules): Keep third-party modules updated.
    Minimize Module Usage: Minimize the number of third-party modules used.
