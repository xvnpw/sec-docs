## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in libevent (Known CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_libevent__known_cves_.md)

*   **Overall Path:** `[HIGH RISK]` - This is a high-risk path due to the readily available information about known vulnerabilities and the potential for high impact (RCE or significant DoS).

    *   **1.1 Identify Vulnerable Version:** `*CRITICAL*`
        *   **Description:** The attacker determines the specific version of `libevent` used by the target application.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Depending on information exposure)
        *   **Impact:** N/A (Reconnaissance step)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low to Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy

    *   **1.2 Craft Exploit Payload:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker obtains or creates an exploit payload tailored to the identified vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If a public exploit exists) to Low (If a new exploit needs to be developed)
        *   **Impact:** N/A (Preparation step)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Using public exploit) to High (Developing new exploit)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Using public exploit) to Expert (Developing new exploit)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1.3 Deliver Payload via Network:** `*CRITICAL*`
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends the crafted exploit payload to the vulnerable application, typically over a network connection.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (If the vulnerable service is network-facing)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (RCE or significant DoS)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion (Event Queue Overflow)](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion__event_queue_overflow_.md)

*   **Overall Path (to DoS):** `[HIGH RISK]` - This path is high-risk because flooding attacks are relatively easy to execute and can reliably cause a Denial of Service.  The path to RCE via this method is less likely, but the DoS is a significant impact.

    *   **2.1 Flood with Connections/Messages:** `*CRITICAL*`
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends a large volume of network connections or messages to the application, overwhelming `libevent`'s event queue.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Depends on application capacity and rate limiting)
        *   **Impact:** N/A (Attack execution step)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

    *   **2.2 Observe for Event Queue Buildup:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker monitors the application to confirm that the event queue is growing, indicating the attack is working.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (If the attack is successful)
        *   **Impact:** N/A (Monitoring step)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **2.3 Leverage Overflow for DoS or Potential Code Execution:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits the overflowed event queue to cause a Denial of Service (application crash) or, less likely, achieve Remote Code Execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (For DoS) to Low (For RCE)
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (DoS) or Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low (For DoS) to High (For RCE)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (For DoS) to Expert (For RCE)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (For DoS) to Hard (For RCE)
