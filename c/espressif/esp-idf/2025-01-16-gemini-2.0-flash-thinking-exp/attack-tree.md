## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Firmware Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_firmware_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path represents attacks targeting the core firmware of the ESP-IDF application. Success here often leads to complete control of the device.

    *   **Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
        *   This is a critical node because memory corruption vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, format string bugs, use-after-free) are common in C/C++ based systems like ESP-IDF and can lead to arbitrary code execution.
            *   **Buffer Overflows (Heap/Stack) (Critical Node):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Writing beyond the allocated memory boundaries, overwriting adjacent data or control flow information.
                *   **Risk:** High likelihood due to common programming errors, high impact (remote code execution).
            *   **Format String Bugs (Critical Node):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting improper handling of format strings to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.
                *   **Risk:** Lower likelihood due to increased awareness, but high impact (remote code execution).
            *   **Use-After-Free (Critical Node):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing memory that has already been freed, leading to crashes or exploitable conditions.
                *   **Risk:** Medium likelihood due to complex memory management, high impact (remote code execution, denial of service).
    *   **Exploit Cryptographic Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
        *   This is a critical node because weaknesses in cryptography can undermine the security of the entire system, allowing attackers to bypass authentication, decrypt sensitive data, or forge communications.
            *   **Weak or Broken Cryptography (Critical Node):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Using outdated or insecure cryptographic algorithms that can be easily broken.
                *   **Risk:** Medium likelihood if developers don't follow best practices, high impact (data compromise, authentication bypass).
            *   **Improper Key Management (Critical Node):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Storing keys insecurely (e.g., hardcoding), making them easily accessible to attackers.
                *   **Risk:** Medium likelihood due to developer errors, high impact (complete system compromise).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Network Stack Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_network_stack_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the networking components of ESP-IDF, potentially allowing remote compromise.

    *   **Exploiting TCP/IP Stack Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
        *   This is a critical node because the TCP/IP stack is fundamental for network communication, and vulnerabilities here can have widespread impact.
            *   **Exploiting Specific Protocol Vulnerabilities (e.g., in mDNS, HTTP server) (Critical Node):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in specific network protocols implemented within ESP-IDF.
                *   **Risk:** Lower likelihood (requires finding new vulnerabilities or unpatched systems), but high impact (remote code execution, information disclosure).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Secure Boot/Flash Encryption Weaknesses (Critical Node) (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_secure_bootflash_encryption_weaknesses__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path targets the core security mechanisms designed to protect the device's firmware. Bypassing these mechanisms grants significant control to the attacker.

    *   **Bypassing Secure Boot (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in the secure boot process to load unauthorized or malicious firmware.
            *   **Exploiting vulnerabilities in the bootloader (Critical Node):**
                *   **Risk:** Low likelihood if secure boot is correctly implemented, but high impact (full control of the device).
    *   **Bypassing Flash Encryption (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Circumventing flash encryption to gain access to the device's firmware and potentially sensitive data.
            *   **Exploiting weaknesses in the encryption algorithm or key management (Critical Node):**
                *   **Risk:** Low likelihood if implemented correctly, but high impact (firmware access, data extraction).
