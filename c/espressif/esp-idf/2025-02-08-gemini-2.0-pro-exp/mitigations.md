# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for espressif/esp-idf

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Boot and Flash Encryption (ESP-IDF Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_boot_and_flash_encryption__esp-idf_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable and correctly configure ESP-IDF's Secure Boot (v2) and Flash Encryption features.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Keys:** Use the `espsecure.py` tool (part of ESP-IDF) to generate a secure boot signing key and a flash encryption key.  Store these keys *securely*.
    2.  **Configure Project:** In your project's `sdkconfig`, enable `CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_V2_ENABLED` and `CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENC_ENABLED`.  Select the appropriate key management scheme for flash encryption (e.g., "Release" mode for production).
    3.  **Flash Keys:** Use `espefuse.py` to flash the generated keys to the device's eFuses.  Choose between "Development" (reflashable) and "Release" (irreversible) modes appropriately.
    4.  **Sign Firmware:** Use `espsecure.py sign_data` to sign your application binary (`.bin` file) with the secure boot signing key.
    5.  **Flash Firmware:** Flash the signed firmware to the device using ESP-IDF's flashing tools (e.g., `idf.py flash`).
    6.  **Burn eFuses (Production):**  *After thorough testing*, use `espefuse.py` to burn the eFuses that permanently enable Secure Boot and Flash Encryption, and disable JTAG. This is *irreversible*.
    7. **Disable JTAG:** Use `espefuse.py burn_efuse DISABLE_DL_JTAG` to disable JTAG.

    * Anti-rollback: Not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Wi-Fi Security (ESP-IDF Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/wi-fi_security__esp-idf_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize ESP-IDF's Wi-Fi APIs to implement strong Wi-Fi security (WPA2/WPA3) and secure configuration.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Strong Protocol:** Use the `wifi_config_t` structure in your ESP-IDF code.  Set `wifi_config.sta.threshold.authmode` to `WIFI_AUTH_WPA2_PSK` or `WIFI_AUTH_WPA3_PSK`.  Avoid `WIFI_AUTH_OPEN` and `WIFI_AUTH_WEP`.
    2.  **Strong Passphrase:** Set `wifi_config.sta.password` to a strong, randomly generated passphrase.
    3.  **Disable WPS:** Ensure WPS is disabled (default in ESP-IDF).
    4.  **SSID and Password Storage:** If storing SSID/password in NVS, use ESP-IDF's NVS encryption features.
    5. **(Optional) MAC Address Filtering:** If desired, implement using `esp_wifi_set_mac()` and related functions.
    6. **(Optional) Hidden SSID:** If desired, configure using ESP-IDF Wi-Fi configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access (High):** Prevents unauthorized Wi-Fi connections.
    *   **Eavesdropping (High):** Protects Wi-Fi traffic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TLS/SSL for Network Communication (ESP-IDF Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/tlsssl_for_network_communication__esp-idf_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Use ESP-IDF's mbedTLS library for TLS/SSL, ensuring proper server certificate validation.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use HTTPS:** Always use `https://` URLs.
    2.  **mbedTLS:** Use the mbedTLS API within ESP-IDF.
    3.  **Certificate Verification:** Configure mbedTLS to *verify* the server's certificate:
        *   **Embed CA Certificate:** Embed the CA certificate (or bundle) as a C string in your firmware.
        *   **Verification Flags:** Use `mbedtls_ssl_conf_authmode()` to set `MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_REQUIRED`.
        *   **CA Certificate:** Use `mbedtls_ssl_conf_ca_chain()` to provide the embedded CA certificate.
        *   **Hostname Verification:** Use `mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname()` to verify the hostname.
    4.  **Strong Ciphersuites:** Configure mbedTLS to use strong ciphersuites (review and potentially whitelist).
    5.  **TLS Version:** Use `mbedtls_ssl_conf_min_version()` and `mbedtls_ssl_conf_max_version()` to prefer TLS 1.2 or 1.3.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Critical):** Prevents MitM attacks.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (Critical):** Encrypts network traffic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure OTA Updates (ESP-IDF Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_ota_updates__esp-idf_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement signed OTA updates using ESP-IDF's OTA components and anti-rollback features.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate OTA Signing Key:** Use `espsecure.py` to generate a *separate* OTA signing key.
    2.  **Configure OTA:** Use ESP-IDF's OTA components (e.g., `esp_https_ota`).
    3.  **Sign OTA Images:** Sign OTA images using `espsecure.py sign_data` with the OTA key.
    4.  **Secure Update Server:** Use HTTPS for the update server.
    5.  **Verification on Device:** The device should:
        *   Download the update.
        *   Verify the signature using the embedded public key (part of ESP-IDF OTA process).
        *   Apply the update only if the signature is valid.
    6.  **Rollback Protection:** Use ESP-IDF's anti-rollback feature with Secure Boot:
        *   Increment a software version number.
        *   Store the version in a secure location (eFuse).
        *   Bootloader checks the version and refuses older versions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious OTA Updates (Critical):** Prevents malicious firmware via OTA.
    *   **Rollback Attacks (High):** Prevents downgrading to vulnerable versions via OTA.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Protecting Sensitive Data in NVS (ESP-IDF Specific):](./mitigation_strategies/protecting_sensitive_data_in_nvs__esp-idf_specific_.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize ESP-IDF's NVS (Non-Volatile Storage) features, including encryption, to protect sensitive data stored in flash.
* **Description:**
    1.  **Use NVS Partitions:** Organize your NVS data into different partitions using the ESP-IDF partition table. This allows you to apply different security settings to different types of data.
    2.  **Enable NVS Encryption:** If storing sensitive data in NVS (e.g., Wi-Fi credentials, API keys), enable NVS encryption. This is configured in the partition table. Use the `nvs_flash_init_partition()` function to initialize an encrypted partition.
    3. **Key Management for NVS Encryption:** ESP-IDF provides mechanisms for managing the NVS encryption keys.  Ensure these keys are protected (ideally, use flash encryption as well).  Consider using a separate key for NVS encryption than for general flash encryption.
    4. **Avoid Storing Raw Keys:** If possible, avoid storing raw cryptographic keys directly in NVS.  Derive keys from a master secret using a key derivation function (KDF) provided by mbedTLS, or use key wrapping techniques.
    5. **Access Control:** Use different NVS namespaces to control access to different data items.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Data Extraction from NVS (High):** If flash encryption is bypassed or the key is compromised, NVS encryption provides an additional layer of protection.
    * **Unauthorized Modification of NVS Data (High):** NVS encryption, combined with secure boot, helps prevent unauthorized modification of configuration data.

* **Impact:**
    * **Data Extraction from NVS:** Risk reduced from High to Low (if NVS encryption is used in addition to flash encryption).
    * **Unauthorized Modification of NVS Data:** Risk reduced from High to Low (when combined with secure boot).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * NVS is used for storing configuration.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * NVS Encryption: *Critically missing*. Sensitive data in NVS is not encrypted.
    * NVS Partitioning for Security: Not implemented.
    * Key Derivation/Wrapping: Not implemented.
