## Attack Tree Path: [[***1***] Wi-Fi Stack Buffer Overflow](./attack_tree_paths/_1__wi-fi_stack_buffer_overflow.md)

*Description:* An attacker sends specially crafted Wi-Fi packets (e.g., during the WPA2/3 handshake or in management frames) that exceed the allocated buffer size in the ESP-IDF's Wi-Fi stack. This can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*Likelihood:* Low
*Impact:* High (Remote Code Execution)
*Effort:* Medium
*Skill Level:* Advanced
*Detection Difficulty:* Medium
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Rigorous fuzz testing of the Wi-Fi stack, particularly around handshake and management frame processing.
    *   Implement robust input validation and bounds checking in the Wi-Fi stack code.
    *   Use memory safety tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer) during development.
    *   Regularly update ESP-IDF to the latest stable version to incorporate security patches.

## Attack Tree Path: [[***2***] Wi-Fi Deauthentication/Disassociation Attack](./attack_tree_paths/_2__wi-fi_deauthenticationdisassociation_attack.md)

*Description:* An attacker sends deauthentication or disassociation frames to the ESP32 device or the access point, forcing the device to disconnect from the network. This can cause a denial of service (DoS) or, more critically, force the device to attempt reconnection, potentially to a rogue access point controlled by the attacker.
*Likelihood:* High
*Impact:* Medium (Denial of Service, potential for further attacks)
*Effort:* Very Low
*Skill Level:* Novice
*Detection Difficulty:* Easy
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Implement robust handling of deauthentication/disassociation frames in the ESP-IDF Wi-Fi stack.
    *   Consider using 802.11w (Protected Management Frames) to mitigate these attacks, if supported by the access point and the ESP32 device.
    *   Educate users about the risks of connecting to unknown or untrusted Wi-Fi networks.
    *   Implement network monitoring to detect excessive deauthentication/disassociation attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[!!!12!!!] Security Component Vulnerability (e.g., mbedTLS flaws)](./attack_tree_paths/_!!!12!!!__security_component_vulnerability__e_g___mbedtls_flaws_.md)

*Description:* A vulnerability exists within a core security component of ESP-IDF, such as the mbedTLS library (used for cryptography and secure communication) or other crypto-related modules. This could involve flaws in cryptographic algorithms, key management, or implementation bugs that allow for bypassing security mechanisms.
*Likelihood:* Low
*Impact:* Very High (Compromise of all security features)
*Effort:* High
*Skill Level:* Advanced
*Detection Difficulty:* Hard
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Keep mbedTLS (and all other security-related components) updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Use strong cryptographic algorithms and key lengths, following best practices for secure coding.
    *   Thoroughly validate all cryptographic operations and key exchange processes.
    *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing of the security components.
    *   Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) if available and appropriate for the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[***14***] OTA Update Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/_14__ota_update_vulnerability.md)

*Description:* An attacker exploits weaknesses in the Over-the-Air (OTA) update process to install malicious firmware on the ESP32 device. This could involve a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept and modify the update, bypassing signature verification, or exploiting flaws in the update mechanism itself.
*Likelihood:* Medium
*Impact:* Very High (Complete device compromise)
*Effort:* Medium
*Skill Level:* Advanced
*Detection Difficulty:* Medium
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Implement a secure OTA update mechanism with strong signature verification using robust cryptographic algorithms.
    *   Use a secure channel (e.g., HTTPS with certificate pinning) for downloading updates.
    *   Implement rollback protection to prevent downgrading to vulnerable firmware versions.
    *   Consider using a dual-bank update mechanism to allow for safe rollback in case of a failed or malicious update.
    *   Regularly audit the OTA update process and code for vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement secure boot to ensure that only authorized firmware can be executed.
