## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Buffer Overflow in Input Handling (under "Exploit Nuklear Library Vulnerabilities" -> "Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities")](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__buffer_overflow_in_input_handling__under_exploit_nuklear_library_vulnerabilities_-_m_377c7f79.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** Nuklear library might fail to properly validate the length of input data when processing text input, specifically in functions like `nk_edit_buffer` or `nk_textedit`. This can lead to writing data beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Excessively Long Text Input via UI Elements:**
        *   Attacker provides very long strings into text fields, text areas, or combo box inputs within the application's UI.
        *   This input is processed by Nuklear without sufficient length checks, causing a buffer overflow.
    *   **Manipulated Input Data:**
        *   If the application allows loading UI definitions or data from external sources (e.g., files, network), an attacker could craft malicious UI data containing oversized text inputs.
        *   When Nuklear processes this malicious UI data, it triggers the buffer overflow.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Heap Overflow in Widget Rendering/Layout (under "Exploit Nuklear Library Vulnerabilities" -> "Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities")](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__heap_overflow_in_widget_renderinglayout__under_exploit_nuklear_library_vulnerabiliti_ad164301.md)

*   **Vulnerability:**  Nuklear's widget layout and rendering logic might contain flaws that lead to heap overflows when processing complex or specifically crafted UI structures. This could occur during memory allocation for widget rendering or layout calculations.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Maliciously Crafted UI Layouts:**
        *   Attacker designs a UI layout with deeply nested widgets, an excessive number of UI elements, or specific combinations of widget properties that stress Nuklear's layout engine.
        *   This complex layout triggers excessive heap allocations or incorrect size calculations within Nuklear, leading to a heap overflow during rendering.
    *   **Exploiting Widget Properties:**
        *   Attacker manipulates specific widget properties (e.g., sizes, positions, text content) through UI interaction or crafted UI data to trigger a heap overflow during the rendering process of those widgets.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Use-After-Free Vulnerability (under "Exploit Nuklear Library Vulnerabilities" -> "Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities")](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__use-after-free_vulnerability__under_exploit_nuklear_library_vulnerabilities_-_memory_fca4c803.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** Nuklear's internal memory management, particularly related to widget lifecycle, event handling, or resource cleanup, might have use-after-free vulnerabilities. This happens when memory is freed but still accessed later.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Specific UI Interaction Sequences:**
        *   Attacker performs a precise sequence of UI interactions (e.g., rapidly creating and destroying widgets, triggering specific event combinations) that causes Nuklear to free memory prematurely.
        *   Subsequent UI operations or event handling within Nuklear then attempt to access this freed memory, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
    *   **Exploiting Event Handling Race Conditions:**
        *   If Nuklear's event handling is not properly synchronized, race conditions might occur where memory is freed in one event handler while another event handler is still attempting to access it.
        *   Attacker could try to trigger such race conditions through rapid UI interactions or by manipulating event timing.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Improper Input Sanitization Before Nuklear (under "Exploit Application's Misuse of Nuklear Library")](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__improper_input_sanitization_before_nuklear__under_exploit_application's_misuse_of_nu_758aa6ef.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** The application using Nuklear fails to properly sanitize or validate user input *before* passing it to Nuklear functions. This allows malicious input to reach Nuklear and potentially exploit vulnerabilities within Nuklear itself or be processed unsafely by the application later.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct Injection through UI Elements:**
        *   Attacker enters malicious input (e.g., excessively long strings, format strings, shell commands, script code) into UI elements like text fields, combo boxes, or any input mechanism provided by the application.
        *   The application passes this unsanitized input directly to Nuklear functions (e.g., for display, editing, or processing).
        *   If Nuklear has vulnerabilities related to handling such input, they can be triggered. Even if Nuklear is safe, the application might process this malicious input later in a vulnerable way.
    *   **Bypassing Client-Side Validation:**
        *   If the application only relies on client-side (e.g., JavaScript in a web context, or UI-level checks) input validation, an attacker can bypass these checks.
        *   They can directly send crafted requests or manipulate application data to inject malicious input that reaches the server-side application and is then passed to Nuklear without proper server-side sanitization.
