# Threat Model Analysis for vurtun/nuklear

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Text Input Fields](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_text_input_fields.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides excessively long input to a text input field within the Nuklear UI. This overflows the allocated buffer in Nuklear's internal memory, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions. The attacker might be able to cause a crash, corrupt data, or in more sophisticated scenarios, potentially execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** High - Application crash, denial of service, potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Nuklear Component Affected:** `nk_edit_buffer`, `nk_textedit` (Input handling functions and data structures).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to Nuklear's text input functions. Limit input length on the application side. Review Nuklear's source code for input buffer handling. Use safe string handling functions in application code.

## Threat: [General Memory Corruption Bugs](./threats/general_memory_corruption_bugs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker triggers a memory safety bug in Nuklear (e.g., use-after-free, double-free, out-of-bounds access) through crafted UI interactions or by providing specific input data. This can corrupt memory, leading to crashes, denial of service, or potentially exploitable conditions for code execution.
*   **Impact:** High - Application crash, denial of service, potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Nuklear Component Affected:** Various Nuklear modules, potentially related to memory management, UI element handling, rendering, or input processing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools on Nuklear's source code. Perform fuzz testing with diverse UI interactions and inputs. Regularly update Nuklear to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes. Employ memory safety tools during development and testing.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Size Calculations](./threats/integer_overflow_in_size_calculations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides extremely large values or triggers UI interactions that cause integer overflows in Nuklear's internal calculations related to UI element sizes, positions, or buffer allocations. This can lead to unexpected behavior, memory corruption due to undersized buffers, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** High - Application crash, memory corruption, denial of service.
*   **Nuklear Component Affected:** Modules related to layout management, rendering, and buffer allocation (e.g., `nk_layout`, `nk_buffer`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Code review Nuklear's source code focusing on size and length calculations. Use safe integer arithmetic practices in application code when interacting with Nuklear's size-related APIs. Test with large and boundary values for UI dimensions and input.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Image Loading/Handling](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_image_loadinghandling.md)

*   **Description:** If Nuklear handles image loading, an attacker provides malicious image files (e.g., crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in image parsing libraries or Nuklear's image handling code). This can lead to buffer overflows, memory corruption, or other vulnerabilities during image processing, potentially resulting in crashes, denial of service, or code execution.
*   **Impact:** High - Application crash, denial of service, potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Nuklear Component Affected:** Image loading and processing modules (if present in Nuklear or its backend).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Investigate if Nuklear directly handles image loading. If so, use secure and updated image loading libraries in the application and pass processed image data to Nuklear. Sanitize and validate image files before processing. Consider disabling or limiting image loading features if not essential.

## Threat: [Reliance on Vulnerable or Outdated Nuklear Version](./threats/reliance_on_vulnerable_or_outdated_nuklear_version.md)

*   **Description:** Developers use an outdated version of Nuklear that contains known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities to compromise the application, potentially leading to code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** High - Exploitation of known Nuklear vulnerabilities, potentially leading to code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
*   **Nuklear Component Affected:** Entire Nuklear library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Regularly update Nuklear to the latest stable version. Monitor Nuklear's release notes and security advisories. Implement a dependency management system to track and update library versions.
