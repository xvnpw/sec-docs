# Attack Surface Analysis for vurtun/nuklear

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Failures (Text Input)](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_failures__text_input_.md)

*   **Description:**  Insufficient validation of user-supplied text data passed to Nuklear's text input functions (e.g., `nk_edit_string`).
*   **Nuklear Contribution:** Nuklear provides the text input widgets and basic filtering, but *relies entirely on the application* for proper length validation and sanitization to prevent buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities. It offers *no* inherent protection against these.
*   **Example:** An attacker enters a string containing format string specifiers (e.g., `%x%x%x%x`) into a Nuklear text field. The application doesn't sanitize the input before passing it to Nuklear, and a subsequent `nk_draw_text` call uses this string, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Implement strict length checks *before* calling Nuklear input functions.  Use `strncpy` or safer alternatives.
        *   Sanitize input to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters, *especially* format string specifiers.
        *   Fuzz test input fields with various inputs, including long strings and special characters.
        *   Use static analysis tools (e.g., Coverity, Fortify) to detect potential buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Custom Input Handling](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_custom_input_handling.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities introduced when the application uses Nuklear's raw input API (`nk_input_begin`, `nk_input_end`, etc.) and implements its own input processing logic.
*   **Nuklear Contribution:** Nuklear provides the low-level input API, giving the application *complete control* and *full responsibility* for input safety. Any flaws in the application's custom handling are directly exposed.
*   **Example:** The application uses `nk_input_key` to handle keyboard input. A bug in the application's logic allows an attacker to inject arbitrary key events, bypassing authentication checks or triggering unintended actions (e.g., simulating "admin" key presses).
*   **Impact:**  Bypass of security controls, input spoofing, potentially arbitrary code execution (depending on the vulnerability and how the input is used).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   *Avoid using the raw input API unless absolutely necessary.* Prefer Nuklear's higher-level widgets.
        *   If raw input handling is required, implement *extremely* thorough input validation, bounds checking, and sanitization.
        *   Use a secure input handling library if possible.
        *   Extensively fuzz test and perform static analysis on any custom input handling code.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Font Files (Indirect, via Font Rendering Library)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_font_files__indirect__via_font_rendering_library_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the *external* font rendering library (e.g., stb_truetype) that Nuklear uses, triggered by a maliciously crafted font file.
*   **Nuklear Contribution:** Nuklear *indirectly* exposes this attack surface by relying on an external font rendering library. Nuklear itself doesn't handle font parsing, but it *uses* the results.
*   **Example:**  The application allows users to load custom fonts. An attacker provides a crafted font file that exploits a buffer overflow in stb_truetype, leading to code execution when Nuklear attempts to render text using that font.
*   **Impact:**  Potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Use a well-vetted, *up-to-date*, and actively maintained font rendering library.
        *   *Validate font files before loading them.* This might involve checking file signatures, using a font validator tool, or sandboxing the font loading process.
        *   *Strongly consider restricting the ability for users to load arbitrary custom fonts.* Provide a curated set of safe fonts instead.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Widgets and Drawing (When Interacting with Nuklear)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_widgets_and_drawing__when_interacting_with_nuklear_.md)

*   **Description:**  Security flaws in the application's custom-built GUI components and drawing routines that *interact with Nuklear's context*.
*   **Nuklear Contribution:** Nuklear provides the framework and drawing context, but the application developer is *entirely responsible* for the security of any custom code that interacts with it. This is the most likely source of high-severity vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  A custom widget for displaying images, integrated with Nuklear, contains a buffer overflow vulnerability when handling malformed image data passed to it *through Nuklear's drawing commands*.
*   **Impact:**  Varies widely, but can include crashes, denial of service, and *potentially arbitrary code execution* if the vulnerability is exploitable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test *all* custom widget and drawing code that interacts with Nuklear's context.
        *   Follow secure coding practices *rigorously* (input validation, bounds checking, safe memory management).
        *   Use static analysis tools and fuzzing to identify vulnerabilities.
        *   *Strongly consider using a memory-safe language (e.g., Rust) for implementing custom GUI components that interact with Nuklear.*
        *   Keep any third-party libraries used by custom widgets up-to-date.
