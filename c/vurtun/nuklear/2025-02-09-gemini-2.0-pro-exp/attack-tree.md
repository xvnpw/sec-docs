## Attack Tree Path: [Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) - CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/arbitrary_code_execution__ace__-_critical_node.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker achieves the ability to execute arbitrary code of their choosing on the system running the application. This is the most severe outcome, granting the attacker complete control.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Complete system compromise.
*   **Why it's Critical:** This is the ultimate goal for many attackers, allowing them to steal data, install malware, pivot to other systems, or cause significant damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow - HIGH-RISK](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_-_high-risk.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability where data written to a buffer exceeds its allocated size, overwriting adjacent memory. In the context of Nuklear, this would likely occur due to insufficient input validation on data passed to Nuklear widgets.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High. Can lead to ACE.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Nuklear widgets (text fields, etc.) have internal buffers to store data.
    *   If the application doesn't validate the length of user-provided input *before* passing it to Nuklear, an attacker can provide input that's larger than the buffer.
    *   This overwrites adjacent memory, potentially corrupting data structures, function pointers, or return addresses.
    *   By carefully crafting the overflowing data, the attacker can redirect program execution to their own malicious code.
*   **Example:** A text field widget in Nuklear might have a buffer of 64 bytes. If the application doesn't check the input length, an attacker could provide a string of 128 bytes. The extra 64 bytes would overwrite adjacent memory.
*   **Mitigation:** Rigorous input validation (length checks, type checks, sanitization) *before* passing data to Nuklear functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Crafted Input to Widgets (Buffer Overflow) - HIGH-RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/crafted_input_to_widgets__buffer_overflow__-_high-risk_path.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides specially crafted input to Nuklear widgets (e.g., text fields, sliders) designed to trigger a buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (leads to Buffer Overflow, then ACE).
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires understanding of Nuklear's data structures and the application's input handling. Fuzzing can reduce effort.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High. Requires knowledge of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and C.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High. Might be silent initially. Requires IDS, application logging, or crash analysis.
*   **Mitigation:** Same as for Buffer Overflow: rigorous input validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Crafted Input (Format String) - HIGH-RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/crafted_input__format_string__-_high-risk_path.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a specially crafted string that is used as a format string in a function like `nk_textf` (or a similar function if the application wraps Nuklear calls). This allows the attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (can lead to ACE).
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires understanding of format string vulnerabilities and how the application uses string formatting.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High. Requires knowledge of format string vulnerabilities and C.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High. Similar to buffer overflows.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Format string functions (like `printf` in standard C, or `nk_textf` in Nuklear) use format specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%s`, `%n`) to interpret arguments.
    *   If an attacker can control the format string itself (e.g., by providing it as input to a text field that's then used in `nk_textf`), they can use these specifiers to:
        *   `%x`: Read data from the stack (potentially leaking sensitive information).
        *   `%s`: Read data from an arbitrary memory address (potentially crashing the application or leaking data).
        *   `%n`: *Write* to an arbitrary memory address (this is the most dangerous, allowing for code execution).
    *   The attacker crafts a format string with a specific sequence of specifiers to achieve their desired outcome (reading or writing to specific memory locations).
*   **Example:** If an application has code like `nk_textf(ctx, NK_TEXT_LEFT, user_input);` where `user_input` is directly taken from a text field without sanitization, an attacker could enter a string like `"%x %x %x %x %n"` to potentially write to memory and gain control.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Never** use user-supplied input directly as a format string.
    *   If you need to display user-supplied text, use functions that don't interpret format specifiers (e.g., `nk_label` for simple text).
    *   If you *must* use a format string function with user input, *always* provide a fixed format string and pass the user input as *arguments* to the function, *not* as part of the format string itself.  For example: `nk_textf(ctx, NK_TEXT_LEFT, "%s", user_input);` (This is safe because `user_input` is treated as a string to be displayed, not as a format string).
