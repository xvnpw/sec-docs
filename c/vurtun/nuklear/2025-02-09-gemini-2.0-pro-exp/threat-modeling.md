# Threat Model Analysis for vurtun/nuklear

## Threat: [Malformed Font Data](./threats/malformed_font_data.md)

*   **Description:** Nuklear uses a font atlas for rendering text. If an attacker can control the font data loaded by the application (e.g., by providing a malicious font file or manipulating a network request that fetches a font), they could potentially craft a font file that triggers vulnerabilities in Nuklear's font rendering code (or the underlying font rendering library, like stb_truetype, which Nuklear often uses). This is a *direct* threat because Nuklear itself handles the loading and processing of the font data.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Potential for code execution or denial-of-service if vulnerabilities exist in the font rendering process.
    *   **Nuklear Component Affected:**
        *   `nk_font`
        *   `nk_font_atlas`
        *   `nk_init_default` (if it loads a default font)
        *   Any functions related to font loading and management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate Font Data:** If loading fonts from external sources, validate the font file's integrity (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures) before loading it. This is crucial because Nuklear directly processes this data.
        *   **Use a Trusted Font Source:** Ideally, embed a known-good font directly within the application binary, avoiding external font loading altogether. This eliminates the attack vector.
        *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Consider rendering text in a separate, sandboxed process to isolate potential font rendering vulnerabilities. This is a more complex but robust solution.
        *   **Update Dependencies:** Keep the underlying font rendering library (e.g., stb_truetype) up-to-date to benefit from any security patches. This is important as Nuklear relies on this external library.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Layout Calculations (Directly within Nuklear)](./threats/integer_overflow_in_layout_calculations__directly_within_nuklear_.md)

*   **Description:** While application-provided values *can* trigger this, Nuklear's internal layout calculations *themselves* could be vulnerable to integer overflows if not carefully designed. If Nuklear's *own* code has flaws in how it handles widget dimensions, spacing, or nesting, an attacker might be able to craft a specific (though likely complex) UI configuration that triggers an overflow *within Nuklear's internal logic*, even if the application provides seemingly reasonable input values. This is distinct from the application failing to validate input; this is about flaws *within* Nuklear's calculations.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Potential for memory corruption or denial-of-service due to incorrect internal state within Nuklear.
    *   **Nuklear Component Affected:**
        *   `nk_layout_row_dynamic`
        *   `nk_layout_row_static`
        *   `nk_layout_row_template_begin`
        *   `nk_layout_space_begin`
        *   `nk_widget`
        *   `nk_widget_fitting`
        *   Essentially, any function involved in layout and widget positioning.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update Nuklear:** The primary mitigation is to use the *latest version* of Nuklear.  The developers may have already addressed such issues.  This is crucial.
        *   **Fuzz Testing (for Nuklear developers):**  Extensive fuzz testing of Nuklear's layout functions with a wide range of inputs (sizes, nesting, etc.) is essential to identify and fix potential integer overflow vulnerabilities. This is a mitigation for the *library maintainers*, not the application developers.
        *   **Limit Nesting Depth (Application-level, as a precaution):** While not a direct fix for internal Nuklear bugs, limiting the complexity of the UI (e.g., maximum nesting depth) can reduce the likelihood of triggering edge cases in Nuklear's layout code.

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Format String in `nk_text` (If Nuklear Internally Misuses It)](./threats/uncontrolled_format_string_in__nk_text___if_nuklear_internally_misuses_it_.md)

* **Description:** While the primary responsibility is on the application to *not* pass user input to format string functions, it's theoretically possible (though less likely) that Nuklear *itself* might have internal code paths where it incorrectly uses a format string with potentially attacker-influenced data. This would be a bug *within* Nuklear, not just misuse by the application.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Critical:** Potential for arbitrary code execution or sensitive information disclosure.
    * **Nuklear Component Affected:**
        * `nk_text`
        * `nk_text_colored`
        * `nk_text_wrap`
        * `nk_text_wrap_colored`
        * `nk_label`
        * `nk_label_colored`
        * `nk_label_wrap`
        * `nk_label_wrap_colored`
        * Any function that uses a format string to display text.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (but low probability if Nuklear is well-maintained)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Update Nuklear:** The primary mitigation is to use the *latest version* of Nuklear. The developers would likely fix such a critical vulnerability quickly.
        * **Code Review (for Nuklear developers):** Thorough code review of Nuklear's source code, specifically focusing on all uses of format string functions, is essential to identify and eliminate any potential vulnerabilities. This is a mitigation for the *library maintainers*.
        * **Application-Level Avoidance (as a precaution):** Even though this threat targets internal Nuklear misuse, the application should *always* avoid passing user input to format strings as a general best practice.
