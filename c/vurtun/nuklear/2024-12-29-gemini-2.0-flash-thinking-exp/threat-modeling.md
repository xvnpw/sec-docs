### High and Critical Nuklear Threats

*   **Threat:** Buffer Overflow in Text Rendering
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides an excessively long string to be rendered by Nuklear. Nuklear's text rendering functions, if not properly bounds-checked, might write beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory. This could lead to application crashes or, in more severe cases, allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code by carefully crafting the overflowed data.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Nuklear Component:** `nk_text`, `nk_label`, or other text rendering functions within the `Nuklear` core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all text input before passing it to Nuklear rendering functions.
        *   Implement length checks to ensure text strings do not exceed expected buffer sizes.
        *   Regularly update to the latest stable version of Nuklear, as bug fixes may address such vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using memory-safe string handling techniques within the application when interacting with Nuklear.

*   **Threat:** Integer Overflow in Layout Calculations
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates input values (e.g., window dimensions, element sizes, padding) that are used in Nuklear's layout calculations. If these calculations are not protected against integer overflows, it could lead to incorrect memory allocation sizes or out-of-bounds access during rendering. This might cause crashes or unexpected visual glitches that could be exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, incorrect UI rendering, potential for memory corruption.
    *   **Affected Nuklear Component:** Layout calculation functions within the `Nuklear` core, potentially affecting functions related to `nk_layout_row`, `nk_group`, etc.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Be mindful of the range of values used when configuring Nuklear layouts and element properties.
        *   Implement checks within the application to ensure input values for layout calculations are within reasonable bounds.
        *   Review Nuklear's source code for potential integer overflow vulnerabilities if necessary.

*   **Threat:** Input Injection through Text Fields
    *   **Description:** An attacker enters malicious input into Nuklear text input fields. If the application does not properly sanitize or validate this input before using it in subsequent operations (e.g., executing commands, constructing database queries), it could lead to various injection attacks, such as command injection or cross-site scripting (if the application renders web content based on this input).
    *   **Impact:** Command injection, cross-site scripting (if applicable), data manipulation, unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Nuklear Component:** `nk_edit_string`, `nk_text_edit`, or other input handling functions within the `Nuklear` core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received from Nuklear text input fields.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.
        *   Encode output appropriately when rendering user-provided data in web contexts.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege when executing commands based on user input.

*   **Threat:** Memory Corruption due to Incorrect Resource Management
    *   **Description:**  Bugs within Nuklear's internal resource management (e.g., allocation and deallocation of memory for UI elements, textures, fonts) could lead to memory corruption issues like use-after-free or double-free errors. These errors can cause application crashes and potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Nuklear Component:** Memory management functions within the `Nuklear` core, potentially related to `nk_buffer`, `nk_font_atlas`, etc.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update to the latest stable version of Nuklear, as bug fixes may address such issues.
        *   Carefully review the application's interaction with Nuklear's API, especially when dealing with resource creation and destruction.
        *   Consider using memory safety tools during development to detect potential memory management errors.

*   **Threat:** Use of a Vulnerable Nuklear Version
    *   **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of Nuklear that contains known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if they are aware of them.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability, ranging from application crashes to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Nuklear Component:** The entire `Nuklear` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use the latest stable version of Nuklear.
        *   Stay informed about any reported security issues in Nuklear and apply necessary updates promptly.
