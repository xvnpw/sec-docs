### Key Attack Surface List (High & Critical, Directly Involving Nuklear)

*   **Description:** Insufficient Input Validation and Sanitization
    *   **How Nuklear Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Nuklear's functions process input data provided by the application. If the application fails to validate and sanitize this input *before* passing it to Nuklear, malicious or malformed input can be processed by Nuklear, potentially leading to vulnerabilities within Nuklear's internal logic.
    *   **Example:** An application uses Nuklear's text input field. If the application doesn't limit the length of the input string, a user could enter an excessively long string, potentially causing a buffer overflow within Nuklear's internal string handling if not robustly implemented.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, unexpected UI behavior, potential for memory corruption if Nuklear's internal handling is flawed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* passing any user-provided data to Nuklear functions.
        *   Enforce length limits on text inputs.
        *   Sanitize special characters that could be interpreted maliciously.
