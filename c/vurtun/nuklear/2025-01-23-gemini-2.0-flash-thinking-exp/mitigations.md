## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization within Nuklear UI Elements](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_within_nuklear_ui_elements.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization within Nuklear UI Elements
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Nuklear Input Points:** Pinpoint all Nuklear UI elements in your application (e.g., `nk_edit_string`, `nk_slider_float`) that accept user input.
    2.  **Validate Input *After* Nuklear Input Handling:** Implement validation logic *immediately after* retrieving input from Nuklear UI elements but *before* using this input in application logic or further Nuklear rendering. This ensures that even if Nuklear itself has any unexpected input handling behavior, your application logic is protected.
    3.  **Sanitize Input for Nuklear Display (if echoing back):** If you are displaying user input back into Nuklear UI elements (e.g., echoing text in an edit box), sanitize the input before passing it back to Nuklear for rendering. This prevents potential rendering issues or unexpected behavior caused by special characters interpreted by Nuklear's rendering engine.
    4.  **Limit Input Lengths in Nuklear:** Utilize Nuklear's input element parameters (like `max_len` in `nk_edit_string`) to enforce input length limits directly at the UI level. This helps prevent potential buffer overflows that could be triggered by excessively long input processed by Nuklear or your application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow in Nuklear Input Handling (Medium):**  If Nuklear's internal input handling has vulnerabilities, limiting input length can mitigate buffer overflows.
    *   **Rendering Issues due to Malformed Input in Nuklear (Low to Medium):** Sanitizing input before displaying it back in Nuklear can prevent rendering glitches or unexpected UI behavior caused by special characters not properly handled by Nuklear's rendering.
    *   **Application Logic Vulnerabilities due to Unvalidated Input from Nuklear (Medium to High):** Validating input *after* retrieval from Nuklear ensures that even if Nuklear passes through unexpected data, your application logic remains protected from injection or other input-based attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow in Nuklear Input Handling:** Medium reduction. Input length limits reduce the risk, but deeper inspection of Nuklear's code would be needed for full mitigation.
    *   **Rendering Issues due to Malformed Input in Nuklear:** Low to Medium reduction. Sanitization helps, but depends on the specific rendering issues in Nuklear.
    *   **Application Logic Vulnerabilities due to Unvalidated Input from Nuklear:** High reduction. Validating input after Nuklear handling is crucial for protecting application logic.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Input length limits are used in some Nuklear text input fields (e.g., filename input in file browser uses `max_len`). (Located in `src/ui/file_browser.c`).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic input validation is missing for all input retrieved from Nuklear UI elements before being used in application logic.
    *   Sanitization of input before displaying it back in Nuklear UI elements is not consistently implemented.
    *   Input length limits are not consistently applied across all Nuklear text input fields.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Memory Management Practices Specific to Nuklear Context](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_memory_management_practices_specific_to_nuklear_context.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rigorous Memory Management Practices Specific to Nuklear Context
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Nuklear Context Memory:** Pay close attention to memory allocations and deallocations associated with the Nuklear context (`nk_context`) and related Nuklear structures. Use memory debugging tools to track memory usage specifically within the Nuklear UI rendering and event handling code paths.
    2.  **Review Nuklear Integration Code for Memory Errors:** Conduct focused code reviews on the parts of your application that directly interact with the Nuklear library. Look for potential memory leaks, double frees, or use-after-free errors specifically related to Nuklear's API usage and data structures.
    3.  **Handle Nuklear Resource Allocation and Deallocation:** Ensure proper allocation and deallocation of resources used by Nuklear, such as fonts, images, and buffers. Follow Nuklear's documentation and examples for correct resource management. Pay attention to Nuklear's functions like `nk_font_atlas_begin`, `nk_font_atlas_bake`, `nk_font_atlas_end`, and resource destruction functions if any are provided by Nuklear or your rendering backend integration.
    4.  **Test Nuklear UI Under Memory Stress:**  Perform testing of the Nuklear UI under memory stress conditions (e.g., creating and destroying UI elements rapidly, loading large datasets into UI elements) to identify potential memory leaks or instability related to Nuklear's memory management in your application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Memory Leaks due to Nuklear Resource Handling (Medium):** Improper handling of Nuklear's internal resources (fonts, textures, etc.) can lead to memory leaks.
    *   **Buffer Overflows related to Nuklear Context Data (Medium to High):** Memory management errors in code interacting with Nuklear's context or data structures could lead to buffer overflows.
    *   **Crashes due to Nuklear Memory Corruption (High):** Double frees or use-after-free errors in Nuklear integration code can lead to crashes and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Memory Leaks due to Nuklear Resource Handling:** Medium reduction. Focused memory management reduces leaks, improving stability.
    *   **Buffer Overflows related to Nuklear Context Data:** Medium to High reduction. Careful coding and debugging tools can significantly reduce overflow risks.
    *   **Crashes due to Nuklear Memory Corruption:** High reduction. Rigorous memory management is crucial for preventing crashes and related vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic memory management is used for Nuklear context and related structures. (Located in `src/main.c` and various UI files).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No dedicated memory monitoring or profiling specifically focused on Nuklear context and resource usage.
    *   Code reviews are not explicitly focused on memory management aspects of Nuklear integration.
    *   No systematic stress testing of the Nuklear UI under memory pressure.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Data Handling for Display *Within* Nuklear Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/secure_data_handling_for_display_within_nuklear_rendering.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Data Handling for Display Within Nuklear Rendering
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Encode Data Before Nuklear Rendering:** When providing data to Nuklear for rendering, especially data from external or untrusted sources, ensure it is encoded appropriately for Nuklear's text rendering and other display functions. This might involve escaping special characters that could be interpreted by Nuklear's rendering engine in unintended ways.
    2.  **Validate Media Data Formats for Nuklear Image Display:** If using Nuklear to display images or other media, validate the format and integrity of the media data *before* passing it to Nuklear's image rendering functions. Use safe media decoding libraries and check for potential vulnerabilities in the media data itself.
    3.  **Limit Complexity of Nuklear UI Structures:** Avoid creating excessively complex or deeply nested UI structures within Nuklear, especially if these structures are dynamically generated based on external data. Complex UIs can potentially lead to performance issues or even trigger rendering vulnerabilities within Nuklear or the underlying graphics backend.
    4.  **Review Nuklear Rendering Backend Integration:** If you are using a custom rendering backend with Nuklear, carefully review the integration code for potential vulnerabilities in how data is passed from Nuklear to the rendering backend and how rendering commands are executed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Rendering Vulnerabilities in Nuklear or Backend (Medium):** Maliciously crafted data passed to Nuklear for rendering could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in Nuklear's rendering engine or the underlying graphics backend.
    *   **Denial of Service through Complex Nuklear UI (Medium):** Overly complex UI structures can lead to excessive rendering load and application slowdown or crash, causing a denial of service.
    *   **Unexpected UI Behavior due to Malformed Data in Nuklear (Low to Medium):** Improperly encoded or malformed data displayed by Nuklear could lead to unexpected UI glitches or incorrect rendering.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Rendering Vulnerabilities in Nuklear or Backend:** Medium reduction. Data encoding and validation reduce the risk, but thorough testing is also needed.
    *   **Denial of Service through Complex Nuklear UI:** Medium reduction. Limiting UI complexity helps prevent DoS, but performance optimization is also important.
    *   **Unexpected UI Behavior due to Malformed Data in Nuklear:** Low to Medium reduction. Encoding and validation improve UI robustness.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic text and UI element rendering is implemented using Nuklear. (Throughout UI files).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No explicit encoding of data before passing it to Nuklear rendering functions.
    *   No validation of media data formats before displaying images through Nuklear (if image display is used).
    *   No enforced limits on the complexity or depth of Nuklear UI structures.
    *   No specific security review of the rendering backend integration with Nuklear.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Updated with Nuklear Library Releases](./mitigation_strategies/stay_updated_with_nuklear_library_releases.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Stay Updated with Nuklear Library Releases
*   **Description:**

    2.  **Subscribe to Nuklear Release Notifications:** If available, subscribe to release notifications or use repository watching features to be alerted to new Nuklear versions.
    3.  **Promptly Update Nuklear Version:** When new versions of Nuklear are released, especially those containing security fixes, update the Nuklear library in your project as soon as feasible.
    4.  **Test Application After Nuklear Updates:** After updating Nuklear, thoroughly test your application's UI and functionality to ensure compatibility with the new version and to verify that the update has not introduced any regressions or new issues.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Security Vulnerabilities in Nuklear Library (High):** Outdated versions of Nuklear may contain publicly known security vulnerabilities that are addressed in newer releases.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Security Vulnerabilities in Nuklear Library:** High reduction. Updating to patched versions directly mitigates known vulnerabilities in Nuklear itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Nuklear is included as a Git submodule, allowing for updates. (Located in `.gitmodules` and `external/nuklear`).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No automated or scheduled process for checking for and applying Nuklear library updates.
    *   No formal testing process specifically triggered by Nuklear library updates to ensure stability and security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Nuklear Rendering Context](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_nuklear_rendering_context.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Nuklear Rendering Context
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Separate Nuklear Rendering Logic:** Isolate the code responsible for Nuklear UI rendering and event handling into distinct modules or functions, separate from core application logic. This makes it easier to reason about and restrict the privileges of the UI-related code.
    2.  **Minimize Privileges for Nuklear Code:**  Within your application's architecture, ensure that the code sections directly interacting with Nuklear and handling UI events operate with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid granting unnecessary access to sensitive resources or functionalities to the UI rendering code.
    3.  **Consider Process Isolation (Advanced):** For highly security-sensitive applications, explore the feasibility of running the Nuklear UI rendering in a separate process with restricted privileges. This can provide a stronger security boundary and limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities exploited through the UI.
    4.  **Secure Communication with Nuklear Context (if isolated):** If using process isolation, ensure that communication between the main application process and the Nuklear UI process is secure and uses appropriate authorization and validation mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of the UI or application data.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Nuklear Vulnerabilities (High):** If a vulnerability is exploited through the Nuklear UI, limiting the privileges of the UI rendering context can prevent attackers from escalating their privileges within the application or system.
    *   **Lateral Movement from UI Compromise (Medium):** In case of a compromise through the UI, reduced privileges can limit the attacker's ability to move laterally to other parts of the application or access sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Nuklear Vulnerabilities:** High reduction. Least privilege significantly limits the potential damage from UI exploits.
    *   **Lateral Movement from UI Compromise:** Medium reduction. Privilege reduction provides a barrier to lateral movement.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   UI rendering code is somewhat separated into UI-specific files. (Located in `src/ui` directory).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No explicit privilege separation or restriction for the code sections interacting with Nuklear.
    *   Process isolation for Nuklear rendering is not implemented.
    *   No secure communication mechanisms are in place related to the Nuklear context (as process isolation is not used).
