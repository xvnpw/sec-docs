# Attack Surface Analysis for vurtun/nuklear

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input Strings to Text Widgets](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_strings_to_text_widgets.md)

*   **Description:**  Providing excessively long or specially crafted strings to Nuklear text input widgets can potentially trigger buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues within Nuklear's internal string handling.
*   **How Nuklear Contributes:** Nuklear's internal implementation of text input handling might have vulnerabilities related to buffer management when dealing with unexpectedly large input.
*   **Example:** A user enters a string of several megabytes into a text field designed for a few hundred characters.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if a buffer overflow is exploitable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input length limits and character filtering at the application level *before* passing data to Nuklear widgets.
    *   **Nuklear Updates:** Keep the Nuklear library updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   **Defensive Coding:**  When using Nuklear's text input functions, be mindful of potential buffer sizes and handle input defensively.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Font Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_font_loading.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to specify fonts or if Nuklear's font loading mechanism has vulnerabilities, an attacker could load a specially crafted malicious font file.
*   **How Nuklear Contributes:** Nuklear needs to load and parse font files for rendering text. Vulnerabilities in this parsing process could be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a custom font file that, when loaded by Nuklear, triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Font Sources:**  Limit the sources from which fonts can be loaded. Ideally, bundle necessary fonts with the application.
    *   **Font Validation:** If loading external fonts is necessary, implement robust validation checks on the font files before attempting to load them with Nuklear.
    *   **Nuklear Updates:** Ensure Nuklear is updated to benefit from any fixes to font loading vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_loading.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Nuklear to display images, vulnerabilities in Nuklear's image loading or handling (or underlying libraries) could be exploited by loading malicious image files.
*   **How Nuklear Contributes:** Nuklear needs to decode and render image data. Flaws in this process or in the image decoding libraries it uses can be exploited.
*   **Example:** Loading a specially crafted PNG or JPEG image that triggers a buffer overflow in the image decoding library used by Nuklear.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Image Sources:** Limit the sources from which images can be loaded.
    *   **Image Validation:** Implement robust validation checks on image files before loading them with Nuklear.
    *   **Use Secure Image Libraries:** Ensure the underlying image decoding libraries used (either directly by Nuklear or the host application) are up-to-date and have a good security track record.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Management Issues within Nuklear](./attack_surfaces/memory_management_issues_within_nuklear.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs within Nuklear's internal memory management (e.g., memory leaks, double-frees, use-after-free) could be exploited.
*   **How Nuklear Contributes:** As a C library, Nuklear manages its own memory. Errors in allocation and deallocation can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Triggering a specific sequence of UI interactions that causes Nuklear to free memory twice or access memory that has already been freed.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Nuklear Updates:** Keep Nuklear updated to benefit from fixes to memory management bugs.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to scan the application code and Nuklear's source code for potential memory management errors.
    *   **Memory Debugging Tools:** Employ memory debugging tools during development and testing to identify and fix memory-related issues.
