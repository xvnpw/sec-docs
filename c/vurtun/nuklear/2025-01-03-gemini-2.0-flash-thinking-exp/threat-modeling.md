# Threat Model Analysis for vurtun/nuklear

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Text Input](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_text_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a string to a text input field that exceeds the allocated buffer size *within Nuklear's internal handling*. This could overwrite adjacent memory within Nuklear's structures, potentially leading to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

**Impact:** Application crash, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Text Input Widget (part of the `nuklear_text` module or related structures within Nuklear).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure Nuklear's internal text input functions perform robust bounds checking.
*   Contribute to or use patched versions of Nuklear that address potential buffer overflows.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Nuklear](./threats/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_nuklear.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages publicly known vulnerabilities in specific versions of the Nuklear library. This directly targets flaws within Nuklear's code.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially including arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** The specific Nuklear module or function affected by the known vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if the vulnerability allows for remote code execution) to High (for less severe vulnerabilities).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Nuklear library updated to the latest stable version.
*   Monitor security advisories related to Nuklear and patch vulnerabilities promptly.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Nuklear Source](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_nuklear_source.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the source code of the Nuklear library (e.g., on GitHub or a distribution channel) and injects malicious code. Applications using this compromised version will directly execute the malicious code from within the Nuklear library.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the user's system.

**Affected Component:** The entire Nuklear library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Obtain Nuklear from trusted and official sources.
*   Verify the integrity of the downloaded library (e.g., using checksums).
*   Consider using dependency management tools that can verify the integrity of libraries.
