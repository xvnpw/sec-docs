## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Nuklear Library Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nuklear_library_weaknesses.md)

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To compromise application that use given project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_critical_node.md)

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**

* This node represents the broad category of attacks that target how Nuklear processes user input. If successful, an attacker can manipulate the application's behavior or gain control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow in Text Input Fields **CRITICAL NODE**, **HIGH-RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_in_text_input_fields_critical_node__high-risk_path.md)

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Buffer Overflow in Text Input Fields (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides an input string to a text field within the application's Nuklear interface that exceeds the allocated buffer size.
* **Mechanism:** Due to insufficient bounds checking in Nuklear or the application's integration, the excess data overwrites adjacent memory locations on the stack or heap.
* **Consequences:** This can lead to crashes, data corruption, or, more critically, the attacker gaining control of the program's execution flow by overwriting return addresses or function pointers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Size/Length Calculations **HIGH-RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/integer_overflowunderflow_in_sizelength_calculations_high-risk_path.md)

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Integer Overflow/Underflow in Size/Length Calculations (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input values that, when used in calculations for buffer sizes or lengths within Nuklear, cause an integer overflow (wrapping around to a small value) or underflow (wrapping around to a large value).
* **Mechanism:** This can lead to the allocation of smaller-than-expected buffers or incorrect length checks. Subsequently, when data is written to these undersized buffers, a heap-based buffer overflow can occur.
* **Consequences:** Similar to stack-based buffer overflows, this can lead to crashes, data corruption, and potential code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit State Management Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_state_management_issues.md)

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Handling of User-Defined Callbacks **HIGH-RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_handling_of_user-defined_callbacks_high-risk_path.md)

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Insecure Handling of User-Defined Callbacks (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:** The application using Nuklear defines callback functions that are triggered by certain UI events. An attacker finds a way to influence the data passed to these callbacks or even inject malicious code into the callback function itself (if the application dynamically loads or interprets code).
* **Mechanism:** If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate data passed to callbacks, an attacker might be able to inject malicious arguments that cause unintended actions or vulnerabilities within the callback function. If dynamic code loading is involved, vulnerabilities there could allow direct code injection.
* **Consequences:** This can lead to a wide range of issues, including arbitrary code execution within the application's context, bypassing security checks, or manipulating application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Safety Issues within Nuklear **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_safety_issues_within_nuklear_critical_node.md)

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Exploit Memory Safety Issues within Nuklear (CRITICAL NODE):**

* This node represents the general category of attacks that exploit flaws in how Nuklear manages memory. These flaws can lead to critical vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities **CRITICAL NODE**, **HIGH-RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/use-after-free_vulnerabilities_critical_node__high-risk_path.md)

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker triggers a sequence of actions that causes memory to be freed (deallocated) by Nuklear, but the application or Nuklear itself still holds a pointer to that memory (a dangling pointer). Subsequently, the application or Nuklear attempts to access or modify the freed memory.
* **Mechanism:** Accessing freed memory can lead to unpredictable behavior, as the memory might now contain different data or be allocated to another part of the program.
* **Consequences:** This can cause crashes, data corruption, and, critically, can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. An attacker can potentially allocate new data in the freed memory region and then manipulate the dangling pointer to execute their own code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Heap Overflow Vulnerabilities **CRITICAL NODE**, **HIGH-RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/heap_overflow_vulnerabilities_critical_node__high-risk_path.md)

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Heap Overflow Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input or triggers actions that cause Nuklear to write data beyond the boundaries of a dynamically allocated memory block (on the heap).
* **Mechanism:** Similar to stack-based buffer overflows, insufficient bounds checking during memory operations allows data to overwrite adjacent memory regions on the heap.
* **Consequences:** This can corrupt data structures, function pointers, or other critical information stored on the heap, leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or, most severely, arbitrary code execution.
