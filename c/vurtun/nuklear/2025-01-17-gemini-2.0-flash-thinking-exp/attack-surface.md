# Attack Surface Analysis for vurtun/nuklear

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflows/Underflows in Input Processing](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflowsunderflows_in_input_processing.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arise when Nuklear processes input data (e.g., mouse coordinates, sizes of UI elements) without proper bounds checking. This can lead to integer overflows or underflows when calculating memory offsets or sizes.
    *   **How Nuklear Contributes:** Nuklear's internal logic for handling and interpreting input events and UI element dimensions might perform calculations that are susceptible to integer overflow or underflow if the input values are maliciously crafted or unexpectedly large/small.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides extremely large coordinates for a mouse click, causing an integer overflow when Nuklear calculates the index of the clicked UI element, leading to an out-of-bounds memory access.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow leads to overwriting critical data or code pointers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to Nuklear. Check the range of input values to ensure they are within expected limits.
        *   **Developer:** Utilize safe integer arithmetic functions or compiler flags that detect and prevent overflows/underflows in the application code interacting with Nuklear.
        *   **Developer:** Review Nuklear's source code (if feasible) to understand its input processing logic and identify potential overflow points.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Robust Input Sanitization in Text Fields](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_robust_input_sanitization_in_text_fields.md)

*   **Description:** If an application relies solely on Nuklear for sanitizing user-provided text within UI elements (like text fields), and Nuklear's built-in sanitization is insufficient, vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) or command injection can occur.
    *   **How Nuklear Contributes:** Nuklear provides mechanisms for handling text input and rendering it, but its primary focus is rendering and UI management, not comprehensive security sanitization of the *content* of the text. It might not inherently protect against all forms of malicious input.
    *   **Example:** An attacker enters a malicious JavaScript payload into a text field, and the application renders this text via Nuklear without proper sanitization, leading to the execution of the script in the user's context (if the application is web-based or uses a web rendering component).
    *   **Impact:** XSS attacks, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or malicious actions on behalf of the user. Command injection if the unsanitized input is used in system commands by the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement server-side or client-side input sanitization *in addition* to any basic handling done by Nuklear. Use established sanitization libraries appropriate for the context (e.g., HTML escaping for web-related applications).
        *   **Developer:** Treat all user input as untrusted and validate it against expected formats and patterns *before* passing it to Nuklear for rendering or processing.

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on Application-Provided Input Buffers leading to Buffer Overflows](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_application-provided_input_buffers_leading_to_buffer_overflows.md)

*   **Description:** Nuklear often relies on the application to provide buffers for input data (e.g., text input). If the application doesn't correctly manage the size and lifetime of these buffers, Nuklear's input processing could lead to buffer overflows if it attempts to write beyond the allocated space.
    *   **How Nuklear Contributes:** While the application allocates the buffer, Nuklear's functions write data into it. If Nuklear doesn't have sufficient information about the buffer's size or doesn't perform adequate bounds checking *before writing*, it can write past the end.
    *   **Example:** The application provides a fixed-size buffer for text input, but Nuklear receives input exceeding that size and writes beyond the buffer boundary, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Always provide buffers of sufficient size to accommodate the maximum expected input *before* passing them to Nuklear.
        *   **Developer:** Ensure that Nuklear's input functions are used correctly and that buffer sizes are communicated accurately to Nuklear (if applicable).
        *   **Developer:** Consider using dynamic memory allocation for input buffers to avoid fixed-size limitations when interacting with Nuklear's input handling.
