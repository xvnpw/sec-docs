# Threat Model Analysis for vurtun/nuklear

## Threat: [Malformed Input Exploitation](./threats/malformed_input_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send specially crafted input strings or sequences that exploit vulnerabilities in how Nuklear parses or handles specific input patterns within its own code.

**Impact:** Application crash, unexpected UI behavior, potential for memory corruption within Nuklear's internal structures.

**Affected Component:** Nuklear's input processing functions (e.g., within `nk_input_*` family of functions).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Review Nuklear's source code for vulnerabilities in input handling logic.
*   Consider contributing fuzzing tests to the Nuklear project to identify such issues.
*   While application-level validation is important, ensure Nuklear's internal handling is robust.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Input Processing](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_input_processing.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides extremely large or small input values for numerical fields or parameters directly processed by Nuklear's internal calculations, lacking proper bounds checking within Nuklear itself.

**Impact:** Memory corruption within Nuklear's data structures, unexpected program behavior, potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflowed value is used in memory operations within Nuklear.

**Affected Component:** Nuklear's internal functions performing calculations on input values (e.g., size calculations, index calculations).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Review Nuklear's source code for potential integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities in its internal calculations.
*   Contribute patches to Nuklear to add bounds checking where necessary.

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability (If Applicable)](./threats/format_string_vulnerability__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** If Nuklear internally uses functions like `printf` or similar formatting functions with potentially attacker-influenced input within its own codebase, an attacker could inject format string specifiers to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations within the application's process.

**Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive data from the application's memory), potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** Any Nuklear function that uses formatting functions with potentially attacker-controlled input.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly audit Nuklear's source code for usage of formatting functions.
*   If found, report the vulnerability to the Nuklear maintainers and contribute a fix.
*   Ensure that user-controlled strings are never directly passed as the format string argument to functions like `printf` within Nuklear's code.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow/Underflow in Internal Data Structures](./threats/buffer_overflowunderflow_in_internal_data_structures.md)

**Description:** Bugs within Nuklear's own memory management routines could lead to buffer overflows or underflows when handling input, storing UI state, or performing rendering operations internally. An attacker might craft specific inputs or interactions to trigger these overflows within Nuklear's memory.

**Impact:** Memory corruption within the application's process, application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** Nuklear's internal memory allocation and deallocation routines, data structures used for storing UI state within Nuklear.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly audit Nuklear's source code for potential buffer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.
*   Use memory safety tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) when building applications using Nuklear to detect such issues.
*   Contribute patches to Nuklear to fix identified buffer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities](./threats/use-after-free_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If Nuklear incorrectly manages the lifecycle of its internal data structures, it could lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities, where Nuklear attempts to access memory after it has been freed. An attacker might trigger specific sequences of UI interactions or input to exploit these vulnerabilities within Nuklear's memory management.

**Impact:** Memory corruption within the application's process, application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** Nuklear's memory management routines, particularly those involved in object destruction and deallocation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review Nuklear's memory management logic, especially object lifetimes and deallocation within its source code.
*   Use memory safety tools to detect use-after-free errors when developing applications using Nuklear.
*   Report and contribute fixes for any identified use-after-free vulnerabilities in Nuklear.
