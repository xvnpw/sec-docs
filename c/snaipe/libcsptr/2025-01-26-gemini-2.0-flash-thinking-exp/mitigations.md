        *   Correct instantiation with `csptr_new` and appropriate deleters.
        *   Proper acquisition and release of ownership using `csptr_acquire` and `csptr_release`.
        *   Correct deletion using `csptr_delete` when ownership is fully released.
        *   Absence of manual memory management (`free`, `malloc`, etc.) on memory managed by `csptr`.
        *   Correct handling of custom deleters, especially error conditions within deleters.
    2.  **Train Developers on Secure `libcsptr` Practices:** Conduct training sessions focused on the *specific* secure usage patterns of `libcsptr` within the project. Emphasize common mistakes and best practices related to `libcsptr`'s API and memory management model.

    3.  **Implement Synchronization for `csptr` Accesses:** Implement the chosen synchronization mechanisms to protect concurrent access to `csptr` objects. Ensure that synchronization is correctly applied to all relevant code sections and that it is sufficient to prevent race conditions and data corruption *when using `csptr` in concurrent contexts*.
    4.  **Minimize Synchronization Overhead for `csptr` Operations:** Strive to minimize the overhead of synchronization mechanisms to avoid performance bottlenecks, especially for operations involving `csptr`.
