```

## Attack Tree Path: [Premature Object Destruction (Use-After-Free)](./attack_tree_paths/premature_object_destruction__use-after-free_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting errors in reference counting logic (integer overflows, race conditions, logic bugs) within `libcsptr` to cause an object's reference count to drop to zero prematurely.
Exploitation: After premature freeing, the application attempts to access the already freed memory, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. This can be exploited to overwrite memory, hijack control flow, or leak sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Double-Free Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/double-free_vulnerabilities.md)

Attack Vector:  Causing the memory associated with a `csptr_t` to be freed twice. This can be due to errors in reference counting logic, API misuse, or bugs in custom deleters.
Exploitation: Double-free vulnerabilities lead to heap corruption. Attackers can manipulate the heap metadata to gain control when memory is allocated again, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Race Conditions in Reference Counting (if multi-threaded usage)](./attack_tree_paths/race_conditions_in_reference_counting__if_multi-threaded_usage_.md)

Attack Vector: If the application uses `libcsptr` in a multi-threaded environment and `libcsptr`'s reference counting is not thread-safe (lacks proper synchronization mechanisms), race conditions can occur during reference count increment and decrement operations.
Exploitation: Race conditions can lead to incorrect reference counts, resulting in either premature object destruction (use-after-free) or objects never being freed (memory leaks). Use-after-free in multi-threaded contexts can be particularly challenging to debug and exploit but are highly impactful.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bugs in custom deleters (if application uses them)](./attack_tree_paths/bugs_in_custom_deleters__if_application_uses_them_.md)

Attack Vector: If the application utilizes custom deleter functions with `csptr_t`, vulnerabilities within these custom deleters can be exploited. A common vulnerability is a double-free within the custom deleter itself.
Exploitation:  If a custom deleter contains a double-free or other memory corruption bugs, these can be triggered when the `csptr_t` is destroyed, leading to heap corruption and potential control-flow hijacking.

## Attack Tree Path: [API Misuse by Application Developer](./attack_tree_paths/api_misuse_by_application_developer.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by incorrect or insecure usage of the `libcsptr` API by the application developers.
It is critical because developer error is a common source of vulnerabilities and often easier to exploit than vulnerabilities within the library itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrect Usage of `csptr_t` API](./attack_tree_paths/incorrect_usage_of__csptr_t__api.md)

Attack Vectors:

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper initialization of smart pointers](./attack_tree_paths/improper_initialization_of_smart_pointers.md)

Failing to correctly initialize `csptr_t` using `csptr_create` or other appropriate methods can lead to undefined behavior and potential crashes or memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrect handling of raw pointers alongside smart pointers](./attack_tree_paths/incorrect_handling_of_raw_pointers_alongside_smart_pointers.md)

Mixing raw pointers with `csptr_t` without careful consideration of ownership and lifetime can lead to double-frees, memory leaks, or use-after-free vulnerabilities. For example, manually freeing memory that is also managed by a `csptr_t`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Forgetting to use smart pointers where appropriate](./attack_tree_paths/forgetting_to_use_smart_pointers_where_appropriate.md)

Inconsistent use of `csptr_t` throughout the application, with some memory being managed manually and other parts using smart pointers, can create gaps in memory safety and introduce traditional memory management errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misunderstanding ownership semantics of `csptr_t`](./attack_tree_paths/misunderstanding_ownership_semantics_of__csptr_t_.md)

Incorrectly assuming ownership transfer or shared ownership when using `csptr_t` can lead to unexpected reference count behavior and memory management issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Custom Deleter Vulnerabilities (if used incorrectly)](./attack_tree_paths/custom_deleter_vulnerabilities__if_used_incorrectly_.md)

Attack Vector:  Similar to memory corruption vulnerabilities in custom deleters, but here the focus is on *incorrect usage* of custom deleters by the application developer, such as providing a deleter that itself contains vulnerabilities or doesn't properly handle resources.
Exploitation:  If the application provides a vulnerable custom deleter, this vulnerability will be triggered when the `csptr_t` is destroyed, potentially leading to memory corruption or other issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Ignoring Return Values/Error Codes from `libcsptr` functions](./attack_tree_paths/ignoring_return_valueserror_codes_from__libcsptr__functions.md)

Attack Vector: If `libcsptr` functions return error codes to indicate failures or exceptional conditions, and the application ignores these return values without proper error handling, it can lead to undefined behavior and potentially exploitable states.
Exploitation: Ignoring error codes can mask underlying issues, allowing vulnerabilities to propagate and become exploitable. For example, if a `csptr_create` fails due to resource exhaustion and the application doesn't check for errors, it might proceed with a null pointer, leading to a crash or exploitable null pointer dereference.
