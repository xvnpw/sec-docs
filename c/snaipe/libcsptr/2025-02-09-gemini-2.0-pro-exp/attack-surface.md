# Attack Surface Analysis for snaipe/libcsptr

## Attack Surface: [Use-After-Free (UAF)](./attack_surfaces/use-after-free__uaf_.md)

*   **Description:** Accessing memory after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **`libcsptr` Contribution:** `libcsptr` aims to prevent UAF, but incorrect usage of the API (e.g., not setting raw pointers to `NULL` after release, misusing `csptr_get`, mixing `cmalloc/cfree` with `malloc/free`) can re-introduce UAF vulnerabilities.  Bugs within `libcsptr` itself could also lead to UAF.
*   **Example:** A `csptr` is released.  Later, the developer accesses the underlying raw pointer (obtained via `csptr_get` or stored elsewhere) without checking if it's still valid.
*   **Impact:**  Can range from application crashes to arbitrary code execution, depending on how the freed memory is subsequently used.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Always set raw pointers to `NULL` immediately after releasing the associated `csptr` (using `csptr_set_null` if needed).  Minimize the use of `csptr_get` and handle the returned raw pointer with extreme care.  Strictly adhere to the `cmalloc`/`cfree` pairing; never mix with standard C memory management.  Thorough code reviews and static analysis are crucial.  Use dynamic analysis tools (Valgrind) during testing.

## Attack Surface: [Double-Free](./attack_surfaces/double-free.md)

*   **Description:** Freeing the same memory region twice, leading to heap corruption, crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **`libcsptr` Contribution:** `libcsptr`'s reference counting is designed to prevent double-frees.  However, incorrect usage (e.g., misunderstanding ownership, mixing memory management functions) or bugs in `libcsptr`'s reference counting logic (e.g., integer overflows, race conditions) can lead to double-frees.
*   **Example:**  A developer accidentally calls `cfree` on a raw pointer that is still managed by a `csptr`, or a race condition in a multi-threaded application causes the reference count to be decremented twice.
*   **Impact:** Similar to UAF, can range from crashes to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  Strictly follow `libcsptr`'s ownership rules.  Avoid manual manipulation of raw pointers obtained from `csptr_get`.  Ensure thread safety when using `libcsptr` in multi-threaded applications.  Use static and dynamic analysis tools.  Code reviews should focus on ownership transfers and potential race conditions.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Reference Counting](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflowunderflow_in_reference_counting.md)

*   **Description:**  The reference count (an integer) wraps around due to excessive allocations/deallocations, leading to incorrect memory management (typically double-frees).
*   **`libcsptr` Contribution:** `libcsptr`'s core mechanism relies on integer reference counting.  If the implementation is not robust against overflows/underflows, an attacker might be able to trigger them.
*   **Example:**  An attacker crafts a sequence of operations that causes the reference count to underflow, making it appear as if the object is no longer in use, leading to a premature free.
*   **Impact:**  Can lead to double-frees and, consequently, crashes or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** (Primarily applies to `libcsptr` developers)  The `libcsptr` implementation must be rigorously reviewed and tested for integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.  Fuzz testing is highly recommended.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Deleters](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_deleters.md)

*   **Description:**  Custom deleter functions provided to `libcsptr` can contain their own vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs).
*   **`libcsptr` Contribution:** `libcsptr` allows users to specify custom deleters, which are executed when a `csptr` is released.  The security of these deleters is entirely the responsibility of the developer.
*   **Example:**  A custom deleter uses `sprintf` without bounds checking to format a string based on data associated with the object being freed.  An attacker can provide crafted data to trigger a buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability in the custom deleter, but can range from crashes to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the deleter's functionality)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  Treat custom deleters as security-critical code.  Apply all standard secure coding practices (e.g., bounds checking, input validation, avoiding dangerous functions).  Keep deleters as simple as possible.  Thoroughly review and test custom deleters for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Mixing `csptr` with other memory management](./attack_surfaces/mixing__csptr__with_other_memory_management.md)

*   **Description:** Using `csptr` to manage memory that was allocated using standard C functions (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`) or vice-versa.
*   **`libcsptr` Contribution:** `libcsptr` provides its own memory allocation functions (`cmalloc`, `ccalloc`, `crealloc`) that must be used with `csptr`.
*   **Example:** Allocating memory with `malloc` and then attempting to manage it with a `csptr`.
*   **Impact:** Heap corruption, crashes, undefined behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Enforce strict coding standards to prevent mixing memory management functions. Use linters and static analysis tools to detect violations. Code reviews should specifically check for this.
