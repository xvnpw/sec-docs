# Threat Model Analysis for snaipe/libcsptr

## Threat: [Double Free via Incorrect Ownership Transfer](./threats/double_free_via_incorrect_ownership_transfer.md)

*   **Threat:** Double Free via Incorrect Ownership Transfer

    *   **Description:** An attacker could trigger a double-free vulnerability if they can influence how ownership of a `csptr`-managed object is transferred. This might involve exploiting logic flaws that lead to incorrect use of `release()`, or misuse of move semantics within the *intended* usage of `libcsptr`. The attacker might craft specific input or sequences of operations that cause the application to release the same memory twice *despite* the use of smart pointers. This highlights a failure in understanding or correctly applying the library's ownership model.
    *   **Impact:** Heap corruption, leading to arbitrary code execution or application crashes (Denial of Service).
    *   **Affected Component:** `csptr` (the core smart pointer class), `release()` method (if misused), internal reference counting mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly adhere to `libcsptr`'s ownership model. Avoid manual reference count manipulation.
        *   Use `std::move` (or the `libcsptr` equivalent) for ownership transfer.
        *   Thorough code reviews focusing on ownership transfer.
        *   Extensive testing with memory error detection tools (Valgrind, AddressSanitizer).

## Threat: [Use-After-Free via Dangling `weak_csptr`](./threats/use-after-free_via_dangling__weak_csptr_.md)

*   **Threat:** Use-After-Free via Dangling `weak_csptr`

    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit a use-after-free vulnerability if they can cause the application to access an object through a `weak_csptr` after the object has been destroyed. This occurs if the application doesn't properly check the result of `weak_csptr::lock()` *before* dereferencing the resulting `csptr`. The attacker might manipulate the application's state to ensure the owning `csptr` is destroyed while a `weak_csptr` still exists, and then trigger access through the `weak_csptr`. This is a direct misuse of the `weak_csptr` API.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution or application crashes (Denial of Service).
    *   **Affected Component:** `weak_csptr`, `weak_csptr::lock()` method.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Always* check the return value of `weak_csptr::lock()`. If it returns `nullptr`, do *not* use the returned `csptr`.
        *   Consider code refactoring to minimize the lifetime of `weak_csptr` instances.
        *   Use dynamic analysis tools (AddressSanitizer) to detect use-after-free errors.

## Threat: [Type Confusion with `csptr` Variants](./threats/type_confusion_with__csptr__variants.md)

*   **Threat:** Type Confusion with `csptr` Variants

    *   **Description:**  An attacker might exploit type confusion if they can influence the application to use the wrong type of `csptr` (e.g., using a mutable `csptr` where a `const_csptr` is expected). This could involve exploiting flaws in how the application *chooses* the correct `csptr` variant. The attacker might be able to bypass intended const-correctness, potentially leading to other vulnerabilities. This is a direct misuse of the different `csptr` types provided by the library.
    *   **Impact:** Unintended data modification (if a mutable `csptr` is used where a `const_csptr` was intended), potentially leading to logic errors or further exploitation. Could also lead to use-after-free or double-free if incorrect lifetime management is applied due to the wrong type.
    *   **Affected Component:** `csptr`, `const_csptr`, `unique_csptr`, `weak_csptr` (all `csptr` variants).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strict code reviews to ensure the correct `csptr` type is used in each context.
        *   Clear coding guidelines and naming conventions.
        *   Static analysis tools to help enforce type correctness.
        *   Thorough testing to verify const-correctness and lifetime management.

## Threat: [Custom Deleter Denial of Service](./threats/custom_deleter_denial_of_service.md)

* **Threat:** Custom Deleter Denial of Service

    * **Description:** An attacker could trigger a denial-of-service if they can influence the execution of a *custom deleter* associated with a `csptr`. If the custom deleter contains bugs (e.g., infinite loop, deadlock, or throws an unhandled exception), it could prevent the object from being properly deallocated or cause the application to crash. This is a direct threat related to the *custom deleter* feature of `libcsptr`.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource leaks, deadlocks, or application crashes.
    * **Affected Component:** `csptr` (custom deleter functionality).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly test custom deleters for all possible error conditions.
        * Ensure custom deleters are exception-safe and do not throw unhandled exceptions.
        * Avoid complex logic within custom deleters.
        * Consider using standard library deleters whenever possible.
