## Attack Tree Path: [***Exploit Reference Counting Issues*** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reference_counting_issues__critical_.md)

This encompasses attacks that manipulate the reference count of `cptr` objects, leading to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Incorrect logic in custom deleters causing premature decrements.
*   Race conditions in multi-threaded environments leading to incorrect reference count updates.
*   General programming errors that mishandle `cptr` objects.

## Attack Tree Path: [***Cause Double Free*** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_double_free__critical_.md)

An attacker aims to decrement the reference count of a `cptr` object multiple times, leading to the underlying memory being freed twice.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Flawed custom deleters that decrement the count more than once.
*   Race conditions where multiple threads decrement the same `cptr`'s count concurrently.
*   Logic errors in the application code that explicitly release the same `cptr` multiple times.

## Attack Tree Path: [***Cause Use-After-Free*** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_use-after-free__critical_.md)

The attacker attempts to access memory that has already been freed due to the `cptr`'s reference count reaching zero while the memory is still being referenced.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Incorrectly Implemented Custom Deleter [CRITICAL]:** A custom deleter might not account for all existing references, causing premature deallocation.
*   **Race Condition in Reference Count Management [CRITICAL]:** In multi-threaded scenarios, a race condition might cause the reference count to drop to zero and the memory to be freed while another thread is still accessing it.
*   Leaking raw pointers obtained from `cptr` objects and using them after the `cptr` has been destroyed.

## Attack Tree Path: [***Exploit Custom Deleter Vulnerabilities*** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_custom_deleter_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

Attackers target the custom deleter functionality of `cptr` to introduce or exploit vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Supply Malicious Custom Deleter [CRITICAL]:** If the application allows user-defined deleters, an attacker can provide a malicious deleter that executes arbitrary code when the `cptr` is destroyed.
*   **Exploit Flaws in Existing Custom Deleter [CRITICAL]:** Attackers can identify and trigger vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, incorrect memory freeing) within the application's existing custom deleters.

## Attack Tree Path: [***Exploit Concurrency Issues in Reference Counting*** [CRITICAL] (If application is multi-threaded)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_concurrency_issues_in_reference_counting__critical___if_application_is_multi-threaded_.md)

In multi-threaded applications, attackers exploit race conditions related to the incrementing and decrementing of `cptr` reference counts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Race Condition Leading to Double Free [CRITICAL]:** Multiple threads concurrently decrementing the reference count, leading to it reaching zero multiple times and causing a double free.
*   **Race Condition Leading to Use-After-Free [CRITICAL]:** One thread checks the reference count (seeing it as non-zero), while another thread concurrently decrements it to zero and deallocates the memory. The first thread then proceeds to access the freed memory.
