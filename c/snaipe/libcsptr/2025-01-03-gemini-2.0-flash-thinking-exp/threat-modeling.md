# Threat Model Analysis for snaipe/libcsptr

## Threat: [Double Free due to Incorrect `c_ptr` Management](./threats/double_free_due_to_incorrect__c_ptr__management.md)

**Description:** An attacker might trigger a code path where the same memory managed by a `c_ptr` is freed multiple times due to errors in how developers handle `c_ptr` objects. This can involve scenarios where raw pointers to the same memory are also freed or where ownership semantics of `c_ptr` instances are misunderstood, leading to multiple destruction attempts.

**Impact:** Memory corruption leading to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Affected `libcsptr` Component:** `c_ptr` type, specifically the destructor and copy/move semantics.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strict ownership rules for `c_ptr` objects within the codebase.
* Avoid mixing manual memory management with `c_ptr`.
* Implement rigorous code reviews focusing on `c_ptr` usage and ownership transfers.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free due to Premature `c_ptr` Destruction](./threats/use-after-free_due_to_premature__c_ptr__destruction.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a situation where memory managed by a `c_ptr` is accessed after the `c_ptr` has been destroyed. This can occur if raw pointers to the managed memory persist beyond the `c_ptr`'s lifetime or if there are logical flaws in the application's management of `c_ptr` object lifecycles.

**Impact:** Memory corruption leading to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Affected `libcsptr` Component:** `c_ptr` type, specifically the destructor and scope management.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the `c_ptr` object's lifetime encompasses the entire duration the managed resource is needed.
* Minimize the use of raw pointers obtained from `c_ptr_get()`.
* Carefully manage the scope of `c_ptr` objects to prevent premature destruction.

## Threat: [Race Conditions in Reference Counting (Multi-threading)](./threats/race_conditions_in_reference_counting__multi-threading_.md)

**Description:** In multi-threaded applications, concurrent access and modification of the same `c_ptr` object can lead to race conditions within `libcsptr`'s internal reference counting mechanism. This can result in incorrect reference counts, potentially leading to premature deallocation or memory leaks.

**Impact:** Memory corruption or memory leaks.

**Affected `libcsptr` Component:** Internal reference counting mechanism within `c_ptr`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, atomic operations) when multiple threads access the same `c_ptr` object.
* Design applications to minimize shared ownership of `c_ptr` objects across threads.
* Refer to `libcsptr`'s documentation for any thread-safety considerations or recommendations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Deleters](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_deleters.md)

**Description:** When using `c_ptr_make_custom`, vulnerabilities within the provided custom deleter function can be exploited. This could involve the deleter failing to release resources correctly, introducing new security flaws during cleanup, or potentially executing arbitrary code if the deleter is compromised.

**Impact:** Resource leaks, security vulnerabilities specific to the custom deleter's functionality, potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Affected `libcsptr` Component:** `c_ptr_make_custom` function and the mechanism for invoking custom deleters.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Treat custom deleters as security-sensitive code and subject them to rigorous testing and code reviews.
* Ensure custom deleters handle errors gracefully and do not introduce new vulnerabilities.
* Keep custom deleters as simple as possible to reduce the attack surface.

## Threat: [Type Confusion through Incorrect `c_ptr_cast` Usage](./threats/type_confusion_through_incorrect__c_ptr_cast__usage.md)

**Description:** Incorrect or unsafe usage of the `c_ptr_cast` function can lead to type confusion. If a `c_ptr` is cast to an incompatible type and subsequently accessed, the application might interpret memory in an unintended way, potentially leading to information disclosure or exploitable memory corruption.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, memory corruption, potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Affected `libcsptr` Component:** `c_ptr_cast` function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Exercise extreme caution when using `c_ptr_cast`.
* Ensure that casts are logically sound and that the underlying memory layout is compatible with the target type.
* Consider alternative design patterns that minimize the need for casting.
* Implement runtime checks or assertions where feasible to validate the type after casting.
