# Attack Surface Analysis for snaipe/libcsptr

## Attack Surface: [Reference Count Manipulation Leading to Double Free](./attack_surfaces/reference_count_manipulation_leading_to_double_free.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the reference count of a `cptr` instance, causing it to be deallocated prematurely while other parts of the application still hold a reference (raw pointer). Accessing this dangling pointer leads to a double-free vulnerability.
* **How `libcsptr` Contributes:** `libcsptr` manages object lifetime through reference counting. Incorrect manipulation of the reference count, even indirectly through application logic errors, can bypass this mechanism.
* **Example:** In a multithreaded application, two threads might decrement the reference count simultaneously without proper synchronization, causing it to drop to zero prematurely.
* **Impact:** Memory corruption, crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution if the freed memory is reallocated and attacker-controlled data is placed there.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strictly adhere to `libcsptr` usage patterns:** Ensure proper incrementing and decrementing of reference counts.
    * **Implement robust synchronization mechanisms:** Use mutexes, atomic operations, or other appropriate synchronization primitives when managing `cptr` instances in multithreaded environments.
    * **Careful code reviews:** Focus on logic involving `cptr` manipulation, especially in concurrent contexts.
    * **Consider using `cptr_weak` for non-owning references:** Where appropriate, use weak pointers to observe objects without affecting their lifetime.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Deleters](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_deleters.md)

* **Description:** The application utilizes custom deleter functions with `cptr`. These deleters might contain vulnerabilities themselves, such as buffer overflows or use-after-free issues. A malicious or buggy deleter can be triggered during object destruction.
* **How `libcsptr` Contributes:** `libcsptr` allows the use of custom deleters, extending its functionality but also shifting responsibility for the deleter's correctness to the application developer.
* **Example:** A custom deleter might use `free()` on memory that was not allocated with `malloc()`, leading to a crash. Or, it might contain a buffer overflow when handling specific data.
* **Impact:** Memory corruption, crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution if the vulnerable deleter can be controlled by an attacker.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Thoroughly review and test custom deleters:** Treat custom deleters as security-sensitive code.
    * **Minimize the use of custom deleters:** Rely on the default `free()` behavior whenever possible.
    * **Sanitize inputs to custom deleters:** If the deleter operates on external data, ensure proper validation and sanitization.
    * **Consider using RAII principles for resource management within deleters:** Ensure resources acquired in the deleter are properly released.

## Attack Surface: [Type Confusion via Incorrect `cptr_reinterpret` Usage](./attack_surfaces/type_confusion_via_incorrect__cptr_reinterpret__usage.md)

* **Description:** The `cptr_reinterpret` function allows casting a `cptr` to a different type. If used incorrectly, this can lead to type confusion vulnerabilities where the application treats a memory region as a different type than it actually is.
* **How `libcsptr` Contributes:** `libcsptr` provides the `cptr_reinterpret` function, which, while sometimes necessary, introduces the risk of unsafe type casting if not used cautiously.
* **Example:** A `cptr` pointing to a `struct A` is reinterpreted as a `cptr` to `struct B`, and the application attempts to access members that don't exist or have different layouts, leading to memory corruption.
* **Impact:** Memory corruption, crashes, potential for information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Minimize the use of `cptr_reinterpret`:** Only use it when absolutely necessary and with a clear understanding of the underlying memory layout.
    * **Thoroughly document and review code using `cptr_reinterpret`.
    * **Consider alternative approaches that avoid type casting if possible.**
    * **Use static analysis tools to detect potential type confusion issues.**
