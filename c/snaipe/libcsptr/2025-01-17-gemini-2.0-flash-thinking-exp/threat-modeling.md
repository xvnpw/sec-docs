# Threat Model Analysis for snaipe/libcsptr

## Threat: [Double Free via Incorrect Shared Pointer Management](./threats/double_free_via_incorrect_shared_pointer_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker might exploit a logic error in the application's code that leads to the reference count of a `shared_ptr` being manipulated incorrectly. This could involve exploiting race conditions, memory corruption vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that overwrite the reference count, or by triggering specific code paths that decrement the count prematurely or call the destructor directly on a shared object.
    *   **How:** The attacker could craft specific inputs or trigger certain application states that expose the flawed logic, leading to the object's underlying memory being freed multiple times.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, leading to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution if the freed memory is reallocated and attacker-controlled data is placed there.
    *   **Affected libcsptr Component:** `shared_ptr` (specifically the internal reference counting mechanism).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all code paths involving `shared_ptr` creation, copying, and destruction.
        *   Avoid manual manipulation of reference counts or casting away constness in ways that could break the reference counting mechanism.
        *   Employ static analysis and memory error detection tools (e.g., Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) during development and testing.
        *   Enforce coding standards that promote safe `shared_ptr` usage.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free due to Weak Pointer Misuse](./threats/use-after-free_due_to_weak_pointer_misuse.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could exploit a scenario where a `weak_ptr` is dereferenced (via `lock()`) after the managed object has been destroyed. This often happens when the lifetime of the shared pointer managing the object is shorter than expected or if the application logic incorrectly assumes the object is still valid.
    *   **How:** The attacker might trigger a sequence of events that leads to the shared pointer being destroyed while a weak pointer still holds a reference. Subsequently, the attacker could trigger the code path that attempts to access the object through the now-dangling weak pointer.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, leading to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected libcsptr Component:** `weak_ptr` (specifically the `lock()` method).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always check the return value of `weak_ptr::lock()` before accessing the managed object.
        *   Carefully design and document the ownership relationships between objects managed by shared and weak pointers.
        *   Ensure that the lifetime of the shared pointer managing the object is appropriately managed and understood in relation to the weak pointers.
        *   Use debugging tools to track the lifetime of shared and weak pointers during development.

## Threat: [Incorrect Custom Deleter Implementation](./threats/incorrect_custom_deleter_implementation.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** If the application uses custom deleters with smart pointers, an attacker might exploit vulnerabilities within the custom deleter itself. This could involve triggering conditions that cause the deleter to double-free memory, leak resources, or throw unexpected exceptions.
    *   **How:** The attacker might provide specific inputs or trigger application states that lead to the execution of the flawed custom deleter under vulnerable conditions.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, resource leaks, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom deleter.
    *   **Affected libcsptr Component:** `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr` (when used with custom deleters).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test custom deleters in isolation to ensure they correctly handle all necessary cleanup operations and are exception-safe.
        *   Prefer using standard library deleters or well-tested custom deleters where possible.
        *   Carefully review and audit custom deleter implementations.
        *   Consider using RAII principles within the custom deleter to manage resources safely.

## Threat: [Ownership Transfer Errors with Unique Pointers](./threats/ownership_transfer_errors_with_unique_pointers.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker might exploit errors in how `unique_ptr` ownership is transferred. Accidental copying instead of moving can lead to multiple `unique_ptr` instances managing the same resource, resulting in double frees when they go out of scope.
    *   **How:** The attacker might trigger code paths where `unique_ptr` objects are incorrectly copied (e.g., passing by value instead of by move or reference) leading to the creation of aliasing `unique_ptr`s.
    *   **Impact:** Double free, leading to memory corruption, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected libcsptr Component:** `unique_ptr`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Understand the semantics of `unique_ptr` and the importance of move semantics for transferring ownership.
        *   Use `std::move` explicitly when transferring ownership of `unique_ptr`s.
        *   Avoid passing `unique_ptr` by value. Pass by move or by reference instead.
        *   Utilize compiler warnings and static analysis tools to detect potential ownership transfer errors.
