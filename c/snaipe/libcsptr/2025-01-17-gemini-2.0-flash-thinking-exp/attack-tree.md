## Attack Tree Path: [Use-After-Free Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/use-after-free_vulnerability.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * The attacker identifies a code path where a raw pointer is obtained from a `csptr` using `csptr_get()`.
    * The attacker then manipulates the application state to cause the `csptr` (or all `csptr` instances managing the underlying object) to be destroyed, freeing the memory.
    * Subsequently, the attacker triggers the use of the previously obtained raw pointer, leading to access of freed memory.
* **Critical Node: Accessing a raw pointer obtained from a csptr after the underlying object has been deallocated.** This is the precise moment the vulnerability is triggered.
* **Critical Node: Potential for arbitrary code execution if the freed memory is reallocated and attacker controls the new content.** If the attacker can control the data placed in the reallocated memory, they can overwrite function pointers or other critical data structures, leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrect implementation of custom deleter leading to double free](./attack_tree_paths/incorrect_implementation_of_custom_deleter_leading_to_double_free.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * The application uses a custom deleter with a flaw that causes the memory to be freed multiple times.
    * The attacker triggers the destruction of multiple `csptr` instances that rely on this flawed custom deleter.
* **Critical Node: Incorrect implementation of custom deleter leading to double free.** The vulnerability lies within the custom deleter's code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Custom Deleter](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_custom_deleter.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * The attacker compromises a part of the system that provides the custom deleter (e.g., a shared library, configuration file).
    * The application loads and uses this malicious custom deleter.
    * When a `csptr` using this deleter is destroyed, the malicious code is executed.
* **Critical Node: Malicious Custom Deleter.** The deleter itself is the attack vector.
* **Critical Node: Arbitrary code execution when the csptr is destroyed and the malicious deleter is invoked.** This is the direct consequence of using a malicious deleter.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Custom Deleter Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_custom_deleter_implementation.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * The developer implements a custom deleter with a standard memory safety vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, use-after-free within the deleter).
    * When the `csptr` is destroyed, and the vulnerable deleter is executed, the attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
* **Critical Node: Vulnerable Custom Deleter Implementation.** The vulnerability exists within the developer-written deleter code.
* **Critical Node: Arbitrary code execution or other memory corruption issues when the csptr is destroyed.** Exploiting the vulnerability in the deleter leads to these consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dangling Pointer Creation](./attack_tree_paths/dangling_pointer_creation.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * The application incorrectly uses `csptr_release()` on a `csptr` instance while other `csptr` instances are still expected to manage the same underlying object.
    * This detaches the released `csptr` from the memory management, but the memory is not freed because other `csptr` instances still exist.
    * However, the released `csptr` now holds a dangling pointer.
    * Subsequent attempts to access the object through the *other* remaining `csptr` instances might then lead to a use-after-free if those are the last `csptr` instances to be destroyed.
* **Critical Node: Dangling Pointer Creation.** The moment `csptr_release()` is misused, creating the dangling pointer.
* **Critical Node: Subsequent access through the other csptrs leads to use-after-free vulnerabilities.** This is the consequence of the dangling pointer creation.
