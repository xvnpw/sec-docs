# Attack Surface Analysis for snaipe/libcsptr

## Attack Surface: [Double Free Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/double_free_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Memory corruption occurs when the same memory is freed multiple times.
    *   **How `libcsptr` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Incorrect usage patterns or logic errors in the application can lead to scenarios where the underlying raw pointer managed by a `c_ptr` is freed more than once. This can happen if multiple `c_ptr` instances incorrectly believe they own the same memory or if a raw pointer obtained from a `c_ptr` is manually freed elsewhere.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/use-after-free_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Accessing memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.
    *   **How `libcsptr` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If a `c_ptr` goes out of scope or is reset, the underlying memory is deallocated. If the application retains a raw pointer to this memory (obtained via `get()`) and attempts to access it after the `c_ptr`'s destruction, a use-after-free vulnerability occurs.
    *   **Impact:** Information leaks, memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Deleters](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_deleters.md)

*   **Description:**  Security flaws within user-defined functions that are executed when a `c_ptr` is destroyed.
    *   **How `libcsptr` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `libcsptr` allows the use of custom deleter functions to manage resources beyond simple memory deallocation. If these custom deleters contain vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, incorrect resource cleanup), the destruction of the `c_ptr` will trigger the execution of this vulnerable code.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, resource manipulation, denial of service, depending on the vulnerability in the deleter.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions in Reference Counting](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_in_reference_counting.md)

*   **Description:**  Unexpected behavior or memory corruption due to concurrent access and modification of the reference count in a multi-threaded environment.
    *   **How `libcsptr` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While `libcsptr` likely implements thread-safe reference counting mechanisms, subtle race conditions might still exist in specific usage scenarios, especially with complex object interactions and concurrent access to `c_ptr` instances from multiple threads.
    *   **Impact:** Double free, use-after-free, memory leaks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
