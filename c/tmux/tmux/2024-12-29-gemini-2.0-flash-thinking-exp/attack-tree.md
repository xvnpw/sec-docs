**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit tmux Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
    *   Attackers target known security flaws (CVEs) or undiscovered vulnerabilities within the `tmux` software itself. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation within the `tmux` environment, potentially impacting the application.

*   **Leverage Known tmux CVEs (High-Risk Path Start):**
    *   Attackers utilize publicly documented vulnerabilities in specific versions of `tmux`. This often involves readily available exploit code, making it a relatively easier path if the target is running a vulnerable version.

*   **Exploit Buffer Overflows (Critical Node):**
    *   A type of vulnerability where an attacker can write data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions. This can be used to inject and execute malicious code.

*   **Exploit Unpatched tmux Instances (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Start):**
    *   Applications using outdated versions of `tmux` are susceptible to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in later versions. Attackers can easily target these known weaknesses.

*   **Target Outdated tmux Version (Critical Node):**
    *   The specific action of identifying and targeting an application using an older, vulnerable version of `tmux`.

*   **Manipulate tmux Session (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Start):**
    *   Attackers aim to gain control over the `tmux` session that the application is using. This allows them to interact with the session, send commands, and potentially compromise the application's processes.

*   **Attach to Application's tmux Session (Critical Node):**
    *   The initial step in manipulating a `tmux` session. Attackers attempt to connect to the application's `tmux` session without proper authorization.

*   **Exploit Weak Session Naming/Permissions (High-Risk Path Start):**
    *   If the `tmux` session has a predictable name or overly permissive access controls, attackers can easily attach to it.

*   **Exploit Insecure Default Permissions (Critical Node):**
    *   Default `tmux` configurations might have permissions that allow unauthorized users to attach to sessions or interact with the `tmux` server socket.

*   **Exploit tmux Socket Permissions (Critical Node):**
    *   The `tmux` server communicates via a socket. If the permissions on this socket are weak, attackers can gain control over the `tmux` server and all its sessions.

*   **Inject Malicious Commands (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Start):**
    *   Once attached to a `tmux` session, attackers can send commands that are executed within the context of that session, potentially impacting the application.

*   **Send Malicious Commands via `send-keys` (Critical Node):**
    *   The `send-keys` command allows sending keystrokes to a `tmux` pane. Attackers can use this to execute shell commands or interact with application processes.

*   **Execute Shell Commands (Critical Node):**
    *   The attacker successfully uses `send-keys` or other methods to execute arbitrary shell commands within the `tmux` session, potentially gaining control over the application's environment.

*   **Exploit Command Injection in Application's tmux Usage (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Start):**
    *   If the application constructs `tmux` commands based on user input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands that are then executed by `tmux`.

*   **Application Constructs Insecure tmux Commands (Critical Node):**
    *   The root cause of command injection in this context. The application's code is vulnerable to allowing malicious input to be incorporated into `tmux` commands.

*   **Exploit tmux Configuration (Critical Node):**
    *   Attackers aim to modify the `tmux` configuration files (e.g., `.tmux.conf`) to execute malicious commands when a new session or window is created, or to disable security features.

*   **Exploit User Interaction with tmux (High-Risk Path Start):**
    *   Attackers leverage user interaction or lack of proper input validation to compromise the application through `tmux`.

*   **Inject Malicious Input that is Passed to tmux (Critical Node):**
    *   If the application takes user input and directly passes it to `tmux` commands without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands that are then executed by `tmux`.
