# Threat Model Analysis for mozilla/mozjpeg

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in JPEG Decoding](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_jpeg_decoding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JPEG image with carefully manipulated header or data segments. When `mozjpeg` attempts to decode this image, the flawed parsing logic writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap or stack. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions. The attacker might be able to overwrite return addresses or function pointers, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:**  Critical. Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to gain complete control over the application process, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** JPEG Decoder/Parser (specifically within the functions handling header parsing, Huffman decoding, or IDCT).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `mozjpeg` updated to the latest version, as security patches often address buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement robust input validation to reject images with excessively large dimensions or unusual header structures before passing them to `mozjpeg`.
    *   Consider running `mozjpeg` in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to contain potential damage.
    *   Utilize memory safety tools and techniques during development and testing of the application.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Image Dimension Calculations](./threats/integer_overflow_in_image_dimension_calculations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a JPEG image with extremely large dimensions or manipulated metadata that causes integer overflow during calculations within `mozjpeg`. This overflow can lead to the allocation of insufficient memory buffers, resulting in subsequent buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues during processing.
*   **Impact:** High. Could lead to buffer overflows and potentially arbitrary code execution. It can also cause application crashes and denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** JPEG Decoder/Parser (specifically functions calculating buffer sizes based on image dimensions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `mozjpeg` updated.
    *   Implement checks on image dimensions before processing to ensure they fall within reasonable limits.
    *   Use libraries or functions that provide protection against integer overflows where possible.
    *   Perform thorough testing with images having extreme or unusual dimensions.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits a specially crafted JPEG image that is computationally expensive for `mozjpeg` to process. This could involve highly complex DCT coefficients, deeply nested markers, or other features that consume excessive CPU time or memory during decompression or optimization. Repeated submission of such images can overwhelm the application's resources, leading to unresponsiveness or crashes.
*   **Impact:** High. Can render the application unavailable to legitimate users, causing disruption of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Decompression/Compression Engine (functions involved in Huffman decoding, IDCT, and optimization).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement timeouts for image processing operations to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
    *   Set limits on the maximum size and complexity of input JPEG images.
    *   Employ rate limiting to restrict the number of image processing requests from a single source within a given timeframe.
    *   Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) during image processing and implement alerts for unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying libjpeg-turbo Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libjpeg-turbo_library.md)

*   **Description:** `mozjpeg` is based on `libjpeg-turbo`. Security vulnerabilities discovered in `libjpeg-turbo` can potentially affect applications using `mozjpeg`. An attacker could exploit these underlying vulnerabilities through crafted JPEG images.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability in `libjpeg-turbo`. Could range from low (minor information disclosure) to critical (remote code execution).
*   **Affected Component:**  Various components within `mozjpeg` that rely on `libjpeg-turbo` functionality (including decoding, encoding, and error handling).
*   **Risk Severity:**  Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the underlying vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay informed about security advisories and updates for `libjpeg-turbo`.
    *   Ensure that the version of `mozjpeg` being used incorporates the latest security patches from `libjpeg-turbo`. Regularly update `mozjpeg`.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities inherited from `libjpeg-turbo`.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise](./threats/supply_chain_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Although less likely for a reputable project like `mozjpeg`, there's a theoretical risk that the distributed binaries or source code of `mozjpeg` could be compromised, containing malicious code. An attacker could inject backdoors or vulnerabilities into the library before it's distributed.
*   **Impact:** Critical. If the library itself is compromised, it could have widespread and severe consequences for applications using it, potentially allowing for remote code execution or data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** The entire `mozjpeg` library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (impact is critical if it occurs).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Obtain `mozjpeg` from trusted and official sources (e.g., the official GitHub repository or trusted package managers).
    *   Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums or digital signatures provided by the developers.
    *   Consider building `mozjpeg` from source to have more control over the build process.
    *   Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the dependencies of `mozjpeg`.
