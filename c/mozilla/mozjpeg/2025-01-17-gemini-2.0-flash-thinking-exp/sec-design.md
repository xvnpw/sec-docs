# Project Design Document: mozjpeg

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed design overview of the `mozjpeg` project, a fork of the libjpeg-turbo library with a focus on achieving higher JPEG compression efficiency and improved perceptual quality. This document is specifically crafted to facilitate subsequent threat modeling activities by clearly outlining the system's architecture, data flow, and potential points of interaction.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of the `mozjpeg` project are:

* **Superior Compression:**  Reduce JPEG file sizes significantly for a given level of visual fidelity compared to standard libjpeg implementations.
* **Enhanced Perceptual Quality:** Produce JPEG images that exhibit fewer visual artifacts at equivalent compression levels.
* **Broad Compatibility:** Maintain a high degree of compatibility with existing JPEG decoders and standards.
* **Optimized Performance:** Deliver competitive encoding and decoding speeds.
* **Robust Security:**  Maintain and enhance the security posture inherited from libjpeg-turbo, minimizing potential vulnerabilities.

## 3. Architectural Overview

`mozjpeg` is fundamentally a library (`libjpeg.so` or `libjpeg.dylib`) offering programmatic interfaces for JPEG encoding and decoding. It also includes command-line utilities built upon this library. The core processing for both encoding and decoding follows a well-defined pipeline structure.

## 4. Data Flow

### 4.1 Encoding Process

* **Input Stage:**
    * Raw image data (typically in RGB or other formats) is received by the encoder, either through function calls in the library or as input to the `cjpeg` command-line tool.
* **Preprocessing:**
    * **Color Space Conversion:** Input data is transformed into the YCbCr color space, the standard for JPEG.
    * **Downsampling:** Chroma subsampling may be applied to reduce the resolution of the color components (Cb and Cr), improving compression.
* **Core Compression:**
    * **Block Segmentation:** The image is divided into 8x8 pixel blocks.
    * **DCT:** The Discrete Cosine Transform is applied to each block, converting spatial pixel values into frequency domain coefficients.
    * **Quantization:** DCT coefficients are quantized, reducing the precision of higher-frequency components. This is the primary lossy step and is where `mozjpeg`'s optimizations are significant.
* **Entropy Encoding:**
    * **Huffman or Arithmetic Coding:** Quantized coefficients are compressed using either Huffman coding (default) or arithmetic coding.
* **Output Stage:**
    * The compressed data is formatted into a JPEG bitstream, including headers and markers, and outputted either via the library API or written to a file by `cjpeg`.

### 4.2 Decoding Process

* **Input Stage:**
    * A JPEG bitstream is provided to the decoder, either through library function calls or as input to the `djpeg` command-line tool.
* **Entropy Decoding:**
    * The compressed data is decoded using the corresponding entropy decoding method (Huffman or arithmetic).
* **Inverse Transformation:**
    * **Dequantization:** Quantized DCT coefficients are scaled back to approximate their original values.
    * **IDCT:** The Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform is applied to the dequantized coefficients, converting them back to the spatial domain (pixel values).
* **Postprocessing:**
    * **Block Assembly:** 8x8 pixel blocks are reassembled to form the image.
    * **Color Space Conversion:** The YCbCr data is converted back to the desired output color space (e.g., RGB).
* **Output Stage:**
    * The reconstructed image data is outputted, either through the library API or written to a file by `djpeg`.

## 6. Dependencies

`mozjpeg` relies on the following core dependencies:

* **Operating System Kernel:**  Interacts with the operating system kernel for file system access, memory allocation, and other system-level operations. Security vulnerabilities in the kernel could be exploited if `mozjpeg` interacts with them in an insecure manner.
* **Optional Dependencies (for enhanced features or performance):**
    * **SIMD Intrinsics (SSE, AVX, etc.):**  Used for performance optimizations on supported CPU architectures. These are typically compiler-specific and rely on the correct implementation of these instructions by the CPU. Incorrect usage could lead to unexpected behavior.
    * **Assembly Language (Platform-Specific):**  May include hand-optimized assembly code for critical performance sections. Security vulnerabilities could arise from errors in this assembly code.

## 7. Deployment Scenarios and Attack Surfaces

`mozjpeg` is utilized in a variety of deployment scenarios, each presenting a unique attack surface:

* **Command-Line Tool Usage:**
    * **Scenario:** Users execute `cjpeg`, `djpeg`, or `jpegtran` directly on image files.
    * **Attack Surface:**
        * **Malicious Input Files:**  Crafted JPEG files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the decoding or transformation logic.
        * **Command Injection:** If the tool is used in scripts or pipelines where filenames or options are dynamically generated from untrusted sources.
        * **Resource Exhaustion:**  Large or specially crafted files could consume excessive CPU, memory, or disk space.
* **Library Integration in Applications (e.g., Web Servers, Image Editors):**
    * **Scenario:** Developers integrate `libjpeg` into their applications for image processing.
    * **Attack Surface:**
        * **Vulnerabilities in Calling Application:**  The application using `mozjpeg` might pass incorrect or malicious data to the library.

        * **Untrusted Input Sources:** Images might originate from untrusted sources (e.g., downloaded from the internet).

## 8. Security Considerations for Threat Modeling

The following security considerations should be thoroughly investigated during threat modeling:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Malformed JPEG Headers:** Ensure robust parsing and validation of JPEG headers to prevent exploitation of malformed structures.

    * **Heap Overflows:**  Carefully manage heap allocations and deallocations to avoid heap corruption.
    * **Use-After-Free:**  Ensure that memory is not accessed after it has been freed.
* **Integer Handling:**
    * **Integer Overflows/Underflows:**  Thoroughly review arithmetic operations, especially during DCT, quantization, and bitstream parsing, to prevent integer overflows or underflows.
    * **Signedness Issues:**  Ensure correct handling of signed and unsigned integers in calculations.
