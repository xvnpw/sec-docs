# Attack Surface Analysis for mozilla/mozjpeg

## Attack Surface: [Malformed JPEG Input Leading to Memory Corruption](./attack_surfaces/malformed_jpeg_input_leading_to_memory_corruption.md)

* **Description:** Malformed JPEG Input Leading to Memory Corruption
    * **How mozjpeg Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in `mozjpeg`'s C/C++ code related to buffer handling or memory allocation during JPEG parsing could be exploited by specially crafted malformed JPEGs.
    * **Example:** A JPEG with an excessively large or negative dimension value could cause `mozjpeg` to allocate an insufficient buffer, leading to a buffer overflow when processing pixel data.
    * **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution if the memory corruption can be controlled by the attacker. Data corruption or application crashes are also possible.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep `mozjpeg` updated to the latest version, as security patches often address memory safety issues.
        * Utilize compiler-level security features like AddressSanitizer (ASan) or MemorySanitizer (MSan) during development and testing to detect memory errors.
        * Consider fuzzing `mozjpeg` with a wide range of malformed JPEG inputs to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Image Processing Calculations](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflowunderflow_in_image_processing_calculations.md)

* **Description:** Integer Overflow/Underflow in Image Processing Calculations
    * **How mozjpeg Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `mozjpeg` performs various arithmetic operations during JPEG decoding and encoding. Integer overflows or underflows in these calculations, especially related to image dimensions or buffer sizes, can lead to unexpected behavior or memory corruption.
    * **Example:** A JPEG with extremely large dimensions could cause an integer overflow when calculating the required buffer size, leading to a heap overflow when the library attempts to write pixel data.
    * **Impact:** Potential for memory corruption and arbitrary code execution. Application crashes or unexpected image output are also possible.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully review the application's usage of `mozjpeg`'s API, ensuring that input parameters are within expected ranges.
        * While less direct, staying updated with `mozjpeg` releases is crucial as developers address such issues.
        * Implement checks within the application to validate image dimensions before processing with `mozjpeg`.
