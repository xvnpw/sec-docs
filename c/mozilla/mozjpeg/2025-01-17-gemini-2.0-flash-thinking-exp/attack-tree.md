## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploiting Memory Corruption leading to Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploiting_memory_corruption_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerability in mozjpeg Processing [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker targets inherent flaws in how mozjpeg handles image data.
*   **Trigger Memory Corruption [HIGH-RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker aims to corrupt memory used by mozjpeg, paving the way for code execution.
    *   **Provide Maliciously Crafted Input Image [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker crafts a specific image designed to trigger a memory corruption vulnerability. This can involve:
        *   Exploiting Buffer Overflows: Injecting data beyond allocated buffer boundaries by providing images with:
            *   Excessively large image dimensions.
            *   Overly long metadata fields (e.g., EXIF).
        *   Exploiting Integer Overflows: Providing image data that causes integer overflow during memory allocation calculations, leading to undersized buffers.
        *   Exploiting Heap Overflows: Crafting images that cause incorrect heap allocation sizes, leading to overflows during processing.
        *   Exploiting Use-After-Free vulnerabilities: Creating images that trigger premature freeing of memory that is later accessed.
    *   **Vulnerable mozjpeg version is used [HIGH-RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]:** The application uses an outdated version of mozjpeg containing known, unpatched memory corruption vulnerabilities.
    *   **Application processes the malicious image without sufficient sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]:** The application fails to adequately validate or sanitize the input image before passing it to mozjpeg, allowing the malicious image to be processed.
    *   **Achieve Code Execution [HIGH-RISK PATH END] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Successful memory corruption allows the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code within the application's process.
        *   **Gain control of the application process [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker achieves control over the running application.
        *   **Exfiltrate sensitive data [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker steals sensitive information accessible to the application.
        *   **Modify application data or behavior [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker alters application data or its functionality for malicious purposes.
        *   **Launch further attacks on the system [CRITICAL NODE]:** The compromised application is used as a foothold to attack other parts of the system or network.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Triggering Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_triggering_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerability in mozjpeg Processing [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker targets flaws in mozjpeg's processing logic to cause a denial of service.
*   **Trigger Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH-RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker aims to make the application unavailable by exhausting its resources or causing it to crash.
    *   **Provide Maliciously Crafted Input Image [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker crafts a specific image designed to trigger a DoS condition. This can involve:
        *   Causing Infinite Loops: Crafting images that trigger parsing errors leading to infinite loops in the decoding process, consuming excessive CPU.
        *   Causing Excessive Resource Consumption: Providing images that require significant resources to process:
            *   Highly complex images demanding excessive CPU processing.
            *   Images with excessive metadata leading to high memory usage.
        *   Triggering Unhandled Exception/Crash: Providing images with invalid or unexpected data that causes a crash in the mozjpeg library.
    *   **Vulnerable mozjpeg version is used [HIGH-RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]:** The application uses an outdated version of mozjpeg that is susceptible to DoS attacks via specific image formats or malformed data.
    *   **Disrupt application availability [HIGH-RISK PATH END] [CRITICAL NODE]:** The DoS attack successfully makes the application unavailable.
        *   Making the application unresponsive.
        *   Crashing the application.
