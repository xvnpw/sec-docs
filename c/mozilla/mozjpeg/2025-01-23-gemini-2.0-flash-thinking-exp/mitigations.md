# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mozilla/mozjpeg

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Image Format Validation *Before* mozjpeg Processing](./mitigation_strategies/strict_image_format_validation_before_mozjpeg_processing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Expected JPEG Standards for mozjpeg:** Determine the specific JPEG standards and profiles that your application intends to process with `mozjpeg`.
    2.  **Choose Validation Library (External to mozjpeg):** Select a robust image validation library *separate* from `mozjpeg` to perform initial checks *before* passing data to `mozjpeg`. This ensures validation is independent of potential `mozjpeg` vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Implement Pre-mozjpeg Validation Function:** Create a function that takes the raw image data as input and performs validation *before* `mozjpeg` is invoked:
        *   Use the chosen validation library to analyze the image header and metadata.
        *   Verify the image signature (magic bytes) to confirm it's a JPEG file before `mozjpeg` attempts to decode it.
        *   Check for basic conformance to expected JPEG structure *before* `mozjpeg` parsing.
        *   Reject images that fail validation *before* they are processed by `mozjpeg`.
    4.  **Integrate into Input Pipeline (Pre-mozjpeg):** Integrate this validation function at the earliest point in your application's image processing pipeline, *immediately before* passing the image data to `mozjpeg` for decoding or encoding.
    5.  **Handle Validation Failures (Pre-mozjpeg):** Implement error handling for validation failures *before* `mozjpeg` processing. Log errors and prevent the invalid image from being passed to `mozjpeg`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Image Exploits in mozjpeg (High Severity):** Prevents processing of crafted images designed to exploit vulnerabilities *within* `mozjpeg`'s decoder by ensuring a basic level of format integrity beforehand.
    *   **Denial of Service via mozjpeg (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of DoS attacks that could target resource consumption *in* `mozjpeg` by rejecting malformed images *before* they reach `mozjpeg`'s processing engine.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Image Exploits in mozjpeg: High Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploits targeting `mozjpeg` by filtering out potentially malicious inputs *before* they are processed by the library.
    *   **Denial of Service via mozjpeg: Medium Impact:** Reduces the likelihood of DoS attacks that rely on exploiting resource-intensive behavior *within* `mozjpeg` when processing malformed images.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in the image upload service with basic MIME type checking. Deeper JPEG header validation *before* `mozjpeg` processing is missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Detailed JPEG header and structure validation needs to be implemented *before* image data is passed to `mozjpeg` in both the image upload service and image processing backend.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Size and Dimension Limits *for mozjpeg Processing*](./mitigation_strategies/size_and_dimension_limits_for_mozjpeg_processing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Acceptable Limits for mozjpeg:** Determine the maximum acceptable image dimensions (width, height) and file size that `mozjpeg` will be allowed to process, based on your application's resource constraints and expected usage of `mozjpeg`.
    2.  **Implement Size Checks *Before* mozjpeg Processing:** Implement checks in your application to verify image dimensions and file size *before* invoking `mozjpeg`.
        *   Check file size before passing data to `mozjpeg`.
        *   If possible, extract image dimensions from the header *before* full `mozjpeg` decoding (using a lightweight header parsing method) to avoid resource consumption by `mozjpeg` on oversized images. Alternatively, check dimensions after `mozjpeg` decoding but before further processing, ensuring resource limits are still effective.
    3.  **Enforce Limits *Before* mozjpeg Processing:** Reject images that exceed the defined size or dimension limits *before* they are processed by `mozjpeg`. Prevent `mozjpeg` from being invoked on oversized images.
    4.  **Configuration for mozjpeg Limits:** Make these limits configurable specifically for `mozjpeg` processing, allowing adjustments without code changes if `mozjpeg`'s resource usage characteristics change or application needs evolve.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service via mozjpeg (High Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks that could exploit resource consumption *within* `mozjpeg* by limiting the size and complexity of images processed by the library.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion during mozjpeg Processing (High Severity):** Protects against resource exhaustion scenarios where processing very large images with `mozjpeg` consumes excessive memory or CPU, impacting application performance and stability *due to mozjpeg's operation*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service via mozjpeg: High Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks that target resource exhaustion *within* `mozjpeg` by limiting input size.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion during mozjpeg Processing: High Impact:** Effectively prevents resource exhaustion caused by `mozjpeg` processing oversized images.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic file size limits are implemented in the image upload service, but these are not specifically tailored to `mozjpeg`'s processing characteristics. Dimension limits relevant to `mozjpeg` are not enforced.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dimension limits (width and height) need to be implemented *before* passing data to `mozjpeg* in both the image upload service and the image processing backend. Configuration options specific to `mozjpeg` processing limits should be added.
