## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict JPEG Validation *Before* MozJPEG Processing](./mitigation_strategies/strict_jpeg_validation_before_mozjpeg_processing.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Strict JPEG Validation *Before* MozJPEG Processing

Here are mitigation strategies that directly involve `mozjpeg` library, focusing on its specific threats:

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement a Pre-processing Validation Step:** Before passing any JPEG data to `mozjpeg` for decoding or encoding, implement a validation step.
    2.  **Verify JPEG Structure:** Use a dedicated JPEG validation library or custom code to check for a valid JPEG file structure. This includes verifying the JPEG header markers (SOI, SOF, etc.) and segment structure.
    3.  **Sanitize Input Data:** Ensure the input data stream conforms strictly to the expected JPEG format *before* `mozjpeg` attempts to parse it. This can involve rejecting files that deviate from the standard or attempting to repair minor inconsistencies (with caution).
    4.  **Dimension Checks (Relevance to MozJPEG):** While `mozjpeg` is generally robust, sanity checks on image dimensions *before* processing can prevent potential issues if extremely large or unusual dimensions are encountered by `mozjpeg`'s internal decoding routines. Limit image width and height to reasonable values based on your application's needs.
    5.  **Progressive Scan Handling (MozJPEG Specific):** Be aware that `mozjpeg` handles progressive JPEGs. If your application doesn't require progressive features and you suspect potential issues with progressive JPEG handling in `mozjpeg` (though unlikely in recent versions), consider converting progressive JPEGs to baseline before `mozjpeg` processing or rejecting them.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Maliciously Crafted JPEGs Exploiting MozJPEG Parsing Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** By validating the JPEG structure *before* `mozjpeg` processes it, you reduce the risk of triggering vulnerabilities within `mozjpeg`'s parsing logic that might be exploited by malformed JPEGs.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior in MozJPEG due to Non-Standard JPEGs (Medium Severity):**  Ensuring input conforms to JPEG standards minimizes the chance of `mozjpeg` encountering unexpected data structures that could lead to errors, crashes, or undefined behavior within the library.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Maliciously Crafted JPEGs Exploiting MozJPEG Parsing Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Unexpected Behavior in MozJPEG due to Non-Standard JPEGs:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the backend image processing service. Basic MIME type checks are performed before file processing, but no in-depth JPEG structure validation specific to `mozjpeg` input is done.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Detailed JPEG structure validation tailored for `mozjpeg` input, dimension sanity checks relevant to `mozjpeg` processing, and specific handling of progressive JPEGs in relation to `mozjpeg` are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Compile MozJPEG with Security Hardening Flags](./mitigation_strategies/compile_mozjpeg_with_security_hardening_flags.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Compile MozJPEG with Security Hardening Flags

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Modify MozJPEG Compilation Process:** When building `mozjpeg` from source (which is often recommended for control and customization), adjust the compilation flags.
    2.  **Enable Compiler Security Features:**  Utilize compiler flags that activate security features during the compilation of `mozjpeg`'s C/C++ code. Key flags include:
        *   **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) - System Level:** Ensure your operating system and compiler support ASLR, which randomizes memory addresses to make exploitation of memory corruption bugs harder. This is generally a system-wide setting but compilation flags can influence its effectiveness.
        *   **Data Execution Prevention (DEP) / No-Execute (NX) (`-Wl,-z,noexecstack` for GCC/Clang):** Prevent execution of code from data segments, mitigating buffer overflow attacks.
        *   **Stack Smashing Protection (SSP) (`-fstack-protector-strong` for GCC/Clang):** Detect and prevent stack buffer overflows by inserting canaries on the stack.
        *   **Fortify Source (`-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` for GCC/Clang):** Enable compile-time and runtime checks for buffer overflows and other memory safety issues, leveraging safer versions of standard library functions.
    3.  **Recompile and Link:** Recompile the `mozjpeg` library with these flags enabled. Ensure your application is then linked against this newly compiled, hardened version of `mozjpeg`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in MozJPEG Code (High to Medium Severity):**  Compiler-level security features make it significantly harder for attackers to successfully exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows, use-after-free) that might be present in `mozjpeg`'s C/C++ codebase. These features don't eliminate vulnerabilities, but they raise the bar for exploitation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in MozJPEG Code:** Medium Risk Reduction (Mitigation, increases exploitation difficulty, doesn't prevent vulnerabilities).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Standard compilation process is used for `mozjpeg` if compiled from source, but explicit security hardening compiler flags are not actively configured or verified during the `mozjpeg` build process.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Configuration and verification of security-focused compiler flags (ASLR, DEP/NX, SSP, Fortify Source) during `mozjpeg` compilation are missing. Recompilation of `mozjpeg` with these flags and integration into the build pipeline is required to implement this mitigation.
