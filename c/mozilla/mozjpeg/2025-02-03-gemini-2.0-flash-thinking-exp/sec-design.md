# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Priority 1: Optimize JPEG encoding to reduce file size without significant loss of quality.
  - Priority 2: Maintain compatibility with existing JPEG standards and decoders.
  - Priority 3: Provide a performant and efficient JPEG encoding solution.
  - Priority 4: Offer mozjpeg as an open-source and freely available tool.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk 1: Introduction of bugs or vulnerabilities in the optimization process that could lead to corrupted images or security issues in applications using mozjpeg.
  - Risk 2: Performance regressions in new versions that could negatively impact user experience.
  - Risk 3: Lack of adoption if the tool is not easy to use or integrate into existing workflows.
  - Risk 4: Dependency on community contributions and maintenance, which can be unpredictable.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code is publicly available on GitHub for review and scrutiny. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Bug reports and issues are tracked publicly on GitHub. (Implemented: GitHub Issues)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk: Lack of formal security testing or dedicated security team for the project.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Integrate dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by mozjpeg.
  - security control: Establish a process for handling security vulnerability reports, including a dedicated security contact and a defined response timeline.
  - security control: Encourage and facilitate security audits of the codebase by external security experts.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for mozjpeg as a library/tool itself. Authentication might be relevant for systems that integrate mozjpeg and require user access control.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for mozjpeg as a library/tool itself. Authorization might be relevant for systems that integrate mozjpeg and need to control access to image processing functionalities.
  - Input Validation: Critical. mozjpeg must robustly handle various image formats and inputs to prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, denial-of-service, or arbitrary code execution through maliciously crafted images. Input validation should be implemented at the image decoding stage.
  - Cryptography: JPEG format itself does not inherently involve strong cryptography for encoding. However, if mozjpeg is used in contexts requiring secure image handling (e.g., watermarking, secure transmission), integration with cryptographic libraries might be necessary in the applications using mozjpeg, but not within mozjpeg core itself.
