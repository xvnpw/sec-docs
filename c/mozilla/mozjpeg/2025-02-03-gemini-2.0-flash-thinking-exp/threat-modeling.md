# Threat Model Analysis for mozilla/mozjpeg

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Image Processing](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_image_processing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a JPEG image with dimensions or metadata values designed to cause integer overflows or underflows during `mozjpeg`'s internal calculations, particularly when determining buffer sizes. This can lead to undersized buffer allocations. When `mozjpeg` attempts to write image data into these undersized buffers, it results in a buffer overflow. The attacker could manipulate image dimensions or other parameters within the JPEG to trigger this.
    *   **Impact:** Buffer Overflow, Memory Corruption, Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Affected Component:** `mozjpeg` Decoder/Encoder (modules handling image dimensions and buffer management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use compiler and OS features to detect integer overflows (AddressSanitizer, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer) during development and testing.
        *   Audit code paths in the application interacting with `mozjpeg` that handle image dimensions and sizes.
        *   Keep `mozjpeg` updated to the latest version for security patches.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Decoding/Encoding Routines](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_decodingencoding_routines.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted JPEG image that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability within `mozjpeg`'s decoding or encoding routines. This could be due to incorrect bounds checking or memory management within these core modules. The attacker aims to overwrite memory beyond allocated buffers when `mozjpeg` processes the image.
    *   **Impact:** Buffer Overflow, Memory Corruption, Potential RCE.
    *   **Affected Component:** `mozjpeg` Decoder/Encoder (core decoding and encoding modules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `mozjpeg` to the latest version for security patches.
        *   Use memory safety tools (AddressSanitizer, Valgrind, fuzzing) during development and testing.
        *   Employ compiler-level mitigations (stack canaries, ASLR).

## Threat: [Heap Overflow](./threats/heap_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a JPEG image that triggers a heap overflow vulnerability in `mozjpeg`. This occurs when `mozjpeg` allocates memory on the heap for processing and then writes beyond the allocated region due to a flaw in memory management. The attacker manipulates image data or processing parameters to cause this out-of-bounds write on the heap.
    *   **Impact:** Heap Overflow, Memory Corruption, Potential RCE.
    *   **Affected Component:** `mozjpeg` Memory Management (heap allocation and deallocation routines, potentially within Decoder/Encoder modules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Same as Buffer Overflow in Decoding/Encoding Routines: update `mozjpeg`, memory safety tools, compiler mitigations.
        *   Carefully review application's memory management related to `mozjpeg` integration.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities](./threats/use-after-free_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input that triggers a use-after-free vulnerability in `mozjpeg`. This happens when `mozjpeg` attempts to access memory that has already been freed, due to incorrect memory management logic. This could be caused by specific image structures or processing sequences.
    *   **Impact:** Use-After-Free, Memory Corruption, Potential RCE.
    *   **Affected Component:** `mozjpeg` Memory Management (memory deallocation and object lifecycle management, potentially across various modules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Same as Buffer Overflow in Decoding/Encoding Routines: update `mozjpeg`, memory safety tools, compiler mitigations.
        *   Thoroughly review application's memory management when interacting with `mozjpeg` to ensure proper object lifetimes.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `mozjpeg` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__mozjpeg__library_itself.md)

*   **Description:**  Undiscovered security vulnerabilities exist within the `mozjpeg` library code. If a vulnerability is discovered and exploited, it could allow an attacker to compromise applications using `mozjpeg`. The attacker would exploit a flaw in `mozjpeg`'s code to achieve their malicious goals.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability (RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure).
    *   **Affected Component:** Any component of `mozjpeg` depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical, High, or Medium depending on the specific vulnerability, assuming potential for RCE, we classify as High to Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly update `mozjpeg` to the latest stable version.**
        *   Implement vulnerability scanning for application dependencies, including `mozjpeg`.
        *   Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies and get security vulnerability information.

## Threat: [Compromised `mozjpeg` Distribution](./threats/compromised__mozjpeg__distribution.md)

*   **Description:** The `mozjpeg` distribution (source code or pre-built binaries) is compromised by an attacker. This could involve malicious code injection. If an application uses a compromised distribution, it will inherit the malicious code. The attacker would aim to distribute a backdoored version of `mozjpeg`.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially severe, various vulnerabilities and backdoors introduced.
    *   **Affected Component:** Entire `mozjpeg` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download `mozjpeg` from trusted official sources (official GitHub repository, reputable package managers).
        *   Verify file integrity using checksums or digital signatures.
        *   Consider building `mozjpeg` from source to reduce reliance on pre-built binaries.
