# Threat Model Analysis for mozilla/mozjpeg

## Threat: [Malformed JPEG Input Leading to Crashes or Unexpected Behavior](./threats/malformed_jpeg_input_leading_to_crashes_or_unexpected_behavior.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted or malformed JPEG image as input to `mozjpeg`. This exploits vulnerabilities within `mozjpeg`'s own decoding logic, causing the library to crash, hang, or exhibit unexpected behavior during parsing.

**Impact:**  A successful attack can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) for the image processing functionality. It might also expose underlying system vulnerabilities if the crash leads to exploitable conditions.

**Affected Component:** `mozjpeg` Decoder (specifically the JPEG parsing and decoding modules).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `mozjpeg` updated to the latest version, as newer versions often include fixes for known vulnerabilities in the decoder.
*   Implement robust input validation *before* passing images to `mozjpeg`, although relying solely on this might not be sufficient against sophisticated attacks targeting decoder vulnerabilities.
*   Isolate `mozjpeg` processing in a separate process or container to limit the impact of a crash.

## Threat: [Integer Overflows/Underflows in Image Processing](./threats/integer_overflowsunderflows_in_image_processing.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts an image with specific dimensions or data values that trigger integer overflows or underflows within `mozjpeg`'s internal calculations during image processing (e.g., during scaling, color conversion, or DCT). This memory corruption occurs within `mozjpeg`'s own code.

**Impact:** Integer overflows or underflows can lead to buffer overflows, heap corruption, or other memory safety issues. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or cause unpredictable application behavior and crashes.

**Affected Component:** `mozjpeg` Encoder and Decoder (modules involved in image manipulation and processing like DCT, scaling, color conversion).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `mozjpeg` updated to the latest version, as these types of vulnerabilities are critical and often addressed promptly by the developers.
*   While input validation on dimensions can help, the complexity of image processing means it might not fully prevent these issues. Rely on `mozjpeg`'s internal safeguards and updates.
*   Consider using memory-safe languages or techniques in the application code *around* `mozjpeg` to potentially mitigate the impact of memory corruption, although preventing the corruption within `mozjpeg` is the primary goal.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion During Image Processing (DoS)](./threats/memory_exhaustion_during_image_processing_(dos).md)

**Description:** An attacker provides images with specific characteristics (e.g., extremely large dimensions, unusual color spaces) that cause `mozjpeg` itself to allocate excessive amounts of memory during its internal processing, leading to memory exhaustion and a crash of the `mozjpeg` process.

**Impact:** The application's image processing functionality crashes due to `mozjpeg` exhausting available memory, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Affected Component:** `mozjpeg` Decoder and Encoder (memory allocation within its processing modules).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement limits on the maximum size and dimensions of images that can be processed by the application before they reach `mozjpeg`.
*   Monitor the memory usage of the processes running `mozjpeg`.
*   Run `mozjpeg` in a separate process or container with memory limits enforced by the operating system or containerization technology.
*   Keep `mozjpeg` updated, as updates might include improvements in memory management.
