## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via mozjpeg Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_mozjpeg_exploitation.md)

* Objective: The attacker's ultimate goal is to gain control of the application server.
    * Significance: This represents the highest level of impact and motivates all subsequent attack steps. Successful exploitation at this level can lead to data breaches, service disruption, and complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Decoding Process](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_decoding_process.md)

* Objective: Gain an initial foothold by exploiting weaknesses in how mozjpeg processes JPEG files.
    * Significance: The decoding process is a complex operation involving parsing untrusted data, making it a prime target for vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation here can lead to memory corruption or other exploitable states.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Memory Corruption during Decoding](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_memory_corruption_during_decoding.md)

* Objective: Corrupt memory within the application's process by providing a malicious JPEG.
    * Significance: Memory corruption is a fundamental building block for many exploits, allowing attackers to overwrite data or code. This node represents a critical step towards achieving code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overflow Buffer](./attack_tree_paths/overflow_buffer.md)

* Objective: Write data beyond the allocated boundaries of a buffer in memory.
    * Significance: Buffer overflows are a common class of vulnerability that can lead to memory corruption and, ultimately, code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Heap Overflow](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_heap_overflow.md)

* Objective: Overflow a buffer allocated on the heap.
    * Significance: Heap overflows are particularly dangerous as they can often be exploited more reliably than stack overflows due to the more predictable nature of heap memory management.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Maliciously Crafted JPEG with Exceedingly Large Dimensions/Data Segments](./attack_tree_paths/provide_maliciously_crafted_jpeg_with_exceedingly_large_dimensionsdata_segments.md)

* Objective: Achieve arbitrary code execution by overflowing a heap-allocated buffer during the JPEG decoding process.
    * Attack Steps:
        1. The attacker targets a vulnerability in mozjpeg's decoding logic that fails to properly handle excessively large dimensions or data segments within a JPEG file.
        2. The attacker crafts a malicious JPEG file with header information or data segments that specify extremely large values.
        3. When mozjpeg attempts to decode this malicious JPEG, it allocates a heap buffer based on the attacker-controlled size.
        4. Due to the excessive size, the subsequent write operations during decoding overflow the allocated buffer, corrupting adjacent memory regions.
        5. The attacker carefully crafts the overflowing data to overwrite critical data structures or inject executable code into memory.
        6. By manipulating program execution flow (e.g., overwriting function pointers or return addresses), the attacker gains arbitrary code execution on the server.
    * Key Characteristics: This is a classic buffer overflow attack, targeting a common vulnerability in memory-unsafe languages like C/C++. It requires a good understanding of memory management and exploit development techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Integer Overflow/Underflow](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_integer_overflowunderflow.md)

* Objective: Cause an arithmetic error during size calculations within mozjpeg.
    * Significance: Integer overflows can lead to incorrect memory allocation sizes, which can then be exploited as buffer overflows or other memory corruption vulnerabilities. While not always directly leading to code execution, they are a significant precursor to exploitable conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Build/Supply Chain](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_buildsupply_chain.md)

* Objective: Compromise the mozjpeg library itself during its development or distribution.
    * Significance: This represents a high-impact, albeit lower-likelihood, attack vector. If successful, it can compromise all applications using the affected version of mozjpeg.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Dependencies of mozjpeg](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_dependencies_of_mozjpeg.md)

* Objective: Introduce vulnerabilities by compromising external libraries used by mozjpeg during its build process.
    * Significance: This highlights the risk of relying on external code and the importance of verifying the integrity of dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code During mozjpeg Build Process](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_during_mozjpeg_build_process.md)

* Objective: Directly insert malicious code into the mozjpeg source code or build artifacts.
    * Significance: This is a highly effective way to compromise the library, as the malicious code will be present in all compiled versions. It requires significant access and control over the build environment.
