# Attack Surface Analysis for mozilla/mozjpeg

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted JPEG Input (Buffer Overflow/Over-read)](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_jpeg_input__buffer_overflowover-read_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted JPEG file designed to trigger a buffer overflow or over-read within `mozjpeg`'s decoding process. This is the most common and dangerous attack vector.
*   **How mozjpeg Contributes:** `mozjpeg`'s core function is to decode JPEG images, making it directly susceptible to flaws in its parsing and memory handling logic.
*   **Example:** An image with manipulated Huffman table data that causes `mozjpeg` to write data beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running `mozjpeg`.  Information disclosure (reading sensitive memory).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Extensive Fuzzing:** Continuously fuzz `mozjpeg` with a wide range of malformed JPEG inputs using tools like AFL, libFuzzer, and OSS-Fuzz.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Employ static analysis tools (e.g., Coverity, clang-tidy) to identify potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the `mozjpeg` codebase.
    *   **Memory Sanitizers:** Compile and run `mozjpeg` with AddressSanitizer (ASan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan) during testing to detect memory errors at runtime.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Stay current with the latest `mozjpeg` releases, which often include security fixes.

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted JPEG Input (Integer Overflow/Underflow)](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_jpeg_input__integer_overflowunderflow_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a JPEG file that exploits integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities in `mozjpeg`'s calculations related to image data or metadata.
*   **How mozjpeg Contributes:** `mozjpeg` performs numerous calculations during decoding, making it susceptible to integer overflow/underflow errors.
*   **Example:** An image with manipulated quantization table values that lead to an integer overflow, resulting in an incorrectly sized memory allocation.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially RCE (though often less direct than buffer overflows), or information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Fuzzing:** (As above) - Fuzzing is crucial for detecting integer overflow/underflow issues.
    *   **Static Analysis:** (As above) - Static analysis tools can often identify potential integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Review:**  Carefully review `mozjpeg`'s code for areas where integer calculations are performed, especially those involving user-provided data.
    *   **Regular Updates:** (As above)

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted JPEG Input (Use-After-Free)](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_jpeg_input__use-after-free_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker crafts a JPEG that triggers a use-after-free vulnerability, where `mozjpeg` attempts to access memory that has already been freed.
*   **How mozjpeg Contributes:**  Complex memory management within `mozjpeg` during decoding creates opportunities for use-after-free errors.
*   **Example:**  A carefully crafted sequence of JPEG operations that causes `mozjpeg` to free a memory block and then later attempt to access it.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially RCE, or information disclosure.  The impact is highly dependent on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Fuzzing:** (As above) - Fuzzing is essential for detecting use-after-free vulnerabilities.
    *   **Memory Sanitizers:**  Use AddressSanitizer (ASan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan) during testing.  ASan is particularly effective at detecting use-after-free errors.
    *   **Static Analysis:** (As above)
    *   **Code Review:**  Carefully review `mozjpeg`'s memory management code.
    *   **Regular Updates:** (As above)

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted JPEG Input (Out-of-bounds reads in color conversion)](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_jpeg_input__out-of-bounds_reads_in_color_conversion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a JPEG that triggers out-of-bounds reads during color conversion.
*   **How mozjpeg Contributes:** `mozjpeg` performs color conversion, making it susceptible to out-of-bounds read errors.
*   **Example:** A carefully crafted JPEG that causes `mozjpeg` to read memory outside allocated buffer during color conversion.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Fuzzing:** (As above)
    *   **Memory Sanitizers:** Use AddressSanitizer (ASan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan) during testing.
    *   **Static Analysis:** (As above)
    *   **Code Review:** Carefully review `mozjpeg`'s color conversion code.
    *   **Regular Updates:** (As above)

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted JPEG Input (NULL pointer dereference)](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_jpeg_input__null_pointer_dereference_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a JPEG that triggers NULL pointer dereference.
*   **How mozjpeg Contributes:** Errors in `mozjpeg` can lead to NULL pointer dereference.
*   **Example:** A carefully crafted JPEG that causes `mozjpeg` to dereference a NULL pointer.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, potentially RCE.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fuzzing:** (As above)
        *   **Static Analysis:** (As above)
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review `mozjpeg`'s code.
