# Threat Model Analysis for mozilla/mozjpeg

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in DCT Coefficient Handling](./threats/integer_overflow_in_dct_coefficient_handling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JPEG image with specially designed DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) coefficients that, when processed by `mozjpeg`, cause an integer overflow within the quantization or dequantization routines. This could lead to unexpected behavior, potentially including buffer overflows.  This is a *direct* consequence of how `mozjpeg` handles DCT coefficients.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to application crashes.
        *   Potential for arbitrary code execution (though less likely than DoS).
        *   Possible corruption of the output image.
    *   **Affected mozjpeg Component:**
        *   `djpeg` (decompression) component.
        *   `cjpeg` (compression) component.
        *   DCT-related functions (e.g., `jpeg_idct_islow`, `jpeg_fdct_islow`, functions within `jdcoefct.c`, `jccoefct.c`).
        *   Quantization-related functions (e.g., functions within `jquant.c`, `jdquant.c`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if code execution is possible, but more likely High due to DoS).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update mozjpeg:** Keep `mozjpeg` updated to the latest version.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate image dimensions and file size before processing. Reject excessively large images.  This helps *indirectly* by limiting the scope of potential overflows.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce resource limits (CPU time, memory) on the `mozjpeg` process to mitigate DoS.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run `mozjpeg` in a sandboxed environment.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Marker Parsing](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_marker_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a JPEG image with a malformed marker segment (e.g., SOF, DHT, DQT) that exceeds the expected size or contains invalid data.  This causes a buffer overflow when `mozjpeg`'s *internal marker parsing routines* attempt to process it. This is a direct vulnerability in `mozjpeg`'s parsing logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to application crashes.
        *   Potential for arbitrary code execution.
        *   Possible information disclosure (leaking memory contents).
    *   **Affected mozjpeg Component:**
        *   `djpeg` (decompression) component, specifically marker parsing functions.
        *   Functions related to reading and processing JPEG markers (e.g., functions within `jdmarker.c`, `jcomapi.c`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (High probability of DoS, with a significant risk of code execution).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update mozjpeg:**  Prioritize updating to the latest version.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement basic checks on the JPEG header to detect obviously malformed markers (excessively large marker lengths). This is a sanity check *before* `mozjpeg`'s full parsing.
        *   **Sandboxing:**  Isolate the `mozjpeg` process.

## Threat: [Out-of-Bounds Read in Huffman Decoding](./threats/out-of-bounds_read_in_huffman_decoding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a JPEG image with a corrupted or malicious Huffman table. When `mozjpeg`'s *Huffman decoding routines* attempt to decode the image data, they read beyond the bounds of allocated memory due to the invalid table. This is a direct vulnerability in `mozjpeg`'s Huffman decoding implementation.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to application crashes.
        *   Information disclosure (leaking memory contents).
        *   Potentially, arbitrary code execution (less likely than DoS or information disclosure).
    *   **Affected mozjpeg Component:**
        *   `djpeg` (decompression) component.
        *   Huffman decoding functions (e.g., functions within `jdhuff.c`, `jdphuff.c`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS and information disclosure are likely; code execution is possible but less probable).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update mozjpeg:**  This is the primary defense.
        *   **Input Validation:** Basic checks on the Huffman table definitions in the JPEG header (though full validation is complex and best left to `mozjpeg`).
        *   **Sandboxing:**  Isolate the `mozjpeg` process.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Excessive Memory Allocation](./threats/denial_of_service_via_excessive_memory_allocation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides an image that, while seemingly valid according to basic checks, triggers `mozjpeg`'s *internal memory allocation routines* to allocate an extremely large amount of memory, leading to a denial-of-service. This exploits how `mozjpeg` handles image data internally.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) â€“ the application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
    *   **Affected mozjpeg Component:**
        *   `cjpeg` (compression) and `djpeg` (decompression) components.
        *   Memory allocation functions throughout the library (e.g., `jpeg_alloc_huff_table`, `jpeg_alloc_quant_table`, functions that allocate memory for image buffers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is highly likely).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**
            *   Strictly enforce maximum image dimensions (width and height).
            *   Enforce a maximum file size limit.
            *   Limit the number of image components.  These limits prevent `mozjpeg` from even attempting to allocate excessive memory.
        *   **Resource Limits:**
            *   Use operating system features to limit the maximum amount of memory that the `mozjpeg` process can allocate.
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for `mozjpeg` processing.
