*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Input Image during Encoding
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image (e.g., extremely large dimensions, highly complex content) to the application's encoding function *that leverages a vulnerability within the BlurHash encoding process itself*. This forces the server to allocate excessive resources (CPU, memory) to process the image and generate the BlurHash, potentially leading to service slowdown or failure for other users.
    *   **Impact:** The application's encoding functionality becomes unavailable or severely degraded. This can impact features relying on BlurHash generation, potentially affecting user experience and overall application availability.
    *   **Affected Component:** The BlurHash encoding function/module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Update the BlurHash library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches related to encoding efficiency and vulnerability fixes.
        *   Set reasonable resource limits (e.g., CPU time, memory usage) for the encoding process.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious BlurHash String during Decoding
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted BlurHash string that exploits vulnerabilities *within the BlurHash decoding algorithm*. This string causes excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) on the server or client attempting to render the blurred image. This can lead to application slowdown or crashes.
    *   **Impact:** The application's decoding functionality becomes unavailable or severely degraded. This can impact the display of blurred image placeholders, leading to broken UI or a poor user experience. In severe cases, it could crash the application or the user's browser.
    *   **Affected Component:** The BlurHash decoding function/module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Update the BlurHash library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Implement robust error handling around the decoding process to gracefully handle invalid or malicious BlurHash strings.
        *   Set resource limits for the decoding process, especially if performed on the server-side.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation
    *   **Description:** The BlurHash library itself contains security vulnerabilities that are discovered after its integration into the application. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities if the library is not kept up-to-date.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from denial of service to remote code execution, potentially compromising the application or user data.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire BlurHash library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the BlurHash library to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to the BlurHash library.
        *   Implement a process for quickly patching or mitigating identified vulnerabilities.
