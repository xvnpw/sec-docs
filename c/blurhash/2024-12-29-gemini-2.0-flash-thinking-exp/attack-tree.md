Title: High-Risk Attack Paths and Critical Nodes for BlurHash Application

Goal: To highlight the most critical threats and defense points related to BlurHash vulnerabilities.

Sub-Tree:

HIGH-RISK PATH: Manipulate BlurHash String
  CRITICAL NODE: Cause Decoding Errors
    HIGH-RISK PATH: Provide Malformed BlurHash String
      CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities in Decoder Library
        Result: Application Crash, Denial of Service
    HIGH-RISK PATH: Provide Unexpectedly Large BlurHash String
      CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Resource Consumption in Decoder
        Result: Denial of Service

HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Resource Exhaustion
  CRITICAL NODE: Trigger Excessive Encoding/Decoding
    CRITICAL NODE: Send Requests Requiring BlurHash Generation for Many/Large Images
      Result: Denial of Service

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

HIGH-RISK PATH: Manipulate BlurHash String

  CRITICAL NODE: Cause Decoding Errors
    Description: Attackers aim to trigger errors during the BlurHash decoding process.

    HIGH-RISK PATH: Provide Malformed BlurHash String
      Description: Attackers supply BlurHash strings that violate the expected format.
      CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities in Decoder Library
        Description: The decoder library fails to handle malformed input correctly, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.
        Attack Vector: Supply a BlurHash string with incorrect length, invalid characters, or incorrect component counts.
        Potential Impact: Application crash, denial of service.

    HIGH-RISK PATH: Provide Unexpectedly Large BlurHash String
      Description: Attackers provide BlurHash strings with an extremely high number of components.
      CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Resource Consumption in Decoder
        Description: Decoding an excessively large BlurHash string consumes significant memory or processing power.
        Attack Vector: Supply a BlurHash string with very large X and Y parameters.
        Potential Impact: Denial of service.

HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Resource Exhaustion

  CRITICAL NODE: Trigger Excessive Encoding/Decoding
    Description: Attackers attempt to overload the application by forcing it to perform many BlurHash operations.
    CRITICAL NODE: Send Requests Requiring BlurHash Generation for Many/Large Images
      Description: Attackers send a large number of requests that trigger BlurHash generation.
      Attack Vector: Send numerous requests for BlurHash generation of many images or very large images.
      Potential Impact: Denial of service.
