* = High-Risk Path
[CRITICAL NODE] = Critical Node
Numbers (1, 2, 3) represent individual attack steps within a node.

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal 1: Information Disclosure [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_1_information_disclosure__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary and most critical area of concern. GoAccess's main function is to provide information, making unauthorized access to that information the most likely and impactful attack vector.
    *   **Overall Likelihood:** High
    *   **Overall Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Overall Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Overall Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    *   **Overall Detection Difficulty:** Varies (Easy to Hard)

## Attack Tree Path: [A1: Exploit GoAccess Output Vulnerabilities (HTML/JSON Report) - HIGH-RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/a1_exploit_goaccess_output_vulnerabilities__htmljson_report__-_high-risk_path.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target the generated reports (HTML, JSON, CSV) that GoAccess creates. If these reports are stored insecurely, they can be directly accessed.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  **Identify the location of GoAccess output files:**
                *   Likelihood: Medium to High
                *   Impact: Medium to High
                *   Effort: Very Low to Low
                *   Skill Level: Beginner
                *   Detection Difficulty: Easy to Medium
            2.  **Attempt to access the report files directly:**
                *   Likelihood: High
                *   Impact: Medium to High
                *   Effort: Very Low
                *   Skill Level: Beginner
                *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
            3.  **Analyze the report for sensitive information:**
                *   Likelihood: High
                *   Impact: Medium to High
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Beginner
                *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   Store reports outside the web root.
            *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for report access.
            *   Regularly review report contents for sensitive data.
            *   Avoid predictable report file paths.
            *   Consider encrypting reports at rest.

## Attack Tree Path: [A2: Leverage GoAccess Real-Time HTML Output (WebSocket) - HIGH-RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/a2_leverage_goaccess_real-time_html_output__websocket__-_high-risk_path.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target the real-time data stream provided by GoAccess via WebSockets. If the WebSocket connection is not secured, the data can be intercepted.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  **Identify the WebSocket endpoint:**
                *   Likelihood: Medium
                *   Impact: Medium to High
                *   Effort: Low to Medium
                *   Skill Level: Intermediate
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
            2.  **Attempt to connect to the WebSocket without authentication:**
                *   Likelihood: High
                *   Impact: Medium to High
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Intermediate
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
            3.  **Capture the real-time data stream:**
                *   Likelihood: High
                *   Impact: Medium to High
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Intermediate
                *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   Use Secure WebSockets (`wss://`). This is crucial.
            *   Implement authentication for the WebSocket connection (handled at the web server or application level).
            *   Validate the `Origin` header in the WebSocket handshake.
            *   Implement rate limiting on WebSocket connections.
