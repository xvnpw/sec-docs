# Attack Surface Analysis for allinurl/goaccess

## Attack Surface: [1. Log Injection/Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/1__log_injectionpoisoning.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the log files that GoAccess processes, injecting malicious data or crafted entries.
    *   **How GoAccess Contributes:** GoAccess is the *direct target* of this attack. It's the component parsing and presenting the manipulated (malicious) input.
    *   **Example:** An attacker adds a crafted line to the web server log containing JavaScript within the User-Agent: `192.168.1.1 - - [01/Jan/2024:00:00:00 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 1234 "-" "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"`. If GoAccess doesn't sanitize, the script could execute in the report.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   False reporting/skewed statistics.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via resource exhaustion.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the GoAccess report.
        *   Potential data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if logs are writable by untrusted sources) / **High** (if logs have some protection, but vulnerabilities exist).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Log Source Control:** *Absolute* control over log file permissions. Only the web server (or trusted logging process) should have write access. Use a dedicated, non-privileged user.
        *   **Log Rotation and Archiving:** Frequent rotation and secure archiving to limit the attack window. Monitor archives for anomalies.
        *   **Input Validation (Pre-Processing):** *Crucial mitigation.* A script or process *before* GoAccess that:
            *   Sanitizes: Removes/escapes dangerous characters (`<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`, control characters).
            *   Filters: Removes entries matching malicious patterns (long strings, specific sequences).
            *   Validates Format: Ensures entries conform to the expected format (using regex).
        *   **Monitor GoAccess Resource Usage:** Track GoAccess's CPU, memory, and disk I/O. Alert on spikes indicating a potential attack.
        *   **Run GoAccess as non-root user:** Run GoAccess with least privileges.

## Attack Surface: [2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Report](./attack_surfaces/2__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_report.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject JavaScript into log entries; GoAccess renders it unsanitized in the HTML report/real-time interface.
    *   **How GoAccess Contributes:** GoAccess's report generation is the *directly vulnerable* component if it fails to escape/sanitize data from logs.
    *   **Example:** (Same as Log Injection). The injected `<script>` in User-Agent is rendered, executing when an admin views the report.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the administrator's browser session, leading to further attacks (cookie theft, redirection, report modification).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rely on Log Injection Mitigations:** *Primary defense* is preventing malicious code from entering logs (see Log Injection mitigations).
        *   **Use Latest GoAccess Version:** Ensure you're using the newest GoAccess; XSS vulnerabilities are actively patched.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a *strict* CSP on the web server hosting the report. Prevent inline script execution and limit script sources. Example: `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; ...`.  (Adjust to your needs).
        *   **Output Encoding (GoAccess's Responsibility, but Verify):** GoAccess *should* HTML-encode output. Verify that characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'` are converted to entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;`, `&apos;`).

## Attack Surface: [3. Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/3__vulnerable_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** GoAccess relies on external libraries, and these libraries might have known vulnerabilities.
    * **How GoAccess Contributes:** GoAccess uses these libraries, making it indirectly vulnerable if a dependency is compromised.
    * **Example:** If GoAccess uses an older version of a library with a known buffer overflow vulnerability, an attacker could potentially exploit that vulnerability through GoAccess.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to remote code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep GoAccess Updated:** Regularly update GoAccess to the latest stable release.  This is the *most important* mitigation, as updates often include security patches for dependencies.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools or vulnerability scanners to identify known vulnerabilities in GoAccess and its dependencies. Tools like `dependabot` (for GitHub), `snyk`, or `owasp dependency-check` can help.
        * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to GoAccess and its dependencies. Subscribe to mailing lists or follow security news sources.
