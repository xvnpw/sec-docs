# Threat Model Analysis for allinurl/goaccess

## Threat: [Malicious Log Content Leading to Command Injection](./threats/malicious_log_content_leading_to_command_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts log entries containing shell commands or GoAccess command-line options. GoAccess, due to insufficient input sanitization, interprets and executes these commands. This could occur if GoAccess directly uses log data in system calls or when invoking external commands.

**Impact:** Full control of the server, including data breaches, service disruption, and malware installation.

**Affected GoAccess Component:** Input parsing module, specifically the logic that processes log lines and potentially its command-line argument parsing if influenced by log data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly sanitize all log data before it is processed by GoAccess to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters or commands.
*   Avoid passing user-controlled data directly into GoAccess command-line arguments.
*   Run GoAccess with the least necessary privileges in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential command execution.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Log Content](./threats/path_traversal_via_log_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts log entries that, when processed by GoAccess, cause it to access files or directories outside of its intended scope. This happens if GoAccess uses data from log files to construct file paths without proper validation. An attacker could manipulate paths to read sensitive configuration files or potentially overwrite system files.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, modification of critical system files, potential for arbitrary code execution if writable paths are targeted.

**Affected GoAccess Component:** File access functionalities within GoAccess, potentially in modules handling geo-IP lookups or custom data sources specified in logs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure GoAccess does not use log data directly to construct file paths without strict validation and sanitization.
*   Configure GoAccess with explicit and restricted paths for any auxiliary data it needs to access.
*   Run GoAccess with restricted file system permissions to limit the scope of potential file access.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in GoAccess Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_goaccess_dependencies.md)

**Description:** GoAccess relies on external libraries. If these libraries contain security vulnerabilities, those vulnerabilities could be exploited through GoAccess.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from denial of service to remote code execution, potentially compromising the server.

**Affected GoAccess Component:**  Depends on the specific vulnerable dependency.

**Risk Severity:** High (if a high or critical vulnerability exists in a dependency)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep GoAccess updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Regularly check security advisories for GoAccess and its dependencies.
*   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities and update dependencies proactively.
*   If possible, explore options for static analysis or vulnerability scanning of the GoAccess codebase itself.
