## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit GoAccess Input Handling -> Log Poisoning for Code Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_goaccess_input_handling_-_log_poisoning_for_code_injection.md)

**High-Risk Path 1: Exploit GoAccess Input Handling -> Log Poisoning for Code Injection**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious log entries containing shell commands or code that, when processed by GoAccess, are interpreted and executed by the underlying operating system.
*   **Mechanism:** This occurs when the application uses user-controlled data (directly or indirectly) to specify the log file path for GoAccess to process or as arguments passed to the GoAccess executable. If this data is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject shell metacharacters or commands.
*   **Example:**  If the application executes GoAccess using a command like `goaccess <user_provided_log_path> -o report.html`, an attacker could provide a `user_provided_log_path` like `; rm -rf /`.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user running the GoAccess process, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Critical Node: Craft malicious log entries with shell commands**

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the specific point where the attacker's malicious input is designed to be interpreted as a command by the shell.
*   **Mechanism:**  Attackers utilize shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&`, `$()`, `` ` ``) to chain commands, redirect output, or execute arbitrary code.
*   **Example:** A log entry might contain a seemingly normal request but include a malicious payload within a field that is later used in a command, such as `GET /index.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd`. If the application then uses this unsanitized input in a command, it could lead to unintended file access.
*   **Impact:** Successful crafting of malicious log entries leading to shell command execution is a critical vulnerability that can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit GoAccess Output Generation -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Reports](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_goaccess_output_generation_-_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_reports.md)

**Critical Node: GoAccess generates HTML reports containing unsanitized user-controlled data from logs**

*   **Attack Vector:** GoAccess, by design, includes data from the processed logs in its generated HTML reports. If the application directly serves these reports to users without proper sanitization, any malicious JavaScript embedded in the logs will be executed in the user's browser.
*   **Mechanism:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into log entries. When GoAccess generates the report, this script is included in the HTML output. When a user views the report, their browser executes the malicious script.
*   **Example:** A log entry might contain a crafted User-Agent string like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
*   **Impact:** This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the application, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit GoAccess Execution Environment -> Command Injection via GoAccess Arguments](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_goaccess_execution_environment_-_command_injection_via_goaccess_arguments.md)

**High-Risk Path 2: Exploit GoAccess Execution Environment -> Command Injection via GoAccess Arguments**

*   **Attack Vector:** The application constructs the command to execute GoAccess by concatenating user-provided input (e.g., log file path, output path, other GoAccess options) without proper sanitization.
*   **Mechanism:** Attackers can inject arbitrary commands or options into the GoAccess command line by manipulating the user-provided input.
*   **Example:** If the application uses a string concatenation approach like `command = "goaccess " + user_provided_log_path + " -o " + user_provided_output_path`, an attacker could provide a malicious `user_provided_log_path` such as `access.log ; touch /tmp/pwned`.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user running the application, leading to severe consequences similar to log poisoning for code injection.

**Critical Node: Command Injection via GoAccess Arguments**

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the specific point where the attacker's manipulated input is directly used as part of the command executed by the system.
*   **Mechanism:**  Attackers leverage the lack of proper input validation and sanitization to inject malicious commands or options into the GoAccess command line.
*   **Example:**  An attacker might manipulate a form field or API parameter that is used to specify the log file path, injecting a command that will be executed before or after GoAccess.
*   **Impact:**  This is a critical vulnerability that allows for direct command execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit GoAccess Specific Vulnerabilities -> Exploiting Undiscovered GoAccess Vulnerabilities (Zero-Day)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_goaccess_specific_vulnerabilities_-_exploiting_undiscovered_goaccess_vulnerabilities__zero-d_6636734a.md)

**Critical Node: Exploiting Undiscovered GoAccess Vulnerabilities (Zero-Day)**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker discovers and exploits a previously unknown vulnerability within the GoAccess codebase itself.
*   **Mechanism:** This requires significant reverse engineering skills, deep understanding of GoAccess's internals, and the ability to develop an exploit for the discovered vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  A buffer overflow, format string vulnerability, or logic error within GoAccess could be exploited to gain control of the application or the underlying system.
*   **Impact:** The impact of a zero-day exploit can be critical, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, or denial of service. Detection and mitigation are extremely challenging until a patch is released.
