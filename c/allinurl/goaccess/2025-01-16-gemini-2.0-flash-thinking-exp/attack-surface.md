# Attack Surface Analysis for allinurl/goaccess

## Attack Surface: [Log File Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/log_file_poisoning.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious data into log files that are subsequently processed by GoAccess.

**How GoAccess Contributes:** GoAccess parses and interprets the content of log files. If it encounters specially crafted entries, it might trigger vulnerabilities within GoAccess's parsing logic.

**Example:** An attacker injects a log entry with excessively long fields or special characters that exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in GoAccess's parsing routine.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (GoAccess crashes or becomes unresponsive), potential information disclosure if GoAccess mishandles the malicious input, or in severe cases, potentially remote code execution if a critical parsing vulnerability exists.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regular GoAccess Updates:** Keep GoAccess updated to the latest version to patch known parsing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Real-time HTML Report Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/real-time_html_report_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

**Description:** If GoAccess's real-time HTML report feature is enabled, unsanitized data from log entries can be rendered directly in the HTML output, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.

**How GoAccess Contributes:** GoAccess generates HTML reports based on the content of the log files. If log entries contain malicious JavaScript or HTML, and GoAccess doesn't properly sanitize this output, it can be executed in the browser of users viewing the report.

**Example:** A malicious user injects a log entry containing `<script>alert("XSS");</script>`. When a user views the real-time HTML report, this script will execute in their browser.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the report, or other client-side attacks against users viewing the report.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Disable Real-time HTML Report (if not needed):** The simplest mitigation is to disable this feature if it's not a core requirement.
* **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Ensure that GoAccess (or the application displaying the report) properly encodes or escapes any user-controlled data from the logs before rendering it in the HTML report. This prevents the browser from interpreting the data as executable code.
