# Threat Model Analysis for allinurl/goaccess

## Threat: [Malicious Log Injection](./threats/malicious_log_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might craft malicious log entries and inject them into the log files that GoAccess processes. GoAccess, upon parsing these crafted entries, might trigger vulnerabilities *within its own parsing logic*. This direct interaction with GoAccess's code is the core of the threat.
    *   **Impact:** This could lead to:
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crafted entries could cause GoAccess to crash or become unresponsive due to unexpected data or resource exhaustion *within GoAccess*.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If vulnerabilities exist in GoAccess's parsing logic, specially crafted entries could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server *running GoAccess*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust log sanitization and validation *before* GoAccess processes the logs.
        *   Regularly update GoAccess to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities *in its parsing engine*.

## Threat: [Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Log Path Manipulation](./threats/local_file_inclusion__lfi__via_log_path_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows specifying the log file path for GoAccess to analyze without proper sanitization, an attacker could provide a path to sensitive system files. GoAccess, if not properly validating the input *it receives for the log file path*, might attempt to process these files. This directly involves GoAccess's handling of file paths.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive configuration files, application code, or other system files *through GoAccess's file access*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control and sanitize any input related to log file paths *before passing it to GoAccess*.
        *   Use absolute paths or restrict the allowed directories for log file analysis *within the application's configuration for GoAccess*.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in HTML Reports](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_html_reports.md)

*   **Description:** If GoAccess is configured to generate HTML reports, an attacker might inject malicious JavaScript code into the log data. GoAccess, without proper output sanitization *in its HTML report generation module*, could include this malicious script in the generated HTML report. This is a direct vulnerability in GoAccess's output mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially:
        *   Steal session cookies or other sensitive information from users viewing the reports.
        *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
        *   Perform actions on behalf of the user within the context of the web application displaying the reports.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure GoAccess is configured to properly sanitize output when generating HTML reports.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) on the web application displaying the reports to mitigate the impact of XSS.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration of GoAccess](./threats/insecure_configuration_of_goaccess.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfiguring GoAccess itself, such as running it with excessive privileges or exposing its control interface without proper authentication, creates vulnerabilities *directly within the GoAccess deployment*. An attacker exploiting these misconfigurations targets GoAccess directly.
    *   **Impact:** This could lead to:
        *   Unauthorized access to GoAccess configuration and control.
        *   Ability to manipulate log analysis settings or generate malicious reports *through GoAccess*.
        *   Potential for privilege escalation if GoAccess is running with elevated permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow security best practices when configuring GoAccess.
        *   Run GoAccess with the least necessary privileges.
        *   Secure any control interfaces or APIs provided by GoAccess with proper authentication and authorization.
