# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/zstd

## Threat: [Malformed Compressed Data Exploitation](./threats/malformed_compressed_data_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious compressed data stream designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the `zstd` decompression algorithm. This could involve manipulating header fields, data blocks, or compression parameters to trigger unexpected behavior during decompression.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code Execution: Exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, etc.) in `zstd` to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Causing `zstd` to crash or hang, leading to application unavailability.
    *   Information Disclosure: Potentially leaking sensitive information from server memory if vulnerabilities allow for out-of-bounds reads.
*   **Affected zstd Component:** Decompression module (`zstd_decompressStream`, `ZSTD_decompress`, internal decompression functions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Input Validation: While direct validation of compressed data is complex, validate the source and context of the compressed data. Sanitize or reject data from untrusted sources if possible.
    *   Error Handling: Implement robust error handling around `zstd` decompression calls. Catch exceptions or check return codes to gracefully handle decompression failures and prevent application crashes.
    *   Library Updates: Keep the `zstd` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   Sandboxing/Isolation: Run decompression processes in sandboxed environments or isolated processes to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Threat: [Decompression Bomb (Zip Bomb) Attack](./threats/decompression_bomb__zip_bomb__attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a small, highly compressed file that expands to an extremely large size upon decompression. When the application attempts to decompress this "bomb," it consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk space).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Server resource exhaustion leading to application slowdown, instability, or complete unavailability.
    *   System Instability: Excessive resource consumption can impact other applications running on the same server.
*   **Affected zstd Component:** Decompression module (`zstd_decompressStream`, `ZSTD_decompress`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Decompression Limits:
        *   Limit the maximum size of compressed data accepted for decompression.
        *   Implement limits on the maximum decompressed size allowed. Calculate and enforce a reasonable expansion ratio.
        *   Set timeouts for decompression operations.
    *   Resource Monitoring: Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) during decompression. Implement safeguards to halt decompression if resource consumption exceeds predefined thresholds.
    *   Streaming Decompression: Utilize `zstd`'s streaming decompression APIs to process data in chunks, reducing memory footprint and allowing for early termination if limits are exceeded.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `zstd` Library Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__zstd__library_code.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered bugs or security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows, logic errors) may exist within the `zstd` library itself. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities if they can control the input to `zstd` (compressed data).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code Execution: Exploitation of vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Bugs could cause crashes or hangs during compression or decompression.
    *   Information Disclosure: Vulnerabilities might lead to leakage of sensitive information.
*   **Affected zstd Component:** Any module within the `zstd` library (compression, decompression, dictionary building, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Library Updates:  Immediately apply security patches and update to the latest stable version of `zstd` as soon as they are released.
    *   Security Monitoring: Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `zstd`.
    *   Static/Dynamic Analysis: Use static and dynamic analysis tools to scan the application and the `zstd` library for potential vulnerabilities during development and testing.
    *   Fuzzing: Employ fuzzing techniques to test `zstd` with a wide range of inputs to uncover potential bugs and vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of `zstd`](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of__zstd_.md)

*   **Description:**  The `zstd` library itself, or its distribution channels (source code repository, package managers, download sites), could be compromised by malicious actors. This could lead to the distribution of backdoored or malicious versions of the library.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Backdoors and Malware: Compromised library could contain backdoors allowing unauthorized access or malicious functionality execution within the application.
    *   Data Breaches: Malicious code could steal sensitive data processed by the application.
    *   System Compromise: Compromised library could facilitate full system compromise.
*   **Affected zstd Component:** The entire `zstd` library as distributed.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Verify Source Integrity: When building from source, verify the integrity of the source code using checksums and signatures provided by the official `zstd` project.
    *   Trusted Sources: Download pre-compiled binaries and packages from official and trusted sources (e.g., official repositories of operating systems or language package managers).
    *   Dependency Management: Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies and ensure you are using expected versions.
    *   Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of the application and its dependencies, including verifying the integrity of the `zstd` library in use.
    *   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Use SCA tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies, including `zstd`.
