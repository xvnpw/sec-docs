# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/zstd

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Compressed Data Handling](./attack_surfaces/malformed_compressed_data_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the `zstd` decompression algorithm's parsing of intentionally crafted or corrupted compressed data. Exploiting flaws in parsing logic can lead to memory corruption or denial of service.
*   **Zstd Contribution:** `zstd` library's core functionality is parsing and processing compressed data streams. Vulnerabilities in its parsing implementation are directly exploitable.
*   **Example:** A malicious actor provides a specially crafted `.zst` file. During decompression by `zstd`, a buffer overflow occurs due to incorrect parsing of a header field within the malformed data, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Memory corruption
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Arbitrary code execution
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement thorough error checking of `zstd` decompression function return codes. Handle errors gracefully and halt processing of potentially corrupted data.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Utilize fuzzing techniques to rigorously test `zstd` decompression with a wide range of malformed inputs to proactively identify parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the `zstd` library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from crucial security patches and bug fixes addressing parsing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Compression Bombs (Decompression Bombs)](./attack_surfaces/compression_bombs__decompression_bombs_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting the nature of the `zstd` compression algorithm to create a small compressed file that expands to an extremely large size upon decompression. This can overwhelm system resources and cause denial of service.
*   **Zstd Contribution:** As a compression algorithm, `zstd` is inherently susceptible to compression bomb attacks if decompression is not handled with resource awareness.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a tiny `.zst` file (e.g., a few kilobytes) that, when decompressed using `zstd`, expands to gigabytes or terabytes of data. An application attempting to decompress this without safeguards could exhaust memory or disk space, leading to a severe DoS.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Memory Exhaustion
    *   Disk Space Exhaustion
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Decompressed Size Limits:** Implement strict limits on the maximum allowed decompressed size. Estimate potential decompressed size (if feasible) and reject decompression if it exceeds a safe threshold.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce resource limits (memory, CPU time, disk space) on the decompression process to prevent runaway resource consumption. Utilize OS-level limits or containerization.
    *   **Streaming Decompression:** Employ `zstd`'s streaming decompression APIs to process data in chunks, limiting memory usage and mitigating the impact of extreme decompression ratios.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Safety Vulnerabilities in Zstd Library Code](./attack_surfaces/memory_safety_vulnerabilities_in_zstd_library_code.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs within the `zstd` library's C code itself that could lead to memory corruption (buffer overflows, out-of-bounds access, etc.) during compression or decompression operations. These are vulnerabilities within the core `zstd` implementation.
*   **Zstd Contribution:** The inherent security of the `zstd` library's codebase is the direct contributor. Vulnerabilities in `zstd`'s implementation directly translate to vulnerabilities in applications using it.
*   **Example:** A coding error in `zstd`'s dictionary handling during decompression could cause a buffer overflow when processing specific compressed data, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Memory corruption
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Arbitrary code execution
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Consistently update the `zstd` library to the latest stable version. Security patches and bug fixes are the primary defense against these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Monitoring:** Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `zstd` (e.g., GitHub security advisories, CVE databases) to stay informed about reported issues and apply updates promptly.
    *   **Code Auditing (Advanced):** For extremely high-security requirements, consider performing independent code audits of the `zstd` library itself, although this is a resource-intensive and specialized task.
