## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Decompression Vulnerabilities (OR)](./attack_tree_paths/[critical_node]_exploit_decompression_vulnerabilities_(or).md)

**[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Decompression Vulnerabilities:** This is the most likely attack vector due to the complexity of decompression logic and the need to handle potentially untrusted data.

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Achieve Buffer Overflow during Decompression:**
    *   **Mechanism:** An attacker crafts compressed data where the declared uncompressed size is smaller than the actual size. When Zstd attempts to decompress, it writes beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.
    *   **Exploitation:** By carefully crafting the malicious data, an attacker can overwrite critical data structures or inject executable code into memory.

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Trigger Integer Overflow during Decompression:**
    *   **Mechanism:** An attacker provides compressed data that leads to an integer overflow when calculating the required buffer size for decompression. This can result in allocating a smaller-than-needed buffer.
    *   **Exploitation:** Subsequent decompression writes will then overflow the undersized buffer, leading to memory corruption.

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Cause Denial of Service (DoS) via Decompression:**
    *   **Compression Bomb (Decompression Bomb):**
        *   **Mechanism:** An attacker provides a small, highly compressed file that expands to an enormous size upon decompression.
        *   **Exploitation:** Decompressing this "bomb" can consume excessive memory and CPU resources, potentially crashing the application or the server.
    *   **Algorithmic Complexity Exploitation:**
        *   **Mechanism:** Certain compressed data patterns can trigger worst-case performance in Zstd's decompression algorithm, leading to excessive CPU usage.
        *   **Exploitation:** Repeatedly sending such data can tie up server resources, causing a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Achieve Buffer Overflow during Decompression](./attack_tree_paths/[high-risk_path]_achieve_buffer_overflow_during_decompression.md)

*   Provide Maliciously Crafted Compressed Data
    *   Data designed to exceed allocated buffer size during decompression
*   Exploit Lack of Bounds Checking in Zstd Decompression Logic
    *   Trigger memory corruption leading to code execution

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Trigger Integer Overflow during Decompression](./attack_tree_paths/[high-risk_path]_trigger_integer_overflow_during_decompression.md)

*   Provide Compressed Data leading to large uncompressed size
    *   Manipulate compression parameters or data to cause overflow in size calculations
*   Exploit Integer Overflow in Memory Allocation or Size Handling
    *   Cause allocation of insufficient memory or incorrect size calculations

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Cause Denial of Service (DoS) via Decompression](./attack_tree_paths/[high-risk_path]_cause_denial_of_service_(dos)_via_decompression.md)

*   Compression Bomb (Decompression Bomb)
    *   Provide highly compressed data that expands to an extremely large size

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Zstd Bindings/Integrations (OR)](./attack_tree_paths/[critical_node]_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_zstd_bindingsintegrations_(or).md)

**[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Zstd Bindings/Integrations:** Issues can arise in how Zstd is integrated into different programming languages.

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Improper Error Handling in Application Code:**
    *   **Mechanism:** The application might not handle errors returned by Zstd functions correctly.
    *   **Exploitation:** Attackers could trigger error conditions in Zstd (e.g., by providing invalid compressed data) and exploit the application's poor error handling to gain information or cause further issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Improper Error Handling in Application Code](./attack_tree_paths/[high-risk_path]_exploit_improper_error_handling_in_application_code.md)

*   Application doesn't handle Zstd errors gracefully
    *   Allow attackers to trigger error conditions leading to information disclosure or other issues
