# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/zstd

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Decompression](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_decompression.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious compressed data where specific fields or patterns trigger the Zstd decompression algorithm to write data beyond the allocated buffer. This is done by manipulating the compressed data structure to specify lengths or offsets that exceed buffer boundaries.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, application crash, denial of service. The attacker could potentially gain control of the application process or the underlying system.

**Affected Zstd Component:** Decompression module (specifically functions handling frame parsing and data copying during decompression).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use the latest stable version of the Zstd library, as these often contain fixes for known buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using memory-safe wrappers or language bindings for Zstd if available in your development environment.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Decompression](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_decompression.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts compressed data that causes integer overflow or underflow conditions within the Zstd decompression logic. This can be achieved by manipulating size fields within the compressed data to exceed the maximum or minimum values of integer types used in calculations. This can lead to incorrect memory allocation sizes or incorrect loop bounds.

**Impact:** Application crash, unexpected behavior, potential memory corruption, and in some cases, exploitable conditions leading to remote code execution.

**Affected Zstd Component:** Decompression module (specifically functions involved in calculating buffer sizes, memory allocation, and loop counters during decompression).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use the latest stable version of the Zstd library, which includes checks and mitigations for integer overflow vulnerabilities.
*   If possible, compile the application with compiler flags that provide runtime checks for integer overflows (though this might have performance implications).

## Threat: [Excessive Resource Consumption (Decompression Bomb/Zip Bomb Analog)](./threats/excessive_resource_consumption_(decompression_bombzip_bomb_analog).md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a small compressed file that, upon decompression, expands to an extremely large size, consuming excessive memory, disk space, or CPU resources due to the way the data is structured within the compressed format.

**Impact:** Denial of service, resource exhaustion, application instability, potentially impacting other services on the same system.

**Affected Zstd Component:** Decompression module (the core decompression algorithm itself).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement limits on the maximum decompressed size allowed.
*   Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk space) during decompression and terminate the process if it exceeds predefined thresholds.
*   Set timeouts for decompression operations.

## Threat: [Compromised Zstd Dependency (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/compromised_zstd_dependency_(supply_chain_attack).md)

**Description:** The Zstd library itself or its distribution channels are compromised, and a malicious version of the library is used by the application.

**Impact:** Potentially complete compromise of the application and the systems it runs on, as the attacker has injected malicious code directly into a core component.

**Affected Zstd Component:** All modules.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use trusted sources for obtaining the Zstd library (e.g., official releases, reputable package managers).
*   Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the downloaded library (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures).
*   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities or malicious code in dependencies.
