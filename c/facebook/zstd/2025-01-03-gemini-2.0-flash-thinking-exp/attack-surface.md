# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/zstd

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Compressed Data Leading to Buffer Overflow During Decompression](./attack_surfaces/malicious_compressed_data_leading_to_buffer_overflow_during_decompression.md)

**Description:** A crafted compressed data stream exploits vulnerabilities in `zstd`'s decompression logic, causing it to write data beyond the boundaries of allocated buffers.

**How zstd Contributes:** Bugs or oversights in `zstd`'s decompression implementation might not correctly handle certain patterns in the compressed data, leading to out-of-bounds writes.

**Example:** A compressed file contains instructions that cause `zstd` to write data past the end of a buffer allocated to hold the decompressed output.

**Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or application crashes.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the `zstd` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
*   Utilize memory-safe programming practices in the application code that handles decompressed data.
*   Perform thorough fuzzing and security testing of the application's decompression functionality.
*   Consider using `zstd`'s API in a way that provides bounds checking or limits on output size.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Compressed Data Leading to Memory Exhaustion During Decompression](./attack_surfaces/malicious_compressed_data_leading_to_memory_exhaustion_during_decompression.md)

**Description:** A specially crafted compressed data stream is designed to consume an excessive amount of memory when decompressed.

**How zstd Contributes:** `zstd`'s decompression algorithm, if not handled with proper resource limits, can be tricked into allocating large amounts of memory based on instructions within the malicious compressed data.

**Example:** An attacker provides a compressed file that, when processed by `zstd`, attempts to allocate gigabytes of memory, exceeding available resources.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to memory exhaustion.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement limits on the maximum size of decompressed data allowed.
*   Set timeouts for decompression operations.
*   Monitor memory usage during decompression and abort if thresholds are exceeded.
*   Consider using `zstd`'s streaming decompression API with fixed-size output buffers.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Custom Dictionaries](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_custom_dictionaries.md)

**Description:** If the application uses custom dictionaries with `zstd`, a malicious dictionary could be provided to exploit vulnerabilities during compression or decompression.

**How zstd Contributes:** `zstd` relies on the provided dictionary for compression and decompression. A malicious dictionary could contain patterns that trigger vulnerabilities in `zstd`'s processing logic.

**Example:** An attacker provides a crafted dictionary that, when used with `zstd`, leads to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues during compression or decompression.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or application crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High (if custom dictionaries are used)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure dictionaries are loaded from trusted sources only.
*   Verify the integrity and structure of dictionaries before using them with `zstd`.
*   Limit the ability for users to provide custom dictionaries.
