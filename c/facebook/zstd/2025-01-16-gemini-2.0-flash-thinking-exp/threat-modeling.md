# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/zstd

## Threat: [Decompression Bomb (Excessive Memory Consumption)](./threats/decompression_bomb__excessive_memory_consumption_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious compressed payload. When the application uses zstd to decompress this payload, it expands exponentially, consuming excessive memory and CPU resources. The attacker might send this payload through an API endpoint expecting compressed data or store it in a location where the application will later attempt to decompress it.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, potentially crashing. Server resources are exhausted, potentially impacting other services. Could lead to denial of service for legitimate users.

**Affected Zstd Component:** Decompression Engine (functions related to `ZSTD_decompress`, `ZSTD_decompressStream` etc.)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the maximum size of decompressed data.
* Set timeouts for decompression operations.
* Monitor resource usage (memory and CPU) during decompression.
* Consider using streaming decompression to avoid loading the entire decompressed data into memory at once and to allow for early termination if the output size is unexpectedly large.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Decompression Size Calculation](./threats/integer_overflow_in_decompression_size_calculation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a compressed payload that, when its decompressed size is calculated by zstd, triggers an integer overflow. This could lead to allocating a smaller buffer than needed, resulting in a buffer overflow during the actual decompression process. The attacker might exploit this by carefully crafting the compressed data to trigger this specific overflow.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to application crashes, unexpected behavior, or in some scenarios, remote code execution.

**Affected Zstd Component:** Decompression Engine, specifically size calculation functions within the decompression logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the zstd library updated to the latest stable version, as updates often include fixes for such vulnerabilities.
* If possible, perform size validation of the decompressed data against expected limits *before* allocating memory.
* Utilize memory-safe programming practices and tools to detect potential buffer overflows.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption during Decompression due to Algorithm Flaws](./threats/memory_corruption_during_decompression_due_to_algorithm_flaws.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted compressed payload that exploits a bug or flaw in the zstd decompression algorithm itself. This could cause zstd to write data to incorrect memory locations during decompression. The attacker would need deep knowledge of the zstd internals to craft such a payload.

**Impact:** Application crashes, unpredictable behavior, potential security vulnerabilities if corrupted memory is later accessed or used.

**Affected Zstd Component:** Core Decompression Algorithm logic within the `libzstd` library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Rely on the security testing and fuzzing performed by the zstd project maintainers.
* Keep the zstd library updated to benefit from bug fixes.
* Consider using memory safety tools and techniques in the application that consumes the decompressed data to mitigate the impact of potential memory corruption.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on the Zstd Library](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_the_zstd_library.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the zstd library itself, either through a compromised repository, build process, or distribution channel. This could introduce backdoors or vulnerabilities into the application using the compromised library. The attacker's access could be temporary, injecting malicious code that persists in downloaded versions.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system, depending on the nature of the injected malicious code.

**Affected Zstd Component:** The entire `libzstd` library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Download zstd from official and trusted sources (e.g., the official GitHub repository, package managers).
* Verify the integrity of the downloaded library using checksums or signatures.
* Utilize dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in the zstd library.
* Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) practices to track dependencies.
