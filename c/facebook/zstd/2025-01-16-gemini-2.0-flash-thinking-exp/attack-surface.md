# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/zstd

## Attack Surface: [Decompression Bomb (Zip Bomb/Billion Laughs)](./attack_surfaces/decompression_bomb__zip_bombbillion_laughs_.md)

* **How zstd Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `zstd` decompression algorithm, when processing maliciously crafted compressed data, can lead to an exponential expansion of the data in memory or on disk.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides a small `zstd` compressed file that, upon decompression, expands to several gigabytes, exhausting server resources.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk space).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement limits on the maximum size of decompressed data allowed.
        * Set timeouts for decompression operations to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
        * Monitor resource usage during decompression and terminate processes exceeding thresholds.
        * Consider using streaming decompression with size limits on the output stream.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflows/Underflows during Decompression](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflowsunderflows_during_decompression.md)

* **How zstd Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Bugs within the `zstd` decompression code could be triggered by specific, malformed compressed data, leading to out-of-bounds reads or writes in memory buffers used by the library.
    * **Example:** A specially crafted `zstd` compressed file causes the decompression routine to write data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions.
    * **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, crashes, or information leaks.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep the `zstd` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * Utilize memory-safe programming practices in the application code interacting with `zstd`.
        * Employ fuzzing techniques to test the robustness of the application's decompression logic against various inputs.
        * Consider using compiler-level protections like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and stack canaries.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflows/Underflows in Size Calculations](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflowsunderflows_in_size_calculations.md)

* **How zstd Contributes to the Attack Surface:** When handling compressed or uncompressed sizes, integer overflows or underflows within the `zstd` library could lead to incorrect memory allocation or buffer handling.
    * **Example:** A large value in the compressed data header, intended to represent the uncompressed size, overflows an integer, leading to the allocation of a much smaller buffer than required for decompression.
    * **Impact:** Memory corruption, buffer overflows, leading to potential crashes or exploitable conditions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Validate input data, especially size parameters, before passing it to `zstd` functions.
        * Be aware of the limitations of integer types used by the `zstd` API and handle potential overflow scenarios.
        * Review the application's code for any manual size calculations involving `zstd` outputs or inputs.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption Bugs within zstd Itself](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption_bugs_within_zstd_itself.md)

* **How zstd Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Bugs within the `zstd` library's code itself could lead to memory corruption during compression or decompression, even with valid input.
    * **Example:** A flaw in the `zstd` compression algorithm corrupts memory during the compression process.
    * **Impact:** Crashes, unexpected behavior, potential for exploitation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Rely on the active development and security community around `zstd` to identify and fix such bugs.
        * Keep the `zstd` library updated to the latest version.
        * In extremely security-sensitive environments, consider code auditing of the `zstd` library itself.
