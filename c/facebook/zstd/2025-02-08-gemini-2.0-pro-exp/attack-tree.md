# Attack Tree Analysis for facebook/zstd

Objective: To achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS) on an application using zstd, by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the zstd library or its implementation.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1__remote_code_execution__rce___cn_.md)

*   **1.1 Buffer Overflow in zstd [CN]**

    *   **Description:** A buffer overflow vulnerability within the zstd library itself. This is a critical vulnerability, though less likely due to zstd's maturity.
    *   **Attack:** An attacker crafts malicious compressed input that, when decompressed, overwrites memory beyond the allocated buffer, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High to Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

*   **1.2 Exploit Dictionary Vulnerabilities**

    *   **1.2.1 Abuse zstd Dict Builder [HR]**

        *   **Description:** If the application builds dictionaries from user-supplied data, an attacker might craft input to cause a buffer overflow or other memory corruption within the dictionary builder.
        *   **Attack:** The attacker provides malicious input to the dictionary building process, triggering a vulnerability and gaining code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1.2.2 Abuse zstd Dict Loading [HR]**

        *   **Description:** If the application loads dictionaries from external sources, an attacker might provide a malicious dictionary file to trigger a vulnerability.
        *   **Attack:** The attacker provides a crafted dictionary file that, when loaded, exploits a vulnerability in the loading or usage process, leading to RCE.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **2.2 Resource Exhaustion via Decompression Bomb/Ratio [HR]**

    *   **Description:** Exploiting the compression algorithm to cause excessive CPU or RAM usage, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Attack:** The attacker provides input designed to consume excessive resources during decompression.

    *   **2.2.1 High Compression Ratio Input**

        *   **Description:** An attacker crafts input that achieves a very high compression ratio, requiring significant resources to decompress.
        *   **Attack:** The attacker sends input that expands to a very large size upon decompression, exhausting memory or CPU.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **2.2.2 Repeated Decompression Requests [HR]**

        *   **Description:** An attacker repeatedly sends decompression requests, overwhelming the server.
        *   **Attack:** The attacker floods the server with decompression requests, consuming resources and preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
