### High and Critical Zstd Threats

This list details high and critical severity security threats directly involving the `zstd` compression library.

*   **Threat:** Maliciously Crafted Compressed Data Leading to Buffer Overflow/Underflow
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a compressed data stream with specific characteristics designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the `zstd` decompression logic. Upon decompression, this malformed data causes the library to write beyond the allocated buffer (overflow) or before the allocated buffer (underflow). This can overwrite adjacent memory regions.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten memory.
    *   **Affected Component:** Decompression module, specifically the frame parsing and entropy decoding functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `zstd` library updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Compression Bomb (Decompression Bomb)
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a small compressed file that, when decompressed, expands to an extremely large size. The decompression process consumes excessive system resources (CPU, memory, disk space).
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting system resources, potentially crashing the application or the entire system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Decompression module, specifically the output buffer management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `zstd` library updated to benefit from potential mitigations implemented within the library.

*   **Threat:** Maliciously Crafted Compressed Data Leading to Infinite Loop/Excessive CPU Consumption
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a compressed data stream that triggers a bug in the `zstd` decompression algorithm, causing it to enter an infinite loop or perform an extremely large number of computations.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by tying up CPU resources, making the application unresponsive.
    *   **Affected Component:** Decompression module, potentially within the entropy decoding or dictionary lookup functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `zstd` library updated to benefit from bug fixes.

*   **Threat:** Integer Overflow/Underflow in Decompression
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides compressed data that exploits integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities within the `zstd` decompression logic. This can lead to incorrect calculations, memory corruption, or unexpected program behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, application crash, potential for information disclosure or other unexpected behavior.
    *   **Affected Component:** Decompression module, potentially within size calculations or buffer management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `zstd` library updated, as these types of vulnerabilities are often addressed in updates.

*   **Threat:** Use of Outdated or Vulnerable `zstd` Library
    *   **Description:** The application uses an older version of the `zstd` library that contains known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if they are aware of them.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, ranging from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `zstd` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust dependency management system to track and update the `zstd` library.
        *   Regularly check for security advisories related to the `zstd` library.
        *   Automate the process of updating dependencies.
