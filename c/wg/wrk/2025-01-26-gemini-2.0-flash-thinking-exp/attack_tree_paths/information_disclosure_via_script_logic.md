### 4. Deep Analysis: Information Disclosure via Script Logic

#### 4.1. Detailed Explanation of the Attack Path

The "Information Disclosure via Script Logic" attack path highlights a subtle but significant security risk associated with using scripts in load testing tools like `wrk`. While `wrk` itself is a performance testing tool, its scripting capabilities (using Lua) allow for complex interactions with the target application.  If these scripts are not carefully written and reviewed, they can inadvertently expose sensitive information that is present in application responses or processed within the script itself.

This attack path is not about exploiting vulnerabilities in the *application* being tested directly, but rather about vulnerabilities introduced by the *testing scripts* themselves.  The scripts, designed to simulate user behavior and analyze application performance, can become a source of information leakage if they are not designed with security in mind.

The core issue is that developers, when focused on performance testing, might overlook security considerations within their `wrk` scripts. They might:

* **Log excessively:**  Log entire request/response bodies for debugging purposes, which could contain sensitive data.
* **Print to `stdout` for quick debugging:** Use `print()` statements to inspect variables or response parts, potentially exposing sensitive information to the console output.
* **Incorrectly parse responses:**  Write scripts that extract data from responses in a way that unintentionally reveals more information than intended.
* **Store sensitive data in script variables:**  Temporarily store sensitive data in script variables for processing, which could be inadvertently logged or printed.
* **Use insecure libraries or functions:**  Employ Lua libraries or functions within the script that have known security vulnerabilities or insecure defaults.

#### 4.2. Types of Sensitive Information at Risk

The following types of sensitive information are potentially at risk of disclosure through script logic errors:

* **Authentication Credentials:**
    * API keys, tokens, secrets used for authentication.
    * Database credentials embedded in responses or configuration data.
    * Session IDs, cookies, or JWTs that could be logged or printed.
* **User Personal Data (PII):**
    * Names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses.
    * Financial information, credit card details.
    * Health information, medical records.
    * Any data that can identify or relate to an individual.
* **Internal Application Details:**
    * Internal API endpoints, paths, or parameters.
    * Configuration settings, environment variables.
    * Debugging information, stack traces, error messages.
    * Internal IP addresses, server names, or network topology.
    * Software versions, library paths, framework details.
* **Business Logic Secrets:**
    * Proprietary algorithms or business rules exposed through response data.
    * Discount codes, promotional codes, or pricing strategies.
    * Internal data structures or schemas.

#### 4.3. Common Script Logic Errors Leading to Information Disclosure

Several common scripting errors can lead to information disclosure:

* **Overly Verbose Logging:**
    * Logging entire request and response bodies without filtering.
    * Logging sensitive headers (e.g., `Authorization`, `Cookie`).
    * Logging script variables that hold sensitive data.
    * Example (Lua in `wrk`):
    ```lua
    wrk.body = function(body)
        log.info("Response Body: " .. body) -- Potentially logs sensitive data
    end
    ```
* **Unintentional Printing to `stdout`:**
    * Using `print()` statements for debugging and forgetting to remove them.
    * Printing variables or response parts without proper sanitization.
    * Example (Lua in `wrk`):
    ```lua
    wrk.body = function(body)
        local json_response = json.decode(body)
        print("User ID: " .. json_response.user_id) -- Prints user ID to stdout
    end
    ```
* **Insecure Response Parsing and Manipulation:**
    * Extracting data from responses without proper validation or sanitization.
    * Accidentally exposing more data than intended when parsing JSON or XML.
    * Example (Lua in `wrk` - assuming JSON response with sensitive data):
    ```lua
    wrk.body = function(body)
        local json_response = json.decode(body)
        -- Intended to extract 'status', but accidentally prints the whole object
        print("Response Details: " .. json_response) -- Could print entire JSON object
    end
    ```
* **Storing Sensitive Data in Script Variables:**
    * Temporarily storing sensitive data in script variables for processing and then inadvertently logging or printing these variables.
    * Example (Lua in `wrk`):
    ```lua
    wrk.body = function(body)
        local auth_token = extract_token_from_header(headers) -- Assume this extracts a token
        log.info("Extracted Token: " .. auth_token) -- Logs the token
    end
    ```
* **Error Handling that Reveals Information:**
    * Printing error messages that contain sensitive details about the application's internal state or configuration.
    * Logging stack traces that expose internal paths or code structure.
    * Example (Lua in `wrk` - basic error handling):
    ```lua
    wrk.body = function(body)
        local json_response = json.decode(body)
        if not json_response then
            error("Failed to decode JSON: " .. body) -- Error message might contain sensitive parts of the body
        end
    end
    ```

#### 4.4. Attack Scenarios

An attacker might not directly target `wrk` scripts. However, the information disclosed through these scripts can be valuable for subsequent attacks. Scenarios include:

1. **Passive Information Gathering:** An attacker monitoring network traffic or accessing `wrk`'s output logs (if improperly secured) could passively collect sensitive information disclosed by the scripts. This information can be used to understand the application's architecture, identify potential vulnerabilities, or gather credentials for later use.
2. **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with access to `wrk` scripts or their output could intentionally create scripts that leak sensitive information and then exfiltrate this data.
3. **Accidental Exposure in Shared Environments:** In shared development or testing environments, if `wrk` scripts or their output are not properly secured, other users or processes might inadvertently gain access to disclosed sensitive information.
4. **Exploiting Misconfigurations:** If `wrk` output logs are stored in publicly accessible locations (e.g., misconfigured web servers, shared file systems), attackers could discover and exploit these misconfigurations to retrieve sensitive data.

#### 4.5. Impact Assessment

The impact of information disclosure via script logic can range from low to high severity, depending on the type and sensitivity of the disclosed information:

* **Low Impact:** Disclosure of minor internal details (e.g., software versions) might have a low immediate impact but could aid in future reconnaissance.
* **Medium Impact:** Disclosure of user PII or internal API endpoints could lead to privacy violations, account compromise, or further attacks on internal systems.
* **High Impact:** Disclosure of authentication credentials, database credentials, or critical business logic secrets could result in complete system compromise, data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.

The impact is amplified if the disclosed information is aggregated over multiple load testing runs or if the scripts are executed in production-like environments where real user data is processed.

#### 4.6. Mitigation and Prevention Strategies

To mitigate the risk of information disclosure via script logic, development teams should implement the following strategies:

1. **Secure Scripting Practices:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege for Logging:** Log only necessary information and avoid logging sensitive data.
    * **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize or redact sensitive data before logging or printing. Use techniques like masking, hashing, or tokenization.
    * **Secure Output Handling:**  Carefully manage `wrk` script output and logs. Ensure logs are stored securely and access is restricted. Avoid printing sensitive data to `stdout` unless absolutely necessary for debugging and remove such prints before deployment.
    * **Code Review for Scripts:**  Treat `wrk` scripts as code and subject them to code reviews, focusing on security aspects and potential information leakage.
    * **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**  Validate inputs and encode outputs to prevent injection vulnerabilities and ensure data is handled securely within the script.
    * **Use Secure Libraries:**  If using external Lua libraries, ensure they are from trusted sources and are regularly updated to patch security vulnerabilities.

2. **Environment and Configuration Management:**
    * **Separate Testing Environments:** Use dedicated testing environments that do not contain real production data for load testing. If production-like data is necessary, anonymize or pseudonymize it.
    * **Secure Log Storage:** Store `wrk` output logs in secure locations with appropriate access controls. Avoid storing logs in publicly accessible directories.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of `wrk` scripts and the overall load testing process to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Security Awareness Training:** Train developers on secure scripting practices and the risks of information disclosure in load testing scripts.

3. **Specific `wrk` Script Mitigation Techniques:**
    * **Use `log.info`, `log.warn`, `log.error` with discretion:**  Utilize `wrk`'s logging functions (`log.info`, `log.warn`, `log.error`) but carefully control what is logged. Avoid logging full request/response bodies by default.
    * **Filter and Redact Sensitive Data in Logs:** Implement functions to filter or redact sensitive data before logging.
    * **Avoid `print()` for sensitive data:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of `print()` statements for debugging sensitive data. Use logging mechanisms instead and ensure logs are properly secured.
    * **Careful Response Parsing:**  Parse responses selectively and extract only the necessary data. Avoid blindly printing or logging entire response objects.
    * **Implement Error Handling without Information Leakage:**  Design error handling in scripts to avoid revealing sensitive internal details in error messages.

**Example of Mitigation (Redacting Sensitive Data in Logs):**

```lua
local function redact_sensitive_data(data)
    if type(data) == "string" then
        -- Simple redaction example - replace digits with 'X'
        return data:gsub("%d", "X")
    elseif type(data) == "table" then
        local redacted_table = {}
        for k, v in pairs(data) do
            redacted_table[k] = redact_sensitive_data(v)
        end
        return redacted_table
    else
        return data -- Return non-string/table data as is
    end
end

wrk.body = function(body)
    local json_response = json.decode(body)
    if json_response then
        local redacted_response = redact_sensitive_data(json_response)
        log.info("Redacted Response: " .. json.encode(redacted_response))
    else
        log.warn("Failed to decode JSON response.")
    end
end
```

By implementing these mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of information disclosure via script logic errors in `wrk` load testing and enhance the overall security posture of their applications. Regular review and adherence to secure scripting practices are crucial for preventing this type of vulnerability.
