## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via wrk](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_wrk.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the root goal. An attacker aims to leverage weaknesses related to wrk to compromise the application. This is achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities within wrk's Lua scripting, its load generation capabilities, or potentially wrk itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerable wrk Lua Scripting](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerable_wrk_lua_scripting.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses wrk's Lua scripting feature, attackers can target vulnerabilities in the scripts themselves or the Lua environment. This path is high-risk because Lua scripting introduces a flexible but potentially insecure extension point.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection via User-Provided Script](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_via_user-provided_script.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application allows users or external sources to provide Lua scripts that are then executed by wrk, attackers can inject malicious code into these scripts. This is a classic code injection vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on wrk Host](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_wrk_host.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Successful code injection can lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine running wrk. This allows the attacker to gain control of the wrk host, potentially install malware, pivot to other systems, or steal sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Flaws in Custom Lua Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/logic_flaws_in_custom_lua_scripts.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Even without direct code injection, poorly written custom Lua scripts can contain logic flaws that attackers can exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Script Logic](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_script_logic.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Logic errors in scripts might inadvertently expose sensitive information from application responses. For example, scripts might log sensitive data, print it to stdout, or manipulate response data in insecure ways, leading to information leakage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Script Logic](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_script_logic.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Scripts with inefficient algorithms, infinite loops, or resource-intensive operations can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This can impact the wrk host itself or indirectly affect the target application if wrk consumes excessive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit wrk's Load Generation Capabilities for Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_wrk's_load_generation_capabilities_for_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** wrk is designed for load testing, and attackers can misuse this capability to launch DoS attacks against the application. This path is high-risk because wrk is readily available and designed to generate significant load.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwhelm Application Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/overwhelm_application_infrastructure.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers can use wrk to generate a massive volume of requests to overwhelm the application's infrastructure, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Volumetric Attack (High Request Rate)](./attack_tree_paths/volumetric_attack__high_request_rate_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Flooding the application with a high rate of requests to saturate network bandwidth, processing capacity, or connection limits. This is a classic volumetric DoS attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion on Application Server](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_on_application_server.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a large number of requests to exhaust server resources like CPU, memory, or connections. This can lead to server instability and service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application-Level DoS via Specific Request Patterns](./attack_tree_paths/application-level_dos_via_specific_request_patterns.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers can craft specific request patterns using wrk to target application logic vulnerabilities and cause DoS at the application level, even without overwhelming the entire infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application-Level DoS via Specific Request Patterns](./attack_tree_paths/application-level_dos_via_specific_request_patterns.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This includes targeting resource-intensive endpoints to amplify the impact of the DoS and exploiting application logic flaws that become vulnerable under high load (e.g., race conditions, deadlocks, inefficient algorithms). By carefully crafting requests, attackers can trigger these vulnerabilities and cause application-level DoS.
