# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for wg/wrk

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting in `wrk`](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_in__wrk_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Target Request Rate:** Analyze the application's expected capacity to determine a safe request rate for benchmarking.
    2.  **Utilize `-r` Flag:** When executing `wrk`, use the `-r <requests/sec>` command-line option followed by the calculated request rate. Example: `wrk -r 100 https://example.com`. This limits requests per second.
    3.  **Test and Adjust Rate:** Start with a low rate and gradually increase while monitoring application performance. Observe response times and errors.
    4.  **Document Rate Limits:** Document chosen rates for different scenarios to ensure consistency and prevent overloading.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Unintentionally overwhelming the application, causing service disruption.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):** Causing slowdowns, impacting legitimate users.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces risk by controlling load, preventing accidental overload.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Significantly reduces risk by keeping load manageable, minimizing negative performance impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not consistently implemented as standard practice. May be used ad-hoc.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Benchmarking Scripts:** Integrate `-r` flag into standard scripts.
    *   **Developer Training:** Educate developers on using `-r` for rate limiting.
    *   **CI/CD Pipelines:** Configure rate limiting in automated benchmarking scripts in CI/CD.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Ramp-Up of Load using `wrk` Scripting](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_ramp-up_of_load_using__wrk__scripting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Abrupt Load Spikes:**  Instead of immediate max load, gradually increase load to simulate realistic traffic.
    2.  **Lua Scripting for Ramp-Up:** Utilize `wrk`'s Lua scripting to create load profiles with ramp-up phases. Script can incrementally increase threads/connections over time.
    3.  **Step-Wise Manual Ramp-Up:** Alternatively, manually run `wrk` multiple times, increasing threads/connections in steps, observing application response at each step.
    4.  **Monitor During Ramp-Up:** Monitor application performance during ramp-up to identify instability as load increases.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Application Instability (Medium Severity):** Causing crashes due to sudden load spikes the application can't handle gracefully.
    *   **Inaccurate Benchmark Results (Low Severity):** Less realistic results if load pattern isn't real-world, misrepresenting performance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Application Instability:** Reduces risk by allowing gradual application adaptation to load, minimizing sudden failures.
    *   **Inaccurate Benchmark Results:** Improves accuracy by simulating realistic load, better understanding performance under typical usage.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not consistently implemented. Manual ramp-up may occur, but not standardized.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Standard Ramp-Up Scripts:** Develop example Lua scripts for ramp-up scenarios.
    *   **Benchmarking Guidelines:** Recommend ramp-up procedures in documentation.
    *   **Automated Ramp-Up in CI/CD:** Incorporate ramp-up phases into automated scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits on `wrk` Execution using `-t` and `-c`](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_on__wrk__execution_using__-t__and__-c_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Optimize `-t` and `-c` Values:** Carefully choose threads (`-t`) and connections (`-c`). Avoid excessive values that overload the `wrk` client machine.
    2.  **Monitor Client Resources:** Monitor CPU, memory, network on the `wrk` client during execution. If client is bottleneck, reduce `-t` and `-c`.
    3.  **Iterative Adjustment of `-t` and `-c`:** Experiment to find optimal balance for load on target application without client exhaustion.
    4.  **Document Client Resource Limits:** Document recommended `-t` and `-c` values for scenarios and client configurations to prevent exhaustion.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Benchmarking Client Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Overloading the `wrk` client, causing performance issues or crashes on the client.
    *   **Inaccurate Benchmark Results (Low Severity):** Inaccurate results if client becomes bottleneck, as it can't generate intended load.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Benchmarking Client Resource Exhaustion:** Significantly reduces risk by preventing client overload, ensuring stable benchmark execution.
    *   **Inaccurate Benchmark Results:** Improves accuracy by ensuring client can generate intended load without bottleneck, providing realistic performance assessment.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not consistently implemented. Developers may adjust `-t` and `-c` based on experience, but not formalized.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Guidelines for `-t` and `-c`:** Develop guidelines for choosing `-t` and `-c` based on client resources and application capacity.
    *   **Client Resource Monitoring Recommendations:** Recommend monitoring client resources and adjusting `-t` and `-c` if needed.
    *   **Automated Client Resource Checks:** Consider automated checks in scripts to detect client exhaustion and adjust `-t` and `-c` dynamically.
