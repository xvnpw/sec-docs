Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Lua Script Tampering" threat for `wrk`.

## Deep Analysis: Lua Script Tampering in `wrk`

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the attack vectors related to Lua script tampering in `wrk`.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies.
*   Propose additional or refined mitigation strategies, if necessary.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the security of `wrk` against this threat.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the threat of malicious modification of Lua scripts used by the `wrk` HTTP benchmarking tool.  It encompasses:

*   The `wrk` tool itself, and how it loads and executes Lua scripts.
*   The typical use cases of Lua scripts within `wrk` (request generation, response processing, custom metrics).
*   The operating system environment where `wrk` is typically executed (primarily Linux, but also considering macOS and potentially Windows).
*   The interaction between `wrk` and the target web server, *only* in the context of how a tampered script could affect that interaction.  We are *not* analyzing the security of the target server itself, except as a consequence of the tampered script.

**1.3 Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the `wrk` source code (available on GitHub) to understand how Lua scripts are loaded, parsed, and executed.  We'll look for potential vulnerabilities in this process.
*   **Threat Modeling (STRIDE/DREAD):**  We'll use threat modeling principles (building upon the initial threat description) to identify specific attack scenarios and assess their impact and likelihood.
*   **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities related to Lua scripting and embedding Lua in C applications.
*   **Best Practices Review:** We will compare the implementation and mitigation strategies against established security best practices for handling external scripts.
*   **Documentation Review:** We will review the `wrk` documentation to understand the intended usage of Lua scripts and any security guidance provided.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1 Attack Vectors:**

An attacker could tamper with a Lua script used by `wrk` through several potential attack vectors:

*   **Compromised Development Environment:** If the developer's machine is compromised, an attacker could modify the Lua scripts before they are even committed to a repository.
*   **Compromised Build Server/CI/CD Pipeline:**  If the build process is compromised, an attacker could inject malicious code into the Lua scripts during the build or deployment process.
*   **Compromised Repository:**  If the source code repository (e.g., GitHub) is compromised, an attacker could directly modify the Lua scripts.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (during script retrieval):** If `wrk` retrieves scripts from a remote location (less common, but possible), a MitM attack could intercept and modify the script.
*   **Local File System Access:** If an attacker gains access to the file system where `wrk` is running and the Lua scripts are stored, they could directly modify the files.  This could be through a separate vulnerability (e.g., SSH compromise, web shell).
*   **Insecure Permissions:** If the Lua script files have overly permissive permissions (e.g., world-writable), any user on the system could modify them.

**2.2 Vulnerability Analysis (based on `wrk`'s likely behavior):**

*   **Lua's `loadfile` and `dofile` (or similar):**  `wrk` almost certainly uses Lua's built-in functions to load and execute scripts.  These functions, by themselves, don't perform any integrity checks.  This is the *core* vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Sandboxing (potentially):**  While Lua itself has some sandboxing capabilities, `wrk` might not fully utilize them.  A malicious script could potentially:
    *   Access the file system (beyond the intended script directory).
    *   Execute system commands (using `os.execute` or similar).
    *   Access network resources.
    *   Interact with other Lua modules in unexpected ways.
*   **Error Handling:**  Poor error handling in `wrk`'s Lua integration could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if a tampered script throws errors.  This could be a denial-of-service vector, or potentially reveal information about the system.
* **No Input Validation of Script Path:** If the path to the Lua script is taken from user input without proper validation, an attacker might be able to specify an arbitrary file path, potentially leading to the execution of a different, malicious script.

**2.3 Impact Analysis (Expanding on the initial threat):**

The impact of a successful Lua script tampering attack can be severe and wide-ranging:

*   **Data Exfiltration:** The script could be modified to send sensitive data from the target server (obtained from responses) to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The script could be modified to send malformed requests, flood the server, or consume excessive resources, causing a DoS.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Target Server:** The script could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the target server (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) through specially crafted requests.
*   **RCE on the `wrk` Host:** If the Lua script can execute arbitrary system commands, the attacker could gain control of the machine running `wrk`.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  The compromised `wrk` host could be used as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network.
*   **Credential Theft:**  The script could be modified to capture credentials used by `wrk` (if any) or to attempt to steal credentials from the target server.
*   **Data Corruption:** The script could send requests that modify or delete data on the target server.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack could damage the reputation of the organization using `wrk` and the organization hosting the target server.

**2.4 Mitigation Strategy Evaluation and Refinement:**

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigation strategies and suggest refinements:

*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  This is a *critical* mitigation.  
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement FIM using a robust tool (e.g., OSSEC, Tripwire, Samhain) that can detect changes in real-time and generate alerts.  Configure FIM to monitor the specific Lua script files used by `wrk`.  Consider using a centralized FIM solution for easier management.  Ensure the FIM system itself is secured.
    *   **Consideration:** FIM detects *after* a change has occurred.  It's a detective control, not a preventative one.

*   **Code Signing:** This is a strong preventative measure.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement code signing using a trusted code signing certificate.  Modify `wrk` to verify the digital signature of the Lua script *before* loading it.  If the signature is invalid or missing, `wrk` should refuse to execute the script.
    *   **Consideration:** Requires managing code signing certificates and integrating signature verification into `wrk`.  This adds complexity.

*   **Secure Storage:** This is a basic but important security practice.
    *   **Recommendation:** Store Lua scripts in a directory with restricted permissions.  Only the user account that runs `wrk` should have read access, and *no* users should have write access (except during deployment, which should be automated and secured).  Use the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Consideration:** This is a preventative measure, but it's not foolproof.  An attacker who gains root access could still modify the files.

*   **Code Review:** This is essential for catching vulnerabilities before they are deployed.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a mandatory code review process for *all* changes to Lua scripts.  The review should specifically focus on security implications, looking for potential injection vulnerabilities, unauthorized access to resources, and other security best practices.  Use a checklist to ensure consistency.
    *   **Consideration:** Relies on the expertise of the reviewers.  Automated code analysis tools can help.

**2.5 Additional Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Lua Sandboxing:**  Explore and implement Lua's built-in sandboxing capabilities to restrict the script's access to the file system, network, and system commands.  This can significantly limit the damage a compromised script can cause.  This is a *high-priority* mitigation.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use Lua's `setfenv` (or the equivalent in newer Lua versions) to create a restricted environment for the script.  Explicitly define the allowed functions and modules.  Consider using a Lua sandboxing library for easier management.
*   **Input Validation:** If the path to the Lua script is taken from user input (e.g., a command-line argument), rigorously validate and sanitize this input to prevent path traversal attacks.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use a whitelist approach to allow only specific, known-good script paths.  Reject any input that contains suspicious characters (e.g., "..", "/", "\").
*   **Least Privilege:** Run `wrk` with the least privileges necessary.  Do *not* run it as root.  Create a dedicated user account with limited permissions for running `wrk`.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the `wrk` deployment environment, including the file system, network configuration, and user accounts.
*   **Automated Deployment:** Use an automated deployment process (e.g., CI/CD pipeline) to deploy Lua scripts.  This reduces the risk of manual errors and makes it easier to track changes.  The deployment process itself should be secured.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., luacheck) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the Lua scripts themselves.
* **Harden wrk compilation:** Compile wrk with security flags, like stack protection, and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

The "Lua Script Tampering" threat is a serious one for `wrk`.  The combination of Lua's flexibility and the potential for attackers to gain access to the file system creates a significant attack surface.

**Key Recommendations (Prioritized):**

1.  **Implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** This is the most immediate and practical mitigation.
2.  **Implement Lua Sandboxing:** This significantly reduces the impact of a compromised script.
3.  **Implement Code Signing:** This prevents the execution of unauthorized scripts.
4.  **Enforce Secure Storage and Least Privilege:** These are fundamental security best practices.
5.  **Mandatory Code Review with Security Focus:** This helps catch vulnerabilities before deployment.
6.  **Input Validation (if applicable):** Prevent path traversal attacks.
