# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for wg/wrk

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled `wrk` Usage and Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/controlled__wrk__usage_and_configuration.md)

1.  **Scheduled Testing Windows:**  Conduct `wrk` load tests only during pre-defined, scheduled maintenance windows.  Communicate these windows to relevant teams (operations, security, etc.).
2.  **Controlled Test Environments:**  Ideally, run `wrk` tests against a dedicated staging or testing environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.  *Never* run high-load `wrk` tests directly against production without *extreme* caution and coordination.
3.  **Limited Concurrency and Duration:**  Carefully control the `-c` (connections), `-t` (threads), and `-d` (duration) parameters in `wrk`.  Start with low values and gradually increase them, monitoring the impact on the target system.  Avoid unnecessarily long test durations.
4.  **Realistic Request Patterns:**  Craft `wrk` scripts (Lua) that simulate realistic user behavior.  Don't just hammer a single endpoint with identical requests.  Vary request parameters, headers, and timing to mimic real-world traffic.
5.  **Avoid Default User-Agent (in Production-Like Tests):** While useful for differentiating *controlled* tests, change the default `wrk` User-Agent string (`-H "User-Agent: My-Realistic-Agent"`) when testing in environments that resemble production. This helps avoid accidentally triggering special-case handling that might be in place for the default `wrk` agent.  It also makes your tests more representative of real user traffic.
6.  **Rate Limiting *Within* `wrk` (Lua Scripting):**  Use `wrk`'s Lua scripting capabilities to implement client-side rate limiting *within the test itself*.  This is *not* a security measure, but a way to control the load generated by `wrk` and prevent it from overwhelming the target, even if server-side rate limiting isn't yet in place.  This is particularly useful during development.  You can use `request()` and `delay()` functions in Lua to achieve this.
7. **Controlled Source IPs:** If possible, run `wrk` tests from a limited set of known IP addresses. This makes it easier to identify and filter `wrk` traffic at the network level (though this is *not* a primary security measure).
8. **Avoid unnecessary headers:** Do not include unnecessary headers in requests.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):**  Prevents `wrk` itself from causing an outage due to excessive load during testing.
    *   **Unrealistic Test Results (Medium Severity):**  Ensures that load tests accurately reflect real-world usage patterns.
    *   **Misinterpretation of Test Traffic (Low Severity):**  Helps differentiate legitimate `wrk` testing from potential attacks (when using controlled environments and custom User-Agents).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (in Test Environment) (Medium Severity):** Protects the test environment from being overwhelmed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental DoS:**  High impact; directly prevents self-inflicted DoS.
    *   **Unrealistic Test Results:**  High impact; ensures the validity of test results.
    *   **Misinterpretation of Traffic:**  Moderate impact; aids in distinguishing test traffic.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Test):** High impact; protects the test environment.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `wrk` tests are run against a staging environment.
    *   Basic control over `-c`, `-t`, and `-d` parameters.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal scheduled testing windows.
    *   `wrk` scripts don't fully simulate realistic user behavior.
    *   Default `wrk` User-Agent is often used.
    *   No client-side rate limiting within `wrk` scripts.
    *   No restriction on source IPs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure and Responsible `wrk` Lua Scripting](./mitigation_strategies/secure_and_responsible__wrk__lua_scripting.md)

1.  **Input Validation:**  Within your Lua scripts, *always* validate and sanitize any input data used to construct requests (URLs, headers, body content).  This is crucial even though it's "just a test" because vulnerabilities exposed during testing are still real vulnerabilities.
2.  **Avoid Hardcoding Sensitive Data:**  Do *not* hardcode API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information directly into `wrk` scripts.  Use environment variables or other secure methods to provide these values.
3.  **Limit Script Functionality:**  Keep `wrk` scripts focused on their core purpose: generating HTTP requests.  Avoid unnecessary complexity or functionality that could introduce vulnerabilities.
4.  **Error Handling:**  Implement proper error handling within the Lua scripts.  Handle potential errors gracefully and avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages.
5.  **Code Review:**  Subject all `wrk` Lua scripts to thorough code reviews, paying close attention to security best practices.
6.  **Regular Audits:**  Periodically audit existing `wrk` scripts to ensure they remain secure and up-to-date.
7. **Use functions wisely:** Use `wrk` Lua functions (`setup`, `init`, `delay`, `request`, `response`) in the intended way.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities (Medium-High Severity):**  Prevents attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in the application through malicious `wrk` scripts.
    *   **Data Leakage (Medium Severity):**  Prevents scripts from accidentally exposing sensitive information.
    *   **Scripting Errors (Low-Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of errors in the scripts causing unexpected behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities:**  High impact; directly addresses the threat.
    *   **Data Leakage:**  Moderate impact; reduces the risk of data exposure.
    *   **Scripting Errors:**  Moderate impact; improves the reliability of testing.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `wrk` scripts are stored in version control.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No mandatory code reviews for `wrk` scripts.
    *   No consistent input validation or sanitization within scripts.
    *   No regular audits of existing scripts.
