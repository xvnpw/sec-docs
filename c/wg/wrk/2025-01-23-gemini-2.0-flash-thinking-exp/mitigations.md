# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for wg/wrk

## Mitigation Strategy: [Gradual Load Ramp-Up](./mitigation_strategies/gradual_load_ramp-up.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When configuring `wrk` tests, avoid immediately starting with the maximum number of threads and connections.
    2.  Utilize `wrk` scripting capabilities (Lua scripts) or external scripting to gradually increase the load over a defined period.
    3.  Start with a low number of threads and connections using `wrk -t` and `-c` parameters and incrementally increase them in steps over minutes or hours, depending on the test duration and environment capacity. For example, start with `-t2 -c10` and increase to `-t4 -c20`, and so on.
    4.  Monitor system resources during the ramp-up (separately, as described in other mitigation strategies) to observe performance degradation points and identify bottlenecks without causing sudden crashes.
    5.  Document the ramp-up schedule and `wrk` configuration used for each test scenario.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) in Test Environment - Severity: Medium
    *   Resource Exhaustion in Test Environment - Severity: Medium
    *   Application Instability during Testing - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS in Test Environment: Medium reduction - Reduces the likelihood of abrupt DoS by allowing the system to gradually adapt to increasing load initiated by `wrk`.
    *   Resource Exhaustion in Test Environment: Medium reduction - Lessens the chance of sudden resource exhaustion by providing time to observe resource usage trends under increasing `wrk` load.
    *   Application Instability during Testing: Medium reduction -  Minimizes the risk of application crashes or unexpected behavior due to sudden load spikes from `wrk`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some test scripts utilize a basic ramp-up by adjusting thread count manually between test runs.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated ramp-up scripting using Lua within `wrk` is not consistently used across all test scenarios. No standardized ramp-up profiles are defined for `wrk` tests.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Realistic Test Scenarios](./mitigation_strategies/realistic_test_scenarios.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Analyze production traffic patterns, including request rates, request types (GET, POST, etc.), payload sizes, and user behavior.
    2.  Design `wrk` test scripts and configurations that closely mimic these production traffic characteristics. This includes using appropriate HTTP methods, headers, request bodies, and URL paths in your `wrk` scripts.
    3.  Avoid creating artificial or exaggerated load scenarios in `wrk` that do not reflect real-world usage. Focus on testing expected peak loads and common user flows that `wrk` can simulate.
    4.  Regularly review and update `wrk` test scenarios to align with evolving production traffic patterns and application changes.
    5.  Document the rationale behind `wrk` test scenario design and how it reflects production usage.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Misleading Performance Results - Severity: Medium
    *   Unnecessary Resource Stress - Severity: Medium
    *   False Positives in Security Testing - Severity: Low
*   **Impact:**
    *   Misleading Performance Results: High reduction - Ensures that performance test results obtained using `wrk` are relevant and accurately reflect real-world application behavior under load.
    *   Unnecessary Resource Stress: Medium reduction - Prevents the test environment from being subjected to unrealistic stress from `wrk`, which can lead to inaccurate conclusions and potential instability.
    *   False Positives in Security Testing: Low reduction - Reduces the chance of triggering false security alerts or misinterpreting security scan results due to artificial load patterns generated by `wrk`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some `wrk` test scenarios are based on production traffic analysis, but not all scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal process for regularly analyzing production traffic and updating `wrk` test scenarios. Lack of comprehensive documentation linking `wrk` test scenarios to production usage patterns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Test Duration](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_test_duration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define a specific and reasonable duration for each `wrk` test run based on the test objectives and environment capacity. Use the `-d` parameter in `wrk` to set the test duration.
    2.  Avoid running `wrk` tests indefinitely or for excessively long periods without clear justification.
    3.  Set timeouts or stop conditions in `wrk` scripts or test automation frameworks to automatically terminate tests after the defined duration, ensuring the `-d` parameter is always used.
    4.  Regularly review and adjust `wrk` test durations based on experience and evolving testing needs.
    5.  Document the planned `wrk` test duration for each test scenario and the rationale behind it.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Resource Exhaustion in Test Environment (Prolonged) - Severity: Medium
    *   Unnecessary Test Environment Load - Severity: Low
    *   Wasted Testing Resources - Severity: Low
*   **Impact:**
    *   Resource Exhaustion in Test Environment (Prolonged): Medium reduction - Reduces the risk of long-term resource depletion and potential instability due to prolonged high load generated by `wrk`.
    *   Unnecessary Test Environment Load: Medium reduction - Minimizes unnecessary load on test environments from `wrk`, freeing up resources for other testing activities.
    *   Wasted Testing Resources: Low reduction - Prevents wasting testing resources (time, compute) on unnecessarily long `wrk` test runs.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Test scripts generally include a `-d` (duration) parameter, but durations are not always consistently planned or reviewed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  No standardized guidelines for determining appropriate `wrk` test durations. Lack of automated enforcement of test duration limits in all `wrk` test scenarios.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Version Control for `wrk` Scripts and Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/version_control_for__wrk__scripts_and_configurations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Store all `wrk` scripts, configuration files (including parameters used with the `wrk` command), and related test data in a version control system (e.g., Git).
    2.  Treat `wrk` test configurations as code and follow standard version control practices (branching, merging, pull requests, commit messages).
    3.  Use version control to track changes to `wrk` test scenarios, configurations, and scripts over time.
    4.  Implement code review processes for changes to `wrk` scripts and configurations before they are used in testing.
    5.  Utilize version control to easily revert to previous `wrk` test configurations if needed.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic documentation exists on internal wiki pages, but training is ad-hoc and not formally structured.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formalized `wrk` training program for new team members. Comprehensive and regularly updated documentation repository for `wrk` usage and best practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Validation before Execution](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_validation_before_execution.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement a validation step before executing any `wrk` test to review and confirm the configured parameters (threads `-t`, connections `-c`, duration `-d`, target URL, scripts `-s`, headers `-H`, etc.).
    2.  Create a checklist or automated script to verify key `wrk` configuration settings against expected values or predefined ranges.
    3.  Ensure that target URLs used with `wrk` are correct and point to the intended test environment, not production.
    4.  Verify that script paths provided to `wrk`'s `-s` parameter are valid and scripts are correctly configured.
    5.  Prompt users to confirm the `wrk` configuration before initiating the test execution.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Focus on Stress Testing Security Features (using `wrk`)](./mitigation_strategies/focus_on_stress_testing_security_features__using__wrk__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Design `wrk` test scripts specifically to target and stress security-related functionalities of the application.
    2.  Create `wrk` test scenarios that focus on authentication mechanisms (login, session management), authorization checks (access control), input validation routines, and rate limiting implementations. You can use `wrk` scripts to simulate authentication flows, send requests with different authorization levels, or provide invalid input to test validation.
    3.  Simulate various attack vectors within `wrk` scripts to test the resilience of security features under load (e.g., brute-force login attempts by iterating through credentials in a `wrk` script, injection attacks by crafting malicious payloads in request bodies within `wrk` scripts).
    4.  Monitor security logs and audit trails during these stress tests to detect suspicious activities or security violations triggered by `wrk` generated load.
    5.  Analyze the performance of security features under stress generated by `wrk` to identify potential bottlenecks or weaknesses.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Security Feature Performance Degradation under Load - Severity: Medium
    *   Bypassable Security Controls under Load - Severity: Medium
    *   Security Feature Failures under Load - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
