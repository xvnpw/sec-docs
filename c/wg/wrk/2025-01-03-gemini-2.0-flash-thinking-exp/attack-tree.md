# Attack Tree Analysis for wg/wrk

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise the application under test by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the wrk tool itself or by leveraging its capabilities in a malicious way.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Attack: Compromise Application Using wrk [CRITICAL NODE]
    * OR: Exploit wrk's Request Generation Capabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * AND: Inject Malicious Payloads via wrk [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]
            * OR: Inject Command Injection Payloads [HIGH-RISK PATH]
            * OR: Inject Path Traversal Payloads [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    * OR: Leverage wrk for Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * AND: Overwhelm Application with Traffic [HIGH-RISK PATH]
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Attack: Compromise Application Using wrk [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_compromise_application_using_wrk__critical_node_.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate objective. Success at this node signifies a breach of the application's security, potentially leading to data loss, unauthorized access, or disruption of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit wrk's Request Generation Capabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_wrk's_request_generation_capabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on leveraging wrk's core functionality – its ability to send custom HTTP requests. Attackers exploit this to craft requests that target vulnerabilities in the application's handling of incoming data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payloads via wrk [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payloads_via_wrk__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This critical node signifies the successful injection of harmful data into the application through requests sent by wrk. This is a key stepping stone for several high-impact attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Command Injection Payloads [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_command_injection_payloads__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  wrk is used to send HTTP requests where parameters or other data fields contain operating system commands. If the application doesn't properly sanitize this input before using it in system calls, the attacker's commands will be executed on the server.
**Potential Impact:** Full compromise of the server hosting the application, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, install malware, or pivot to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Path Traversal Payloads [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_path_traversal_payloads__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** wrk is used to send HTTP requests with manipulated file paths. By crafting requests with ".." sequences or absolute paths, attackers attempt to access files and directories outside the application's intended web root.
**Potential Impact:** Access to sensitive configuration files, source code, user data, or other critical information stored on the server's file system. This can lead to further exploitation or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage wrk for Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_wrk_for_denial_of_service__dos__attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

This path exploits wrk's intended purpose – load testing – for malicious ends. The attacker uses wrk to generate a large volume of traffic aimed at overwhelming the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwhelm Application with Traffic [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/overwhelm_application_with_traffic__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** wrk is configured to send a massive number of requests to the application's endpoints within a short period. This floods the application server and network infrastructure, consuming resources and preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.
**Potential Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, financial losses due to downtime, damage to reputation, and potential impact on dependent services.
