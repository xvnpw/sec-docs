# Threat Model Analysis for wg/wrk

## Threat: [Application Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/application_denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker uses `wrk` to generate an extremely high volume of requests to the target application, far exceeding its capacity. This floods the application with requests, consuming all available resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, database connections).

**Impact:** The target application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing it. This can lead to business disruption, financial losses, and reputational damage.

**Affected `wrk` Component:** Core request generation logic, command-line options (`-t`, `-c`, `-d`, `-R`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully configure `wrk` parameters (threads, connections, duration, rate limiting).
* Monitor the target application's resource usage during testing.

## Threat: [Database Denial of Service via Excessive Queries](./threats/database_denial_of_service_via_excessive_queries.md)

**Description:** An attacker uses `wrk` to simulate a large number of users performing actions that result in numerous database queries. This can overwhelm the database server, leading to performance degradation or complete failure.

**Impact:** The target application experiences significant slowdowns or becomes unable to access the database, leading to application errors and unavailability.

**Affected `wrk` Component:** Core request generation logic, custom Lua scripts (if used to craft specific query-intensive requests).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully configure `wrk` to avoid generating excessive database load during testing.
* Review and optimize the queries generated by the application under test.

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution on `wrk` Host via Malicious Lua Scripts](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_on__wrk__host_via_malicious_lua_scripts.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a malicious custom Lua script to be used with `wrk`. If `wrk` executes this script, it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine running `wrk`.

**Impact:** The attacker can gain control of the machine running `wrk`, potentially compromising sensitive data stored on that machine or using it as a stepping stone for further attacks.

**Affected `wrk` Component:** Lua scripting engine (`script` command-line option).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only use trusted Lua scripts with `wrk`.
* Review and understand the functionality of any custom Lua scripts before execution.
* Run `wrk` in an isolated environment.

## Threat: [Data Manipulation via Malicious Lua Scripts](./threats/data_manipulation_via_malicious_lua_scripts.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Lua script for `wrk` that modifies request data in a way that exploits vulnerabilities in the target application. This could lead to data corruption, unauthorized access, or other malicious actions.

**Impact:** The target application's data integrity can be compromised, leading to incorrect information, financial losses, or security breaches.

**Affected `wrk` Component:** Lua scripting engine (`script` command-line option), request building functions within the script.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using untrusted or unreviewed Lua scripts with `wrk`.
* Implement robust input validation on the target application to mitigate the impact of manipulated data.
