# Threat Model Analysis for wg/wrk

## Threat: [Malicious Denial of Service (DoS) using `wrk`](./threats/malicious_denial_of_service__dos__using__wrk_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could leverage `wrk` from a compromised system or their own infrastructure to generate a massive volume of requests against a target application. They would configure `wrk` with a high number of threads (`-t`), connections (`-c`), and potentially a long duration (`-d`) to overwhelm the target server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
    *   **Impact:** The target application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service. This can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and disruption of business operations.
    *   **Affected `wrk` Component:** Command-line arguments (`-t`, `-c`, `-d`), core benchmarking engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the target application to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given timeframe.
        *   Deploy robust infrastructure with sufficient resources to handle expected and some unexpected traffic spikes.
        *   Utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious traffic patterns.
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to identify and mitigate DoS attacks.
        *   Monitor network traffic for unusual spikes and patterns.

## Threat: [Amplification Attack using `wrk` against Vulnerable Infrastructure](./threats/amplification_attack_using__wrk__against_vulnerable_infrastructure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might use `wrk` to target a vulnerable intermediary service (e.g., a poorly configured DNS resolver or NTP server) that amplifies requests. By sending a small number of requests through `wrk` to this vulnerable service, they can cause it to send a much larger volume of responses to the intended victim, effectively amplifying the attack.
    *   **Impact:** The target system is overwhelmed by the amplified traffic, leading to DoS. The attacker doesn't directly target the victim with `wrk`, but uses it to trigger the amplification.
    *   **Affected `wrk` Component:** Command-line arguments (`-H` for custom headers, URL specification), core request sending mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that all infrastructure components are securely configured and patched against known vulnerabilities that could be exploited for amplification attacks.
        *   Implement egress filtering to prevent internal systems from sending requests to potentially vulnerable external services.
        *   Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns indicative of amplification attacks.
