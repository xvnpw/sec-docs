## High and Critical OBS Studio Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats directly involving OBS Studio:

**Threat:** Malicious Plugin Installation

*   **Description:** An attacker tricks a user into installing a malicious OBS Studio plugin. This plugin could have broad access to OBS Studio's functionalities and the underlying system, allowing for data exfiltration, remote control, or other malicious activities.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, system compromise, loss of control over OBS Studio, potential for further attacks on the host system.
*   **Affected Component:** Plugins System (`obs_plugin_load`, plugin API).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only allow installation of plugins from trusted and verified sources.
    *   Implement a plugin vetting or review process.
    *   Provide users with clear warnings about the risks of installing untrusted plugins.
    *   Consider using plugin sandboxing or isolation techniques.
    *   Regularly audit installed plugins.

**Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerable Plugin

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an installed OBS Studio plugin. This could allow for arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, or other malicious actions within the context of OBS Studio.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data breach, loss of control over OBS Studio, potential for denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Specific plugin with the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep all installed plugins updated to the latest versions.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for installed plugins.
    *   Implement a process for quickly patching or removing vulnerable plugins.
    *   Consider using automated vulnerability scanning tools.

**Threat:** Unauthorized Remote Control Access

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to OBS Studio's remote control interface (e.g., obs-websocket) due to weak credentials or misconfiguration. This allows them to remotely control OBS Studio's functions, potentially disrupting streams, changing settings, or injecting malicious content.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of service, reputational damage, potential for manipulation of output.
*   **Affected Component:** Remote Control Interface (`obs-websocket`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong, unique passwords for remote control access.
    *   Restrict access to the remote control interface to authorized networks or IP addresses.
    *   Enable authentication and encryption for remote control connections.
    *   Regularly review and audit remote control configurations.

**Threat:** API Command Injection

*   **Description:** If the application interacts with OBS Studio through its API and improperly handles user-provided input when constructing API commands, an attacker could inject malicious commands. This could allow them to execute arbitrary OBS Studio functions or even system commands.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data manipulation, disruption of service.
*   **Affected Component:** OBS Studio API (`libobs`), application's API interaction logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before using it in API calls.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing API commands.
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege when granting API access.

**Threat:** Exploitation of OBS Studio Software Vulnerability

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a previously unknown or unpatched vulnerability in the OBS Studio software itself. This could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or other malicious outcomes.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, loss of control over OBS Studio, disruption of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Various OBS Studio modules and functions depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep OBS Studio updated to the latest version.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for OBS Studio.
    *   Implement a process for quickly patching OBS Studio when updates are released.
    *   Consider using intrusion detection or prevention systems.
