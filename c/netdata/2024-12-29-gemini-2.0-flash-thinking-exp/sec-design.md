## Project Design Document: Netdata (Improved)

**1. Introduction**

This document provides an enhanced and detailed design overview of the Netdata monitoring system. It aims to clearly articulate the system's architecture, components, and data flow, serving as a robust foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities. This document is intended for security architects, developers, and operations personnel involved in understanding, securing, and deploying Netdata. The focus is on providing the necessary context for identifying potential security vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

**2. System Overview**

Netdata is a highly granular, real-time performance and health monitoring system for systems and applications. It excels at collecting a vast array of metrics at per-second intervals and presenting them through interactive, customizable web dashboards. Designed for minimal overhead, it can be deployed on virtually any Linux system, container, or virtual machine. Key features include:

*   Extremely high-resolution, real-time data collection and visualization.
*   Automatic detection and collection of thousands of system and application metrics without extensive configuration.
*   A flexible and extensible plugin architecture allowing for the collection of custom and application-specific metrics.
*   Sophisticated alerting and anomaly detection capabilities based on collected metrics.
*   A distributed architecture supporting both standalone agents and optional centralized collection and cloud integration.
*   Local-first design, ensuring monitoring continues even during network outages.

**3. Architectural Design**

Netdata employs a distributed agent-based architecture with optional components for centralized aggregation and cloud services.

*   **Netdata Agent:** The fundamental building block, deployed on each system to be monitored. It collects metrics, stores them in an efficient in-memory time-series database (TSDB), and serves a local web dashboard.
*   **Netdata Central (Optional):** A dedicated Netdata instance configured to act as a central collector, receiving and aggregating metrics streamed from multiple Netdata Agents. This provides a consolidated view of infrastructure performance.
*   **Netdata Cloud (Optional):** A cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform offered by Netdata, Inc., providing centralized monitoring, alerting, team collaboration features, and long-term data storage. Agents can stream metrics to Netdata Cloud.
*   **Web Dashboard:** A dynamic user interface served by the Netdata Agent (or Central) allowing users to visualize real-time metrics, configure the agent, and manage alerts.
*   **Plugins (Collectors):** Independent processes or scripts that extend the Netdata Agent's capabilities by collecting metrics from diverse sources.

**5. Key Components and their Interactions**

*   **Netdata Agent:**
    *   **Metric Collectors (Internal):**  C code modules responsible for gathering core system metrics directly from the kernel, `/proc` filesystem, and other system interfaces. Examples include CPU usage, memory statistics, disk I/O, and network interface metrics.
    *   **Plugins (External Collectors):** Independent processes or scripts that collect metrics from applications and services. These are typically written in Python (using the `python.d.plugin` framework), Go (using the `go.d.plugin` framework), or other languages. They communicate metric data to the agent via standard output in a defined format.
    *   **Internal Time-Series Database (TSDB):** An in-memory database optimized for storing time-series data. It provides fast read and write operations for real-time visualization. Data retention is configurable, and older data can be optionally written to disk or external TSDBs.
    *   **Web Server (uvicorn):** An embedded ASGI server that serves the web dashboard (static files and JavaScript application) and the agent's API endpoints.
    *   **API Endpoints:** RESTful API providing access to collected metrics (in JSON format), agent configuration, and health status. Endpoints are typically accessed via HTTP GET requests.
    *   **Streaming Engine:**  Manages the transmission of collected metrics to other Netdata instances (Central) or Netdata Cloud. It uses a custom binary protocol over TCP or WebSocket, often secured with TLS.
    *   **Alerting Engine:** Evaluates collected metrics against pre-defined thresholds and generates alerts when conditions are met. Alerts can be configured via YAML files.
    *   **Configuration Files:** Store agent settings, plugin configurations, alert definitions, and streaming configurations. The primary configuration directory is typically `/etc/netdata/`.

*   **Plugins (Collectors):**
    *   **External Processes:** Executable files or scripts that run independently of the main Netdata Agent process.
    *   **Communication via Standard Output:** Plugins output metric data to the agent's standard input in a specific format (e.g., `METRIC_NAME value timestamp`).
    *   **Configuration:** Plugin behavior is often configured through YAML files located in subdirectories of `/etc/netdata/` (e.g., `/etc/netdata/python.d/`, `/etc/netdata/go.d/`).
    *   **Health Checks:** Plugins can also report their own health status to the agent.

*   **Netdata Central:**
    *   **Metrics Receiver:** Listens for incoming metric streams from Netdata Agents over TCP or WebSocket connections.
    *   **Acts as a Netdata Agent:**  Internally functions as a standard Netdata Agent, storing received metrics in its own in-memory TSDB and serving a web dashboard.
    *   **Centralized Visualization:** Provides a unified view of metrics from multiple monitored systems.

*   **Netdata Cloud:**
    *   **Secure Metrics Ingestion:** Accepts metric streams from Netdata Agents over the internet, typically using TLS-encrypted connections. Agents authenticate using claim tokens.
    *   **Centralized Monitoring and Alerting Platform:** Offers a comprehensive cloud-based platform for visualizing metrics, managing alerts, and collaborating with teams.
    *   **Long-Term Data Storage:** Provides persistent storage for historical metric data.

*   **Web Dashboard:**
    *   **Client-Side Application (JavaScript):** A single-page application built with JavaScript frameworks, running entirely in the user's web browser.
    *   **API Communication:** Fetches metric data and configuration information from the Netdata Agent's API endpoints using asynchronous HTTP requests (AJAX).
    *   **Real-time Visualization:** Renders dynamic charts and graphs using JavaScript libraries, providing real-time insights into system performance.

**6. Data Storage and Persistence**

*   **Netdata Agent:**
    *   **Primary Storage:** In-memory time-series database (TSDB) for real-time data.
    *   **Optional Disk Persistence:**  Can be configured to write metrics to disk for longer retention, typically using a round-robin database (RRD) approach or by forwarding to external TSDBs.
    *   **External TSDB Integration:** Supports integration with various external time-series databases like Prometheus, Graphite, InfluxDB, and others via configurable data exporters.

*   **Netdata Central:** Stores metrics in its own in-memory TSDB, similar to a regular agent. Persistence options are also available, including disk-based storage and external TSDB integration.

*   **Netdata Cloud:** Utilizes a proprietary, scalable backend infrastructure for storing and managing the large volume of time-series data it receives from connected agents.

**7. Communication Protocols and Interfaces**

*   **Agent to Web Dashboard:** HTTP/HTTPS for serving static files, the JavaScript application, and API requests (typically JSON over HTTP).
*   **Agent to Central/Cloud:** A custom binary streaming protocol over TCP or WebSocket. Communication is typically secured with TLS encryption. Authentication is handled via agent claim tokens for Netdata Cloud.
*   **Plugins to Agent:** Standard output (stdout) using a simple text-based format.
*   **External TSDB Integration:** Protocols specific to the chosen database (e.g., Prometheus remote write protocol over HTTP, Graphite plaintext protocol over TCP).

**8. Authentication and Authorization**

*   **Netdata Agent:**
    *   **No Authentication (Default):** By default, the web dashboard and API are accessible without any authentication. This is a significant security risk in production environments.
    *   **Basic Authentication (Optional):** Can be enabled to require a username and password for accessing the web dashboard and API. Credentials are stored in a configuration file.
    *   **API Keys (Optional):**  Can be generated and used for authenticating API requests, providing a more granular approach to access control.
    *   **TLS Certificates:** Used for securing HTTPS communication.

*   **Netdata Central:** Authentication mechanisms are similar to the Netdata Agent, with options for basic authentication and API keys.

*   **Netdata Cloud:**
    *   **Account-Based Authentication:** Users authenticate with Netdata Cloud using email/password or social login.
    *   **Agent Claim Tokens:** Agents connecting to Netdata Cloud use unique, long-lived tokens for authentication and authorization. These tokens are generated within the Netdata Cloud UI and configured in the agent.

**9. Security Considerations (Detailed for Threat Modeling)**

This section provides a more detailed overview of potential security concerns and attack vectors:

*   **Unauthenticated Access to Agents:** The default lack of authentication exposes sensitive system metrics and potentially agent control to anyone with network access to the agent's port (default 19999). This is a high-risk vulnerability.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Unauthorized information disclosure, potential manipulation of agent configuration if API access is not restricted.
*   **Agent Compromise:** If a Netdata Agent is compromised, attackers gain access to real-time system performance data and potentially the ability to manipulate the monitored system (depending on plugin capabilities and configurations).
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Netdata Agent software, compromising the host system where the agent runs, exploiting vulnerabilities in plugins.
*   **Insecure Communication:** If communication between agents and central/cloud instances is not properly secured with TLS, metric data can be intercepted and potentially manipulated.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping on sensitive performance data.
*   **Malicious Plugins:**  Compromised or malicious plugins can inject false metrics, consume excessive resources, or perform arbitrary actions on the monitored system with the privileges of the Netdata Agent user.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Supply chain attacks targeting plugin repositories, social engineering to install malicious plugins, exploiting vulnerabilities in plugin code.
*   **Web Dashboard Vulnerabilities:** Standard web application vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and insecure direct object references could exist in the dashboard, potentially allowing attackers to compromise user sessions or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Injecting malicious scripts into the dashboard, tricking authenticated users into performing unintended actions.
*   **Data Storage Security:** If persistent storage is enabled (either locally or via external TSDBs), the security of the storage mechanism becomes critical. Sensitive metric data needs to be protected against unauthorized access and modification.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Unauthorized access to database credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in the external TSDB software.
*   **Central/Cloud Security:** The security of the central Netdata instance or the Netdata Cloud platform is paramount. A compromise of these components could expose aggregated metrics from multiple systems.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the central Netdata instance or the Netdata Cloud infrastructure, compromising administrator accounts.
*   **Supply Chain Security:** Ensuring the integrity of the Netdata software packages and their dependencies is crucial to prevent the introduction of malicious code.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Compromised software repositories, malicious code injected into dependencies.

**10. Deployment Considerations**

*   **Installation Methods:** Typically installed via a one-line installer script, package managers (e.g., `apt`, `yum`), or container images (Docker).
*   **Configuration Management:** Primarily configured through YAML files. Configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) can be used to automate deployment and configuration.
*   **Resource Requirements:** Designed to be lightweight, but resource consumption (CPU, memory) can increase with the number of metrics collected and the data retention period.
*   **Network Topology:** Consider network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to Netdata Agents and Central instances. Ensure proper port forwarding if accessing dashboards from outside the local network.

**11. Future Considerations**

*   Mandatory authentication and authorization by default for Netdata Agents.
*   Enhanced role-based access control (RBAC) for managing access to metrics and agent configuration.
*   Improved plugin security mechanisms, such as sandboxing or code signing.
*   Integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems for centralized security monitoring.
*   Enhanced auditing and logging capabilities for security events.
