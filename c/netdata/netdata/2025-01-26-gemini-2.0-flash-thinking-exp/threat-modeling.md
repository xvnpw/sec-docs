# Threat Model Analysis for netdata/netdata

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to Metrics Dashboard](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_metrics_dashboard.md)

Description: Netdata dashboard is accessible without authentication, allowing any network user to view sensitive system and application metrics. An attacker can use this information for reconnaissance, identifying vulnerabilities, and planning further attacks.
Impact: High.  Critical Information Disclosure. Exposure of sensitive system and application details can lead to significant security breaches and system compromise. Attackers gain valuable insights into the target system's internals.
Affected Component: Netdata Web Server, Netdata Agent
Risk Severity: High (when exposed to untrusted networks or the internet)
Mitigation Strategies:
    Mandatory: Enable authentication for the Netdata dashboard using built-in authentication or reverse proxy authentication.
    Mandatory: Restrict network access to the Netdata port (default 19999) using firewalls to trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
    Recommended: Use a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) to handle authentication and authorization in front of Netdata for enhanced security and centralized management.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerabilities.md)

Description: A vulnerability in Netdata's code allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running Netdata. This could be exploited through various Netdata components like the web server, data collection agents, or plugins.
Impact: Critical. Complete System Compromise. Attackers gain full control of the server, enabling them to steal data, disrupt services, install malware, and pivot to other systems within the network.
Affected Component: Netdata Web Server, Netdata Agent, Netdata Plugins, Core Netdata Code
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    Mandatory: Keep Netdata updated to the latest version to immediately patch known RCE vulnerabilities.
    Recommended: Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block potential RCE exploits targeting Netdata.
    Recommended: Run Netdata with the least privileges necessary to limit the impact of a potential RCE exploit.
    Recommended: Follow security best practices for system hardening and minimize the attack surface of the server running Netdata.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerabilities](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__vulnerabilities.md)

Description: If Netdata interacts with external resources (e.g., for plugins or Netdata Cloud integrations), SSRF vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to force Netdata to make requests to internal or external resources they should not have access to. An attacker could potentially access sensitive internal services or exfiltrate data.
Impact: High. Unauthorized Access to Internal Resources, Information Disclosure. Attackers can bypass network firewalls and access internal systems, potentially leading to data breaches or further exploitation of internal services.
Affected Component: Netdata Agent, Netdata Plugins, External Data Collection Modules
Risk Severity: High (when internal network access is possible and sensitive internal resources are reachable)
Mitigation Strategies:
    Mandatory: Carefully review and configure Netdata plugins and external data collection modules to strictly limit their access to external and internal resources. Implement strict allow-lists for allowed destinations if possible.
    Recommended: Implement network segmentation and firewalls to limit Netdata's network access and restrict its ability to reach sensitive internal resources.
    Recommended: Sanitize and validate any user-supplied input or configuration that could influence Netdata's external requests to prevent manipulation by attackers.

## Threat: [Running Netdata with Excessive Privileges](./threats/running_netdata_with_excessive_privileges.md)

Description: Running Netdata with unnecessary elevated privileges, especially as root, significantly increases the impact if Netdata is compromised. If an attacker exploits a vulnerability in Netdata, the attacker inherits the privileges Netdata is running with.
Impact: High. Increased Impact of Exploits, Potential System Compromise. If Netdata is compromised while running with root privileges, the attacker gains root access to the entire system, leading to complete system compromise.
Affected Component: Netdata Deployment, System User Configuration
Risk Severity: High (when running as root or with unnecessarily high privileges)
Mitigation Strategies:
    Mandatory: Run Netdata with the least privileges necessary to collect the required metrics.  Avoid running as root unless absolutely unavoidable and fully understand the risks.
    Recommended: Utilize capabilities or other privilege separation mechanisms provided by the operating system to further restrict Netdata's privileges beyond basic user-level permissions.
    Recommended: Regularly audit the privileges assigned to the Netdata process and ensure they are still the minimum required.

## Threat: [Lack of Regular Updates and Patching](./threats/lack_of_regular_updates_and_patching.md)

Description: Failing to regularly update Netdata to the latest version with security patches leaves the system vulnerable to known and publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities to compromise outdated Netdata instances.
Impact: High. Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities, System Compromise. Outdated Netdata installations become easy targets for attackers who can leverage publicly available exploit code for known vulnerabilities.
Affected Component: Netdata Software, Update Process
Risk Severity: High (when known vulnerabilities exist in the deployed version and are actively exploited)
Mitigation Strategies:
    Mandatory: Establish a robust and regular patching schedule for Netdata. Prioritize security updates.
    Recommended: Automate Netdata updates where possible to ensure timely patching.
    Recommended: Subscribe to security advisories and release notes from the Netdata project to stay informed about security updates and prioritize patching efforts.

## Threat: [Compromised Netdata Binaries or Packages](./threats/compromised_netdata_binaries_or_packages.md)

Description: Downloading and using compromised Netdata binaries or packages from unofficial or untrusted sources. These malicious packages could contain backdoors or malware that compromise the system upon installation.
Impact: Critical. System Compromise, Malware Infection. Malicious binaries can grant attackers persistent access, steal data, or cause widespread system damage.
Affected Component: Netdata Installation Packages, Distribution Channels
Risk Severity: Critical (if malware is present in compromised binaries)
Mitigation Strategies:
    Mandatory: Download Netdata binaries and packages only from official Netdata sources, such as the official GitHub releases or trusted package repositories maintained by the Netdata project or your operating system distribution.
    Recommended: Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or digital signatures provided by the official Netdata project.
    Recommended: Utilize package managers from trusted repositories for installation and updates, as they often include integrity checks and security scanning.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Netdata Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_netdata_dependencies.md)

Description: Netdata relies on third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect Netdata's security, potentially leading to various attack vectors including RCE or information disclosure through Netdata.
Impact: High.  Potential for various impacts depending on the dependency vulnerability, ranging from Information Disclosure to Remote Code Execution, all exploitable through Netdata.
Affected Component: Netdata Dependencies, Third-Party Libraries
Risk Severity: High (if critical vulnerabilities exist in dependencies and are exploitable through Netdata)
Mitigation Strategies:
    Mandatory: Regularly update Netdata and all its dependencies to the latest versions, ensuring security patches for dependencies are applied promptly.
    Recommended: Implement dependency scanning tools in your development and deployment pipelines to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in Netdata's dependencies.
    Recommended: Monitor security advisories for Netdata's dependencies and proactively take action to mitigate any identified vulnerabilities, even if the vulnerability is not directly in Netdata's core code.
