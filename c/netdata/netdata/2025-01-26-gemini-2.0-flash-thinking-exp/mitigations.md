# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for netdata/netdata

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Authentication for Netdata Dashboard](./mitigation_strategies/enable_authentication_for_netdata_dashboard.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Authentication for Netdata Dashboard
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Choose Authentication Method (Netdata Configuration):** Review Netdata's documentation for supported authentication methods. This might include built-in authentication mechanisms (if available in your Netdata version) or configuration options that facilitate integration with external authentication via a reverse proxy.
        2.  **Configure Netdata Authentication:**  Modify Netdata's configuration file (`netdata.conf`) to enable and configure the chosen authentication method. This typically involves setting options within the `[web]` section or dedicated authentication sections if available.
            *   Specify user credentials directly in Netdata's configuration (less secure, suitable for testing or very controlled environments).
            *   Configure Netdata to work with an external authentication system (more complex, often involves reverse proxy integration, but more secure and scalable).
        3.  **Test Authentication (Netdata Dashboard):** Access the Netdata dashboard and verify that you are prompted for credentials. Ensure that only users with valid credentials can successfully log in and access the dashboard.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Monitoring Data (High Severity):** Without authentication, anyone who can reach the Netdata dashboard URL can view sensitive system and application metrics.
        *   **Data Manipulation via API (High Severity):** If the Netdata API is exposed without authentication, attackers could potentially manipulate Netdata's configuration or data collection.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Monitoring Data:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible for unauthorized access *if Netdata's authentication is correctly configured and strong*.
        *   **Data Manipulation via API:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible for unauthorized access *if Netdata's authentication is correctly configured and strong*.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented directly within Netdata. Authentication is partially implemented *externally* via a reverse proxy in the staging environment.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Direct Netdata authentication is missing in both staging and production. Explore if Netdata offers suitable built-in authentication or configuration options to enhance the existing reverse proxy based authentication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Collectors and Metrics](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_collectors_and_metrics.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unnecessary Collectors and Metrics
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Review Collector Configuration (Netdata Configuration):** Examine the collector configuration files in `/etc/netdata/conf.d/` and the main `netdata.conf`. Identify all enabled collectors and their default metrics.
        2.  **Identify Essential Metrics (Monitoring Requirements):** Determine the absolute minimum set of metrics required for your monitoring needs. Focus on core system performance and application KPIs.
        3.  **Disable Collectors (Netdata Configuration):**  In the collector configuration files or `netdata.conf`, disable collectors that are not essential. This is typically done by commenting out or removing the collector's configuration section.
        4.  **Fine-tune Metric Collection (Netdata Configuration):** Within enabled collectors, use Netdata's configuration options (like `allowlist` or `denylist` within collector configurations) to precisely control which metrics are collected. Exclude any metrics deemed sensitive or unnecessary.
        5.  **Restart Netdata (Service Management):** Restart the Netdata service for configuration changes to take effect.
        6.  **Verify Reduced Metrics (Netdata Dashboard/API):** Check the Netdata dashboard and API to confirm that disabled collectors and metrics are no longer being collected and exposed.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unintentionally collecting and exposing sensitive data not required for monitoring.
        *   **Data Leakage through Monitoring Data (Medium Severity):** Minimizes potential data leakage if Netdata is compromised, as less sensitive data is collected.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low, depending on the sensitivity of data previously collected by disabled collectors.
        *   **Data Leakage through Monitoring Data:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low, as less potentially sensitive data is available.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Default Netdata collector configuration is in use.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Need to review and customize Netdata collector configuration in both staging and production environments to disable unnecessary collectors and metrics.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure HTTPS for Netdata Dashboard (Netdata Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_https_for_netdata_dashboard__netdata_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure HTTPS for Netdata Dashboard (Netdata Configuration)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Obtain SSL/TLS Certificates (Certificate Management):** Acquire SSL/TLS certificates for the domain or hostname used for the Netdata dashboard.
        2.  **Configure Netdata for HTTPS (Netdata Configuration):**  Modify Netdata's configuration file (`netdata.conf`) to enable HTTPS. This typically involves:
            *   Specifying the paths to your SSL/TLS certificate and private key within the `[web]` section.
            *   Enabling HTTPS listening (if a separate option exists).
            *   Potentially disabling HTTP listening if only HTTPS access is desired.
        3.  **Test HTTPS Access (Netdata Dashboard):** Verify that the Netdata dashboard is accessible via `https://your-netdata-domain` and that the connection is secure (browser padlock icon). Ensure HTTP access is disabled or redirects to HTTPS (if configured in Netdata or externally).
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Eavesdropping and Data Interception (High Severity):** Without HTTPS, communication is unencrypted, allowing potential interception of sensitive monitoring data.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Without HTTPS, attackers could intercept and modify communication.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Eavesdropping and Data Interception:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible for network traffic to the dashboard.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible for network traffic to the dashboard.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented directly within Netdata. HTTPS is partially implemented *externally* via a reverse proxy in staging.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Direct HTTPS configuration within Netdata is missing in both staging and production. Investigate Netdata's HTTPS configuration options and implement them, or ensure the external reverse proxy HTTPS setup is robust and correctly configured for production.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Netdata Updated to the Latest Version](./mitigation_strategies/keep_netdata_updated_to_the_latest_version.md)
