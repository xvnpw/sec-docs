## Attack Tree Path: [1. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Libraries used by Netdata) [HR] [CR]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__dependency_vulnerabilities__libraries_used_by_netdata___hr___cr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Netdata relies on various third-party libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities and Netdata is not updated, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities.
    *   Attackers scan for known vulnerabilities in the versions of libraries used by Netdata.
    *   Publicly available exploits for these vulnerabilities are used to compromise Netdata.
*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:**
    *   **High Likelihood:**  Dependency vulnerabilities are common, and if Netdata or the underlying system is not regularly patched, the likelihood of exploitable vulnerabilities increases.
    *   **High Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to code execution within the Netdata process, potentially allowing for system compromise.
    *   **Critical Node:**  Compromising dependencies is a common and effective attack vector in modern software.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses [HR]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses__hr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Default/Weak Credentials [HR]:** If authentication is enabled but default or weak credentials are not changed, attackers can easily guess or brute-force access.
        *   Attackers attempt to log in to the Netdata dashboard or API using default usernames and passwords.
        *   Brute-force attacks are used to try common or weak passwords.
    *   **Lack of Authentication (If disabled or misconfigured) [HR] [CR]:** If authentication is disabled or misconfigured, the Netdata dashboard and API become publicly accessible without any login required.
        *   Attackers directly access the Netdata dashboard or API URL without providing any credentials.
*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:**
    *   **High Likelihood:** Misconfigurations related to authentication are common, especially if default settings are not properly reviewed and hardened.
    *   **High Impact:**  Gaining unauthorized access to the Netdata dashboard or API allows attackers to view sensitive metrics, potentially manipulate configurations (if API access is available), and gather reconnaissance information.
    *   **Critical Node:** Unsecured access to the dashboard is a direct path to information leakage and potential further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Configuration Vulnerabilities [HR] [CR]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__configuration_vulnerabilities__hr___cr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Insecure Default Configuration [HR] [CR]:** Netdata's default configuration might not be secure enough for production environments. For example, exposing the dashboard on all interfaces without proper authentication.
        *   Attackers exploit default settings that are not secure, such as exposed ports or lack of authentication.
    *   **Misconfiguration of Access Control [HR]:** Incorrectly configured access control rules can lead to unintended access. For example, overly permissive firewall rules or incorrect Netdata access lists.
        *   Attackers exploit overly permissive access rules or incorrect restrictions to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Unnecessary Features Enabled [HR]:** Enabling features that are not required increases the attack surface. For example, enabling data streaming if it's not needed, which might introduce new vulnerabilities or exposure points.
        *   Attackers leverage features that are not needed but introduce attack surface, such as streaming endpoints.
*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:**
    *   **High Likelihood:** Configuration errors are a leading cause of security vulnerabilities. Default configurations are often designed for ease of use, not maximum security.
    *   **High Impact:** Misconfigurations can directly lead to information leakage, unauthorized access, and increased attack surface.
    *   **Critical Node:** Configuration is fundamental to security, and vulnerabilities here can have wide-ranging consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks against Netdata [HR]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__denial_of_service__dos__attacks_against_netdata__hr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (CPU, Memory, Network) [HR]:** Attackers can send a large volume of metrics to Netdata, overwhelming its resources and causing performance degradation or crashes.
        *   Attackers send excessive metrics to overload the Netdata agent, consuming CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.
    *   **Crash Netdata Agent [HR]:** Attackers can send malformed data or exploit specific conditions to crash the Netdata agent, disrupting monitoring.
        *   Attackers send malformed data packets or crafted requests that trigger unhandled exceptions or errors in Netdata, leading to crashes.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **High Likelihood:** DoS attacks are relatively easy to execute, requiring minimal skill and effort. Sending large amounts of data or malformed packets is straightforward.
    *   **Medium Impact:** While DoS attacks against Netdata might not directly compromise the application's data, they can disrupt monitoring capabilities, mask other attacks, and potentially cause instability in the system being monitored.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Information Leakage via Netdata [HR] [CR]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__information_leakage_via_netdata__hr___cr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Metrics [HR] [CR]:** Netdata collects a vast amount of metrics. If not properly configured, it can inadvertently expose sensitive information like API keys, passwords in process arguments, internal network details, or business logic information.
        *   Netdata collects and exposes sensitive data as metrics, such as application secrets, internal network IPs, system configuration details, or business-related data.
    *   **Unsecured Netdata Dashboard Access [HR] [CR]:** If the Netdata dashboard is publicly accessible or weakly protected, attackers can gain access to all the collected metrics.
        *   **Publicly Accessible Dashboard (No Authentication) [HR] [CR]:** Dashboard is accessible from the internet without any login.
        *   **Weakly Protected Dashboard (Basic Authentication only) [HR]:** Basic authentication is vulnerable to brute-force and bypasses.
        *   **Dashboard Accessible on Internal Network without Proper Segmentation [HR]:** Dashboard is accessible from compromised internal network segments.
    *   **Data Streaming Exposure [HR]:** If data streaming is enabled and not secured, attackers can intercept and access real-time metrics.
        *   **Unsecured Streaming Endpoint [HR]:** Streaming data is accessible without authentication or encryption.
        *   **Streaming Data Contains Sensitive Information [HR]:** Streaming data exposes more detailed or raw metrics than intended.
    *   **Logs and Debug Information Leakage [HR]:** Verbose logging or accessible log files can expose sensitive data.
        *   **Verbose Logging Exposing Sensitive Data [HR]:** Logs contain sensitive information due to excessive logging levels.
        *   **Log Files Accessible to Unauthorized Users [HR]:** Log files are stored in world-readable locations or accessible via web server.
*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:**
    *   **High Likelihood:**  Netdata's default behavior is to collect a wide range of metrics, and misconfigurations in access control and logging are common.
    *   **High Impact:** Information leakage can lead to credential compromise, reconnaissance for further attacks, exposure of business secrets, and violation of confidentiality.
    *   **Critical Node:** Information leakage is a significant security risk and can be a stepping stone for more severe attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Netdata as a Stepping Stone for Further Attacks [CR]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__netdata_as_a_stepping_stone_for_further_attacks__cr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Initial Access via Netdata Vulnerability [CR]:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Netdata itself to gain initial access to the system.
        *   **Exploit Netdata to gain initial foothold on the system [CR]:** Use code execution or other vulnerabilities in Netdata to get shell access.
    *   **Leverage Information from Netdata for Reconnaissance [HR]:** Attackers use information gathered from Netdata's exposed metrics to map the network, identify services, and find vulnerabilities in other systems.
        *   Use exposed metrics to map network, identify services, and find vulnerabilities.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Netdata Host [HR]:** Once Netdata is compromised, attackers can use it as a pivot point to move laterally within the network.
        *   **Exploit Weaknesses in Host OS from Compromised Netdata [HR]:** After compromising Netdata, exploit OS vulnerabilities for privilege escalation on the Netdata host.
        *   **Credential Harvesting from Netdata Host [HR]:** Extract credentials stored on the Netdata host (e.g., SSH keys, API tokens) to access other systems.
*   **Why Critical:**
    *   **Critical Node:** Even if Netdata itself doesn't directly hold sensitive application data, compromising it can provide a valuable foothold for attackers to launch further attacks against the application and the wider infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Netdata Installation [CR]:](./attack_tree_paths/7__supply_chain_attacks_targeting_netdata_installation__cr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Compromised Netdata Packages [CR]:** Attackers compromise the Netdata package distribution channels or create malicious packages and trick users into installing them.
        *   Install malicious Netdata packages from unofficial sources.
    *   **Compromised Update Mechanisms [CR]:** Attackers compromise Netdata's update mechanism to inject malicious updates.
        *   Exploit vulnerabilities in Netdata's update process to inject malicious updates.
*   **Why Critical:**
