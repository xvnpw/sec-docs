# Attack Surface Analysis for netdata/netdata

## Attack Surface: [1. Unauthenticated Web Interface Access](./attack_surfaces/1__unauthenticated_web_interface_access.md)

*   **Description:** Netdata's web interface, by default, can be accessed without any authentication, exposing metrics to anyone who can reach the Netdata instance.
*   **Netdata Contribution:** Netdata's design prioritizes ease of use and quick setup, leading to unauthenticated access being the default configuration.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as a Netdata server can access the web interface via a browser and view real-time system metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and running processes without any login.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive system and application performance data, aiding reconnaissance for further attacks, potential exposure of business-sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (in environments with sensitive data or accessible networks).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication:** Configure Netdata to require authentication for web interface access using built-in options or reverse proxy authentication.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Place Netdata instances in a restricted network segment, limiting access to authorized users and systems only.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Implement firewall rules to restrict access to the Netdata web interface port (default 19999) to trusted IP addresses or networks.

## Attack Surface: [2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Web Interface](./attack_surfaces/2__cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_web_interface.md)

*   **Description:** Potential vulnerabilities in Netdata's web interface code could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in users' browsers when they access the dashboard.
*   **Netdata Contribution:** The dynamic nature of the dashboard and the display of potentially user-controlled data (like application names, log messages if collected) increase the potential for XSS if input sanitization is insufficient.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a monitored application's name. When an administrator views the Netdata dashboard displaying metrics for this application, the script executes, potentially stealing session cookies or redirecting the administrator to a malicious site.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise of Netdata users (administrators), potential redirection to phishing sites, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of logged-in users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Netdata Updated:** Regularly update Netdata to the latest version to benefit from security patches that address XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** Ensure Netdata developers rigorously sanitize user inputs and properly encode outputs in the web interface to prevent script injection.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy header to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.

## Attack Surface: [3. Privilege Escalation via Netdata Agent Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/3__privilege_escalation_via_netdata_agent_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Netdata agent code, which often runs with root privileges, could be exploited by local attackers to gain root access to the system.
*   **Netdata Contribution:** Netdata agent requires elevated privileges to collect comprehensive system-level metrics, making it a target for privilege escalation if vulnerabilities exist.
*   **Example:** A local attacker with user-level access discovers a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Netdata agent. By exploiting this vulnerability, they can execute arbitrary code with root privileges, gaining full control of the system.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, unauthorized access to all data and resources, potential for further malicious activities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Netdata Updated:**  Immediately apply security updates for Netdata agent to patch known privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Limited):** While Netdata agent needs elevated privileges for full functionality, ensure the agent runs with the minimum necessary privileges possible and avoid granting unnecessary permissions.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct security audits and penetration testing of the Netdata agent to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

## Attack Surface: [4. Collector Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/4__collector_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Netdata collector plugins, especially custom or less-maintained ones, can be exploited to compromise the Netdata agent or the monitored system.
*   **Netdata Contribution:** Netdata's plugin-based architecture, while extensible, increases the attack surface if plugins are not properly vetted and secured.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable collector plugin designed to monitor a specific application contains a command injection vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the plugin's input to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the Netdata agent.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the Netdata agent context, denial of service, information disclosure, potential compromise of monitored applications or systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Official and Well-Maintained Plugins:** Prioritize using official Netdata plugins or plugins from trusted and actively maintained sources.
    *   **Plugin Security Audits:**  If using custom or less common plugins, conduct security audits and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins:**  If possible, configure plugins to run with the minimum necessary privileges and restrict their access to system resources.
    *   **Input Validation in Plugins:** Ensure plugin developers implement robust input validation to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [5. Insecure Streaming/Export Protocols](./attack_surfaces/5__insecure_streamingexport_protocols.md)

*   **Description:** Streaming or exporting metrics data using insecure protocols like unencrypted HTTP exposes data to interception and tampering during transmission.
*   **Netdata Contribution:** Netdata's streaming and exporting features, if not configured securely, can lead to data exposure.
*   **Example:** Netdata is configured to stream metrics to a central monitoring server using unencrypted HTTP. An attacker on the network can intercept the traffic and gain access to sensitive system and application metrics being transmitted.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive metrics data, potential data manipulation, man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Encrypted Protocols:** Configure Netdata to stream and export data using encrypted protocols like HTTPS or TLS.
    *   **Authentication for Streaming/Export:** Implement authentication mechanisms for streaming and export destinations to ensure only authorized systems can receive the data.
    *   **Secure Network Channels:**  Stream and export data over secure network channels like VPNs or encrypted tunnels when transmitting over untrusted networks.

## Attack Surface: [6. Unauthenticated API Access](./attack_surfaces/6__unauthenticated_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** If Netdata's API is enabled without authentication, it provides a programmatic interface to access metrics data without any access control.
*   **Netdata Contribution:** Netdata's API, if enabled and not secured, provides an alternative unauthenticated access point to metrics data.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers that the Netdata API is enabled on a server and accessible without authentication. They can use API calls to programmatically retrieve detailed system metrics, bypassing any web interface access controls that might be in place.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive metrics data, potential for automated data scraping and analysis for malicious purposes.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable API if Not Needed:** If the API is not required, disable it in Netdata's configuration.
    *   **Implement API Authentication:** Configure authentication for the Netdata API to restrict access to authorized users or applications.
    *   **API Access Control:** Implement access control mechanisms to limit API access based on roles or permissions.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the API to mitigate potential denial-of-service attacks and brute-force attempts.
