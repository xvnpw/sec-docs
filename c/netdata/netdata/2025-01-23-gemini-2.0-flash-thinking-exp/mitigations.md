# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for netdata/netdata

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Authentication for Netdata Web UI and API](./mitigation_strategies/implement_authentication_for_netdata_web_ui_and_api.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Authentication for Netdata Web UI and API.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Authentication Method:** Decide on an authentication method supported by Netdata or compatible with your setup. Netdata supports basic authentication directly. For more robust solutions, consider using a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) with authentication mechanisms that integrate with your existing identity management system.
    2.  **Configure Netdata (Basic Auth):** If using Netdata's basic authentication, edit `netdata.conf` in the `[web]` section.  Enable authentication by setting `web files owner` and `web files group` to appropriate user and group. Configure `htpasswd file = /path/to/.htpasswd` to point to your password file. Create the `.htpasswd` file using the `htpasswd` utility.
    3.  **Configure Reverse Proxy (Recommended for advanced auth):** If using a reverse proxy, configure it to handle authentication (e.g., using `auth_basic` or `auth_request` directives in Nginx). The reverse proxy should then forward authenticated requests to Netdata's backend port (default 19999). Ensure the reverse proxy is properly configured to verify user credentials before forwarding requests to Netdata.
    4.  **Test Authentication:** Verify that accessing the Netdata web UI or API prompts for credentials and only allows access with valid credentials based on your chosen method.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Monitoring Data (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive system and application metrics exposed by Netdata.
    *   **Data Manipulation via API (Medium Severity):** Protects against unauthorized modification of Netdata configurations or actions triggered through the API.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduced risk of unauthorized access and data manipulation by enforcing credential-based access control directly within or in front of Netdata.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic authentication is configured on the staging environment Netdata instances.
    *   **Location:** Staging environment Netdata configurations (`netdata.conf` files on staging servers).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in production environment. Production Netdata instances are currently accessible without authentication. Reverse proxy based authentication is not yet implemented in any environment for Netdata.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Exposed Metrics](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_exposed_metrics.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Exposed Metrics.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Default Metrics:** Examine the default metrics collected by Netdata. Understand the data collected by each Netdata plugin (CPU, memory, disk, network, applications, etc.). Consult Netdata plugin documentation for details.
    2.  **Identify Sensitive Metrics:** Identify metrics collected by Netdata that could potentially expose sensitive information about your application or infrastructure.
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary Plugins:** Disable Netdata plugins that collect metrics you don't require or that collect sensitive data unnecessarily. Edit `netdata.conf` and comment out or remove plugin configurations in the `[plugins]` section. Restart Netdata after changes.
    4.  **Configure Plugin Metric Collection:** For essential plugins, configure them to collect only necessary metrics. Many Netdata plugins offer configuration options to filter or limit collected data (e.g., exclude specific processes, databases, or network interfaces). Refer to individual Netdata plugin documentation for configuration details within `netdata.conf`.
    5.  **Regularly Review Metrics Collection Configuration:** Periodically review the configured metrics collection in `netdata.conf` to ensure it remains minimal and aligned with monitoring needs, and that no new sensitive metrics are inadvertently being collected by Netdata.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces the risk of inadvertently exposing sensitive information through Netdata metrics to unauthorized users.
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface (Low Severity):** Minimizing collected metrics reduces the amount of potentially exploitable data available through Netdata.
*   **Impact:** Moderately Reduced risk of information disclosure by limiting the scope of data collected and exposed by Netdata.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic review of default Netdata plugins has been done, and some unnecessary plugins (like `sensors` plugin in cloud environments) have been disabled.
    *   **Location:** `netdata.conf` files on all Netdata instances.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Detailed review and configuration of individual Netdata plugin metric collection is missing. Specific sensitive metrics within enabled Netdata plugins have not been systematically identified and disabled or filtered.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Features and Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_features_and_plugins.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unnecessary Features and Plugins.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Unused Features:** Review Netdata's features and plugins. Identify any features or plugins that are not actively used or required for your monitoring purposes.
    2.  **Disable Plugins:** Disable unused Netdata plugins by commenting out or removing their configuration sections in `netdata.conf` within the `[plugins]` section. Restart Netdata after making changes.
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary Web UI Features (if configurable):** If Netdata offers configuration options to disable specific features within the web UI (beyond plugins), explore and disable any features that are not needed and could potentially increase the attack surface. (Note: Netdata's web UI customization options might be limited).
    4.  **Regularly Review Enabled Features:** Periodically review the enabled Netdata features and plugins to ensure only necessary components are active and to identify any newly introduced features that might be unnecessary or pose a security risk if enabled by default in future Netdata updates.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface (Low to Medium Severity):** Disabling unnecessary features and plugins reduces the overall attack surface of the Netdata installation. Fewer active components mean fewer potential vulnerabilities to exploit.
    *   **Resource Consumption (Low Severity):** Disabling unused plugins can also reduce resource consumption by Netdata, improving performance and stability.
*   **Impact:** Slightly Reduced attack surface and potentially improved performance by minimizing the active components within Netdata.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some obviously unnecessary plugins (like `sensors` in cloud environments) are disabled.
    *   **Location:** `netdata.conf` files on all Netdata instances.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A comprehensive review of all enabled Netdata plugins and features to identify and disable truly unnecessary components is missing.  No proactive process exists to review and disable new features introduced in Netdata updates if they are not required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable HTTPS for Netdata Web UI](./mitigation_strategies/enable_https_for_netdata_web_ui.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable HTTPS for Netdata Web UI.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use a Reverse Proxy:** Deploy a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) in front of Netdata to handle HTTPS termination. Netdata itself does not directly handle HTTPS.
    2.  **Obtain SSL/TLS Certificate:** Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate for your Netdata web UI domain or IP address. You can use Let's Encrypt for free certificates or use certificates from your organization's certificate authority.
    3.  **Configure Reverse Proxy for HTTPS:** Configure the reverse proxy to listen on port 443 (HTTPS) and use the obtained SSL/TLS certificate. Configure the proxy to forward requests to Netdata's backend port (19999) over HTTP.
    4.  **Enforce HTTPS Redirection:** Configure the reverse proxy to redirect HTTP requests (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443) to ensure all web UI access is encrypted.
    5.  **Strong TLS Configuration:** Configure the reverse proxy with strong TLS settings, including modern protocols (TLS 1.2 or 1.3), strong cipher suites, and disable insecure protocols like SSLv3 and TLS 1.0/1.1 in the reverse proxy configuration.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Interception (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents interception of sensitive monitoring data transmitted between the user's browser and the Netdata web UI.
    *   **Credential Theft (Medium Severity):** Protects against interception of authentication credentials if basic authentication is used for the Netdata web UI.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduced risk of data interception and credential theft for web UI access by encrypting communication with HTTPS.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. HTTPS is enabled for the staging environment Netdata web UI via a reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt certificates.
    *   **Location:** Staging environment reverse proxy configurations (Nginx configuration files).
*   **Missing Implementation:** HTTPS is not yet implemented for production environment Netdata web UI.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Netdata Resource Usage for Anomalies](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_netdata_resource_usage_for_anomalies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Monitor Netdata Resource Usage for Anomalies.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Netdata Metrics:** Use a separate monitoring system (or even Netdata itself, if feasible and safe) to monitor Netdata's own resource consumption metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic).
    2.  **Establish Baselines:** Establish baseline resource usage patterns for Netdata under normal operating conditions.
    3.  **Set Alert Thresholds:** Define alert thresholds for Netdata's resource usage metrics based on the established baselines. Set alerts to trigger when resource usage deviates significantly from normal patterns.
    4.  **Investigate Anomalies:** When alerts are triggered, promptly investigate the cause of the anomalous resource usage. This could indicate a security issue (e.g., a denial-of-service attack targeting Netdata, or a compromised Netdata instance being used for malicious activities) or a misconfiguration.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Netdata (Medium Severity):** Detects potential DoS attacks targeting Netdata by monitoring for unusual resource spikes.
    *   **Compromised Netdata Instance (Medium Severity):**  Anomalous resource usage could indicate that a Netdata instance has been compromised and is being used for malicious purposes (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, botnet activity).
*   **Impact:** Moderately Reduced risk of undetected DoS attacks and compromised Netdata instances by providing early warning signs through resource usage monitoring.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic infrastructure monitoring includes CPU and memory usage for servers, which indirectly covers Netdata's resource usage.
    *   **Location:** General infrastructure monitoring system dashboards and alerting rules.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Dedicated monitoring and alerting specifically focused on Netdata's resource usage metrics is missing. No specific baselines or thresholds are defined for Netdata's resource consumption.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Run Netdata with Least Privilege](./mitigation_strategies/run_netdata_with_least_privilege.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Run Netdata with Least Privilege.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Dedicated User:** Create a dedicated system user account specifically for running the Netdata process. Avoid running Netdata as the `root` user.
    2.  **Configure User and Group:** Ensure Netdata is configured to run as the dedicated user and group. This is often configured during the Netdata installation process or can be adjusted in systemd service files or init scripts.
    3.  **Restrict File System Permissions:**  Restrict file system permissions for Netdata's configuration files, data directories, and log files to only allow access to the dedicated Netdata user and authorized administrators.
    4.  **Avoid Unnecessary Privileges:**  Do not grant the Netdata user any unnecessary privileges beyond what is required for its monitoring functions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium to High Severity):** If Netdata is compromised, running it with least privilege limits the potential damage an attacker can cause. An attacker gaining control of a non-privileged Netdata process will have limited access to the system compared to if Netdata was running as root.
    *   **System-Wide Impact of Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the potential impact of vulnerabilities in Netdata itself. A vulnerability in a non-privileged process is less likely to lead to system-wide compromise.
*   **Impact:** Moderately Reduced risk of privilege escalation and system-wide impact in case of Netdata compromise by limiting the privileges of the Netdata process.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Netdata is generally installed and run as a non-root user by default in most standard installation methods.
    *   **Location:** System service configurations (systemd unit files, init scripts) and user/group configurations on servers.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit verification and hardening of file system permissions for Netdata's configuration and data directories to strictly adhere to the least privilege principle is missing. Regular audits to ensure Netdata continues to run with minimal necessary privileges are not in place.
