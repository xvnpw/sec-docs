## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Netdata Vulnerabilities [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_netdata_vulnerabilities__cn_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This branch represents the exploitation of software flaws within Netdata itself.
*   **Sub-Vector: Known CVEs [CN] [HR] (e.g., CVE-2021-41817):**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities with known exploits. CVE-2021-41817, for example, allowed unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Assuming patching is not immediate, but eventually happens)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Depends on the specific CVE)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediate and regular patching of Netdata.
        *   Implementation of a vulnerability scanning process.
        *   Use of a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Netdata's Legitimate Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_netdata's_legitimate_functionality.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This branch focuses on leveraging Netdata's intended features in unintended or malicious ways.
*   **Sub-Vector: Data Exposure [CN] [HR]:**
    *   **Description:** Accessing sensitive system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network) exposed by a misconfigured or unprotected Netdata instance.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (If Netdata is misconfigured or exposed)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strict access control to the Netdata dashboard.
        *   Strong authentication (passwords, MFA).
        *   Configuration to listen only on specific IPs/interfaces.
        *   Use of a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) with authentication.
        *   Disabling unnecessary features and plugins.
        *   Regular review of exposed metrics.
* **Sub-Vector: Expose API Keys [CN] [HR]:**
    *   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to Netdata API keys, allowing for full control over the Netdata API.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If keys are mishandled)
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure storage and management of API keys.
        *   Avoidance of hardcoding keys in configuration or scripts.
        *   Use of environment variables or a secrets management system.
        *   Regular rotation of API keys.
