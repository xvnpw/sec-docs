# Threat Model Analysis for netdata/netdata

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to Netdata Dashboard](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_netdata_dashboard.md)

*   **Threat:**  Unauthenticated Access to Netdata Dashboard

    *   **Description:** An attacker accesses the Netdata web dashboard without providing any credentials.  This happens if authentication is disabled, misconfigured, or bypassed.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive system and application metrics, revealing details about infrastructure, running processes, resource usage, and potentially application-specific data. This information facilitates further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `web/` directory (web server functionality), `http_parser.c` (if HTTP parsing vulnerabilities exist), configuration files (`netdata.conf`, `stream.conf` if relevant).
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical (if sensitive data is exposed) or High (if only basic system metrics are exposed).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication in `netdata.conf`. Use strong passwords.
        *   **Strongly Recommended:** Configure a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) with authentication and authorization in front of Netdata.
        *   Use HTTPS with a valid, trusted certificate.
        *   Restrict access to the Netdata port (default: 19999) via firewall rules, allowing only authorized IPs.
        *   Regularly audit `netdata.conf` for misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Netdata Dashboard](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_netdata_dashboard.md)

*   **Threat:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Netdata Dashboard

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the Netdata dashboard, potentially via a crafted URL, a vulnerable plugin, or a compromised data source.  This code executes in other users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:**  Session hijacking, credential theft, redirection to malicious sites, dashboard defacement, or arbitrary code execution within the user's browser.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `web/` directory (HTML/JavaScript rendering), plugins generating HTML output without proper sanitization (especially custom plugins), potentially the data collection engine if it doesn't sanitize data before passing it to the web interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Netdata up-to-date; the Netdata team addresses XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Carefully review and sanitize custom plugins generating HTML. Use proper output encoding.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) header to restrict resource loading sources (via a reverse proxy).
        *   Configure a reverse proxy to add security headers like `X-XSS-Protection` and `X-Content-Type-Options`.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Plugins](./threats/command_injection_via_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:**  Command Injection via Plugins

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a Netdata plugin (especially custom plugins) to inject arbitrary shell commands. This occurs if the plugin uses unsanitized user input when constructing shell commands.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary code on the host with the Netdata user's privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Plugins executing external commands (`charts.d/`, `python.d/`, `node.d/` plugins, custom plugins), specifically functions handling external input and constructing shell commands.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid shell commands in plugins whenever possible.** Use Netdata functions or libraries.
        *   If unavoidable, **meticulously sanitize and validate all user input** before using it in a command. Use parameterization/escaping.
        *   Run Netdata as a non-root user with limited privileges.
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom plugins for command injection. Use static analysis and penetration testing.
        *   Consider a language-specific security linter (e.g., Bandit for Python).

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via API](./threats/information_disclosure_via_api.md)

*   **Threat:**  Information Disclosure via API

    *   **Description:** An attacker accesses the Netdata API without proper authentication/authorization, retrieving sensitive system/application metrics.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information, similar to unauthenticated dashboard access.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `web/` directory (API endpoints), `http_parser.c` (if HTTP parsing vulnerabilities exist), configuration files related to API access.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Require authentication for API access** (in `netdata.conf` or, preferably, via a reverse proxy).
        *   Use API keys or tokens for authentication.
        *   Restrict API access to specific IPs/networks using firewall rules.
        *   Limit API access scope to only necessary data.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via setuid/setgid binaries](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_setuidsetgid_binaries.md)

* **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via setuid/setgid binaries

    * **Description:** If Netdata or its helper binaries are incorrectly configured with setuid/setgid bits, vulnerabilities in those binaries could be exploited for privilege escalation.
    * **Impact:** An attacker could gain root or other privileged user access.
    * **Affected Component:** Any Netdata-related binary that is setuid or setgid (check with `find / -perm +6000 -type f 2>/dev/null`). This is *not* the default or recommended.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Do not run Netdata as root.**
        * Ensure no Netdata binaries have unnecessary setuid/setgid permissions. Remove them if found.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege.

## Threat: [Data Spoofing via Stream API](./threats/data_spoofing_via_stream_api.md)

* **Threat:** Data Spoofing via Stream API

    * **Description:** When using Netdata's streaming to a central instance, an attacker could intercept/modify the data stream or send forged data.
    * **Impact:** Inaccurate data in the central Netdata instance, causing incorrect alerts and misleading information.
    * **Affected Component:** `daemon/` (streaming functionality), `stream.conf`, network communication between Netdata instances.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use TLS encryption for the streaming connection (configured in `stream.conf`).
        * Use API keys for authentication between Netdata instances.
        * Implement network segmentation to isolate Netdata streaming traffic.
