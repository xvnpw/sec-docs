# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for netdata/netdata

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Netdata's `[web]` Section for Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/configure_netdata's___web___section_for_access_control.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** **Configure Netdata's `[web]` Section for Access Control**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Edit `netdata.conf`:** Open the Netdata configuration file (`netdata.conf`).
        2.  **Locate the `[web]` Section:** Find the section that controls web access.
        3.  **Set `mode = proxy`:**  If using a reverse proxy (which is *strongly* recommended), ensure `mode = proxy` is set. This tells Netdata to trust headers like `X-Forwarded-For`.
        4.  **Use `allow from` (Optional, Secondary):**  *In addition to* external firewall rules, you can use `allow from = <IP_ADDRESS_OR_NETWORK>` to specify allowed IP addresses or networks.  This is a *secondary* control and should *not* be relied upon as the primary access control mechanism.
        5.  **Set `max clients`:** Use `max clients = <NUMBER>` to limit the maximum number of concurrent client connections.  Choose a reasonable value based on expected usage.
        6.  **Disable Unnecessary API Endpoints (Advanced):** If certain API endpoints are not required, disable them through configuration (refer to Netdata documentation for specific endpoint control).
        7.  **Restart Netdata:** After making changes, restart the Netdata service for them to take effect.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Dashboard and API:** (Severity: **Medium** - when used as a *secondary* control, in conjunction with a reverse proxy and firewall)
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** (Severity: **Medium**) - `max clients` helps limit the impact.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Provides an additional layer of defense, but should *not* be the primary control.
        *   **DoS Attacks:** `max clients` helps mitigate, but external rate limiting is also crucial.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `mode = proxy` is set.
        *   `max clients` is set to 50.
        *   `allow from` is *not* currently used, relying on the external firewall.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Review and potentially disable unnecessary API endpoints.  This requires a detailed understanding of the application's API usage. Ticket #1111.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Customize Collectors; Disable Unnecessary Ones](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_customize_collectors;_disable_unnecessary_ones.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** **Review and Customize Collectors; Disable Unnecessary Ones**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Inventory Default Collectors:** List all default collectors enabled in Netdata.  This can often be done by inspecting the `netdata.conf` file or using Netdata's API.
        2.  **Assess Necessity:** For each collector, determine if it's *strictly* required for your monitoring needs.  Consider the specific services and applications running on the monitored system.
        3.  **Disable Unnecessary Collectors:** In `netdata.conf`, comment out or remove the configuration sections for any collectors that are not essential.  This reduces the amount of data collected and minimizes the potential attack surface.
        4.  **Review Configuration of Remaining Collectors:** For collectors that *are* needed, carefully review their configuration options.  Look for settings that might inadvertently expose sensitive data.
        5.  **Restart Netdata:** After making changes, restart the Netdata service.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Exposure via Misconfigured Data Collection:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Reduces the risk of unintentionally exposing sensitive information.
        *   **Resource Consumption (minor):** (Severity: **Low**) - Disabling unnecessary collectors can slightly reduce Netdata's resource usage.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Exposure:** Risk reduced to **Low**.  Minimizes the amount of potentially sensitive data collected.
        *   **Resource Consumption:** Minor improvement in resource usage.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   A review of default collectors was conducted during initial setup.
        *   Several unnecessary collectors were disabled in `netdata.conf`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A periodic review of enabled collectors should be added to the maintenance schedule. Ticket #999.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Write Access (Read-Only Mode)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_write_access__read-only_mode_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** **Disable Write Access (Read-Only Mode)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Verify Read-Only Mode:** Ensure that Netdata is running in read-only mode.  This is typically the default configuration.  Check the `netdata.conf` file and look for any settings that might enable write access.
        2.  **Restrict API Access (if write access is *absolutely* required):** If, for a very specific and well-justified reason, write access *must* be enabled, restrict it to specific API endpoints and require *very* strong authentication and authorization (handled externally via the reverse proxy).
        3.  **Audit Write Operations (if write access is enabled):** If write access is enabled, ensure that detailed auditing of all write operations is also enabled (refer to Netdata documentation for auditing configuration).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Tampering:** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents unauthorized modification of system configurations or data.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced to **Very Low** (if write access is disabled) or **Low** (if write access is strictly controlled and audited).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Netdata is running in read-only mode.  Write access is *not* enabled.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   None. The current configuration is considered secure.

## Mitigation Strategy: [System Resource Limits (cgroups/ulimit) for Netdata Process](./mitigation_strategies/system_resource_limits__cgroupsulimit__for_netdata_process.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** **System Resource Limits (cgroups/ulimit) for Netdata Process**
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **cgroups (Recommended for Linux):**
            *   Create a dedicated cgroup for the Netdata process.
            *   Configure limits for CPU, memory, and I/O usage within the cgroup. This prevents Netdata from consuming excessive resources, even under attack.
        2.  **ulimit (Alternative for Linux/Unix):**
            *   Use the `ulimit` command (often configured within the Netdata service startup script or systemd unit file) to set resource limits for the user running the Netdata process (e.g., the `netdata` user).  Limits can be set for things like the number of open files, maximum memory usage, and CPU time.
        3. **Test:** After setting limits, test Netdata under load to ensure the limits are effective and don't negatively impact normal operation.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Prevents Netdata from consuming all system resources, even if the Netdata service itself is targeted.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS Attacks:** Risk reduced to **Low**. Limits the impact of a successful DoS attack on the Netdata service.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   System resource limits using `ulimit` are implemented via the systemd service file for Netdata (`/etc/systemd/system/netdata.service`).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   cgroups implementation is planned for a future release to provide more granular resource control. Ticket #456.
