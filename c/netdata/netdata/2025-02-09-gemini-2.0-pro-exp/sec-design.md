# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide real-time, high-fidelity system, application, and service monitoring.
*   Offer an intuitive and interactive user interface for visualizing and analyzing performance data.
*   Be easily deployable and require minimal configuration.
*   Support a wide range of systems and applications out-of-the-box.
*   Be open-source and community-driven.
*   Minimize resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
*   Provide a distributed architecture for scalability and high availability.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive system and application metrics.
*   Denial-of-service attacks impacting the availability of the monitoring service.
*   Injection attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in the web interface or data processing pipeline.
*   Compromise of the Netdata agent leading to unauthorized control over monitored systems.
*   Supply chain attacks targeting the Netdata build and distribution process.
*   Reputational damage due to security incidents or data privacy violations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for web dashboard access (configurable).
*   security control: Data encryption in transit using TLS (configurable).
*   security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing (mentioned on website and in community discussions).
*   security control: Secure communication between parent and child nodes using TLS (configurable).
*   security control: Support for external authentication providers (e.g., through reverse proxies).
*   security control: Built-in web server with limited functionality to reduce attack surface.
*   security control: Use of memory-safe languages (primarily C, with some components in other languages).
*   security control: Community involvement in identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Default configuration may not be fully secure (requires user configuration for optimal security).
*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries and dependencies (potential for supply chain vulnerabilities).
*   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in custom plugins and integrations.
*   accepted risk: Exposure of monitoring data to users with network access to the Netdata web interface (mitigated by RBAC and TLS).

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement mandatory authentication for all web dashboard access, even for read-only views.
*   security control: Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   security control: Provide detailed security hardening guides and best practices documentation.
*   security control: Implement regular vulnerability scanning and automated security testing in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   security control: Introduce a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all releases to improve supply chain security.
*   security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) and other web security headers to mitigate XSS and other web-based attacks.
*   security control: Provide options for data encryption at rest.
*   security control: Implement anomaly detection and alerting for suspicious activity.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All users accessing the web dashboard must be authenticated.
    *   Support for strong authentication mechanisms, including MFA.
    *   Integration with existing identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth 2.0).
*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control to restrict access to specific metrics and features based on user roles.
    *   Ability to define custom roles and permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user inputs, including those from plugins and external sources, must be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Strict validation of data types and formats.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for data encryption in transit and at rest (where applicable).
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Regular review and update of cryptographic libraries and configurations.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code changes to the source code repository (GitHub).
2.  The CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) is triggered by code commits or pull requests.
3.  The build server within the CI/CD pipeline checks out the code.
4.  Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are executed to analyze the code for potential vulnerabilities.
5.  Dependency checks are performed to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
6.  The Netdata application is built, and a container image is created.
7.  The container image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

Security Controls:

*   security control: Use of GitHub Actions for automated builds and testing.
*   security control: Integration of SAST tools (e.g., CodeQL, SonarQube) into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   security control: Dependency scanning to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (e.g., using Dependabot or similar tools).
*   security control: Use of signed commits and releases.
*   security control: Container image scanning for vulnerabilities before pushing to the registry.
*   security control: Regular updates to build tools and dependencies.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Real-time system and application monitoring.
*   Alerting and notification for critical events.
*   Data visualization and analysis.

Data Sensitivity:

*   System metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic): Potentially sensitive, could reveal information about system configuration and workload.
*   Application metrics (request rates, error rates, response times): Potentially sensitive, could reveal information about application performance and usage patterns.
*   User data (usernames, IP addresses): Sensitive, requires protection under privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
*   Configuration data (API keys, passwords): Highly sensitive, requires strong protection.
