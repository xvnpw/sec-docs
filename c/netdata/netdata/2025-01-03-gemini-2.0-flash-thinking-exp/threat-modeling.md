# Threat Model Analysis for netdata/netdata

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive System Metrics via Unauthenticated Web Interface](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_system_metrics_via_unauthenticated_web_interface.md)

**Description:** An attacker could access the Netdata web interface (typically running on port 19999 by default) if it's exposed without any authentication mechanism. They could browse real-time and historical system metrics, including CPU usage, memory consumption, network activity, and disk I/O.

**Impact:**  Reveals sensitive information about the system's health, performance, and potentially running processes. This information can be used for reconnaissance, identifying vulnerabilities, or planning further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Netdata Web Interface (specifically the HTTP server serving the dashboard)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Netdata web interface (e.g., HTTP Basic Auth, OAuth 2.0).
*   Restrict access to the Netdata port (19999 by default) using firewalls or network segmentation to only trusted networks or IP addresses.
*   Disable the web interface entirely if it's not needed.

## Threat: [Exposure of Application-Specific Metrics Containing Sensitive Data](./threats/exposure_of_application-specific_metrics_containing_sensitive_data.md)

**Description:** If applications expose custom metrics to Netdata that contain sensitive business data (e.g., transaction values, user IDs, internal service names) and access to Netdata is not properly controlled, attackers could view this data.

**Impact:**  Direct exposure of confidential business information, potentially leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Netdata Agent (data collection modules, custom exporters), Netdata Web Interface

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and sanitize any custom metrics before exposing them to Netdata. Avoid including sensitive data directly in metric names or values.
*   Implement strict access controls for the Netdata web interface and API.
*   Consider alternative methods for monitoring sensitive application data that do not involve direct exposure through a general monitoring tool.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Netdata Agent or its Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_netdata_agent_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Like any software, Netdata may contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service on the system running the Netdata agent.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the system running the Netdata agent, potentially leading to data breaches, system instability, or further attacks on the network.

**Affected Component:** Netdata Agent (core functionality, specific modules, or dependencies)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Netdata updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
*   Regularly review Netdata's release notes and security advisories.
*   Implement a vulnerability scanning process to identify and address potential weaknesses.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Injection](./threats/malicious_plugin_injection.md)

**Description:** Netdata's functionality can be extended through plugins. An attacker could potentially inject a malicious plugin that could execute arbitrary code on the system, exfiltrate data, or disrupt monitoring.

**Impact:**  Full compromise of the system running the Netdata agent, with the potential for data theft, system damage, or use as a foothold for further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Netdata Agent (plugin loading and execution mechanism)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only install plugins from trusted sources.
*   Implement a mechanism for verifying the integrity and authenticity of plugins.
*   Monitor the plugins that are installed and running on the Netdata agent.
*   Consider disabling plugin functionality if it's not strictly necessary.
