# Attack Surface Analysis for netdata/netdata

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Netdata Web Interface](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_netdata_web_interface.md)

**Description:** The Netdata web interface, providing real-time metrics and dashboards, is accessible without any authentication mechanism.

**How Netdata Contributes to Attack Surface:** Netdata inherently includes a built-in web server to display its data. If not configured for authentication, this server is open to anyone who can reach it on the network.

**Example:** An attacker on the same network or with access to the server's port can directly access the `/netdata/` endpoint and view all collected metrics.

**Impact:** Information disclosure (system performance, resource usage, potential application-specific metrics), reconnaissance for further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable Authentication: Configure Netdata to require username and password authentication for accessing the web interface.
* Restrict Network Access: Use firewalls or network segmentation to limit access to the Netdata port (default 19999) to trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
* Use a Reverse Proxy: Place Netdata behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) that handles authentication and authorization before forwarding requests to Netdata.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Netdata API](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_netdata_api.md)

**Description:** The Netdata API, used for programmatically accessing metrics, is accessible without any authentication.

**How Netdata Contributes to Attack Surface:** Netdata provides an API for retrieving collected data. If not secured, this API can be accessed by anyone who can reach the Netdata instance.

**Example:** An attacker can send API requests to retrieve real-time or historical metrics without providing any credentials.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for automated data scraping and analysis for malicious purposes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable API Authentication: Configure Netdata to require authentication (e.g., API keys) for accessing the API endpoints.
* Restrict API Access: Use firewalls or network policies to limit access to the Netdata API to authorized systems or networks.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Netdata Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_netdata_plugins.md)

**Description:** Netdata's plugin system allows for extending its functionality. However, poorly written or malicious plugins can introduce vulnerabilities.

**How Netdata Contributes to Attack Surface:** Netdata's architecture allows for the execution of external scripts and programs through its plugin system. This expands the attack surface if these plugins are not secure.

**Example:** A malicious plugin could be designed to execute arbitrary commands on the server, or a vulnerable plugin could be exploited to gain access to sensitive data.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation, data compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use Only Trusted Plugins: Only install plugins from reputable sources and carefully review their code before deployment.
* Regularly Update Plugins: Keep all installed plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Implement Plugin Sandboxing or Isolation: If possible, explore methods to isolate or sandbox Netdata plugins to limit the impact of a compromised plugin.
* Monitor Plugin Activity: Monitor the behavior of Netdata plugins for any suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Netdata Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_netdata_update_mechanism.md)

**Description:** If the process for updating Netdata is compromised, attackers could potentially distribute malicious updates.

**How Netdata Contributes to Attack Surface:** Netdata's update mechanism, while necessary for patching vulnerabilities, can become an attack vector if not properly secured.

**Example:** An attacker compromises the Netdata update server and pushes a malicious update that installs malware on systems running Netdata.

**Impact:** System compromise, widespread malware distribution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Verify Update Integrity: Ensure that Netdata verifies the integrity and authenticity of updates (e.g., using digital signatures).
* Monitor Update Processes: Monitor the Netdata update process for any unusual activity.
* Use Official Repositories: Obtain Netdata installations and updates from official and trusted sources.
