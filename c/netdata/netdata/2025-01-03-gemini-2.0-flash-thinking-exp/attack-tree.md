## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Netdata Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_netdata_vulnerabilities_[high_risk_path].md)

**1. Exploit Netdata Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target known or unknown security flaws within the Netdata application itself. These vulnerabilities can exist in the web interface, the API, collector plugins, or the core Netdata codebase.
* **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the Netdata server and potentially the underlying host system, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or disrupt service.

**   1.1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL NODE]:**

    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities that allow them to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting Netdata. This is often achieved through injection flaws in the web interface or API, or through vulnerabilities in how Netdata processes data.
    * **Impact:**  This is the most critical outcome, granting the attacker full control over the Netdata server and potentially the application it monitors. They can install malware, steal data, or pivot to other systems.
    * **   1.1.1. Exploit Unpatched Netdata Vulnerability:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Netdata that have not been patched on the target system. They use readily available exploits or develop their own based on vulnerability details.
        * **Impact:**  Allows for immediate compromise if the system is vulnerable.

**   1.2. Information Disclosure [CRITICAL NODE]:**

    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information managed by Netdata, such as system metrics, configuration details, or potentially even credentials.
    * **Impact:** While not as immediately damaging as RCE, information disclosure can provide attackers with valuable insights for planning further attacks or gaining access to other systems.
    * **   1.2.1. Access Sensitive Data via Netdata API [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit missing or weak authentication and authorization mechanisms on the Netdata API endpoints. This allows them to bypass security controls and directly access sensitive data exposed through the API.
        * **Impact:**  Exposes system metrics, potentially revealing application secrets, performance characteristics, and other sensitive information that can be used for further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Netdata Functionality [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_netdata_functionality_[high_risk_path].md)

**2. Abuse Netdata Functionality [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

* **Attack Vector:** Instead of exploiting vulnerabilities, attackers misuse the intended features of Netdata for malicious purposes. This involves manipulating data or configurations to negatively impact the application or gain unauthorized access.

**   2.1. Metric Injection/Manipulation:**

    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject false or misleading metrics into Netdata, or intercept and alter legitimate metrics before they reach Netdata.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to incorrect application behavior if the application relies on Netdata metrics for decision-making. It can also mislead monitoring systems and hide malicious activity.
    * **   2.1.1. Inject False Metrics [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers send crafted metric data to the Netdata API, bypassing any validation or authentication if not properly implemented.
        * **Impact:**  Can directly influence application logic if it depends on these metrics, leading to incorrect actions, denial of service, or security bypasses.

**   2.2. Configuration Tampering [CRITICAL NODE]:**

    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers modify Netdata's configuration to weaken security, introduce backdoors, or exfiltrate data.
    * **Impact:** Can severely compromise the security posture of the Netdata instance and potentially the monitored application.
    * **   2.2.1. Modify Netdata Configuration Remotely [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the Netdata API or web interface, or leverage weak authentication credentials to remotely change Netdata's configuration.
        * **Impact:**  Allows attackers to disable security features, add malicious collector plugins to execute code, or redirect data to attacker-controlled servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Host System via Netdata [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_host_system_via_netdata_[high_risk_path].md)

**3. Compromise Host System via Netdata [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage Netdata's access to system resources to compromise the underlying host operating system. This is particularly concerning if Netdata runs with elevated privileges.

**   3.1. Exploit Netdata's Access to System Resources [CRITICAL NODE]:**

    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within Netdata to leverage its existing permissions and access to the file system or network.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to full compromise of the host system, allowing attackers to install malware, access sensitive files, or pivot to other systems on the network.
    * **   3.1.1. Leverage Netdata's Permissions for File System Access:**
        * **Attack Vector:** If Netdata runs with elevated privileges (e.g., root), attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to make Netdata read or write arbitrary files on the system.
        * **Impact:** Allows attackers to read sensitive configuration files, inject malicious code into system binaries, or create new user accounts with administrative privileges.
