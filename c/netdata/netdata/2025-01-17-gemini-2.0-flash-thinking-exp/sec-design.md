## 4. Data Flow

Understanding the movement of data within Netdata is critical for identifying potential security vulnerabilities.

### 4.1. Metric Collection

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Monitored System"
        A["'Netdata Agent'"]
        B["'Data Sources'"]
        C["'Collectors/Plugins'"]
        D["'Internal Time-Series DB'"]
    end

    B -- "'Provide Metrics'" --> C
    C -- "'Collect & Format Metrics'" --> A
    A -- "'Store Metrics'" --> D
```

*   Data Sources generate raw performance and health metrics.
*   Collectors and Plugins, managed by the Netdata Agent, interact with these Data Sources using specific protocols or methods (e.g., reading `/proc` files, querying APIs).
*   Collectors format and normalize the raw data into a consistent metric format.
*   The Netdata Agent stores these processed metrics in its internal, in-memory time-series database.

### 4.2. Local User Access

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["'User (Web Browser)'"]
    B["'Netdata Agent'"]
    C["'Internal Time-Series DB'"]

    A -- "'HTTP Request for UI & Data'" --> B
    B -- "'Query Metrics'" --> C
    C -- "'Return Metric Data'" --> B
    B -- "'Render UI with Data'" --> A
```

*   A user accesses the Netdata Agent's web interface by navigating to the Agent's IP address and port (default: 19999) in their web browser.
*   The browser sends HTTP requests to the Netdata Agent for the user interface files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and for metric data via API calls.
*   The Netdata Agent receives these requests and queries its internal time-series database for the requested metrics.
*   The Agent then sends the metric data back to the browser, where the JavaScript application renders the visualizations.

### 4.3. Cloud Integration (Optional)

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Monitored System"
        A["'Netdata Agent'"]
    end
    B["'Netdata Cloud'"]
    C["'Cloud Database'"]
    D["'User (Web Browser)'"]

    A -- "'Securely Stream Metrics (HTTPS)'" --> B
    B -- "'Store Metrics'" --> C
    D -- "'Request Metrics via Cloud API (HTTPS)'" --> B
    B -- "'Retrieve Metrics'" --> C
    B -- "'Send Metrics to User'" --> D
    B -- "'Send Configuration/Alerts (HTTPS)'" --> A
```

*   When configured, the Netdata Agent establishes a secure (HTTPS) connection to Netdata Cloud.
*   The Agent streams collected metrics to Netdata Cloud over this secure channel.
*   Netdata Cloud stores these metrics in its backend database infrastructure.
*   Users can access and visualize metrics from multiple agents by logging into the Netdata Cloud web interface. Their browsers communicate with Netdata Cloud via HTTPS.
*   Netdata Cloud can send configuration updates and alert definitions to connected agents, also over the secure HTTPS connection.

## 6. Security Considerations

This section expands on the initial security thoughts, providing more specific considerations for threat modeling.

*   **Netdata Agent Exposure and Access Control:**
    *   **Unauthenticated Local Access:** By default, the agent's web interface and API are accessible without authentication on the local host. This relies on the host's security.
    *   **Remote Access:** Enabling remote access to the agent's interface significantly increases the attack surface and requires careful consideration of authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **API Security:** The API endpoints could be targeted for unauthorized data access or manipulation if not properly secured.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Vulnerabilities in the web interface could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  Lack of CSRF protection could allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.
*   **Data Security and Privacy:**
    *   **Sensitive Data in Metrics:** Collected metrics may contain sensitive information (e.g., application-specific data, internal network details).
    *   **Encryption in Transit:** Communication with Netdata Cloud must be encrypted (HTTPS) to protect data confidentiality and integrity.
    *   **Data at Rest (Optional Persistence):** If disk persistence is enabled, the stored metrics need to be protected against unauthorized access.
    *   **Data Retention Policies:**  Considerations for how long metrics are stored and how they are securely disposed of.
*   **Plugin and Collector Security:**
    *   **Malicious Plugins:**  The plugin architecture introduces the risk of malicious or poorly written plugins that could compromise the agent or the host system.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Faulty plugins could consume excessive resources, leading to denial-of-service.
    *   **Code Injection:** Vulnerabilities in plugin execution could allow for code injection.
    *   **Supply Chain Security:**  Ensuring the integrity and security of third-party plugins.
*   **Netdata Cloud Communication Security:**
    *   **Mutual Authentication:**  Verifying the identity of both the agent and the cloud service.
    *   **Secure Key Management:**  Protecting the keys used for authentication and encryption.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**  Ensuring the communication channel cannot be intercepted and manipulated.
*   **Configuration Security:**
    *   **Sensitive Information in Configuration:** Configuration files may contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials).
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:**  Protecting configuration files from unauthorized modification.
    *   **Secure Distribution of Configuration:**  Ensuring secure delivery of configuration updates from Netdata Cloud.
*   **Software Supply Chain Security:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**  Regularly scanning and updating dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Signing:**  Verifying the integrity and authenticity of the Netdata software.
