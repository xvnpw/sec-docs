# Threat Model Analysis for netdata/netdata

## Threat: [Agent Compromise via Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/agent_compromise_via_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

- **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a security vulnerability within the Netdata agent software itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, remote code execution flaw). This could be achieved through network attacks or by exploiting local vulnerabilities if the attacker has some level of access to the system.
- **Impact:** Full compromise of the Netdata agent process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the host system with the privileges of the Netdata agent user. This could allow the attacker to exfiltrate data, install backdoors, or pivot to other systems.
- **Affected Component:** Netdata Agent core codebase, specific modules or functions containing the vulnerability.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep Netdata updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Subscribe to Netdata security advisories and mailing lists to stay informed about potential threats.
    - Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block exploitation attempts.
    - Follow security best practices for the host operating system to minimize the attack surface.
    - Consider running the Netdata agent with minimal privileges (least privilege principle).

## Threat: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass in Web Interface](./threats/authentication_and_authorization_bypass_in_web_interface.md)

- **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Netdata's authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the web interface or specific functionalities without proper credentials.
- **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive monitoring data to unauthorized individuals, potential manipulation of Netdata configurations, or denial of service by disrupting the monitoring system.
- **Affected Component:** Netdata Web Interface's authentication and authorization modules.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Enable and properly configure authentication for the Netdata web interface (e.g., using HTTP basic authentication or other supported methods).
    - Keep Netdata updated to benefit from security fixes related to authentication and authorization.
    - Restrict access to the Netdata web interface based on the principle of least privilege, ensuring only authorized personnel can access it.
    - Consider using a reverse proxy with its own authentication and authorization mechanisms in front of the Netdata web interface.

## Threat: [Plugin/Collector Vulnerabilities](./threats/plugincollector_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Netdata's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality. Vulnerabilities in third-party or custom plugins (collectors) could be exploited by attackers.
- **Impact:** Compromise of the Netdata agent process, arbitrary code execution on the host system, or access to sensitive data handled by the vulnerable plugin.
- **Affected Component:** Netdata Agent's plugin system, specific vulnerable plugins or collectors.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Only use trusted and well-maintained plugins from reputable sources.
    - Regularly update plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Review the code of custom plugins for security vulnerabilities before deploying them.
    - Consider running plugins in isolated environments or with restricted privileges.
