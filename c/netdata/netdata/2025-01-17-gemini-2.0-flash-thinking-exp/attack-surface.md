# Attack Surface Analysis for netdata/netdata

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Netdata Web Interface](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_netdata_web_interface.md)

*   **Description:** Netdata exposes a web interface that, if left unauthenticated, allows anyone to view sensitive system metrics.
    *   **How Netdata Contributes:** Netdata's default configuration might not enforce authentication on its web interface, making it publicly accessible.
    *   **Example:** An attacker browses to the Netdata port (default 19999) and gains real-time insights into CPU usage, memory consumption, network activity, and potentially even process names.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive system information, aiding in reconnaissance for further attacks, potential for denial of service by overloading the Netdata instance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable Authentication:** Configure Netdata to require username and password for accessing the web interface.
        *   **Restrict Access:** Use firewall rules or network segmentation to limit access to the Netdata port to authorized networks or IP addresses.
        *   **Use a Reverse Proxy:** Place Netdata behind a reverse proxy that handles authentication and authorization.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Netdata API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_netdata_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Netdata exposes an API for retrieving metrics and managing the agent. Vulnerabilities in this API could allow unauthorized actions.
    *   **How Netdata Contributes:** Netdata's API provides programmatic access to its functionality, which, if not properly secured, can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an unpatched vulnerability in the Netdata API to retrieve historical metrics, reconfigure data collection, or potentially even execute commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of Netdata configuration, potential for remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Netdata Updated:** Regularly update Netdata to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Secure API Access:** Implement authentication and authorization for the Netdata API.
        *   **Restrict API Access:** Limit access to the API to trusted sources or internal networks.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Netdata Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_netdata_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** If an attacker gains access to Netdata's configuration files, they can modify its behavior, potentially leading to security compromises.
    *   **How Netdata Contributes:** Netdata relies on configuration files to define its behavior, including data collection, web interface settings, and streaming configurations.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the `netdata.conf` file to disable authentication, configure Netdata to send metrics to a malicious server, or alter data collection settings to expose more sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Netdata agent, exposure of sensitive data, potential for using Netdata as a pivot point for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure File System Permissions:** Ensure that Netdata's configuration files are only readable and writable by the Netdata user and appropriate administrative accounts.
        *   **Regularly Audit Configuration:** Periodically review Netdata's configuration files for any unauthorized changes.
        *   **Implement File Integrity Monitoring:** Use tools to detect unauthorized modifications to critical Netdata files.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Netdata Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_netdata_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Netdata's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality. Vulnerabilities in these plugins can introduce security risks.
    *   **How Netdata Contributes:** Netdata's plugin system allows for third-party code execution within the Netdata agent's context.
    *   **Example:** A malicious or vulnerable plugin allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the Netdata user.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Carefully Vet Plugins:** Only use trusted and well-maintained Netdata plugins.
        *   **Keep Plugins Updated:** Ensure that all installed plugins are updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Implement Plugin Sandboxing (if available):** Explore if Netdata offers any mechanisms to sandbox or restrict the privileges of plugins.
