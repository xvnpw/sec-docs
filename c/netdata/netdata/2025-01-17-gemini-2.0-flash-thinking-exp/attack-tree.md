## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Netdata Web Interface -> Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) -> Add malicious custom plugins to Netdata](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_netdata_web_interface_-_cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__-_add_malicious_custom_plugins_to__d7982eac.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker tricks a logged-in Netdata user into making a request that adds a malicious custom plugin. This could be achieved through a malicious link or website.
    *   **Impact:**  Adding a malicious plugin allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Netdata server, potentially leading to full compromise of the server and access to the monitored application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Netdata API -> API Endpoint Exploitation -> Utilize vulnerable API endpoints to execute commands on the Netdata server](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_netdata_api_-_api_endpoint_exploitation_-_utilize_vulnerable_api_endpoints_to_execute_commands_f4c7c855.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a specific Netdata API endpoint that allows them to execute commands on the underlying server. This could involve injection flaws or other API security weaknesses.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to run arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Netdata process, potentially leading to full server compromise and access to the monitored application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Netdata Plugins -> Vulnerabilities in Core Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_netdata_plugins_-_vulnerabilities_in_core_plugins.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages known or zero-day vulnerabilities present in the default Netdata plugins. These vulnerabilities could include buffer overflows, command injection flaws, or other security weaknesses.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can grant the attacker access to the Netdata server, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code and compromise the server and the monitored application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Netdata Plugins -> Malicious Custom Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_netdata_plugins_-_malicious_custom_plugins.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with the ability to install plugins (either through compromised credentials, a vulnerability, or social engineering) deploys a crafted plugin containing malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** The malicious plugin can execute arbitrary code on the Netdata server with the privileges of the Netdata process, leading to full server compromise and access to the monitored application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Netdata Configuration -> Modifying Configuration Files Directly (if attacker gains access to the server)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_netdata_configuration_-_modifying_configuration_files_directly__if_attacker_gains_access_to__929609fd.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains direct access to the Netdata server's file system (e.g., through a separate server compromise or stolen credentials) and modifies Netdata's configuration files.
    *   **Impact:** By modifying configuration files, an attacker can disable security features, configure Netdata to expose more sensitive application data, or even configure malicious plugins, leading to a compromise of the monitoring system and potentially the monitored application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Add malicious custom plugins to Netdata](./attack_tree_paths/add_malicious_custom_plugins_to_netdata.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** As described in the corresponding High-Risk Path.
    *   **Impact:**  Directly leads to the ability to execute arbitrary code on the Netdata server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access internal application resources or services (via SSRF)](./attack_tree_paths/access_internal_application_resources_or_services__via_ssrf_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If Netdata has features to fetch external resources, an attacker could exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability to make requests to internal resources that are not publicly accessible.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows the attacker to interact with internal application components, potentially leading to information disclosure, further exploitation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize vulnerable API endpoints to execute commands on the Netdata server](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_vulnerable_api_endpoints_to_execute_commands_on_the_netdata_server.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** As described in the corresponding High-Risk Path.
    *   **Impact:**  Provides the attacker with the ability to run arbitrary commands on the Netdata server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit known vulnerabilities in default Netdata plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_default_netdata_plugins.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** As described in the corresponding High-Risk Path.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to remote code execution and full compromise of the Netdata server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deploy a crafted plugin to execute arbitrary code on the Netdata server](./attack_tree_paths/deploy_a_crafted_plugin_to_execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_netdata_server.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** As described in the corresponding High-Risk Path.
    *   **Impact:**  Results in the ability to execute arbitrary code on the Netdata server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Plugin Configuration Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/plugin_configuration_exploitation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how plugin configurations are handled, allowing them to manipulate settings to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious commands.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to privilege escalation, remote code execution, or exposure of sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage weaknesses in the streaming protocol to gain control over the Netdata instance or the receiving end](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_weaknesses_in_the_streaming_protocol_to_gain_control_over_the_netdata_instance_or_the_recei_9c1f20d4.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Netdata streaming protocol itself to gain control over a Netdata instance or a system receiving the stream.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to remote code execution, data manipulation, or denial of service on the affected systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Alert Actions](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_alert_actions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If Netdata's alert actions involve executing scripts or commands, an attacker could find a way to inject malicious payloads into these actions.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Netdata server or other systems involved in the alerting process, potentially impacting the monitored application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modifying Configuration Files Directly (if attacker gains access to the server)](./attack_tree_paths/modifying_configuration_files_directly__if_attacker_gains_access_to_the_server_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** As described in the corresponding High-Risk Path.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows the attacker to disable security features or expose sensitive data, weakening the security of the monitoring system and potentially the monitored application.
