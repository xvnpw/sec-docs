## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving htop

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected htop Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Command Injection via `htop` Execution** | An attacker could inject malicious commands into the `htop` command string if the application dynamically constructs it based on unsanitized input. For example, if the application allows filtering processes by name and doesn't sanitize the input, an attacker could input `; rm -rf /` which would be executed by the shell. | **Critical:** Complete system compromise, data loss, service disruption. | **Execution:** The `system()` call or similar function used to execute `htop` with attacker-controlled arguments. | **Critical** | **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all input used to construct the `htop` command. Use parameterized commands or escape shell metacharacters. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the `htop` process with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running it as root unless absolutely necessary. **Static Command Construction:** If possible, avoid dynamic command construction and use predefined, safe command structures. |
| **Path Traversal/Arbitrary Code Execution via `htop` Path** | An attacker could replace the legitimate `htop` binary with a malicious one if the application doesn't explicitly specify the full path to `htop` or relies on insecure environment variables. The application would then execute the attacker's malicious binary. | **Critical:** Complete system compromise, data loss, service disruption. | **Execution:** The path resolution mechanism used by the operating system to locate the `htop` executable. | **High** | **Explicit Path Configuration:**  Hardcode or securely configure the full path to the `htop` executable. **Integrity Checks:**  Consider implementing checks to verify the integrity of the `htop` executable (e.g., checksum verification). **Secure Environment:** Ensure the environment variables used for path resolution are not modifiable by untrusted users. |
| **Malicious `htop` Binary Substitution** | An attacker with sufficient privileges on the system could replace the legitimate `htop` binary with a modified version that performs malicious actions in addition to or instead of its intended functionality. The application would unknowingly execute this malicious binary. | **Critical:** Complete system compromise, data loss, service disruption. | **Execution:** The `htop` executable file itself. | **High** | **Secure Installation and Updates:** Ensure `htop` is installed from a trusted source and kept up-to-date. Implement mechanisms to detect unauthorized modifications to system binaries (e.g., using file integrity monitoring systems). **System Hardening:** Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized modification of system files. |
| **Privilege Escalation via `htop` Vulnerabilities** | If the application runs `htop` with elevated privileges (e.g., as root) and `htop` itself has a vulnerability, an attacker could potentially exploit that vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or control over the system. | **Critical:** Complete system compromise, ability to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. | **Execution:** The `htop` executable and its internal functions. | **High** (if running with elevated privileges) | **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `htop` with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running it as root unless absolutely necessary. **Regular Updates:** Keep `htop` updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities. **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Consider running the application and `htop` within a sandboxed environment or container to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities. |
| **Information Disclosure via `htop` Output to Unauthorized Users** | If the application displays the output of `htop` directly to users without proper authorization checks, sensitive system information (e.g., process names, user IDs, resource usage, command-line arguments) could be exposed to unauthorized individuals. | **High:** Exposure of sensitive system information, potentially aiding further attacks. | **Output:** The text output stream generated by `htop`. | **High** | **Authorization Checks:** Implement strict authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can access the output of `htop`. **Data Masking/Filtering:** Filter or mask sensitive information from `htop`'s output before displaying it to users. Only show necessary information. |
