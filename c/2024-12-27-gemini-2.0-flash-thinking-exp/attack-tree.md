## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using htop - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the `htop` project as it's used by the application.

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to the application's resources, manipulate its behavior, or exfiltrate sensitive information by leveraging vulnerabilities related to the application's use of `htop`.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

+-- Achieve Attacker's Goal: Compromise Application Using htop
    +-- **Exploit Application's Interaction with htop  *** HIGH RISK PATH *** **
    |   +-- **Command Injection via htop Execution  **CRITICAL NODE** *** HIGH RISK PATH *** **
    |   |   +-- Application Constructs htop Command with User-Controlled Input
    |   |   |   - Insight: If the application constructs the `htop` command line using unsanitized user input (e.g., filtering processes based on user-provided names), an attacker could inject arbitrary commands.
    |   |   |   - Actionable Insight: **Crucial:** Never construct shell commands with unsanitized user input. Use parameterized commands or dedicated libraries for process management. This is a direct vulnerability in the application's code.
    |   |   |   - Likelihood: Medium to High
    |   |   |   - Impact: High
    |   |   |   - Effort: Low
    |   |   |   - Skill Level: Low to Medium
    |   |   |   - Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
    |   +-- **Information Disclosure via htop Output  **CRITICAL NODE** *** HIGH RISK PATH *** **
    |   |   +-- htop Displays Sensitive Information Accessible to Attacker
    |   |   |   - Insight: If the application displays `htop`'s output directly to users without filtering, sensitive information like process arguments containing passwords or API keys might be exposed.
    |   |   |   - Actionable Insight: **Essential:** Never directly display raw `htop` output to users. Filter and sanitize the output to remove sensitive information before presentation.
    |   |   |   - Likelihood: Medium
    |   |   |   - Impact: High
    |   |   |   - Effort: Low
    |   |   |   - Skill Level: Low
    |   |   |   - Detection Difficulty: Low

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

1. **Command Injection via htop Execution (**CRITICAL NODE** *** HIGH RISK PATH ***):**

   * **Attack Vector:** The application dynamically constructs the command used to execute `htop`, incorporating user-provided input without proper sanitization.
   * **Mechanism:** An attacker provides malicious input that, when incorporated into the command, injects additional shell commands.
   * **Example:** If the application allows users to filter processes by name and constructs the command like `htop -p $(pgrep "$user_input")`, an attacker could input `"; cat /etc/passwd #"` to execute `cat /etc/passwd`.
   * **Likelihood:** Medium to High. Command injection is a common web application vulnerability, especially when dealing with external commands.
   * **Impact:** High. Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
   * **Effort:** Low. If the vulnerability exists, exploiting it is often straightforward, requiring basic knowledge of shell commands.
   * **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
   * **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium. Can be detected through monitoring command line arguments, system logs, or network traffic if the injected commands interact with external systems.

2. **Information Disclosure via htop Output (**CRITICAL NODE** *** HIGH RISK PATH ***):**

   * **Attack Vector:** The application directly displays the raw output of the `htop` command to users without proper filtering or sanitization.
   * **Mechanism:** `htop` displays various process information, including command-line arguments and potentially environment variables. If processes are run with sensitive information in their arguments (e.g., database passwords, API keys) or environment, this information will be visible in `htop`'s output.
   * **Example:** A process might be started with a command like `my_app.py --db-password "SuperSecretPassword"`. If the application displays the `htop` output, this password will be visible to anyone with access to that output.
   * **Likelihood:** Medium. This depends on whether the application developers are aware of the risks of displaying raw output and whether processes are inadvertently started with sensitive information in their arguments or environment.
   * **Impact:** High. Exposure of sensitive information like credentials or API keys can lead to unauthorized access to other systems, data breaches, and further compromise.
   * **Effort:** Low. If the application displays raw `htop` output, the sensitive information is readily available to anyone who can view it.
   * **Skill Level:** Low.
   * **Detection Difficulty:** Low. The sensitive information is directly visible in the application's output.

These two high-risk paths represent the most immediate and significant threats related to the application's use of `htop`. Addressing the vulnerabilities associated with these paths should be the top priority for the development team.
