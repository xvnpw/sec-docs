```

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Memory Management Issues [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_memory_management_issues__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This category encompasses vulnerabilities arising from improper memory management within the raylib library, a common issue in C codebases.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Buffer Overflow in Raylib [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_buffer_overflow_in_raylib__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts malicious input that, when processed by raylib, overwrites a buffer's allocated memory. This can corrupt adjacent data, including function pointers or return addresses, leading to control flow hijacking.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Crafted Texture Data [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_crafted_texture_data__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a specially crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPG) with manipulated dimensions, chunk sizes, or other metadata. When raylib attempts to load or process this image, it overflows a buffer allocated for texture data.
*   **Vulnerable Functions (Examples):** `LoadTexture()`, `LoadImage()`, `LoadImageRaw()`, internal image processing functions.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Thorough input validation of image dimensions and metadata.
    *   Use of safe memory handling functions (e.g., bounds checking).
    *   Fuzz testing with various image formats and corrupted data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Crafted Model Data [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_crafted_model_data__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to texture data, the attacker provides a maliciously crafted 3D model file (e.g., OBJ, glTF) containing oversized data elements or incorrect structural information. This overflows buffers during model parsing or rendering.
*   **Vulnerable Functions (Examples):** `LoadModel()`, `LoadModelFromMesh()`, internal model parsing and rendering functions.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strict validation of model file format and data sizes.
    *   Use of safe parsing libraries with built-in security checks.
    *   Fuzz testing with various model formats and corrupted data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4 Integer Overflow Leading to Memory Corruption [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_integer_overflow_leading_to_memory_corruption__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** An integer overflow occurs during calculations related to memory allocation or data indexing. This can result in allocating a buffer that is too small or writing data outside of allocated bounds.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.1 Crafted Input to Trigger Overflow [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_1_crafted_input_to_trigger_overflow__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides input values (e.g., dimensions, sizes, counts) that, when used in calculations within raylib, cause an integer overflow. This leads to incorrect memory allocation or out-of-bounds writes.
*   **Vulnerable Functions (Examples):** Any function that takes integer input and uses it for memory allocation or indexing.  This is highly context-dependent.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Careful review of all integer calculations, especially those involving user input.
    *   Use of checked arithmetic operations (e.g., functions that detect and handle overflows).
    *   Input validation to restrict the range of acceptable integer values.
    *   Static analysis to identify potential integer overflow vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Resource Loading Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_resource_loading_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** This category focuses on vulnerabilities in how raylib handles external resources, particularly image files.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Malformed Image File [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_malformed_image_file__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a malformed image file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the image decoding process.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Heap Overflow in Decoder [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_heap_overflow_in_decoder__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts an image file that triggers a heap overflow within the image decoding library used by raylib (e.g., stb_image). This often involves manipulating image metadata or chunk structures to cause the decoder to write beyond allocated buffer boundaries.
*   **Vulnerable Functions (Examples):**  Indirectly, through raylib functions like `LoadTexture()`, `LoadImage()`. The vulnerability is *within* the underlying image decoding library.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Keep image decoding libraries (dependencies of raylib) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Use memory-safe image decoding libraries if possible.
    *   Fuzz testing of raylib's image loading functions with a wide variety of malformed image files.
    *   Consider sandboxing the image decoding process to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
