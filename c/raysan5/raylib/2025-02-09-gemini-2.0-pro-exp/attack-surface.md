# Attack Surface Analysis for raysan5/raylib

## Attack Surface: [1. File Parsing and Loading](./attack_surfaces/1__file_parsing_and_loading.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in raylib's file parsing routines for various supported formats (images, audio, models, etc.). This is the most direct and likely attack vector.
*raylib Contribution:* raylib provides the functions (`LoadTexture`, `LoadModel`, `LoadSound`, etc.) and the underlying parsing logic that are directly vulnerable.
*Example:* A maliciously crafted `.obj` model file with an invalid vertex count is loaded using `LoadModel()`, triggering an out-of-bounds write in raylib's model parsing code.
*Impact:*
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Application crash.
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE): Possible, especially with complex formats, allowing the attacker to gain control.
    *   Information Disclosure: Potential leakage of memory contents.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** (for formats with complex parsers like 3D models, compressed audio) to **High** (for simpler formats).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Input Validation:** *Before* calling raylib functions, rigorously validate file size, magic numbers, and internal structure (as much as feasible without reimplementing the parser).
        *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Extensive fuzz testing of *all* file loading functions is *absolutely essential*. Use a fuzzer to generate a wide variety of malformed inputs.
        *   **Limit Supported Formats:**  Restrict the application to only load the file formats that are strictly necessary.
        *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** If possible, load and process files in a sandboxed environment or a separate process to contain the impact of a successful exploit.
        *   **Memory Safety:** Use memory analysis tools (Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) during development to catch memory errors.
    *   **User:**
        *   **Trusted Sources:** Only load files from trusted sources. Avoid files from untrusted websites or unknown senders.

## Attack Surface: [2. Shader Exploits (If User-Defined Shaders are Allowed)](./attack_surfaces/2__shader_exploits__if_user-defined_shaders_are_allowed_.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in raylib's shader handling, allowing attackers to execute malicious code on the GPU. This is only relevant if the application allows loading external or user-created shaders.
*raylib Contribution:* raylib provides the functions (`LoadShader`, `LoadShaderFromMemory`) to load and use shaders, making it directly responsible for this attack surface if external shaders are permitted.
*Example:* An attacker provides a custom shader with an infinite loop, causing the GPU to hang and the application to freeze.  A more sophisticated attack might attempt to read from unauthorized GPU memory locations.
*Impact:*
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): GPU crash, application freeze.
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE): Theoretically possible, but extremely difficult on modern systems. More likely to result in data corruption or instability.
    *   Information Disclosure: Potential for reading sensitive data from GPU memory.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (if user-defined or externally loaded shaders are allowed).  If the application *only* uses its own built-in, pre-compiled shaders, this risk is significantly reduced and would not be included in this high/critical list.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Avoid User-Defined Shaders:** The *best* mitigation is to *completely disallow* loading shaders from external sources or user input. Use only pre-compiled, thoroughly vetted shaders that are part of the application.
        *   **Strict Sandboxing (if unavoidable):** If external shaders are *absolutely essential*, implement *extremely* strict sandboxing and validation. This is a complex and challenging task, and even with sandboxing, vulnerabilities are possible.
        *   **Input Validation:** If external shaders are allowed, attempt to validate the shader source code for obviously dangerous operations (though this is very difficult to do comprehensively).
        * **Limit Shader Capabilities:** Restrict features available to externally loaded shaders.
    *   **User:**
        *   **No user-level mitigation if the application allows arbitrary shader loading.** This is entirely the developer's responsibility.
