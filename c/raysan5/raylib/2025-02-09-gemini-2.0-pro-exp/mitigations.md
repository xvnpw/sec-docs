## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict File Type Validation (raylib Loading Functions)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_file_type_validation__raylib_loading_functions_.md)

**1. Strict File Type Validation (raylib Loading Functions)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Initial Extension Check:** Use `IsFileExtension()` to perform a preliminary check against a whitelist of allowed extensions (e.g., ".png", ".jpg", ".ogg").  Reject the file immediately if the extension is not on the whitelist.
    2.  **Magic Number Check:**  If the extension is allowed, read the first few bytes (e.g., 4-8 bytes) of the file.  Compare these bytes against a known set of "magic numbers" for the expected file types.  For example, PNG files start with `\x89PNG`.  Reject the file if the magic number doesn't match.  This check happens *before* calling raylib's loading functions.
    3.  **Post-Load Sanity Check:** *After* calling a raylib loading function (e.g., `LoadImage()`, `LoadSound()`), check the returned data structure.  For images, verify that `width`, `height`, and `format` are within expected bounds.  For sounds, check that `sampleCount` and `sampleRate` are reasonable.  If these checks fail, *immediately unload the resource using the corresponding `Unload...` function* and treat it as invalid.
    4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for all raylib file loading operations.  Log any failures and provide informative error messages to the user (without revealing sensitive information).  Check the return values of raylib loading functions (many return `false` or a null pointer on failure).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical):** Prevents loading of maliciously crafted files that exploit vulnerabilities in parsing libraries used by raylib (e.g., buffer overflows in stb_image, which raylib uses internally).
    *   **Denial of Service (High):** Prevents loading of excessively large or malformed files that could crash the application or consume excessive resources, leveraging vulnerabilities within raylib's or its dependencies' parsing logic.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):**  Reduces the risk of accidentally loading files that might contain sensitive information (if the user mistakenly selects the wrong file), although this is secondary to the security concerns.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Risk significantly reduced.  The multi-stage validation, *especially the post-load sanity check on raylib-returned data*, makes it much harder for an attacker to successfully exploit a parsing vulnerability within raylib's dependencies.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk significantly reduced.  Sanity checks on the data returned by raylib prevent resource exhaustion caused by malformed data.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Extension check implemented in `src/resource_manager.c`, function `LoadResource()`.
    *   Post-load sanity checks implemented for images in `src/graphics_engine.c`, function `LoadTextureFromImage()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Magic number checks are not yet implemented.  This should be added to `src/resource_manager.c`, function `LoadResource()`, *before* calling any raylib loading functions.
    *   Post-load sanity checks are missing for audio files.  This needs to be added to `src/audio_engine.c`, function `LoadSoundFromFile()`, *and should include calls to `UnloadSound()` or `UnloadMusic()` on failure*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Size Limits (with raylib Functions)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_size_limits__with_raylib_functions_.md)

**2. Resource Size Limits (with raylib Functions)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Maximum Sizes:**  Establish maximum file size limits for each resource type (images, sounds, models, etc.).
    2.  **Pre-Load Size Check:** *Before* calling any raylib loading function, use `GetFileSize()` to get the file size.  Compare the size to the defined maximum limit.  Reject the file if it exceeds the limit.
    3.  **Image Dimension Limits:**  For images, *after* loading with `LoadImage()`, check the `width` and `height` of the returned `Image` struct.  Reject the image (and *unload it using `UnloadTexture()` if a texture was created, or `UnloadImage()` if it remains an `Image`*) if the dimensions exceed predefined limits.
    4. **Error Handling:** Log any instances where a file is rejected due to exceeding size limits, and check return values of raylib functions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (High):** Prevents attackers from crashing the application or consuming excessive memory by providing extremely large files that would exhaust resources when processed by raylib or its dependencies.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk significantly reduced.  Size limits, *combined with checks on data returned by raylib*, provide a strong defense against resource exhaustion attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Maximum file size limits defined in `src/config.h`.
    *   Pre-load size checks (using `GetFileSize()`) implemented in `src/resource_manager.c`, function `LoadResource()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Image dimension limits are not yet enforced *after* the `LoadImage()` call.  This needs to be added to `src/graphics_engine.c`, function `LoadTextureFromImage()`, *with appropriate `Unload...` calls*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates (raylib and its *Direct* Dependencies)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates__raylib_and_its_direct_dependencies_.md)

**3. Regular Updates (raylib and its *Direct* Dependencies)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check the raylib GitHub repository (https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) for new releases and security advisories.  *Pay close attention to the changelogs, as they often mention updates to underlying libraries like stb_image, stb_vorbis, etc.*
    2.  **Automated Dependency Checks (Focus on raylib):** While broader dependency checking is good, prioritize tools that can specifically track raylib and flag updates.
    3.  **Update Schedule:** Establish a regular schedule for updating raylib (e.g., monthly, or immediately upon the release of a security update that mentions a dependency update).
    4.  **Testing After Updates:** *After updating raylib, thoroughly test all functionality that uses raylib's resource loading and processing features.* This is crucial because vulnerabilities are often in the underlying parsing libraries.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical):**  Addresses vulnerabilities *within raylib and its directly used libraries* (stb_image, stb_vorbis, etc.) that could be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Denial of Service (High):**  Addresses vulnerabilities in raylib or its dependencies that could lead to crashes or resource exhaustion.
    *   **Various Other Vulnerabilities (Variable):**  Addresses any other security issues that may be discovered in raylib or its *direct* dependencies.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Risk significantly reduced over time as vulnerabilities are patched *in raylib and its bundled libraries*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Manual checks for raylib updates are performed monthly.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal update schedule needs to be documented and followed consistently.
    *   Automated testing *specifically targeting raylib functionality* after updates needs to be improved.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Fuzz Testing (raylib Loading Functions)](./mitigation_strategies/fuzz_testing__raylib_loading_functions_.md)

**4. Fuzz Testing (raylib Loading Functions)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Fuzzing Tool:** Select a suitable fuzzing tool (e.g., libFuzzer, AFL++).
    2.  **Write Fuzz Targets:** Create fuzz target functions that take a byte array as input and pass this data to raylib's resource loading functions *that take memory buffers as input* (e.g., `LoadImageFromMemory()`, `LoadSoundFromMemory()`, `LoadModelFromMemory()`, `LoadFontFromMemory()`).  *This is crucial: you are testing raylib's handling of potentially malformed data.*
    3.  **Integrate with Build System:** Integrate the fuzzing tool.
    4.  **Run Fuzzing Campaigns:** Run fuzzing campaigns.
    5.  **Analyze Results:** Analyze the results. Investigate any crashes or hangs to determine the root cause and fix the underlying vulnerabilities *within raylib or report them to the raylib maintainers*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical):**  Helps identify vulnerabilities *in raylib's handling of malformed input data* (passed to its memory-based loading functions), which could lead to code execution.
    *   **Denial of Service (High):**  Helps identify vulnerabilities that could lead to crashes or hangs *within raylib*.
    *   **Memory Corruption (High):** Helps identify memory safety issues (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) *within raylib's code or its direct dependencies*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Risk significantly reduced by proactively identifying and fixing vulnerabilities *within raylib* before they can be exploited.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Fuzz testing is not yet implemented. This is a high-priority item. A plan needs to be created to select a fuzzing tool, write fuzz targets *specifically for raylib's memory-loading functions*, and integrate fuzzing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Memory Management (raylib Resources)](./mitigation_strategies/memory_management__raylib_resources_.md)

**5. Memory Management (raylib Resources)**

* **Description:**
    1. **Resource Unloading:** *Always unload raylib resources (textures, models, sounds, shaders, fonts, etc.) when they are no longer needed using the appropriate `Unload...` functions* (e.g., `UnloadTexture`, `UnloadModel`, `UnloadSound`, `UnloadShader`, `UnloadFont`). This is fundamental to using raylib correctly.
    2. **Avoid Dynamic Allocation (where possible):** Minimize dynamic allocation *when interacting with raylib*. If you can pre-allocate buffers that you pass to raylib, do so.
    3. **RAII (C++):** If using C++, use RAII techniques (e.g., smart pointers) to manage raylib resources and ensure automatic cleanup *using the `Unload...` functions in destructors*.
    4. **Memory Leak Detection:** Regularly use memory leak detection tools, paying *specific attention to memory allocated and managed by raylib*.
    5. **Code Reviews:** Conduct code reviews, *focusing on correct usage of raylib's `Load...` and `Unload...` functions*.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Memory Leaks (Medium):** Prevents the application from gradually consuming more and more memory due to un-freed raylib resources.
    * **Use-After-Free (Critical):** Prevents accessing raylib-managed memory that has already been freed (via `Unload...`), which can lead to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
    * **Double-Free (Critical):** Prevents freeing the same raylib resource multiple times, which can lead to crashes or memory corruption.

* **Impact:**
    * **Memory Leaks:** Risk significantly reduced by consistent use of raylib's `Unload...` functions.
    * **Use-After-Free/Double-Free:** Risk significantly reduced by RAII and careful, correct use of raylib's API.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Basic resource unloading is implemented in most areas.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Consistent use of RAII is not yet implemented (project is primarily C).
    * Memory leak detection is not integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, and needs to be focused on raylib-related allocations.
    * Code reviews are not consistently focused on *correct raylib resource management*.
