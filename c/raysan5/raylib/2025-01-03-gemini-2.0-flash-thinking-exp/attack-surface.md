# Attack Surface Analysis for raysan5/raylib

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image File Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_file_loading.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries used by raylib by providing crafted image files.

**How Raylib Contributes:** Raylib provides functions to load various image formats (PNG, JPG, BMP, etc.) and relies on underlying libraries (like stb_image) for decoding. It doesn't inherently sanitize or deeply inspect image file contents for malicious payloads.

**Example:** A specially crafted PNG file with an oversized header or malformed data could trigger a buffer overflow in the stb_image library when raylib attempts to load it.

**Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution, denial-of-service (application crash), or information disclosure (memory leaks).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep raylib and its dependencies updated: Regularly update raylib to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in its dependencies (like stb_image).
* Implement file type validation:  Verify the file extension and, ideally, the magic number of the file before attempting to load it with raylib.
* Consider using sandboxing: If the application handles untrusted image files, consider running the image loading process in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
* Report potential vulnerabilities: Encourage users to report suspicious files or crashes encountered while loading images.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal during Resource Loading](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_during_resource_loading.md)

**Description:** Exploiting insufficient path sanitization when loading resources, allowing access to arbitrary files on the system.

**How Raylib Contributes:** If the application allows users to specify file paths for loading resources (images, audio, models, fonts) and directly passes these paths to raylib's loading functions without proper validation, it becomes vulnerable to path traversal attacks.

**Example:** A user providing a path like `"../../../../etc/passwd"` when the application attempts to load an image could potentially lead to the application attempting to load a system file.

**Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive files), potential for file overwriting or modification (depending on application permissions).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never directly use user-provided paths: Avoid directly using user-provided input as file paths.
* Use whitelists for allowed directories:  Restrict resource loading to specific, safe directories.
* Sanitize and validate paths:  Implement robust path sanitization techniques to remove or neutralize potentially malicious path components (e.g., "..", absolute paths).
* Use relative paths: When possible, work with relative paths within the application's resource directory.
