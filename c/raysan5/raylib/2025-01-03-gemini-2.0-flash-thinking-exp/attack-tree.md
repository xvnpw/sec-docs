## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise raylib Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_raylib_application__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of gaining control over the system running the application. This node represents the aggregation of all potential attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This node represents a category of attacks that target how the application receives and processes user input (keyboard, mouse, gamepad). Vulnerabilities here arise from insufficient validation and sanitization of input data. Successful exploitation can lead to control flow hijacking, memory corruption, and arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow in Input Buffers [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_in_input_buffers__high-risk_path_.md)

This attack path involves sending more data to an input buffer than it is designed to hold. This overwrites adjacent memory locations, potentially corrupting program data or control flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keyboard Input Buffer Overflow [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keyboard_input_buffer_overflow__high-risk_path_.md)

This specific attack involves overflowing the buffer used to store keyboard input. Attackers can send excessively long strings through keyboard input, exceeding the buffer's capacity and potentially overwriting critical data or injecting malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resource Loading Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resource_loading_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This node represents attacks that focus on the process of the application loading external resources like images, audio files, and models. Weaknesses in how these resources are loaded, parsed, and handled can be exploited by providing malicious files. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution, denial of service, or access to sensitive information through path traversal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Image Loading [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_image_loading__high-risk_path_.md)

This attack path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the image loading process. Attackers can craft malicious image files that, when loaded by the application, trigger a bug in the image parsing library (within raylib or an underlying library).

## Attack Tree Path: [Load crafted image file with embedded exploit [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/load_crafted_image_file_with_embedded_exploit__high-risk_path_.md)

This specific attack involves embedding malicious code or data within an image file. When the vulnerable image loading function processes this file, the embedded exploit is triggered, potentially leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Audio Loading [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_audio_loading__high-risk_path_.md)

This attack path is similar to malicious image loading but targets audio files. Attackers can create malicious audio files that exploit vulnerabilities in the audio decoding or processing functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Load crafted audio file with embedded exploit [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/load_crafted_audio_file_with_embedded_exploit__high-risk_path_.md)

This specific attack involves embedding malicious code or data within an audio file. When the vulnerable audio loading function processes this file, the embedded exploit is triggered, potentially leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal during Resource Loading [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_during_resource_loading__high-risk_path_.md)

This attack path exploits insufficient validation of file paths provided to resource loading functions. An attacker can supply a specially crafted file path that allows access to files and directories outside of the intended application directory. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or even the execution of arbitrary code if writable locations are accessed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within the raylib Library Itself [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_the_raylib_library_itself__critical_node_.md)

This node represents attacks that directly target weaknesses or bugs within the raylib library code. These vulnerabilities could be due to coding errors, design flaws, or outdated dependencies. Successful exploitation can lead to a wide range of impacts, including arbitrary code execution within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/use_known_vulnerabilities__cves___high-risk_path_.md)

This attack path involves exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in the specific version of the raylib library being used by the application. If the application uses an outdated version with known vulnerabilities, attackers can leverage readily available exploit code to compromise the application.
