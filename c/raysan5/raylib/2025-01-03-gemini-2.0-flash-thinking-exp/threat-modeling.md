# Threat Model Analysis for raysan5/raylib

## Threat: [Malicious Image File Exploitation](./threats/malicious_image_file_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image file (e.g., PNG, BMP, TGA) that exploits a vulnerability in **raylib's image loading functions**. This could involve overflowing buffers, triggering integer overflows, or causing other memory corruption issues during the image decoding process within **raylib**. The attacker might achieve arbitrary code execution within the application's context or cause a denial of service (crash).

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, application crash.

**Affected Component:** `LoadImage()` function within the `raudio` module (if audio image formats are supported) or the core graphics loading functions. Potentially other image loading related functions like `LoadImageEx()`, `LoadImageRaw()`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep raylib updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Implement input validation on image file headers and sizes *before* passing them to raylib's loading functions.
* Consider using a separate, sandboxed process for image decoding if handling untrusted image sources.

## Threat: [Malicious Model File Exploitation](./threats/malicious_model_file_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted 3D model file (e.g., OBJ, GLTF) that exploits a vulnerability in **raylib's model loading functions**. This could involve oversized vertex data, malformed mesh definitions, or other issues leading to buffer overflows or memory corruption during the parsing process within **raylib**. The attacker might achieve arbitrary code execution or cause a denial of service.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, application crash.

**Affected Component:** Model loading functions within the `rmodels` module, such as `LoadModel()`, `LoadModelFromMesh()`, and related functions for loading materials and textures.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep raylib updated.
* Validate model file structures and data before loading.
* Limit the size and complexity of models that can be loaded from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Malicious Audio File Exploitation](./threats/malicious_audio_file_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted audio file (e.g., WAV, OGG) that exploits a vulnerability in **raylib's audio loading or decoding functions**. This could lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues during audio processing within **raylib**. The attacker might achieve arbitrary code execution or cause a denial of service.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, application crash.

**Affected Component:** Audio loading and decoding functions within the `raudio` module, such as `LoadSound()`, `LoadMusicStream()`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep raylib updated.
* Validate audio file headers and sizes before loading.
* Consider using a separate, sandboxed process for audio decoding if handling untrusted audio sources.

## Threat: [Shader Code Injection](./threats/shader_code_injection.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to provide custom shader code (GLSL) that is then compiled and used by **raylib**, an attacker could inject malicious shader code. This code could potentially perform actions like reading arbitrary memory accessible to the GPU process, causing infinite loops that freeze the rendering pipeline managed by **raylib**, or even crashing the graphics driver through actions initiated by **raylib's** rendering calls.

**Impact:** Information disclosure (reading GPU accessible memory), denial of service (rendering freeze), graphics driver crash.

**Affected Component:** Shader loading and compilation functions within the `rshaders` module, such as `LoadShader()`, `LoadShaderFromMemory()`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid allowing user-provided shaders if possible.
* Implement strict validation and sanitization of shader code before compilation using **raylib's** shader loading functions.
* Consider using a shader compiler with security checks or a whitelist of allowed shader functionalities.

## Threat: [Font File Exploitation](./threats/font_file_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted font file (e.g., TTF, OTF) that exploits a vulnerability in **raylib's font loading or rendering functions**. This could lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues during font processing or glyph rendering within **raylib**. The attacker might achieve arbitrary code execution or cause a denial of service.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, application crash.

**Affected Component:** Font loading and rendering functions within the `rtext` module, such as `LoadFont()`, `LoadFontEx()`.

**Risk Severity:** Medium *(Note: While previously marked medium, in some contexts font vulnerabilities can be critical if they lead to remote code execution. We'll keep it for now, but consider its potential impact)*

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep raylib updated.
* Validate font file structures before loading using **raylib's** font loading functions.
* Limit the sources from which fonts are loaded.

## Threat: [Use of a Compromised Raylib Library](./threats/use_of_a_compromised_raylib_library.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially trick developers into using a compromised or backdoored version of the **raylib library**. This could allow the attacker to inject malicious code into the application that is executed as part of the **raylib** functionality.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, complete compromise of the application.

**Affected Component:** The entire application, as the malicious code is within the core **raylib** library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Download raylib only from trusted sources (official GitHub repository, official website).
* Verify the integrity of the downloaded library using checksums or digital signatures.
* Consider using package managers and dependency management tools that provide integrity checks.
