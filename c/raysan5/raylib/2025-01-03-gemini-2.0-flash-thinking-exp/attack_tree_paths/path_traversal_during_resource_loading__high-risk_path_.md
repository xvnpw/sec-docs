**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Prepared By:** Cybersecurity Expert

**Target Application:** Application utilizing the raylib library (https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)

**1. Introduction:**

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Path Traversal during Resource Loading" attack path identified in the application's attack tree analysis. This is considered a high-risk vulnerability due to its potential for significant impact, including sensitive data disclosure and arbitrary code execution. We will delve into the technical details of the vulnerability, its potential exploitation, and provide concrete recommendations for mitigation within the raylib context.

**2. Detailed Description of the Vulnerability:**

The core issue lies in the **insufficient validation of user-supplied or externally influenced file paths** when loading resources within the application. Raylib, while providing powerful resource loading functions, relies on the application developer to ensure the integrity and safety of the provided paths.

Specifically, functions like `LoadTexture()`, `LoadImage()`, `LoadSound()`, `LoadFont()`, `LoadModel()`, `LoadShader()`, and potentially custom resource loading mechanisms, can be vulnerable if they directly use user-controlled input as part of the file path without proper sanitization.

An attacker can exploit this by crafting malicious file paths that utilize directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `../../`) or absolute paths to access files and directories outside the intended application's resource directory.

**3. Potential Exploitation Scenarios:**

* **Reading Sensitive Configuration Files:** An attacker could potentially read configuration files containing database credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information by crafting paths like `../../config/database.ini` or `/etc/shadow` (if the application has sufficient privileges).
* **Accessing Application Source Code:** If the application's source code is deployed alongside the executable, an attacker might be able to access it using paths like `../../src/main.c`. This could reveal further vulnerabilities or intellectual property.
* **Reading User Data:** Depending on the application's file structure and permissions, an attacker might be able to access user-specific data stored on the system.
* **Overwriting Application Files (If Writable Locations are Accessible):**  If the application attempts to load resources into writable directories and doesn't properly sanitize paths, an attacker could potentially overwrite critical application files with malicious content. This could lead to denial of service or even arbitrary code execution upon the next application launch.
* **Code Execution via Shared Libraries/Plugins:** In more advanced scenarios, if the application dynamically loads libraries or plugins based on user-provided paths (which is less common with standard raylib usage but possible in custom implementations), an attacker could potentially load and execute malicious code from an arbitrary location.

**4. Affected raylib Functions (Potential Candidates):**

The following raylib functions are prime candidates for this vulnerability if not used carefully:

* **`LoadTexture(const char *fileName)`:**  Loading image textures.
* **`LoadImage(const char *fileName)`:** Loading image data.
* **`LoadSound(const char *fileName)`:** Loading audio files.
* **`LoadFont(const char *fileName)`:** Loading font files.
* **`LoadModel(const char *fileName)`:** Loading 3D models.
* **`LoadShader(const char *vsFileName, const char *fsFileName)`:** Loading vertex and fragment shaders.
* **`LoadFileText(const char *fileName)`:** Loading text files.
* **Potentially custom resource loading functions** implemented by the development team that utilize file paths.

**Example Vulnerable Code Snippet (Illustrative):**

```c++
#include "raylib.h"
#include <string>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    InitWindow(800, 450, "Vulnerable Raylib App");

    // Assume user input is taken from command line argument
    std::string texturePath = argv[1];

    // Vulnerable code: Directly using user input
    Texture2D texture = LoadTexture(texturePath.c_str());

    while (!WindowShouldClose()) {
        BeginDrawing();
        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);
        DrawTexture(texture, 10, 10, WHITE);
        EndDrawing();
    }

    UnloadTexture(texture);
    CloseWindow();
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, if the application is run with the argument `../sensitive_data.txt`, the `LoadTexture` function will attempt to load that file, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**5. Attack Vectors and Examples:**

* **Directory Traversal:**
    * `../config.ini`: Attempts to access a file one level up from the expected resource directory.
    * `../../../../etc/passwd`: Attempts to access the system's password file (on Linux-like systems).
* **Absolute Paths:**
    * `/home/user/secrets.txt`: Attempts to access a specific file on the system.
    * `C:\Users\Public\Documents\important.doc`: Attempts to access a file on a Windows system.
* **UNC Paths (Windows):**
    * `\\malicious_server\share\evil.exe`:  While less likely for direct resource loading, it's a potential avenue if the application interacts with network resources based on user input.

**6. Potential Impact:**

The successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:

* **Confidentiality Breach:** Disclosure of sensitive application data, configuration details, or user information.
* **Integrity Violation:** Potential modification or deletion of application files if writable locations are accessible.
* **Availability Disruption:**  In severe cases, overwriting critical files could lead to application malfunction or denial of service.
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If attackers can overwrite executable files or load malicious libraries, they could gain complete control over the system running the application.

**7. Mitigation Strategies:**

The development team should implement the following mitigation strategies to address this vulnerability:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Whitelisting:**  Define an allowed set of characters and patterns for file paths. Reject any input that doesn't conform to this whitelist. This is the most secure approach.
    * **Blacklisting:**  Identify and block known malicious patterns like `../`, `..\\`, absolute paths, and UNC paths. However, blacklisting can be bypassed with clever encoding or variations.
    * **Path Canonicalization:**  Resolve symbolic links and relative paths to their absolute canonical form. This helps prevent attackers from using symbolic links to bypass restrictions. Libraries or platform-specific functions can assist with this.
* **Restricting File Access:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions. This limits the damage an attacker can cause even if they successfully traverse directories.
    * **Chroot Jails/Sandboxing:**  Isolate the application's file system access to a specific directory. This prevents the application from accessing files outside the designated area.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Avoid Direct Use of User Input:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly using user-provided input as part of file paths. Instead, use predefined resource identifiers or indices that map to safe file paths.
    * **Use Safe File Path Manipulation Functions:**  Utilize platform-specific functions for joining and manipulating file paths securely, avoiding manual string concatenation that can introduce vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including path traversal issues.

**8. Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Prioritize Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided file paths used in resource loading functions. Focus on whitelisting allowed characters and patterns.
* **Review All Resource Loading Code:**  Thoroughly examine all instances where raylib's resource loading functions (or custom equivalents) are used. Identify potential areas where user input influences file paths.
* **Implement Path Canonicalization:**  Utilize appropriate functions to resolve file paths to their canonical form before attempting to load resources.
* **Consider Using Resource IDs:** Instead of directly using file paths provided by users, consider using internal resource IDs or names that map to predefined, safe file paths within the application's resource directory.
* **Educate Developers:** Ensure the development team is aware of path traversal vulnerabilities and secure coding practices to prevent them.

**9. Testing and Verification:**

To confirm the vulnerability and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, the following testing should be performed:

* **Manual Testing:**  Attempt to exploit the vulnerability by providing various malicious file paths to resource loading functions. This includes directory traversal sequences, absolute paths, and edge cases.
* **Automated Testing (Fuzzing):**  Use fuzzing tools to automatically generate a large number of potentially malicious file paths and observe the application's behavior.
* **Static Analysis:**  Utilize static analysis tools to scan the codebase for potential path traversal vulnerabilities by identifying patterns of user input being used in file path manipulation.

**10. Conclusion:**

The "Path Traversal during Resource Loading" vulnerability poses a significant risk to the application. By failing to properly validate user-supplied file paths, attackers can potentially access sensitive information, compromise the integrity of the application, or even achieve arbitrary code execution. Implementing robust input validation, path canonicalization, and adhering to secure coding practices are crucial steps to mitigate this risk. The development team should prioritize addressing this vulnerability to ensure the security and integrity of the application and its users' data. Continuous testing and security audits are essential to maintain a secure application.
