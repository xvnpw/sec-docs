    *   Shields the core raylib components from platform-specific details, ensuring portability.

## 5. Data Flow

The typical data flow within a raylib application involves the following steps:

*   **Initialization:** The user application initiates the process by calling initialization functions in the `Core` component (e.g., `InitWindow`). This triggers the `Window Management` and `Platform Layer` to create the application window and initialize the graphics context.
*   **Input Handling:** The `Platform Layer` receives raw input events (keyboard presses, mouse movements, etc.) from the operating system. These events are then processed and translated into a platform-independent format by the `Input Management` component. The user application can then query the state of input devices through the `Input Management` API.
*   **Resource Loading:** When the application needs to display images, play sounds, or render 3D models, it uses the `Resource Management` component to load these assets from the file system or embedded resources. The `Resource Management` component handles file I/O and potentially utilizes external libraries for decoding specific file formats.
*   **Game Logic Processing:** The user application updates the game state based on input and internal logic. This involves calculations, AI updates, and other game-specific operations.
*   **Graphics Rendering Pipeline:**
    *   The user application uses functions from the `Graphics Rendering` component to prepare for drawing. This includes setting up the camera, loading shaders, and preparing textures.
    *   Drawing commands (e.g., `DrawRectangle`, `DrawModel`) are issued by the user application.
    *   The `Graphics Rendering` component processes these commands and interacts with the `Platform Layer` to submit rendering calls to the graphics drivers.
    *   The graphics drivers then communicate with the GPU to perform the actual rendering operations.
    *   Rendered output is displayed in the application window.
*   **Audio Playback Pipeline:**
    *   The user application uses the `Audio Management` component to load and control audio playback.
    *   Audio data is loaded by the `Resource Management` component.
    *   Playback commands (e.g., `PlaySound`, `PlayMusicStream`) are issued.
    *   The `Audio Management` component interacts with the `Platform Layer` and audio drivers to output audio through the audio hardware.
*   **Termination:** When the application exits, the user code calls termination functions in the `Core` component (e.g., `CloseWindow`). This triggers the cleanup of resources by the respective components and the `Platform Layer`, releasing system resources.

## 6. External Dependencies

raylib's functionality depends on several external components and libraries at runtime and during the build process:

*   **Operating System:** Provides the fundamental environment for raylib to execute, offering services for memory management, process management, and file system access.
*   **Graphics Drivers (OpenGL, OpenGL ES, DirectX, Metal, WebGL):** Essential for hardware-accelerated rendering. raylib abstracts the underlying graphics API through its `Platform Layer`, but the appropriate drivers must be installed on the target system. The specific driver dependency varies based on the platform and the graphics backend chosen during compilation.
*   **Audio Drivers (OpenAL, PulseAudio, WASAPI, DirectSound, Web Audio API):** Necessary for audio playback. Similar to graphics drivers, raylib abstracts the audio API, but compatible drivers are required. The specific driver dependency depends on the platform.
*   **Build Tools (CMake, Make, Visual Studio, etc.):** Used during the development and compilation phase to build the raylib library and user applications. CMake is the primary build system used by raylib.
*   **Compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, Emscripten):** Required to compile the C source code of raylib and user applications. The specific compiler depends on the target platform. Emscripten is used for compiling to WebAssembly.
*   **Optional Libraries (Linked Conditionally Based on Features and Platform):**
    *   **GLFW:** Can be used as an alternative windowing and input backend, offering cross-platform compatibility.
    *   **dr_libs (dr_wav, dr_flac, dr_mp3, stb_vorbis):** Used for decoding various audio file formats (WAV, FLAC, MP3, Vorbis). These are often included directly within the raylib repository as single header files.
    *   **stb_image:** A single-header library used for loading various image file formats (PNG, JPG, BMP, etc.). Often included directly within the raylib repository.
    *   **tinyobjloader:** A small library for loading OBJ 3D model files.
    *   **zlib:** Used for data compression, potentially for handling compressed resources.

## 7. Deployment

raylib applications are typically deployed through the following methods:

*   **Static Linking:** The compiled raylib library (a `.lib` or `.a` file) is linked directly into the user application's executable during the linking phase. This creates a standalone executable that includes all necessary raylib code. This is the most common and straightforward deployment method for desktop applications.
*   **Dynamic Linking (Shared Library):** On some platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS), raylib can be built as a shared library (e.g., `.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`). The user application then links against this shared library at runtime. This reduces the size of the executable but requires the shared library to be present on the target system.
*   **WebAssembly (for HTML5):** When targeting web browsers, raylib is compiled to WebAssembly using Emscripten. The application, along with the compiled raylib library, is deployed as a set of HTML, JavaScript, and WebAssembly files that can be served by a web server. The browser then executes the WebAssembly code.
*   **Mobile Platforms (Android, iOS):** Deployment on mobile platforms involves creating platform-specific packages (e.g., `.apk` for Android, `.ipa` for iOS) that include the compiled raylib library and application code. These packages are then distributed through app stores or other distribution channels.

## 8. Security Considerations (For Threat Modeling)

Based on the architectural design, the following security considerations are relevant for threat modeling:

*   **Input Validation Vulnerabilities (Input Management):**
    *   Improper validation of user input (keyboard, mouse, gamepad, touch) could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the application does not handle malformed or malicious input correctly. This could be exploited for denial-of-service.
    *   Buffer overflows could occur if input strings or data exceed expected limits when processed.
*   **Resource Loading Vulnerabilities (Resource Management):**
    *   Loading untrusted or maliciously crafted resource files (images, audio, models) could lead to vulnerabilities in the parsing libraries (e.g., `stb_image`, `dr_libs`, `tinyobjloader`). This could result in buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution, or denial-of-service.
    *   Path traversal vulnerabilities could occur if the application allows users to specify file paths for loading resources, potentially allowing access to sensitive files outside the intended directories.
*   **Graphics Driver Vulnerabilities (Graphics Rendering & Platform Layer):**
    *   raylib relies on external graphics drivers. Vulnerabilities in these drivers could potentially be triggered by specific rendering commands or shader code generated by raylib or the user application, leading to system instability or potential exploits.
*   **External Library Vulnerabilities (Dependencies):**
    *   Vulnerabilities in the optional external libraries used by raylib (GLFW, dr_libs, stb_image, etc.) could be inherited by applications using raylib. Regular updates and security audits of these dependencies are important.
*   **Memory Management Errors (Core, Resource Management, Graphics Rendering, Audio Management):**
    *   As a C library, raylib involves manual memory management. Errors such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, and double-free vulnerabilities could exist in raylib's codebase, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities (Platform Layer):**
    *   The `Platform Layer` interacts directly with operating system APIs. Vulnerabilities in these APIs or incorrect usage by raylib could introduce security risks.
*   **Shader Vulnerabilities (Graphics Rendering):**
    *   If the application allows users to provide custom shaders, vulnerabilities in these shaders could potentially be exploited to gain unauthorized access or cause denial-of-service.
*   **Audio Processing Vulnerabilities (Audio Management):**
    *   Processing of audio data from untrusted sources could lead to vulnerabilities in the audio decoding or processing logic.

This detailed design document provides a comprehensive overview of the raylib project's architecture and serves as a solid foundation for conducting thorough threat modeling activities to identify and mitigate potential security risks.
