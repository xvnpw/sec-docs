# Threat Model Analysis for raysan5/raylib

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Asset Loading](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_asset_loading.md)

Description: An attacker provides a maliciously crafted image, audio, or model file. Raylib, or its underlying libraries, improperly parses this file, leading to a buffer overflow. The attacker could potentially overwrite memory, inject code, or cause a crash.
Impact: Code execution, application crash, data corruption.
Affected Raylib Component: `rlLoadTexture()`, `rlLoadSound()`, `rlLoadModel()`, and related asset loading functions, potentially including underlying image/audio/model loading libraries used by raylib.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep raylib and dependencies updated to the latest versions.
    * Validate asset file paths and names to prevent loading unexpected files.
    * Consider sandboxing asset loading processes if feasible.
    * Implement input validation on asset file content if feasible (e.g., file size limits, format checks).

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability in Asset Loading](./threats/format_string_vulnerability_in_asset_loading.md)

Description: An attacker crafts an asset file (e.g., image metadata, model file) containing format string specifiers. If raylib or its dependencies use these strings in format functions without proper sanitization during asset loading, it could lead to information disclosure or code execution.
Impact: Information disclosure, code execution, application crash.
Affected Raylib Component: `rlLoadTexture()`, `rlLoadSound()`, `rlLoadModel()`, and related asset loading functions, potentially within string handling during file parsing.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep raylib and dependencies updated to the latest versions.
    * Avoid using format functions directly with external input strings within asset loading code (if applicable within raylib's internal implementation, less direct mitigation for application developers).
    * Report potential format string vulnerabilities to raylib developers if discovered.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free or Double-Free Vulnerability](./threats/use-after-free_or_double-free_vulnerability.md)

Description: A bug in raylib's internal C code leads to memory being accessed after it has been freed (use-after-free) or freed multiple times (double-free). This can corrupt memory, cause crashes, or potentially be exploited for code execution.
Impact: Memory corruption, application crash, potential for code execution.
Affected Raylib Component: Internal memory management within various raylib modules, potentially triggered by specific API calls or sequences of operations.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep raylib updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    * Report any suspected memory safety issues to raylib developers.
    * While less direct for application developers, understanding C memory management principles can help in identifying potential risk areas.
