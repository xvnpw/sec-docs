# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for raysan5/raylib

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update raylib](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_raylib.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update raylib
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor raylib Releases:** Subscribe to raylib's GitHub repository ([https://github.com/raysan5/raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)) or check the releases page periodically for new versions.
    2.  **Review Release Notes:** When a new version is released, carefully read the release notes and changelogs, paying close attention to bug fixes and security-related updates that might affect your application.
    3.  **Test New Version with raylib Usage:** Before updating in production, test the new raylib version in a development or staging environment, specifically focusing on areas of your application that heavily utilize raylib's features. Ensure compatibility and identify any regressions related to raylib functionality.
    4.  **Update Dependency:** Once testing is successful, update your project's dependency to the latest stable raylib version. This might involve updating build scripts, project files, or dependency management configurations to point to the new raylib version.
    5.  **Continuous Monitoring for raylib Updates:**  Establish a process for regularly checking for and applying raylib updates as part of your ongoing maintenance cycle, specifically considering the raylib library as a key dependency.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in raylib (High Severity):** Outdated raylib versions may contain known security vulnerabilities within the library itself that attackers can exploit. Updating mitigates these raylib-specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities *within the raylib library*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. The development team checks for updates occasionally, but it's not a formalized, scheduled process specifically for raylib.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing a formalized, scheduled process for checking raylib updates and integrating them into the project.  This should be a specific task within the regular development cycle, focused on raylib dependency management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User-Provided File Paths for Asset Loading](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user-provided_file_paths_for_asset_loading.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize User-Provided File Paths for Asset Loading
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify raylib Asset Loading Points:** Pinpoint all locations in your code where raylib functions like `LoadTexture`, `LoadSound`, `LoadModel`, `LoadFont`, etc., are used to load assets based on user-provided file paths.
    2.  **Input Validation Before raylib Calls:**  Before calling any raylib asset loading function with a user-provided path, implement strict input validation and sanitization.
    3.  **Path Sanitization Techniques for raylib Assets:** Use path sanitization techniques to remove or escape potentially harmful characters and sequences from user-provided paths *before* they are passed to raylib's asset loading functions. This includes:
        *   Removing or replacing characters like `..`, `/`, `\`, `:`, and other special characters that could be used for path traversal when interpreted by raylib or the underlying OS.
        *   Using functions provided by your programming language or operating system to normalize paths and resolve symbolic links *before* raylib processes them.
    4.  **Whitelist Approach for raylib Asset Directories:**  Prefer a whitelist approach where you define allowed directories for raylib asset loading and validate user-provided paths against this whitelist. Only allow raylib to access files within these predefined directories.
    5.  **Secure Path Construction for raylib:**  When constructing file paths that will be used with raylib asset loading functions, use secure path joining functions and avoid simple string concatenation with user input. Ensure the final path passed to raylib is safe.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal via raylib Asset Loading (High Severity):** Attackers could manipulate user-provided file paths to access files outside of the intended asset directories when raylib attempts to load them, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system files through raylib's file access mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of path traversal vulnerabilities specifically when loading assets using raylib functions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic input validation is in place to prevent obvious path traversal attempts in some asset loading areas, but more robust sanitization and whitelisting are missing, especially in raylib-specific asset loading contexts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing robust path sanitization and a whitelist-based approach specifically for asset loading paths used with raylib functions.  Needs to be implemented in *all* code paths where user input can influence file paths used with raylib's asset loading functions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Input Data Used in raylib Functions](./mitigation_strategies/validate_input_data_used_in_raylib_functions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Validate Input Data Used in raylib Functions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify raylib Data Processing Points:** Determine where your application uses raylib functions to process external data beyond simple asset loading. This could include custom file format parsing for game data, network data used for rendering or game logic, or any other external data streams processed by raylib-related code.
    2.  **Data Format Validation Before raylib Processing:** Before passing external data to raylib functions for processing (e.g., rendering, calculations, etc.), validate the data format against expected specifications. Check file headers, data structures, and data types relevant to how raylib will use this data.
    3.  **Size and Range Checks for raylib Data:**  Implement checks to ensure that the size and range of input data are within acceptable limits *before* raylib processes it. Prevent excessively large data inputs that could lead to buffer overflows or denial-of-service within raylib's processing or your application's interaction with raylib.
    4.  **Error Handling for raylib Data Validation:** Implement robust error handling for data validation failures that occur before data is used with raylib. If invalid data is detected, gracefully handle the error, log the issue, and prevent further processing of the potentially malicious data by raylib. Avoid crashing or exposing sensitive information in error messages related to raylib data processing.
    5.  **Data Type Enforcement for raylib API:**  Ensure that data types used in raylib functions match the expected types as defined by the raylib API documentation.  For example, if raylib expects an integer for a specific parameter, ensure the input is indeed an integer and within the valid range before passing it to raylib.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Buffer Overflows in raylib or Application Code (High Severity):** Malformed or excessively large input data could cause buffer overflows in *raylib itself* or in your application's code when processing data intended for raylib functions.
    *   **Denial of Service via raylib Data Processing (Medium Severity):** Processing extremely large or malformed data with raylib could lead to excessive resource consumption *by raylib or your application's raylib-related logic*, resulting in denial-of-service.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior/Crashes in raylib or Application (Medium Severity):** Invalid data can cause unexpected behavior or crashes *within raylib or your application's interaction with raylib*, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or instability related to raylib's operation.
*   **Impact:** Partially reduces the risk of buffer overflows, denial-of-service, and unexpected behavior specifically related to data processing by raylib functions. The level of reduction depends on the thoroughness of validation *before* data is used with raylib.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Basic data format checks are implemented for some file formats used with raylib, but size and range checks are not consistently applied across all data inputs intended for raylib processing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing comprehensive data validation, especially size and range checks, for all external data sources *that are processed by raylib functions*. This needs to be implemented for file loading beyond basic assets, network data processing intended for raylib, and any other external data inputs used in conjunction with raylib.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for Asset Loading](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_asset_loading.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Limits for Asset Loading
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define raylib Asset Resource Limits:** Establish specific resource limits for assets loaded using raylib functions, considering raylib's memory management and rendering capabilities.
    2.  **Maximum Texture Size Limits for raylib:**  Implement limits on the maximum width and height of textures that can be loaded using raylib's `LoadTexture` and related functions. Reject textures exceeding these limits *before* passing them to raylib.
    3.  **Maximum Model Complexity Limits for raylib:**  If loading 3D models with raylib's model loading functions, set limits on the maximum number of vertices, faces, or other complexity metrics. Reject models exceeding these limits *before* they are processed by raylib.
    4.  **Maximum Sound File Size Limits for raylib:** Limit the maximum file size for sound files that can be loaded using raylib's sound loading functions.
    5.  **Memory Usage Monitoring in raylib Context:**  Monitor the application's memory usage *specifically in relation to raylib asset loading*. Implement mechanisms to prevent excessive memory consumption by limiting the number of assets loaded simultaneously *by raylib* or by unloading unused assets managed by raylib.
    6.  **Configuration Options for raylib Asset Limits:**  Consider making resource limits for raylib assets configurable, allowing administrators or users to adjust them based on system resources and performance requirements related to raylib usage.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service via raylib Asset Loading (High Severity):** Attackers could provide excessively large or complex assets to consume excessive memory or processing power *when loaded by raylib*, leading to denial-of-service specifically related to raylib's resource handling.
    *   **Memory Exhaustion due to raylib Assets (High Severity):** Uncontrolled asset loading *through raylib functions* can lead to memory exhaustion, causing crashes or system instability directly linked to raylib's memory footprint.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of denial-of-service and memory exhaustion attacks specifically related to asset loading *performed by raylib*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  There are some implicit limits due to system memory constraints and potential performance issues with very large assets, but no explicit resource limits are enforced within the application *specifically for raylib asset loading*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing explicit resource limits for texture sizes, model complexity, and sound file sizes *when loaded using raylib functions*.  Needs to be implemented in the asset loading routines to prevent resource exhaustion and denial-of-service attacks targeting raylib's asset handling.
