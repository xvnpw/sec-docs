# Attack Surface Analysis for raysan5/raylib

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Image Files](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_image_files.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries by providing specially crafted image files.
    *   **How Raylib Contributes:** Raylib uses libraries like `stb_image` to load various image formats (PNG, JPG, BMP, etc.). If these underlying libraries have vulnerabilities, raylib applications become susceptible when loading untrusted image files using functions like `LoadImage()`.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted PNG file that, when loaded by the raylib application using `LoadImage()`, triggers a buffer overflow in `stb_image`, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potentially remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Keep raylib updated to benefit from updates to its dependencies (like `stb_image`).
            *   Consider using alternative, more robust image loading libraries if security is a primary concern and raylib's abstraction allows for it.
            *   Implement input validation: verify file signatures or basic file structure before attempting to load.
            *   Run the application in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Audio Files](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_audio_files.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in audio decoding libraries by providing specially crafted audio files.
    *   **How Raylib Contributes:** Raylib uses libraries like `dr_wav`, `dr_ogg`, and `dr_mp3` for audio loading. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited when loading untrusted audio files using functions like `LoadSound()` or `LoadMusicStream()`.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a malformed MP3 file that, when loaded by the raylib application, triggers a heap overflow in `dr_mp3`, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potentially remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Keep raylib updated to benefit from updates to its audio decoding dependencies.
            *   Consider using alternative, more secure audio loading libraries if feasible.
            *   Implement input validation: verify file signatures or basic file structure before loading.
            *   Run the application in a sandboxed environment.

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted 3D Model Files](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_3d_model_files.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in 3D model loading code by providing specially crafted model files.
    *   **How Raylib Contributes:** Raylib supports loading various 3D model formats (OBJ, GLTF, IQM, etc.) using functions like `LoadModel()`. Parsing these complex file formats can introduce vulnerabilities if the parsing logic within raylib or its dependencies is flawed.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a malformed OBJ file that, when loaded by the raylib application, triggers a buffer overflow in the OBJ parsing code, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potentially remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Keep raylib updated to benefit from bug fixes in model loading code.
            *   If possible, sanitize or validate model files before loading.
            *   Consider using well-established and actively maintained model loading libraries if raylib's built-in functionality is insufficient from a security perspective.
            *   Run the application in a sandboxed environment.
