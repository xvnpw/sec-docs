# Threat Model Analysis for raysan5/raylib

## Threat: [Malicious Image File Loading](./threats/malicious_image_file_loading.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPG, BMP) to the application. The application uses raylib's image loading functions to process this file. The malicious file exploits a vulnerability in **raylib's image decoding logic**.

**Impact:**  The application could crash, experience memory corruption, or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. The attacker could gain control of the application or the system.

**Affected raylib Component:** `rlLoadImage()`, `LoadImage()`, image loading modules (e.g., internal PNG loader, stb_image *within raylib's build*).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Keep raylib updated to the latest version, as updates often include security fixes for image loading vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using alternative, more robust image loading libraries and integrating them with raylib if security is a major concern.
    *   Implement input validation on file paths and ensure only trusted sources are used for loading images.
    *   Sanitize or validate image data before passing it to raylib's loading functions if possible.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Input Handling](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_input_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides excessively long input strings through keyboard or gamepad input, exceeding the buffer size allocated by **raylib's input handling functions**.

**Impact:** The application could crash, experience memory corruption, or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Affected raylib Component:** Input handling functions like `GetKeyPressed()`, `GetCharPressed()`, `GetGamepadAxisMovement()`, `GetGamepadButtonPressed()`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Be mindful of buffer sizes when handling input.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization to limit the length of input strings.
    *   Avoid directly copying unbounded input into fixed-size buffers.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Resource Handling](./threats/integer_overflow_in_resource_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides input that causes an integer overflow when **raylib calculates the size or number of resources to allocate** (e.g., texture dimensions, number of vertices). This can lead to undersized buffer allocations and subsequent buffer overflows.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Affected raylib Component:** Resource loading and management functions, particularly those dealing with size calculations (e.g., `LoadImage()`, `GenMesh()`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Be cautious of potential integer overflows when performing calculations related to resource sizes.
    *   Implement checks to ensure that calculated sizes are within reasonable bounds.
    *   Use data types that are large enough to prevent overflows.
