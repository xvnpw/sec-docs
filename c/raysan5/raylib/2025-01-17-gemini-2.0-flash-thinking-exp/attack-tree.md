## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):** This represents a broad category of attacks that target how the application receives and processes user input. If not handled securely, it can be a primary entry point for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keyboard Input (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keyboard_input__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Keyboard Input (Critical Node):** Specifically targeting the keyboard input mechanism. Applications often use keyboard input for commands or actions, making it a valuable target.
    *   **Inject Malicious Commands (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the application directly uses keyboard input to execute system commands or internal application functions without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands. For example, if the application takes a filename from keyboard input and passes it to a system call, an attacker could input something like `; rm -rf /` to potentially delete files.
        *   **Impact:**  Can lead to arbitrary command execution on the system, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control, delete data, or install malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Loading Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_loading_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit File Loading Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):** This encompasses attacks that exploit weaknesses in how the application loads and processes external files (images, models, audio).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Loading (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_loading__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Image Loading (Critical Node):** Focusing on vulnerabilities related to loading image files.
    *   **Load Malicious Image Format (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the image decoding libraries (potentially within raylib or its dependencies like `stb_image`). By crafting a specially formatted image file, an attacker can trigger buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues during the decoding process.
        *   **Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to run their own code within the application's context, or cause a denial of service by crashing the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Model Loading (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_model_loading__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Model Loading (Critical Node):** Focusing on vulnerabilities related to loading 3D model files.
    *   **Load Malicious Model Format (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Similar to malicious image loading, this involves crafting or using model files with specific structures or data that exploit vulnerabilities in the model loading code (potentially within raylib or its dependencies). This can trigger memory corruption during parsing or processing of the model data.
        *   **Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Audio Loading (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_audio_loading__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Audio Loading (Critical Node):** Focusing on vulnerabilities related to loading audio files.
    *   **Load Malicious Audio Format (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting audio files with specific formats or malformed data that exploit vulnerabilities in the audio decoding libraries (potentially within raylib or its dependencies like `stb_vorbis`). This can lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues during the decoding process.
        *   **Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Shader Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_shader_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Shader Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):** Targeting weaknesses in how the application handles shaders, especially if it allows loading custom shaders.
    *   **Inject Malicious Shader Code (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the application allows users to provide custom shaders without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious code into the shader. This code will then be executed on the GPU.
        *   **Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the GPU, potentially allowing the attacker to perform malicious actions on the graphics hardware, leak information, or even compromise the system if the GPU driver has vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Management Issues (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_management_issues__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Memory Management Issues (Critical Node):**  Focusing on vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of memory allocation and deallocation within the application or raylib.
    *   **Trigger Use-After-Free Errors (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** This occurs when the application attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can happen due to programming errors in managing pointers and memory lifetimes. Attackers can often manipulate the application's state to trigger these errors at specific times, potentially leading to exploitable conditions.
        *   **Impact:** Can lead to application crashes and, more critically, can be exploited for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the memory that gets allocated in the freed region.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit External Library Dependencies (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_external_library_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit External Library Dependencies (Critical Node):**  Highlighting the risk of vulnerabilities present in the external libraries that raylib (or the application using raylib) depends on.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Linked Libraries (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Raylib and applications using it often rely on external libraries for tasks like image loading (`stb_image`), audio decoding (`stb_vorbis`), etc. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows or integer overflows), an attacker can exploit them by providing specially crafted input that triggers these vulnerabilities within the dependency.
        *   **Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
