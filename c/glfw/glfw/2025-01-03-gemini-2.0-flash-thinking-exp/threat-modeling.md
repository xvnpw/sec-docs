# Threat Model Analysis for glfw/glfw

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in GLFW Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_glfw_library.md)

*   **Description:** GLFW might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows, use-after-free). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses a vulnerable version of the library. Exploitation could involve crafting specific inputs or triggering specific sequences of GLFW functions to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the application and potentially the system. Denial of service, causing the application to crash or become unusable. Information disclosure, leaking sensitive data from the application's memory.
    *   **Affected GLFW Component:** Potentially any GLFW function, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if exploitable for code execution), High (for denial of service or information disclosure).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update GLFW to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to GLFW.
        *   Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools to scan the application for potential vulnerabilities related to GLFW usage.

## Threat: [Backdoored or Compromised GLFW Build](./threats/backdoored_or_compromised_glfw_build.md)

*   **Description:** If the GLFW library is obtained from an untrusted source or the build process is compromised, the resulting library could contain malicious code injected by an attacker.
    *   **Impact:** The application built with the compromised GLFW library could be compromised, leading to data theft, malware installation on user systems, or other malicious activities performed on behalf of the attacker.
    *   **Affected GLFW Component:** The entire GLFW library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Obtain GLFW from official and trusted sources (e.g., the official GitHub repository or official package managers).
        *   Verify the integrity of the downloaded GLFW binaries using checksums or digital signatures provided by the GLFW developers.
        *   Implement secure build processes and infrastructure to prevent tampering with the build environment.
