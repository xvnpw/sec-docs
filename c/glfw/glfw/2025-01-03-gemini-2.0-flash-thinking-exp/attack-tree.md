## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit GLFW Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_glfw_vulnerabilities.md)

This represents a direct attack on the GLFW library itself. Attackers aim to leverage weaknesses or bugs within the GLFW code to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Known GLFW Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_known_glfw_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers focus on publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in GLFW, often identified by CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) numbers. They may use existing exploit code or develop their own based on the vulnerability details.

    *   **Attack Vector:** By exploiting a known vulnerability, an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or other malicious outcomes depending on the nature of the flaw.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling.md)

This category focuses on manipulating the input mechanisms provided by GLFW (keyboard and mouse) to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Malicious Keyboard Input Injection](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_malicious_keyboard_input_injection.md)

Attackers attempt to inject malicious input through keyboard events to exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes this data.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Inject Command Sequences](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_inject_command_sequences.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application interprets keyboard input as commands without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands that the application will execute, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or access.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Trigger Buffer Overflows](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_trigger_buffer_overflows.md)

**Attack Vector:** By sending excessively long input strings through keyboard events, an attacker can overflow input buffers in the application's memory if proper bounds checking is not implemented. This can lead to crashes, arbitrary code execution, or other memory corruption issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Malicious Mouse Input Injection](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_malicious_mouse_input_injection.md)

Attackers attempt to manipulate mouse events to trigger unintended actions or cause harm to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Simulate Clicks at Arbitrary Coordinates](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_simulate_clicks_at_arbitrary_coordinates.md)

**Attack Vector:** By simulating mouse clicks at specific coordinates, an attacker can bypass intended user interface flows, trigger unintended actions, access restricted areas, or manipulate the application's state in ways not intended by the developers.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Inject Excessive Mouse Events](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_inject_excessive_mouse_events.md)

**Attack Vector:** Flooding the application with a large number of mouse events can overwhelm its processing capabilities, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service, making the application unresponsive or crashing it.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Build Process/Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_build_processdependencies.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities introduced not directly by GLFW's code, but through its dependencies or the build process used to create GLFW.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack on GLFW Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack_on_glfw_dependencies.md)

**Attack Vector:** If a dependency used by GLFW is compromised, attackers can leverage this compromised dependency to inject malicious code or introduce vulnerabilities that can then be exploited in applications using GLFW. This is known as a supply chain attack.
