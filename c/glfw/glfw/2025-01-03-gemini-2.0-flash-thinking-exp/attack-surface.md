# Attack Surface Analysis for glfw/glfw

## Attack Surface: [Input Handling Vulnerabilities (Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick)](./attack_surfaces/input_handling_vulnerabilities_(keyboard,_mouse,_joystick).md)

**Description:**  Improper handling of input data received through GLFW can lead to vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or unexpected program behavior.

**How GLFW Contributes:** GLFW provides the interface for receiving raw input events (key presses, mouse movements, joystick data) from the operating system. If the application doesn't validate or sanitize this data, it becomes a potential entry point for malicious input.

**Example:** An application might allocate a fixed-size buffer to store a key press string received via a GLFW callback. If an attacker can send an extremely long sequence of characters (perhaps through OS-level input manipulation), this could overflow the buffer.

**Impact:**  Memory corruption, application crashes, potential for code execution if the overflow can overwrite critical memory regions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all input received via GLFW callbacks.
    *   Use dynamic memory allocation or sufficiently large buffers to handle potentially long input strings.
    *   Avoid directly using raw input data in security-sensitive operations without proper checks.
    *   Consider using input filtering or rate limiting to prevent excessive input.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in GLFW Callback Functions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_glfw_callback_functions.md)

**Description:**  Security vulnerabilities within the callback functions registered with GLFW can be triggered by malicious events.

**How GLFW Contributes:** GLFW relies on callback functions provided by the application to handle events like key presses, mouse movements, and window resizing. If these callback functions contain vulnerabilities, GLFW acts as the mechanism to trigger them.

**Example:** A developer might implement a keyboard input callback that has a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could then send a specific sequence of keystrokes that, when processed by GLFW and passed to the vulnerable callback, triggers the overflow.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, application crashes, potential for code execution within the context of the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Apply the same security best practices to callback functions as to any other part of the application code.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within callback functions.
    *   Avoid using unsafe functions or patterns in callback functions.
    *   Regularly review and test callback function implementations for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Use of Outdated or Vulnerable GLFW Version](./attack_surfaces/use_of_outdated_or_vulnerable_glfw_version.md)

**Description:**  Using an old version of GLFW that contains known security vulnerabilities exposes the application to those risks.

**How GLFW Contributes:** The GLFW library itself might have vulnerabilities that are discovered and patched over time. Using an outdated version means the application is still susceptible to these known issues.

**Example:** A publicly disclosed vulnerability in a specific version of GLFW's input handling could be exploited by an attacker if the application is still using that vulnerable version.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from application crashes to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Keep the GLFW library updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Monitor GLFW release notes and security advisories for updates and vulnerability information.
    *   Use dependency management tools to easily update GLFW.
