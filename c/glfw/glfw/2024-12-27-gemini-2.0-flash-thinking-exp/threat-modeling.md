## High and Critical GLFW Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the GLFW library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Actions & How) | Impact | Affected GLFW Component(s) | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Input Spoofing/Injection** | An attacker crafts or intercepts input events (keyboard, mouse, joystick) and sends malicious or unexpected input to the application through GLFW. This could be done via malicious drivers, hardware manipulation, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying OS input handling that GLFW relies on, leading to GLFW passing on the malicious input. | Application performs unintended actions, bypasses security checks, triggers vulnerabilities, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or data manipulation within the application's context. | `glfwPollEvents`, `glfwWaitEvents`, `glfwSetKeyCallback`, `glfwSetCursorPosCallback`, `glfwSetMouseButtonCallback`, `glfwSetJoystickCallback` (Input handling functions) | High | **Developers:** Validate and sanitize all input data received through GLFW. Implement robust state management to prevent unexpected transitions based on spoofed input. Consider platform-specific input validation if necessary. Use secure communication channels if input is received remotely. **Users:** Keep operating system and drivers updated. Be cautious about connecting untrusted input devices. |
| **Native Code Vulnerabilities (Memory Corruption)** | Vulnerabilities in GLFW's native code (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free, integer overflows) could be exploited by an attacker to gain control of the application's execution flow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This could be triggered by providing crafted input processed by GLFW or by exploiting internal logic flaws within GLFW's native implementation. | Full system compromise, data breach, malware installation, elevation of privilege. | Core GLFW library (platform-specific implementations, internal event handling, etc.) | Critical | **Developers:** Keep GLFW updated to benefit from security patches. Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools on the application and its dependencies, including GLFW. Ensure the build environment for GLFW is secure. Follow secure coding practices in any code interacting directly with GLFW's native interface. **Users:** Keep the application and GLFW updated. |
| **API Misuse Leading to Security Issues** | While not a direct vulnerability *in* GLFW's code, improper use of GLFW's API by the application developer can create security vulnerabilities that directly stem from how GLFW is used. For example, mishandling window handles provided by GLFW, failing to properly initialize or terminate GLFW leading to resource leaks or undefined behavior exploitable by an attacker. | Potential for memory corruption, arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure depending on the specific misuse of GLFW's API. | Various GLFW API functions depending on the specific misuse. | High | **Developers:** Thoroughly understand GLFW's API and best practices. Conduct code reviews and security testing to identify potential misuse. Follow secure coding guidelines. Use static analysis tools to detect potential API misuse. **Users:** Difficult to mitigate directly. Rely on developers to use the library correctly. |
