# Attack Tree Analysis for glfw/glfw

Objective: Gain unauthorized control or access to the application or the system it runs on by leveraging vulnerabilities in the GLFW library. This could manifest as arbitrary code execution within the application's context, denial of service, information disclosure, or manipulation of the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Malicious Keyboard Input Sequence [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/send_malicious_keyboard_input_sequence__critical_.md)

An attacker crafts specific sequences of keyboard input designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes this data. This could involve sending overly long strings to trigger buffer overflows or specific character combinations to exploit logic flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow in Input Buffer *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_in_input_buffer___critical_.md)

The application fails to properly validate the length of keyboard input, allowing an attacker to send more data than the allocated buffer can hold. This overwrites adjacent memory, potentially allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Flaws in Input Handling (e.g., command injection) *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/logic_flaws_in_input_handling__e_g___command_injection____critical_.md)

The application uses keyboard input in a way that allows an attacker to inject unintended commands. For example, if the input is used to construct a system command without proper sanitization, the attacker could inject malicious commands that are then executed by the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Clipboard *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_clipboard___critical_.md)

An attacker places malicious data onto the system clipboard. This could be executable code, scripts, or data designed to exploit vulnerabilities when the application retrieves and processes clipboard content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Pastes and Executes Malicious Content *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/application_pastes_and_executes_malicious_content___critical_.md)

The application retrieves data from the clipboard without proper sanitization or validation and then processes it in a way that leads to the execution of the attacker's malicious content. This could involve interpreting the clipboard data as code or using it in a vulnerable context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise GLFW Source Code (Supply Chain Attack) *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_glfw_source_code__supply_chain_attack____critical_.md)

An attacker gains unauthorized access to the GLFW source code repository and injects malicious code. This compromised code is then included in subsequent releases of GLFW, affecting all applications that build against the infected version.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Builds and Includes Vulnerable GLFW *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/application_builds_and_includes_vulnerable_glfw___critical_.md)

The development team unknowingly builds their application using a compromised version of GLFW containing malicious code introduced through a supply chain attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise GLFW Pre-compiled Binaries (Supply Chain Attack) *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_glfw_pre-compiled_binaries__supply_chain_attack____critical_.md)

An attacker replaces legitimate GLFW pre-compiled binaries with malicious versions. Developers who download and link against these compromised binaries unknowingly introduce vulnerabilities into their applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Links Against Malicious GLFW *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/application_links_against_malicious_glfw___critical_.md)

The application is linked against a compromised GLFW binary, directly incorporating the attacker's malicious code into the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Those Dependencies *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_those_dependencies___critical_.md)

GLFW relies on other third-party libraries. Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies, indirectly compromising the application that uses GLFW.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Does Not Properly Handle Errors *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/application_does_not_properly_handle_errors___critical_.md)

The application fails to check the return values of GLFW functions or handle error conditions appropriately. This can lead to unexpected program states, resource leaks, or create opportunities for attackers to exploit undefined behavior.
