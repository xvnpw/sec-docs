# Threat Model Analysis for glfw/glfw

## Threat: [DLL Hijacking/Loading Unintended Libraries](./threats/dll_hijackingloading_unintended_libraries.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker places a malicious DLL file named `glfw.dll` in a directory that the application searches before the legitimate GLFW installation directory. When the application starts, it loads the attacker's DLL instead of the genuine one. The attacker can then execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the application.
    *   **How:** This often involves exploiting weaknesses in the Windows DLL loading mechanism, such as placing the malicious DLL in the application's working directory or a directory listed in the system's PATH environment variable before the legitimate GLFW location.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the user's system. The attacker can steal data, install malware, control the system, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Affected GLFW Component:**
    *   **Component:**  GLFW library loading mechanism on Windows. Specifically, the operating system's dynamic linking process when loading `glfw.dll`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Load GLFW using absolute paths.
    *   Ensure the application's working directory is not writable by untrusted users.
    *   Consider using secure DLL loading techniques provided by the operating system.
    *   Distribute the application with the GLFW DLL in the same directory as the executable.

## Threat: [Input Handling Vulnerabilities (Buffer Overflow in Keyboard Input)](./threats/input_handling_vulnerabilities__buffer_overflow_in_keyboard_input_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker sends an excessively long sequence of characters as keyboard input to the application. If GLFW's internal buffer for handling keyboard input is not sufficiently sized or bounds-checked, this can lead to a buffer overflow.
    *   **How:** This could be achieved through automated input injection or by manipulating input devices in unexpected ways.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow overwrites critical memory regions.
*   **Affected GLFW Component:**
    *   **Component:** `glfwPollEvents`, `glfwWaitEvents`, and related functions that process keyboard input events. Internal buffers used to store keyboard input data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep GLFW updated to benefit from bug fixes.
    *   While developers cannot directly modify GLFW's internal input handling, they should be aware of this potential risk and report any suspicious behavior to the GLFW developers.

## Threat: [Build and Distribution Chain Compromise (Malicious GLFW Library)](./threats/build_and_distribution_chain_compromise__malicious_glfw_library_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker compromises the official GLFW build process or distribution channels and injects malicious code into the GLFW library itself.
    *   **How:** This could involve compromising the GLFW GitHub repository, build servers, or distribution websites.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:**  Any application using the compromised version of GLFW will be vulnerable to the attacker's malicious code. This could lead to widespread compromise.
*   **Affected GLFW Component:**
    *   **Component:** The entire GLFW library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Download GLFW from official and trusted sources.
    *   Verify the integrity of downloaded files using checksums or signatures if provided by the GLFW developers.
    *   Be cautious about using pre-built binaries from untrusted sources.
