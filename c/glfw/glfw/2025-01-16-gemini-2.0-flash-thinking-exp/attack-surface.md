# Attack Surface Analysis for glfw/glfw

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Keycode Injection/Spoofing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_keycode_injectionspoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially inject or spoof keyboard events, causing the application to react as if specific keys were pressed.
    *   **How GLFW Contributes:** GLFW is responsible for capturing and reporting keyboard events from the operating system to the application. A vulnerability in this process could allow manipulation of these reported events.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a key combination that triggers an administrative function or bypasses authentication within the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially high, leading to unauthorized actions, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers should implement robust input validation and not solely rely on GLFW's reported keycodes without further checks.
        *   Developers should consider using higher-level input handling mechanisms or libraries that provide additional security features.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Mouse Event Injection/Spoofing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_mouse_event_injectionspoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject or spoof mouse events (clicks, movements, scrolling), causing the application to react as if the user performed specific actions.
    *   **How GLFW Contributes:** GLFW captures and reports mouse events, including position and button states, to the application. Vulnerabilities here could allow manipulation of this data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a click event on a "delete" button or manipulates mouse movements to bypass security checks in a graphical interface.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially high, leading to unintended actions, data loss, or manipulation of the application state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers should validate mouse events, especially those triggering critical actions, and not solely rely on GLFW's reported data.
        *   Developers should implement rate limiting or other mechanisms to prevent rapid injection of mouse events.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure to Malicious Clipboard Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_to_malicious_clipboard_data.md)

*   **Description:** If an application uses GLFW to retrieve data from the system clipboard without proper sanitization, it could be vulnerable to malicious data placed on the clipboard by an attacker.
    *   **How GLFW Contributes:** GLFW provides functions to interact with the system clipboard (e.g., `glfwGetClipboardString`). If the application directly uses the returned string without validation, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker places a specially crafted string on the clipboard that, when retrieved and processed by the application, triggers a buffer overflow or other vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High, depending on how the application processes the clipboard data. Could lead to crashes, code execution, or information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers **must** sanitize and validate any data retrieved from the clipboard using GLFW before processing it.
        *   Developers should be aware of potential encoding issues and handle different clipboard formats securely.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of File Drop Handling with Malicious Paths](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_file_drop_handling_with_malicious_paths.md)

*   **Description:** If an application relies on GLFW's file drop functionality, vulnerabilities in how GLFW reports the dropped file paths could allow an attacker to provide malicious or unexpected file paths, potentially leading to access of sensitive files or execution of arbitrary code if the application doesn't properly validate the paths.
    *   **How GLFW Contributes:** GLFW provides callbacks that report the paths of files dropped onto the application window. If the application directly uses these paths without validation, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker drags a file with a specially crafted path (e.g., containing "../../../") onto the application window, and the application attempts to access a file outside of its intended directory.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High, potentially leading to unauthorized file access or code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers **must** validate and sanitize file paths received through GLFW's file drop callbacks.
        *   Developers should use secure file access methods and avoid directly using user-provided paths for critical operations.
