# Threat Model Analysis for glfw/glfw

## Threat: [Malicious Input Injection](./threats/malicious_input_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, either with physical access or through a compromised input device/driver/accessibility tool, crafts and sends a sequence of malicious keyboard, mouse, or joystick input events to the application. The attacker might send an extremely high volume of events, unexpected combinations, or sequences designed to trigger edge cases or vulnerabilities in the application's input handling logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): The application becomes unresponsive due to input overload.
        *   Unexpected Application Behavior: The application performs unintended actions, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized access if input is used to control sensitive operations.
        *   Security Bypass: Authentication or authorization mechanisms that rely on user input are circumvented.
    *   **GLFW Component Affected:**
        *   Input handling functions: `glfwSetKeyCallback`, `glfwSetCharCallback`, `glfwSetMouseButtonCallback`, `glfwSetCursorPosCallback`, `glfwSetScrollCallback`, `glfwSetJoystickCallback`, and related polling functions like `glfwGetKey`, `glfwGetMouseButton`, `glfwGetCursorPos`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of *all* input received through GLFW. Check data types, ranges, lengths, and expected sequences. Reject any input that doesn't conform to expected patterns.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate at which input events are processed to prevent DoS. Implement a queue or buffer with a maximum size, discarding excess events.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Before using input in any sensitive context (e.g., file paths, system commands, database queries), sanitize it to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
        *   **Context-Aware Input Handling:** Design the application to be aware of its current state (e.g., which window or dialog is active) and only accept input that is relevant to that state. Ignore irrelevant input.
        *   **Debouncing/Filtering:** For button presses or other discrete events, implement debouncing to prevent multiple events from being triggered by a single physical action.

## Threat: [Clipboard Data Theft/Manipulation](./threats/clipboard_data_theftmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious application running on the same system monitors the clipboard. When the user copies sensitive data (passwords, API keys, etc.), the malicious application steals it. Alternatively, the malicious application replaces the clipboard contents with malicious data, which the GLFW-using application then unknowingly pastes and processes.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information Disclosure: Sensitive user data is stolen.
        *   Data Corruption/Malicious Input: The application processes malicious data pasted from the clipboard, leading to unexpected behavior, code execution, or data corruption.
    *   **GLFW Component Affected:**
        *   Clipboard functions: `glfwSetClipboardString`, `glfwGetClipboardString`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize Clipboard Use:** Avoid using the clipboard for sensitive data whenever possible. Use alternative methods for transferring data within the application.
        *   **User Confirmation (Get):** Before retrieving clipboard contents using `glfwGetClipboardString`, prompt the user for explicit permission. Clearly explain why the application needs to access the clipboard.
        *   **Data Validation (Paste):** If the application *must* paste data from the clipboard, treat it as untrusted input. Implement *strict* validation and sanitization *before* using the pasted data in any way.
        *   **Clear Clipboard (Set):** After the application has finished using sensitive data that was placed on the clipboard (e.g., after a "copy" operation), consider clearing the clipboard using `glfwSetClipboardString(window, "")` to minimize the window of opportunity for theft.
        * **Transient Clipboard Use:** If possible, only hold sensitive data on the clipboard for the shortest possible time.

## Threat: [GLFW Library Vulnerability](./threats/glfw_library_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability exists within the GLFW library itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, integer overflow, or logic error). An attacker crafts input or exploits a specific sequence of GLFW function calls to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary Code Execution: The attacker gains control of the application's process.
        *   Denial of Service: The application crashes.
        *   Information Disclosure: The attacker gains access to sensitive data.
    *   **GLFW Component Affected:** Potentially any part of the GLFW library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a vulnerability is discovered and exploitable)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep GLFW Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable release of GLFW. This is the *most important* mitigation. New releases often include security fixes.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories or mailing lists related to GLFW (and its dependencies) to be notified of any newly discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   **Static/Dynamic Analysis:** Consider using static analysis tools (e.g., code scanners) or dynamic analysis tools (e.g., fuzzers) to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities in the GLFW library (and your application's code). This is more advanced and typically done by security researchers or experienced developers.
