## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_buffer_overflow_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  This is a classic attack where an attacker provides more data than a buffer can hold, overwriting adjacent memory.  This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Critical Node:** 1.1.1 Input Handling (Window/Monitor/Joystick/Cursor)
    *   **Why Critical:**  All external input to GLFW functions is a potential source of buffer overflows.  Proper input validation *before* calling GLFW functions is the primary defense.
*   **High-Risk Sub-Path:** 1.1.1.4 Cursor Image Buffer Overflow
    *   **Attack Vector:** 1.1.1.4.1 Provide Malicious Cursor Image (CVE-like, hypothetical)
        *   **Description:** The attacker provides a specially crafted cursor image (e.g., a BMP, PNG, or custom format) that, when processed by GLFW (or the underlying OS libraries), causes a buffer overflow.  This could be due to an improperly handled image size, a vulnerability in the image parsing code, or a combination of factors.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (GLFW and OS likely have image validation, but a bypass is possible)
        *   **Impact:** High (ACE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding a vulnerability in image parsing)
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Might be caught by antivirus or image validation routines)
* **1.1.2 Internal Data Structure Corruption**
    *   **Attack Vector:** 1.1.2.1 Trigger Specific GLFW Function Sequences to Corrupt Internal Buffers (Hypothetical, complex)
        *   **Description:** By calling a very specific, and likely undocumented, sequence of GLFW functions, the attacker might be able to manipulate GLFW's internal state in a way that leads to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption, even if the individual inputs to each function appear valid. This would require a deep understanding of GLFW's internal workings.
        *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Very High
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Exploit Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_exploit_use-after-free_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** This occurs when memory is freed, but a pointer to that memory is still used.  An attacker can potentially control the contents of the freed memory, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Critical Node:** 1.2.1.2 Improper Context Handling After Error
    *   **Why Critical:**  If GLFW encounters an error and the application doesn't properly handle it (e.g., by destroying the context or resetting relevant variables), subsequent use of the context might lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
    *   **Attack Vector:** 1.2.1.2.1 Force Error, then Access Context (Hypothetical)
        *   **Description:** The attacker intentionally triggers an error condition in GLFW (e.g., by providing invalid input).  If the application doesn't properly check for the error and continues to use the GLFW context, it might access freed memory.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (GLFW should handle errors gracefully, but a vulnerability is possible)
        *   **Impact:** High (ACE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding a specific error handling flaw)
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Might be detected by error logging or crash analysis)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit Integer Overflow/Underflow Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_integer_overflowunderflow_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Integer overflows/underflows occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large or too small to be represented by the data type.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows.
*   **High-Risk Sub-Path:** 1.3.1 Window Size/Position Calculations
    *   **Attack Vector:** 1.3.1.1 Provide Extremely Large/Small Values to Trigger Overflow (CVE-like, hypothetical) [CRITICAL]
        *   **Description:** The attacker provides extremely large or small values for window dimensions or position to a GLFW function (e.g., `glfwSetWindowSize`).  If GLFW doesn't properly handle these values, an integer overflow/underflow could occur during internal calculations, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (GLFW likely has some size checks, but an oversight is possible)
        *   **Impact:** High (ACE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding a vulnerable function and crafting appropriate input)
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Might be caught by input validation or crash analysis)
*   **High-Risk Sub-Path:** 1.3.2 Image Dimension Calculations (Cursor/Icon)
    *   **Attack Vector:** 1.3.2.1 Provide Malicious Image Dimensions (Hypothetical) [CRITICAL]
        *   **Description:** Similar to 1.3.1.1, but the attacker provides malicious dimensions for a cursor or icon image.  This could lead to an integer overflow/underflow during memory allocation or image processing.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Similar to 1.3.1.1)
        *   **Impact:** High (ACE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Triggering Assertions/Crashes [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_triggering_assertionscrashes__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  While not as severe as ACE, causing a crash can still disrupt service.  This is often achieved by providing invalid input.
*   **Critical Node:** 2.2.1 Invalid Input to GLFW Functions
    *   **Why Critical:**  GLFW functions are designed to handle valid input.  Providing invalid input (NULL pointers, invalid handles, out-of-range values) is expected to cause errors or crashes, but the application should handle these gracefully.
    *   **Attack Vector:** 2.2.1.1 Provide NULL Pointers, Invalid Handles, Out-of-Range Values (Expected behavior, but can be DoS)
        *   **Description:** The attacker deliberately provides invalid input to GLFW functions.  This is a simple but effective way to cause a crash if the application doesn't have robust error handling.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (Easy to trigger)
        *   **Impact:** Low to Medium (Application crash)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (Crash logs)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Deadlock/Livelock [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_deadlocklivelock__high_risk_.md)

* **Description:** Occurs when multiple threads are blocked, waiting for each other, preventing any progress.
* **Critical Node:** 2.3.1 Improper Threading with GLFW Calls
    * **Why Critical:** GLFW has specific threading requirements. Violating these can lead to deadlocks or other threading-related issues.
    * **Attack Vector:** 2.3.1.1 Call GLFW Functions from Multiple Threads Without Proper Synchronization (Application-level, but GLFW-related) [CRITICAL]
        * **Description:** The application calls GLFW functions from multiple threads without using the necessary synchronization mechanisms (mutexes, etc.) as specified in the GLFW documentation. This is primarily an application-level error, but it's directly related to the use of GLFW.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (Common programming error)
        * **Impact:** Low to Medium (Application crash or deadlock)
        * **Effort:** Low (Accidental, not a targeted attack)
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of threading)
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Difficult to reproduce, requires debugging)
