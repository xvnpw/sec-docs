# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for glfw/glfw

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep GLFW Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep_glfw_up-to-date.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Current Version:** Determine the currently used GLFW version in your project. This is usually found in your project's build configuration files (e.g., CMakeLists.txt, package.json, etc.) or dependency management system.
2.  **Check for Updates:** Regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly) visit the official GLFW website ([https://www.glfw.org/](https://www.glfw.org/)) or its GitHub repository ([https://github.com/glfw/glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)). Look for announcements of new releases, paying close attention to release notes and changelogs.
3.  **Subscribe to Notifications:** Subscribe to the GLFW mailing list or follow the GitHub repository to receive notifications about new releases and security updates.
4.  **Update Dependency:** If a newer version is available, update the GLFW dependency in your project. The specific steps depend on your build system and dependency manager:
    *   **CMake (FetchContent):** Modify the `FetchContent_Declare` command to specify the new version tag or commit hash.
    *   **vcpkg:** Run `vcpkg update` and `vcpkg upgrade glfw3` (or the appropriate package name).
    *   **Conan:** Update the `conanfile.txt` or `conanfile.py` to specify the new version and run `conan install`.
    *   **Manual Integration:** Download the new GLFW source code or pre-built binaries and replace the old files in your project. Update include paths and library links as needed.
5.  **Test Thoroughly:** After updating, thoroughly test your application.
6.  **Establish Update Policy:** Create a formal policy within your development team that mandates updating GLFW.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: Critical):** Older GLFW versions might contain publicly known vulnerabilities.
*   **Buffer Overflows (Severity: Critical):** Vulnerabilities in input handling or window management.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Vulnerabilities might allow attackers to crash the application.
*   **Unexpected Behavior (Severity: Medium):** Bugs in older versions can cause unexpected behavior.

**Impact:**
*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced to near zero for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Buffer Overflows:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - Needs to be filled in based on the actual project)
*   Partially implemented. GLFW version is checked during the build process.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - Needs to be filled in based on the actual project)
*   No automated update checks or notifications.
*   No formal update policy.
*   No subscription to GLFW notifications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate GLFW Initialization and Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/validate_glfw_initialization_and_configuration.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Check `glfwInit()` Return Value:**  Immediately after calling `glfwInit()`, check its return value. If it returns `GLFW_FALSE`, handle the error appropriately (log, display message, exit). Do *not* proceed with further GLFW calls.
2.  **Explicitly Set Window Hints:** Before `glfwCreateWindow()`, use `glfwWindowHint()` to explicitly set *all* relevant window attributes.  Do *not* rely on defaults.  Key hints:
    *   `GLFW_VISIBLE`
    *   `GLFW_RESIZABLE`
    *   `GLFW_CLIENT_API`
    *   `GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR` and `GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR`
    *   `GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE`
    *   `GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT`
3.  **Verify Window Attributes:** After `glfwCreateWindow()`, use `glfwGetWindowAttrib()` to verify that the requested attributes were actually set.
4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for all GLFW function calls. Check return values and error states.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Undefined Behavior (Severity: Medium):** Incorrect initialization or configuration.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Unexpected window attributes.
*   **Compatibility Issues (Severity: Low):** Relying on default values.
*   **Information Leak (Severity: Low):** Uninitialized window data.

**Impact:**
*   **Undefined Behavior:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced.
*   **Compatibility Issues:** Risk reduced.
*   **Information Leak:** Risk minimized.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example)
*   `glfwInit()` return value is checked.
*   Some window hints are set explicitly.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
*   Not all relevant window hints are set explicitly.
*   Window attributes are not verified after creation.
*   Comprehensive error handling is not consistent.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Handle Input Events Securely (Focus on GLFW API Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/handle_input_events_securely__focus_on_glfw_api_usage_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Input Callbacks:** Identify all GLFW callback functions used (e.g., `glfwSetKeyCallback`, `glfwSetCursorPosCallback`, `glfwSetMouseButtonCallback`, `glfwSetScrollCallback`, `glfwSetJoystickCallback`).
2. **Use Correct Callback Functions:** Ensure you are using the appropriate callback function for the type of input you want to handle.  Don't try to handle keyboard input in a mouse callback, for example.
3. **Check Joystick Connection:** If using joystick input, use `glfwJoystickPresent()` to check if a joystick is actually connected *before* attempting to get input from it.  Use `glfwSetJoystickCallback` to be notified of joystick connection and disconnection events.
4. **Get Input Values Correctly:** Within the callbacks, use the correct GLFW functions to get the input values:
    *   **Keyboard:** Use the provided `key` and `scancode` parameters.
    *   **Mouse:** Use the provided `xpos` and `ypos` parameters.  Use `glfwGetCursorPos()` if you need the cursor position outside of a callback.
    *   **Joystick:** Use `glfwGetJoystickAxes()`, `glfwGetJoystickButtons()`, and `glfwGetJoystickHats()` to get the state of the joystick.  Use `glfwGetJoystickName()` to get the name of the joystick.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unexpected Behavior (Severity: Medium):** Using incorrect callback functions or accessing input data incorrectly can lead to unexpected behavior.
*   **Crashes (Severity: High):** Accessing invalid memory (e.g., trying to read joystick data when no joystick is connected) can cause crashes.
* **Logic Errors (Severity: Medium):** Incorrectly interpreting input data can lead to logic errors in your application.

**Impact:**
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** Risk significantly reduced by using the correct GLFW API functions.
*   **Crashes:** Risk significantly reduced by checking for joystick presence and using appropriate functions.
*   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced by correctly interpreting input data.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example)
*   Basic GLFW input callbacks are set up.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
*   `glfwJoystickPresent()` is not consistently used before accessing joystick data.
*   No handling of joystick connection/disconnection events.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor for and Handle GLFW Errors](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_for_and_handle_glfw_errors.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Set Error Callback:**  At the start of your application, use `glfwSetErrorCallback()` to set a custom error callback function.
2.  **Log Errors:**  Within the error callback, log the error code and description (provided as arguments to the callback).
3.  **Take Corrective Action:**  Based on the error code, consider taking corrective action (e.g., reinitializing GLFW, displaying an error, exiting).
4.  **Do Not Ignore Errors:**  Never silently ignore GLFW errors.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Masked Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium):** Ignoring errors can mask underlying vulnerabilities.
*   **Undefined Behavior (Severity: Medium):** Errors can indicate an undefined state.
*   **Debugging Difficulties (Severity: Low):** Proper error handling aids debugging.

**Impact:**
*   **Masked Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** Risk reduced.
*   **Debugging Difficulties:** Improved debugging.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example)
*   An error callback is set.
*   Errors are logged to `stderr`.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
*   No sophisticated error handling or corrective actions.
*   Error logging is basic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Isolate GLFW Context (Focus on GLFW API Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/isolate_glfw_context__focus_on_glfw_api_usage_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Single-Threaded GLFW:** Restrict all GLFW calls to the thread that created the GLFW window and context. This is the recommended and safest approach.
2.  **Multi-Threaded GLFW (with extreme caution):** If absolutely necessary:
    *   **One Context Per Thread:** Each thread interacting with GLFW *must* have its *own* GLFW window and context. Do *not* share contexts.
    *   **No Cross-Thread Calls:** Do *not* make GLFW calls for a context from a different thread.
3. **Understand `glfwMakeContextCurrent()`:** If you have multiple contexts, use `glfwMakeContextCurrent()` to make a specific context current *before* making any OpenGL (or other rendering API) calls.  Ensure that the correct context is current for each thread.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Race Conditions (Severity: High):** Concurrent access without synchronization.
*   **Deadlocks (Severity: High):** Improper synchronization.
*   **Undefined Behavior (Severity: Medium):** Thread-safety violations.

**Impact:**
*   **Race Conditions:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Deadlocks:** Risk reduced.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example)
*   GLFW is used primarily in the main thread.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
*   No formal documentation of the threading model.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Deprecated Functions](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_deprecated_functions.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review GLFW Documentation:** Regularly check the official GLFW documentation for deprecated functions.
2.  **Identify Deprecated Function Usage:** Search your codebase for calls to deprecated GLFW functions.
3.  **Refactor Code:** Replace deprecated functions with their recommended replacements (as indicated in the GLFW documentation).
4.  **Enable Compiler Warnings:** Use compiler flags (e.g., `-Wdeprecated` with GCC/Clang) to get warnings about deprecated function usage.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Security Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable):** Deprecated functions may have known vulnerabilities.
*   **Compatibility Issues (Severity: Medium):** Deprecated functions may be removed in the future.
*   **Undefined Behavior (Severity: Medium):** Deprecated functions may have undefined behavior.

**Impact:**
*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced.
*   **Compatibility Issues:** Risk reduced.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example)
* Compiler warnings for deprecated functions are enabled.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
* No active effort to replace all deprecated GLFW function calls.
* No regular review of GLFW documentation.
