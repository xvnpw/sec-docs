# Attack Surface Analysis for glfw/glfw

## Attack Surface: [Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities related to how GLFW processes and delivers input events to the application.  This is a *direct* attack surface because GLFW is responsible for receiving and initially processing the raw input.
*   **GLFW Contribution:** GLFW acts as the intermediary between the OS and the application for keyboard, mouse, joystick, and gamepad input. It handles the low-level event processing and delivery via callbacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input stream (e.g., using a virtual keyboard or modified joystick driver) that sends a rapid sequence of key presses or out-of-range joystick values.  This directly targets GLFW's input handling.
*   **Impact:** Denial-of-service (DoS) is highly likely.  Arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation are *possible* if the application does not properly sanitize the input received from GLFW's callbacks before using it in security-sensitive operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the application's subsequent handling of the input).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Input Validation:** *Crucially*, treat all input from GLFW callbacks as untrusted. Rigorously validate and sanitize all input data *within the callback functions* before using it. Check for data types, ranges, and expected values. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on input events to prevent flooding attacks. Limit the number of events processed per unit of time. This mitigates DoS directly targeting GLFW's input processing.
        *   **Safe Input Handling:** Avoid using raw input values directly in security-sensitive operations. Use parameterized queries, escaping, or other appropriate techniques *after* validating the input from GLFW.
        *   **State Machines:** Employ robust input handling mechanisms like state machines to prevent unexpected input sequences from causing harm.
    *   **User:**
        *   Use trusted input devices and drivers.

## Attack Surface: [Underlying System API Vulnerabilities (Direct Interaction)](./attack_surfaces/underlying_system_api_vulnerabilities__direct_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system APIs (Win32, X11, Cocoa, Wayland) *specifically* in how GLFW interacts with them. This is distinct from general OS vulnerabilities; it focuses on GLFW's *code* that calls these APIs.
*   **GLFW Contribution:** GLFW directly calls into these platform-specific APIs to perform window management, event handling, and context creation. A bug in GLFW's *usage* of these APIs is the direct vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical buffer overflow in GLFW's code that interacts with the X11 server when handling a specific, unusual window event. This is *not* a general X11 vulnerability, but a flaw in GLFW's code that uses X11.
*   **Impact:** System instability, potentially arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation (depending on the nature of the flaw in GLFW's interaction with the underlying API).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific API interaction and platform).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Keep GLFW Updated:** This is the *primary* mitigation. Use the latest version of GLFW to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address issues in its interaction with underlying APIs.  GLFW developers actively fix such issues.
        *   **Platform Awareness:** While primarily GLFW's responsibility, being aware of the security implications of the target platforms and their windowing systems can inform testing and code review.
    *   **User:**
        *   Keep the operating system and its components (especially windowing systems) updated. This provides a secondary layer of defense, as underlying API vulnerabilities are often patched by OS updates.
