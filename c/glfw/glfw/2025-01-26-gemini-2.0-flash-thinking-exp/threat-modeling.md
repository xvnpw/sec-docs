# Threat Model Analysis for glfw/glfw

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow/Memory Corruption in Input Processing](./threats/buffer_overflowmemory_corruption_in_input_processing.md)

Description: An attacker might send malformed or excessively long input data (e.g., joystick data, keyboard input) to exploit potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in GLFW's input processing code. This directly targets vulnerabilities within GLFW's code handling input.
Impact: Application crashes, denial of service, potentially arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overflowed data due to a flaw in GLFW.
GLFW Component Affected: Input Module (Specific input processing functions for Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick within GLFW library)
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Ensure GLFW is updated to the latest stable version, patching known vulnerabilities. This is the primary mitigation as the vulnerability is within GLFW itself.
    *   Report any suspected buffer overflow vulnerabilities to the GLFW developers to ensure they are addressed in future releases.

## Threat: [Known Vulnerabilities in GLFW (CVEs)](./threats/known_vulnerabilities_in_glfw__cves_.md)

Description: GLFW itself might contain publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities (CVEs) that an attacker could exploit if the application uses a vulnerable version. These are vulnerabilities inherent to the GLFW library code.
Impact: Ranging from denial of service to arbitrary code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability within GLFW.
GLFW Component Affected: Various GLFW modules depending on the specific CVE (vulnerability within GLFW code).
Risk Severity: Critical to High (depending on the CVE and exploitability of the vulnerability in GLFW)
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   **Crucially:** Regularly update GLFW to the latest stable version. This is the most important step to mitigate known GLFW vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories and CVE databases for known vulnerabilities in GLFW to be aware of potential risks and necessary updates.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management process to track and address known vulnerabilities in GLFW as part of dependency management.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise](./threats/supply_chain_compromise.md)

Description: The GLFW library itself could be compromised during development or distribution, leading to malicious code being injected directly into the GLFW library.
Impact: Distribution of backdoored or malicious GLFW versions, potentially allowing attackers to compromise applications using it, leading to data breaches, malware installation, etc., because the core library itself is compromised.
GLFW Component Affected: Entire GLFW library (if the distributed GLFW package is compromised).
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Download GLFW only from official and trusted sources (e.g., the official GLFW website, GitHub repository).
    *   Verify checksums of downloaded GLFW binaries against official checksums provided by the GLFW project to ensure integrity.
    *   Consider using build systems that support reproducible builds to verify the integrity of GLFW builds if building from source.
    *   Implement code signing and software provenance verification processes to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the GLFW library used in the application.
