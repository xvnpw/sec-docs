# Threat Model Analysis for rsyslog/liblognorm

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Crafted Rulebase (CPU Exhaustion)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_crafted_rulebase__cpu_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits a maliciously crafted rulebase that, when parsed or used for normalization by `liblognorm`, causes excessive CPU consumption. This leverages vulnerabilities or inefficiencies in `liblognorm`'s rulebase parsing logic or the underlying regular expression engine (e.g., triggering catastrophic backtracking). The attacker's goal is to make the application unresponsive by exhausting CPU resources.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability; denial of service.
    *   **Affected liblognorm Component:**
        *   `liblognorm` parser (functions related to loading and parsing rulebases, e.g., `ln_load_ruleset`, `ln_parse_rule`).
        *   Regular expression engine used by `liblognorm`.
        *   Normalization engine (functions that apply the rules, e.g., `ln_normalize`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Rulebase Validation:** Implement robust validation *before* passing the rulebase to `liblognorm`. This includes checks for excessive complexity, known-bad regex patterns, and limits on rule count and size.  This is crucial to prevent the application from even attempting to load a malicious rulebase.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Use OS-level mechanisms (e.g., `ulimit`, cgroups) to limit the CPU time that `liblognorm` can consume.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Execute `liblognorm`'s parsing and normalization in a separate, sandboxed process with restricted privileges and resources.
        *   **Regular Expression Engine Hardening:** If possible, configure `liblognorm` to use a regular expression engine that is resistant to catastrophic backtracking (e.g., RE2). Investigate `liblognorm`'s configuration options for regex engine selection.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Crafted Rulebase (Memory Exhaustion)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_crafted_rulebase__memory_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted rulebase that, when processed by `liblognorm`, causes excessive memory allocation, leading to an out-of-memory condition. This exploits vulnerabilities in how `liblognorm` handles rulebase parsing and internal data structure creation.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash or unavailability due to out-of-memory errors; denial of service.
    *   **Affected liblognorm Component:**
        *   `liblognorm` parser (functions related to loading and parsing rulebases).
        *   Memory allocation functions within `liblognorm` (internal functions responsible for allocating memory for rule representations).
        *   Normalization engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Rulebase Validation:** (Same as for CPU exhaustion, with a focus on limiting constructs that could lead to large memory allocations).
        *   **Resource Limits:** Use OS-level mechanisms (e.g., `ulimit`, cgroups) to limit the memory that `liblognorm` can consume.
        *   **Sandboxing:** (Same as for CPU exhaustion).
        *   **Memory Usage Monitoring:** Monitor `liblognorm`'s memory usage during rulebase loading and normalization; trigger alerts if it exceeds thresholds.

## Threat: [Security Bypass due to Incorrect Normalization (liblognorm Bug)](./threats/security_bypass_due_to_incorrect_normalization__liblognorm_bug_.md)

*   **Description:** A bug *within* `liblognorm`'s normalization logic causes it to incorrectly normalize a log message, even with a correctly written rulebase. This incorrect normalization leads a security system (relying on the normalized output) to fail to detect malicious activity. This is distinct from a rulebase error; the bug is in `liblognorm` itself.
    *   **Impact:** Security bypass; attacker activity goes undetected.
    *   **Affected liblognorm Component:**
        *   Normalization engine (`ln_normalize` and related functions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Liblognorm Updates:** Keep `liblognorm` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches. This is the *primary* mitigation for bugs within the library itself.
        *   **Redundant Security Checks:** Do not rely *solely* on `liblognorm`'s output for critical security decisions. Implement independent validation and checks.
        *   **Output Validation:** After normalization, validate the output to ensure it conforms to expected data types and constraints. This can help detect some incorrect normalization cases.
        *   **Fuzz Testing of liblognorm:** Contribute to the security of `liblognorm` by fuzz testing it with a wide range of inputs to identify potential bugs.

## Threat: [Code Injection (Highly Unlikely)](./threats/code_injection__highly_unlikely_.md)

*   **Description:** A severe vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, format string vulnerability) *within* `liblognorm`'s code allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted rulebase or log message. This is a direct vulnerability in `liblognorm`.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise; attacker gains full control.
    *   **Affected liblognorm Component:** Potentially any part of `liblognorm` that handles input (parsing, normalization, regular expression processing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (but extremely low likelihood)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Liblognorm Updates:** Keep `liblognorm` updated to the latest version. This is the most important mitigation.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Running `liblognorm` in a sandboxed environment with minimal privileges significantly reduces the impact of a successful code injection.
        *   **Compiler Hardening:** Compile the application and `liblognorm` with all available compiler security features (stack canaries, ASLR, DEP/NX).
        *   **Code Audit:** For extremely high-security applications, consider a professional security audit of the `liblognorm` codebase.
