## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion (CPU and Memory)](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion__cpu_and_memory_.md)

**Description:** The attacker crafts specially designed log messages to consume excessive CPU or memory resources, leading to a Denial of Service.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **CPU Exhaustion:** Sending logs with:
            *   Extremely long fields.
            *   Numerous fields.
            *   Deeply nested structures (if applicable).
            *   Complex regular expressions or custom parsing functions within the rulebase that are triggered by the input.
        *   **Memory Exhaustion:** Sending logs with:
            *   Repeating fields.
            *   Very large fields.
            *   Input designed to exploit memory allocation patterns within `liblognorm`.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High (DoS)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Parsing Logic Flaws (Stack/Heap Overflow - Leading to DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/parsing_logic_flaws__stackheap_overflow_-_leading_to_dos_.md)

**Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in `liblognorm`'s parsing logic to cause a stack or heap overflow, leading to a crash (DoS). While RCE is *possible* from these overflows, it's much harder; the DoS outcome is the more likely and therefore high-risk scenario.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Stack Overflow:** Sending logs with excessively nested structures if `liblognorm` uses recursive parsing without proper bounds checking.
        *   **Heap Overflow:** Sending logs crafted to trigger vulnerabilities in how `liblognorm` allocates and manages memory for parsed data. This could involve specific field types, structures, or sequences of data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (DoS)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (for triggering the crash; much higher for RCE)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (for triggering the crash; Expert for RCE)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Rulebase Corruption (Rule Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/rulebase_corruption__rule_injection_.md)

**Description:** The attacker injects malicious rules into the `liblognorm` rulebase, *if* external loading is allowed and poorly secured. These rules can then be used to cause DoS or potentially RCE.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   If `liblognorm` loads rulebases from external files or network locations without proper validation (e.g., digital signatures, checksums), the attacker could:
            *   Replace a legitimate rulebase with a malicious one.
            *   Modify an existing rulebase to include malicious rules.
            *   Create a new rulebase file in a location that `liblognorm` is configured to read from.
        *   Malicious rules could be designed to:
            *   Cause infinite loops or excessive recursion.
            *   Consume excessive CPU or memory resources.
            *   *Potentially* execute arbitrary code (if the rule engine allows for this, which is highly undesirable).
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (heavily dependent on configuration)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (DoS, potential RCE, data corruption)
    *   **Effort:** Low to High (dependent on security measures)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
