# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rsyslog/liblognorm

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Rulebase Storage and Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_rulebase_storage_and_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Determine which parts of your log data *and the resulting parsed fields* are considered sensitive.
    2.  **Choose Storage Location:** Select a secure directory on the file system *outside* of any web-accessible root.  This directory should *not* be world-readable or writable.
    3.  **Set Permissions:** Use `chmod` and `chown` (or equivalent) to set restrictive permissions:
        *   **Owner:** A dedicated, non-root user account that the application runs under.  Read-only access to the rulebase.
        *   **Group:** A dedicated group (if necessary) with read-only permissions.
        *   **Others:** No permissions (---).
        *   **Write Access:** *Only* an administrative user or a dedicated configuration management process (with elevated privileges *only* during deployment) should have write access.
    4.  **Configuration Management (Optional but Recommended):**
        *   Use Ansible, Chef, Puppet, or SaltStack.
        *   Define the rulebase as a "managed resource."
        *   Enforce correct permissions and ownership.
        *   Version control the rulebase configuration.
    5.  **Remote Storage (If Applicable):**
        *   Use HTTPS with strong ciphers (TLS 1.3) and *validate* the server's certificate.
        *   Implement authentication (API keys, client certificates).
        *   Consider encrypting the rulebase at rest.
    6. **Input Validation for Rulebase Creation (If Applicable):**
        * If users can create/modify rules, *strictly* validate all input.
        * Use a whitelist approach for allowed characters and patterns.
        * Implement input length limits.
        * Sanitize input to remove/escape dangerous characters. Use a dedicated parser for the rulebase syntax, *not* custom regex.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Rulebase Modification (Severity: High):** An attacker could alter rules to cause incorrect parsing, data leakage, DoS, or potentially code execution (by injecting malicious patterns *into the rulebase*).
    *   **Rulebase Disclosure (Severity: Medium to High):** Reading the rulebase reveals how logs are parsed, potentially exposing application internals or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Rulebase Manipulation (Severity: High):** Injecting complex or resource-intensive rules to crash or slow down the application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Rulebase Modification:** Risk significantly reduced. Attacker needs elevated privileges.
    *   **Rulebase Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced. Attacker needs to bypass file system permissions.
    *   **DoS via Rulebase Manipulation:** Risk significantly reduced. Attacker needs elevated privileges.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  *Example: Partially - Permissions set, no config management.* (Replace)

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Example: Config management integration missing. Manual updates.* (Replace)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rulebase Integrity Verification](./mitigation_strategies/rulebase_integrity_verification.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Hashing:**
        *   Use a strong hash function (SHA-256).
        *   Before deployment, calculate the rulebase's SHA-256 hash. Store this hash securely.
        *   In the application, *before* loading, calculate the hash again.
        *   Compare the calculated hash with the stored hash. If they don't match, *abort* loading and log an error.
    2.  **Digital Signatures (Optional but Recommended):**
        *   Generate a private/public key pair. Secure the private key.
        *   Use the private key to digitally sign the rulebase.
        *   Store the public key with the application.
        *   Before loading, verify the signature using the public key. If verification fails, abort and log.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Rulebase Modification (Severity: High):** Detects *any* tampering with the rulebase after initial deployment. This is directly related to `liblognorm` because the rulebase is its core configuration.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (Severity: High) - (If rulebase fetched remotely):** If an attacker intercepts and modifies the rulebase during transfer, the check will fail.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Rulebase Modification:** Risk significantly reduced. Any modification is detected.
    *   **MitM Attack:** Risk significantly reduced (if applicable). Tampering is detected.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Example: Not Implemented.* (Replace)

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Example: Entire mechanism missing.* (Replace)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular `liblognorm` Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular__liblognorm__updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to Security Advisories:** Subscribe to `liblognorm`-related security notifications.
    2.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check the `liblognorm` repository for new releases.
    3.  **Automated Dependency Management (Recommended):** Use a dependency manager to track and update `liblognorm`.
    4.  **Testing:** After updating, thoroughly test your application, especially the `liblognorm` integration.
    5.  **Rollback Plan:** Have a plan to quickly roll back to a previous version if needed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: Varies, potentially Critical):** Addresses vulnerabilities discovered and patched in newer `liblognorm` versions. This is *directly* related to the library itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced. Staying up-to-date is crucial.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Example: Manual updates, no automation.* (Replace)

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Example: Automated dependency management, testing/rollback process.* (Replace)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits (Specifically for liblognorm processing)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits__specifically_for_liblognorm_processing_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify Resource Limits:** Determine appropriate limits for memory, CPU, and processing time *specifically for the liblognorm parsing of a single log entry*.
    2. **Implement Limits:**
        *   **Memory:** Use memory allocation limits. In C/C++, consider `setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS, ...)`.
 This limits the memory `liblognorm` can use *during parsing*.
        *   **CPU:** Use CPU time limits (`setrlimit(RLIMIT_CPU, ...)` in C/C++) or process priorities. This prevents a single log entry + `liblognorm` from monopolizing the CPU.
        *   **Processing Time:** Implement a timeout *around the call to liblognorm's parsing function*. If it exceeds the timeout, terminate and log.
    3. **Monitor Resource Usage:** Continuously monitor `liblognorm`'s resource usage. Investigate if limits are frequently hit.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from crafting log messages that cause `liblognorm` to consume excessive resources, *specifically targeting the library's processing*.

* **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced. Attackers are limited in the resources `liblognorm` can consume *per log entry*.

* **Currently Implemented:** *Example: Not Implemented.* (Replace)

* **Missing Implementation:** *Example: No resource limits on liblognorm.* (Replace)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Fuzz Testing of liblognorm Integration](./mitigation_strategies/fuzz_testing_of_liblognorm_integration.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Choose a Fuzzer:** Select a fuzzer suitable for your application and the input `liblognorm` expects. Consider structured input generation.
    2. **Define Input Corpus:** Create valid log messages representing typical input.
    3. **Configure Fuzzer:** Target the functions in your application that interact *directly with liblognorm*.
    4. **Run Fuzzing Campaign:** Run the fuzzer, monitoring for crashes, hangs, etc.
    5. **Analyze Results:** Investigate any issues. Determine the root cause and fix.
    6. **Integrate into CI/CD:** Integrate fuzzing into your CI/CD pipeline.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unknown Vulnerabilities (Severity: Unknown, potentially Critical):** Discovers vulnerabilities in `liblognorm` *or* in your application's interaction with it. This includes buffer overflows, memory leaks, logic errors, etc., *specifically within the context of liblognorm*.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Unknown Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced. Fuzzing can uncover hidden vulnerabilities.

* **Currently Implemented:** *Example: Not Implemented.* (Replace)

* **Missing Implementation:** *Example: Fuzz testing not part of the process.* (Replace)
