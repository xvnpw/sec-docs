## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via liblognorm (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_liblognorm__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within `liblognorm` to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities in liblognorm (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities_in_liblognorm__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This category of attacks focuses on weaknesses in how `liblognorm` interprets and processes log messages. Successful exploitation can lead to various impactful outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Sending overly long log messages or messages with excessively long fields that exceed the allocated buffer size within `liblognorm`.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Relatively easy to execute with basic knowledge, and the impact of code execution is severe.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inconsistent Parsing Logic (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inconsistent_parsing_logic__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Crafting specially designed log messages that exploit ambiguities or flaws in `liblognorm`'s parsing rules. This can lead to the message being parsed in an unintended way.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect normalization of log data, leading to misinterpretation by the application, potentially bypassing security checks or causing incorrect application behavior.
*   **Why High-Risk:** While the immediate impact might be medium, the potential for security bypasses and flawed application logic makes it a significant concern.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resource Exhaustion in liblognorm (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resource_exhaustion_in_liblognorm__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This category of attacks aims to overwhelm the application by consuming excessive resources through `liblognorm`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Excessive CPU Usage (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_excessive_cpu_usage__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Sending log messages with highly complex patterns that require significant processing time by `liblognorm`.
*   **Impact:** Slowing down the application or rendering it unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Relatively easy to execute, and can quickly impact application availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Excessive Memory Consumption (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_excessive_memory_consumption__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a large volume of unique or complex log messages that cause `liblognorm` to allocate excessive memory.
*   **Impact:** Memory exhaustion, potentially leading to application crashes and denial of service.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Simple to execute by sending large amounts of data, directly impacting application stability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Successfully exhausting either CPU or memory resources through the above methods.
*   **Impact:** Rendering the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Direct and significant impact on application availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Output Manipulation by liblognorm (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_output_manipulation_by_liblognorm__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This category focuses on manipulating the normalized output produced by `liblognorm` to cause harm when processed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content into Normalized Output (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_into_normalized_output__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Carefully crafting input log messages so that, after normalization by `liblognorm`, the output contains malicious payloads.
*   **Impact:** Depending on how the application uses the normalized output, this can lead to:
    *   SQL Injection: If the output is used in database queries.
    *   Command Injection: If the output is used in system command execution.
    *   Other forms of injection attacks.
*   **Why High-Risk:** The potential for severe consequences like data breaches, data manipulation, and arbitrary command execution makes this a critical threat.
