# Threat Model Analysis for rsyslog/liblognorm

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Log Message Exploiting Parsing Vulnerability](./threats/maliciously_crafted_log_message_exploiting_parsing_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Maliciously Crafted Log Message Exploiting Parsing Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a log message with specific character sequences, lengths, or patterns designed to trigger a bug or vulnerability within `liblognorm`'s parsing logic. This might involve exceeding buffer limits, exploiting unexpected state transitions, or triggering error conditions that lead to exploitable behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to application crashes, denial of service, memory corruption, or potentially remote code execution if the vulnerability is severe enough.
    *   **Affected Component:** `liblognorm` core parsing engine (likely within functions handling string processing, pattern matching, or memory allocation during parsing, such as `ln_parser_parse()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* passing log messages to `liblognorm`. This includes checking for excessive length, unexpected characters, and potentially known malicious patterns.
        *   Keep `liblognorm` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Consider running `liblognorm` in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement error handling around `liblognorm` parsing to gracefully handle unexpected input and prevent crashes.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Complex Log Patterns](./threats/denial_of_service_via_complex_log_patterns.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Complex Log Patterns
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a stream of log messages that, while not necessarily malicious in content, contain patterns that are extremely complex or resource-intensive for `liblognorm`'s rule engine to process. This could involve deeply nested patterns, excessive use of wildcards, or backtracking issues in the pattern matching logic.
    *   **Impact:**  Leads to excessive CPU and memory consumption by the application, potentially causing slowdowns, unresponsiveness, or complete denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `liblognorm` rule engine and pattern matching logic (specifically the components responsible for evaluating rules against log messages, potentially within functions like `ln_rule_match()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design and review the `liblognorm` rulebase for performance and complexity. Avoid overly complex or redundant rules.
        *   Implement timeouts for `liblognorm` processing to prevent indefinite hangs caused by resource-intensive patterns.
        *   Monitor resource usage during log processing and implement alerts for unusual spikes.
        *   Consider limiting the complexity of allowed log patterns or the depth of nesting in rules.

## Threat: [Rulebase Injection](./threats/rulebase_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Rulebase Injection
    *   **Description:** If the application allows external influence on the `liblognorm` rulebase (e.g., loading rules from user-provided files or databases without proper sanitization), an attacker could inject malicious rules. These rules could be designed to misinterpret logs, ignore security-relevant events, or even trigger unintended actions within the application based on the fabricated interpretation of logs.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to the application failing to detect critical security events, misinterpreting data leading to incorrect decisions, or potentially triggering unintended actions based on attacker-controlled rule interpretations.
    *   **Affected Component:** `liblognorm` rule loading and management components (functions like `ln_rulebase_load_file()`, `ln_rulebase_load_string()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat the `liblognorm` rulebase as a critical security component.
        *   Load rulebases only from trusted and verified sources.
        *   If external sources influence the rulebase, implement strict validation and sanitization of the rule definitions before loading them into `liblognorm`.
        *   Use the principle of least privilege for the user/process running the application and `liblognorm`, limiting its ability to modify the rulebase.
