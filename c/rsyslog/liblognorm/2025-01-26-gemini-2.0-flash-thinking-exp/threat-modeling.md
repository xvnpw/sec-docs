# Threat Model Analysis for rsyslog/liblognorm

## Threat: [Malformed Log Message Exploitation](./threats/malformed_log_message_exploitation.md)

Description: An attacker crafts malicious log messages with unexpected formats, excessively long fields, or special characters and sends them to the application. `liblognorm` attempts to parse these messages using configured rulesets. Exploitation occurs when parsing logic in `liblognorm` or the ruleset fails to handle these malformed messages correctly.
Impact: Application crash, unexpected behavior, resource exhaustion (CPU or memory), potential for denial of service. In severe cases, although less likely directly in `liblognorm` itself, vulnerabilities could be chained to exploit downstream processing of the parsed data.
Affected liblognorm component: Parsing Engine, Rule Set Processing, Input Handling.
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Thoroughly test rulesets with a wide range of valid and invalid log messages, including fuzzing.
    *   Regularly update `liblognorm` to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Implement input sanitization and validation *before* feeding data to `liblognorm` to pre-filter potentially malicious inputs.
    *   Set limits on the maximum size of log messages processed.
    *   Implement error handling to gracefully manage parsing failures and prevent application crashes.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

Description: An attacker crafts log messages specifically designed to trigger exponential backtracking in vulnerable regular expressions used within `liblognorm` rule sets. This causes the regex engine to consume excessive CPU time while attempting to match the malicious input.
Impact: Denial of service, application slowdown, resource exhaustion (CPU), potentially impacting other application components.
Affected liblognorm component: Regular Expression Engine (likely within Rule Set Engine), Rule Set Processing.
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Carefully review all regular expressions in rule sets for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.
    *   Use regex analysis tools to identify problematic patterns and assess regex complexity.
    *   Test regex performance with various inputs, including edge cases and potentially malicious patterns.
    *   Consider using more efficient regex patterns or alternative parsing methods if performance issues or ReDoS vulnerabilities are identified.
    *   Implement timeouts for regex matching operations to prevent unbounded execution.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: `liblognorm` relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies (e.g., security flaws in underlying libraries used for regex processing, memory management, or other functionalities) can indirectly affect applications using `liblognorm`.
Impact: Various impacts depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, potentially including code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or privilege escalation.
Affected liblognorm component: Dependencies, External Libraries, Build Process.
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Regularly update `liblognorm` and its dependencies to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., vulnerability scanners) to identify known vulnerabilities in `liblognorm`'s dependencies.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management process to promptly address identified dependency vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for updates related to `liblognorm` and its dependencies.
