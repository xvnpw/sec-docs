# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rsyslog/liblognorm

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Rulebase Management: Principle of Least Privilege for Rule Access](./mitigation_strategies/secure_rulebase_management_principle_of_least_privilege_for_rule_access.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Rule Access
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Roles and Responsibilities:** Define roles that require access to `liblognorm` rulebases (e.g., security engineers, log management administrators).
    2.  **Restrict File System Permissions:** Configure file system permissions on `liblognorm` rulebase files and directories to grant read access only to authorized users and processes. Prevent write access for unauthorized users.
    3.  **Control Access to Rule Management Tools:** If using tools to manage rulebases (e.g., version control systems, deployment scripts), restrict access to these tools based on the principle of least privilege.
    4.  **Regularly Review Access:** Periodically review and audit access permissions to rulebases and related tools to ensure they remain aligned with the principle of least privilege.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Rule Modification (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized individuals from modifying `liblognorm` rules, which could lead to bypassing security controls, misinterpreting logs, or introducing malicious rules.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Rule Modification (High):** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized rule modifications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. Rulebase files are stored in a dedicated directory with restricted file system permissions. Only the log processing service user has read access.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No missing implementation identified. Access control is consistently applied to rulebase files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Rulebase Management: Rulebase Validation and Testing](./mitigation_strategies/secure_rulebase_management_rulebase_validation_and_testing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rulebase Validation and Testing
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Develop Test Cases:** Create a comprehensive set of test cases for each `liblognorm` rulebase. These test cases should include:
        *   **Valid Log Examples:** Examples of legitimate log messages that the rulebase is intended to parse.
        *   **Edge Cases:** Log messages that represent boundary conditions or unusual but valid scenarios.
        *   **Invalid Log Examples:** Log messages that are intentionally malformed or contain potentially malicious patterns to test rule robustness.
    2.  **Automated Testing Framework:** Implement an automated testing framework to execute test cases against rulebases. This framework should:
        *   Load the rulebase.
        *   Feed test log messages to `liblognorm` using the rulebase.
        *   Verify the normalized output against expected results.
        *   Report test failures.
    3.  **Pre-Deployment Testing:** Run the automated test suite against any new or modified rulebase before deploying it to production.
    4.  **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Integration:** Integrate rulebase testing into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that all rule changes are automatically tested.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
