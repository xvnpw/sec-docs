# Attack Surface Analysis for rsyslog/liblognorm

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Rule Set Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_rule_set_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  `liblognorm` processes rule sets to define log parsing and normalization. If these rule sets are maliciously crafted or modified, they can directly manipulate `liblognorm`'s behavior.
*   **liblognorm Contribution:** `liblognorm`'s core functionality relies on external rule sets. It directly interprets and executes the logic defined within these rule sets.
*   **Example:** A malicious rule set could contain rules designed to trigger excessive CPU usage within `liblognorm`'s processing engine, leading to a Denial of Service. Alternatively, rules could be crafted to extract and expose sensitive data from log messages during normalization.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure, Bypass of Security Controls.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Rule Set Loading:** Ensure `liblognorm` loads rule sets from trusted and protected locations only.
    *   **Rule Set Validation:** Implement mechanisms to validate the integrity and structure of rule sets before they are loaded by `liblognorm`. This could include schema validation or digital signatures.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Rule Sets:** Limit write access to rule set files to only authorized users or processes.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Rule Processing](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_rule_processing.md)

*   **Description:**  `liblognorm` utilizes regular expressions within its rule processing logic. Inefficient or maliciously crafted regular expressions in rule sets can lead to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when processed by `liblognorm`.
*   **liblognorm Contribution:** `liblognorm`'s rule engine directly executes regular expressions defined in rule sets for pattern matching and log parsing. Vulnerable regex patterns within rules are processed by `liblognorm`.
*   **Example:** A rule set might contain a regex like `(a+)+b` which, when processed by `liblognorm` against a crafted log message like `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac`, can cause exponential backtracking and consume excessive CPU time, leading to a DoS.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regex Security Audits:**  Thoroughly audit rule sets for potentially vulnerable regular expressions before loading them into `liblognorm`.
    *   **Regex Complexity Limits:** Implement limits on the complexity of regular expressions allowed in rule sets to prevent overly resource-intensive patterns.
    *   **Timeouts for Regex Matching within liblognorm:**  Consider if `liblognorm` or the application using it can implement timeouts for regular expression matching operations to prevent unbounded CPU consumption during rule processing.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow in Log Message Parsing within liblognorm](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflow_in_log_message_parsing_within_liblognorm.md)

*   **Description:**  `liblognorm`'s internal log message parsing routines might be vulnerable to buffer overflows when handling excessively long or specially crafted log messages.
*   **liblognorm Contribution:** `liblognorm` is responsible for parsing and processing raw log messages. Vulnerabilities in its internal buffer management during parsing can lead to buffer overflows.
*   **Example:** Sending a log message that exceeds the buffer size allocated within `liblognorm`'s parsing functions could overwrite adjacent memory regions. This could lead to crashes or potentially code execution if an attacker can control the overflowed data.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (Crash), Potential Code Execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution is possible), High (if only DoS).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Latest liblognorm Version:** Ensure you are using the latest stable version of `liblognorm` as vulnerabilities are often patched in newer releases.
    *   **Report Potential Vulnerabilities:** If you suspect a buffer overflow vulnerability in `liblognorm`, report it to the developers so they can investigate and fix it.
    *   **Code Audits of liblognorm (if feasible):** If possible, conduct or review code audits of `liblognorm`'s source code, specifically focusing on buffer handling and string manipulation routines within its parsing logic.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Rule or Log Processing within liblognorm](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflowunderflow_in_rule_or_log_processing_within_liblognorm.md)

*   **Description:** Integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities within `liblognorm`'s internal calculations during rule or log processing can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
*   **liblognorm Contribution:** `liblognorm` performs various integer arithmetic operations during rule processing and log message manipulation.  Flaws in these operations can lead to integer overflows/underflows within `liblognorm` itself.
*   **Example:** If `liblognorm` uses an integer to track the length of a processed log component and an overflow occurs, it could lead to incorrect memory allocation or processing logic within `liblognorm`, potentially causing crashes or exploitable conditions.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (Crash), Unexpected Behavior, Potential for Exploitation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical depending on the context and exploitability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Latest liblognorm Version:**  As with buffer overflows, ensure you are using the latest version of `liblognorm` which may contain fixes for integer handling issues.
    *   **Report Potential Vulnerabilities:** Report any suspected integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities in `liblognorm` to the developers.
    *   **Code Audits of liblognorm (if feasible):** Review code related to integer arithmetic within `liblognorm`'s source code for potential overflow/underflow issues.
