# Attack Surface Analysis for rsyslog/liblognorm

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Log Message Handling](./attack_surfaces/malformed_log_message_handling.md)

**Description:** The application processes log messages using `liblognorm`. Maliciously crafted log messages with unexpected formats, excessively long fields, or unusual characters can exploit vulnerabilities in `liblognorm`'s parsing logic.

**How liblognorm Contributes:** `liblognorm` is directly responsible for interpreting and extracting information from log messages. Flaws in its parsing logic or insufficient input validation can lead to exploitable errors.

**Example:** A log message with an extremely long field exceeding buffer limits in `liblognorm`'s internal processing, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact:** Potential for buffer overflows, crashes, denial of service, or unexpected behavior within `liblognorm` itself, impacting the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input validation to limit the maximum length of log messages and fields *before* they are processed by `liblognorm`.
* Ensure `liblognorm` is updated to the latest version with known bug fixes and security patches addressing parsing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Log Injection](./attack_surfaces/log_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious content into log messages that are subsequently processed by `liblognorm`. Vulnerabilities in `liblognorm`'s parsing can contribute to the successful extraction and potential misuse of this injected content by the application.

**How liblognorm Contributes:** `liblognorm` parses the log messages and extracts structured data. If `liblognorm` doesn't properly sanitize or handle potentially malicious characters within the log message, it can facilitate the injection attack.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a log message containing special characters that, when parsed by `liblognorm`, are incorrectly interpreted, leading to the extraction of a malicious command that the application later executes.

**Impact:**  If `liblognorm`'s parsing allows for the extraction of malicious commands or data, it can lead to command injection, SQL injection (if the parsed data is used in database queries), or other forms of injection attacks within the application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Treat data extracted by `liblognorm` as untrusted input and implement robust output encoding and sanitization in the application.
* Review `liblognorm`'s configuration and usage to ensure it's not configured in a way that facilitates the extraction of potentially malicious content.

## Attack Surface: [Rulebase Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/rulebase_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** `liblognorm` relies on rulebases to understand and parse log formats. Vulnerabilities within these rulebases (either default or custom) can be directly exploited by providing specific log messages that trigger the flawed rules within `liblognorm`.

**How liblognorm Contributes:** `liblognorm`'s core functionality depends on the accuracy and security of the loaded rulebases. Flaws in the rules are directly executed by `liblognorm` during parsing.

**Example:** A poorly written regular expression in a rulebase that is susceptible to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS), causing excessive CPU consumption *within `liblognorm`* when processing certain log messages.

**Impact:** Denial of service due to resource exhaustion within `liblognorm`, or incorrect interpretation of log data directly caused by the flawed rule within `liblognorm`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and test all custom rulebases for potential vulnerabilities, including ReDoS, before deploying them with `liblognorm`.
* Obtain rulebases from trusted sources only and implement mechanisms to verify their integrity.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Rulebase Loading](./attack_surfaces/insecure_rulebase_loading.md)

**Description:** If the application loads rulebases that are then used by `liblognorm` from untrusted sources or locations without proper validation, attackers could inject malicious rules that are directly used by `liblognorm` to parse logs in a way that benefits the attacker.

**How liblognorm Contributes:** `liblognorm` directly loads and uses the rulebases provided to it. If this loading process is insecure, `liblognorm` will operate based on potentially malicious instructions.

**Example:** An attacker gains write access to the directory where rulebases are stored and replaces a legitimate rulebase with a malicious one that causes `liblognorm` to misinterpret critical security events or extract data in a way that benefits the attacker.

**Impact:**  Compromised log parsing leading to the circumvention of security logging, misinterpretation of security events by `liblognorm`, potentially allowing attackers to operate undetected.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Load rulebases from trusted and secure locations only.
* Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) for rulebase files before they are loaded by `liblognorm`.
* Restrict file system permissions to prevent unauthorized modification of rulebase files used by `liblognorm`.
