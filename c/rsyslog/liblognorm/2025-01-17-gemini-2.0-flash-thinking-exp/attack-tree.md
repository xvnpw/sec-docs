## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using liblognorm [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_liblognorm__critical_node_.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. It signifies gaining unauthorized control or access to the application or its underlying system by leveraging weaknesses in how liblognorm processes log data. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective through one or more of the identified high-risk paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Log Parsing Logic [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_log_parsing_logic__critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting flaws in how liblognorm parses and interprets log messages. Vulnerabilities in this area can allow attackers to manipulate the application's behavior by sending specially crafted log data. This node is critical because it represents a direct attack surface exposed to potentially untrusted input.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Trigger Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__trigger_buffer_overflow__critical_node_.md)

**Send Maliciously Crafted Log Message with Excessive Length:**
*   Attack Vector: If liblognorm uses fixed-size buffers to store parts of the log message during parsing, an attacker can send a log message with a field exceeding the buffer's capacity. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations.
*   Impact: This can lead to code execution, where the attacker can inject and run arbitrary code on the application's server. It can also cause denial of service by crashing the application or lead to memory corruption, resulting in unpredictable behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Format String Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_format_string_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

**Inject Format Specifiers in Log Message Content:**
*   Attack Vector: If liblognorm uses user-controlled parts of the log message directly in format string functions (like `printf` or similar), an attacker can inject format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`, `%n`) within the log message content.
*   Impact: This allows the attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations. This can be used for information disclosure (reading sensitive data from memory) or, more critically, for arbitrary code execution by overwriting function pointers or other critical data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Manipulate liblognorm Rulesets [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__manipulate_liblognorm_rulesets__critical_node_.md)

This path involves compromising the configuration of liblognorm itself, specifically the rulesets that define how logs are parsed and normalized. Gaining control over the rulesets allows an attacker to influence how log data is processed, potentially leading to information leaks or manipulation of application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Rules [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_malicious_rules__critical_node_.md)

**Modify Configuration Files to Include Rules That Cause Harm:**
*   Attack Vector: If the application allows external configuration of liblognorm rulesets (e.g., loading rules from a file), an attacker who gains unauthorized access to these configuration files can inject malicious rules.
*   Impact: These malicious rules could be designed to:
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Extract sensitive information from log messages and send it to an attacker-controlled server.
    *   **Manipulation of Log Data:** Alter the normalized log output to hide malicious activity or influence the application's logic based on the modified logs.
    *   **Potential Code Execution:** In some scenarios, depending on how rules are processed, it might be possible to craft rules that lead to code execution.
