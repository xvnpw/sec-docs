## High and Critical liblognorm Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats directly involving the `liblognorm` library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Log Injection Exploiting Parsing Logic** | An attacker crafts a log message with specific syntax or overly long fields designed to exploit vulnerabilities in `liblognorm`'s parsing engine. This could involve sending unexpected characters, deeply nested structures, or exceeding buffer limits during parsing. | Incorrect normalization of log data, leading to flawed analysis, reporting, or application logic errors. In severe cases, it could potentially lead to crashes or unexpected behavior in the application relying on the normalized data. | Parsing Engine (Core Logic) | High | - **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust validation of raw log data *before* passing it to `liblognorm`. Filter out potentially malicious characters or patterns based on expected log formats. <br> - **Regular Updates:** Keep `liblognorm` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches addressing known parsing vulnerabilities. <br> - **Rule Set Review & Hardening:** Regularly review and audit the `liblognorm` rulesets for potential vulnerabilities or overly permissive patterns that could be exploited. Use specific and well-defined rules. <br> - **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling within the application to gracefully handle parsing failures and prevent cascading errors. Log parsing errors for investigation. |
| **Elevation of Privilege (Indirect) via Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities** | While less likely in a well-maintained library, vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or format string bugs within `liblognorm` could potentially be exploited by a sophisticated attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the application process. This would require sending specially crafted log messages that trigger these vulnerabilities. | Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, or disrupt operations. | Core Library (Memory Management, Parsing Engine) | Very Low (assuming the library is actively maintained and patched) | - **Regular Updates:** Crucial for patching known vulnerabilities that could lead to memory corruption. <br> - **Memory Safety Practices (for library developers):** If contributing to or modifying `liblognorm`'s code, adhere to strict memory safety practices to prevent such vulnerabilities. <br> - **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Run the application (and thus `liblognorm`) in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential exploits. |
