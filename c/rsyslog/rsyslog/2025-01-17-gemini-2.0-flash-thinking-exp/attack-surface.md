# Attack Surface Analysis for rsyslog/rsyslog

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** Rsyslog configuration files have insecure permissions or contain vulnerable configurations.

**How Rsyslog Contributes:** Rsyslog's behavior is entirely dictated by its configuration files (e.g., `rsyslog.conf`, files in `/etc/rsyslog.d/`).

**Example:** The `rsyslog.conf` file is world-readable, allowing an attacker with local access to understand logging destinations and potentially exploit them. Or, the configuration uses the `omprog` module with insufficient restrictions, allowing command execution based on log content.

**Impact:**
* **Log Redirection:** Attackers could modify the configuration to redirect logs to their own servers, capturing sensitive information.
* **Arbitrary Command Execution:**  Using modules like `omprog`, attackers could configure rsyslog to execute arbitrary commands based on log content.
* **Denial of Service:**  Modifying the configuration to cause excessive resource consumption.
* **Disabling Logging:**  Preventing the recording of malicious activity.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure File Permissions:** Ensure `rsyslog.conf` and related files are only readable and writable by the `root` user or the specific user running `rsyslogd`.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `rsyslogd` with the minimum necessary privileges.
* **Regular Configuration Audits:** Review the rsyslog configuration for potential vulnerabilities and adherence to security best practices.
* **Restrict `omprog` Usage:** If using the `omprog` module, carefully restrict the commands that can be executed and the conditions under which they are executed.

## Attack Surface: [Output Module Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/output_module_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the output modules used by rsyslog to write logs to various destinations.

**How Rsyslog Contributes:** Rsyslog relies on output modules (e.g., `omfile`, `ommysql`, `omtcp`) to send logs to different locations.

**Example:** A vulnerability in the `ommysql` module could allow SQL injection if log data is not properly handled by the module before being inserted into the database. Or, a flaw in `omtcp` could allow for denial-of-service attacks against the receiving server.

**Impact:**
* **Data Breaches:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in database output modules could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
* **Remote Code Execution:** In severe cases, vulnerabilities in output modules could potentially lead to remote code execution on the logging destination.
* **Denial of Service:**  Attacking the logging destination through vulnerabilities in the output module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Rsyslog Updated:** Regularly update rsyslog to patch known vulnerabilities in its core and modules.
* **Secure Output Destinations:** Ensure the security of the systems where logs are being written (e.g., secure database configurations, firewalls for remote servers).
* **Use Secure Output Protocols:** When sending logs over the network, use secure protocols like RELP with TLS encryption.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in rsyslog itself to gain elevated privileges on the system.

**How Rsyslog Contributes:** The `rsyslogd` daemon often runs with root privileges to access system logs and perform certain operations.

**Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in `rsyslogd` could be exploited by sending a specially crafted log message, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

**Impact:** Full system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Rsyslog Updated:** Regularly update rsyslog to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  While often necessary, carefully consider if `rsyslogd` truly needs to run as root and explore alternative configurations if possible.
* **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the rsyslog installation and configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Module Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_module_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in third-party or non-standard rsyslog modules.

**How Rsyslog Contributes:** Rsyslog's modular architecture allows for extending its functionality with external modules.

**Example:** A vulnerability in a custom output module could be exploited by sending specific log messages that trigger the flaw.

**Impact:**  The impact depends on the functionality of the vulnerable module, potentially leading to data breaches, remote code execution, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Only Use Trusted Modules:**  Carefully evaluate and only use modules from trusted sources.
* **Keep Modules Updated:**  If using third-party modules, ensure they are regularly updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Security Audits of Modules:**  If developing custom modules, conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing.
* **Minimize Module Usage:** Only use the modules that are strictly necessary for the application's logging requirements.
