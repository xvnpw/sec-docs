# Threat Model Analysis for rsyslog/rsyslog

## Threat: [Log Injection via Unvalidated Input](./threats/log_injection_via_unvalidated_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted log messages to rsyslog that contain malicious content. This could involve injecting commands or control characters that are interpreted by rsyslog itself or downstream log processing tools. The attacker might leverage this to execute arbitrary commands on the rsyslog server or systems processing the logs.

**Impact:** Command execution on the rsyslog server or log processing systems, log data manipulation, potential for further system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the application side *before* sending logs to rsyslog.
*   Use structured logging formats (e.g., JSON) to reduce ambiguity and the possibility of injecting control characters.
*   Configure rsyslog to escape or sanitize potentially dangerous characters in log messages before forwarding or storing them.
*   Ensure downstream log processing tools are also hardened against log injection attacks.

## Threat: [Configuration File Manipulation](./threats/configuration_file_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the rsyslog configuration files (`rsyslog.conf` or files in `/etc/rsyslog.d/`) and modifies them. This could allow the attacker to redirect logs to a malicious server, disable logging, inject malicious configurations (e.g., using `exec` actions to run commands on the rsyslog server), or alter filtering rules to hide their activity.

**Impact:** Loss of log data, redirection of sensitive information to attackers, potential for arbitrary command execution on the rsyslog server, hindering incident response and forensic analysis.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict access to rsyslog configuration files using appropriate file system permissions (e.g., `chmod 600` for `rsyslog.conf` and appropriate ownership).
*   Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) to detect unauthorized changes to configuration files.
*   Use configuration management tools to enforce desired configurations and detect deviations.
*   Regularly audit rsyslog configurations for suspicious or unauthorized entries.

## Threat: [Insecure Log Forwarding Protocol](./threats/insecure_log_forwarding_protocol.md)

**Description:** Rsyslog is configured to forward logs using an insecure protocol like plain TCP without encryption. An attacker on the network could eavesdrop on the communication and intercept sensitive information contained within the log messages being transmitted by rsyslog.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data (credentials, personal information, application secrets) contained in logs being forwarded by rsyslog.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use secure protocols for log forwarding, such as RELP over TLS or syslog over TLS.
*   Ensure proper certificate management and validation for encrypted connections.
*   Avoid using plain TCP for forwarding logs over untrusted networks.

## Threat: [Rsyslog Software Vulnerability](./threats/rsyslog_software_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** A previously unknown vulnerability exists within the rsyslog software itself. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the rsyslog server, execute arbitrary code within the rsyslog process, or cause a denial of service of the logging service.

**Impact:** Full system compromise of the rsyslog server, arbitrary code execution within the rsyslog process, denial of service of logging functionality, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep rsyslog updated to the latest stable version with security patches applied.
*   Subscribe to security advisories for rsyslog to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
*   Implement a vulnerability management program to regularly scan for and address known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Module Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/module_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Rsyslog's functionality can be extended through modules. A vulnerability in a specific module could be exploited by an attacker if that module is enabled and processing malicious input or interacting with a compromised system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the rsyslog process or other malicious actions.

**Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability and the module's functionality, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the rsyslog process, denial of service of specific logging features, or information disclosure handled by the module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep rsyslog modules updated to the latest stable versions.
*   Only enable necessary modules and carefully evaluate the security of any third-party modules.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring module permissions and access.
