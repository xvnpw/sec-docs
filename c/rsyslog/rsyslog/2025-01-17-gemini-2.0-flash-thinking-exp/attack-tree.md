## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Log Messages -> Craft Log Messages to Exploit Application Logic](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_log_messages_-_craft_log_messages_to_exploit_application_logic.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts log messages containing malicious commands or data that, when processed by the application, are interpreted as legitimate actions. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or execution of arbitrary code within the application's context.
    **Critical Node: Craft Log Messages to Exploit Application Logic:** This is the point where the attacker's malicious input directly impacts the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject Format String Vulnerabilities -> Craft log messages with format string specifiers to execute arbitrary code on the rsyslog server](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_format_string_vulnerabilities_-_craft_log_messages_with_format_string_specifie_a09cf0f7.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects specially crafted log messages containing format string specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`, `%n`). If rsyslog improperly handles these specifiers, it can lead to arbitrary code execution within the rsyslog process, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control of the logging server.
    **Critical Node: Craft log messages with format string specifiers to execute arbitrary code on the rsyslog server:** Successful exploitation at this point grants the attacker code execution on the rsyslog server.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Input Modules (e.g., imtcp, imudp) -> Target known vulnerabilities in specific input modules](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_input_modules__e_g___imtcp__imudp__-_target_known_vulnerab_837d0ad4.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target known security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, remote code execution flaws) within the modules responsible for receiving log messages (like `imtcp` for TCP or `imudp` for UDP). Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the rsyslog process.
    **Critical Node: Target known vulnerabilities in specific input modules:** This is the point where the attacker leverages a specific flaw in the input module to gain control.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities -> Send logs that trigger vulnerabilities in rsyslog's parsing logic](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities_-_send_logs_that_trigger_vulnerabilities_in_rsyslog's_103a0c93.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers craft log messages that exploit weaknesses in how rsyslog parses and interprets log data. This can involve sending malformed or oversized log messages that trigger buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the rsyslog process.
    **Critical Node: Send logs that trigger vulnerabilities in rsyslog's parsing logic:** This is the point where the crafted log message triggers the vulnerability in rsyslog's parsing mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Rsyslog Configuration (Requires Prior Access)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_rsyslog_configuration__requires_prior_access_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker who has gained unauthorized access to the system can modify the rsyslog configuration file. This allows them to:
        **Modify configuration file to redirect logs to attacker-controlled server:**  Redirect log messages to a server under their control, allowing them to collect potentially sensitive information.
        **Modify configuration to execute arbitrary commands via scripting modules (e.g., omprog):** Configure rsyslog to execute arbitrary commands on the system using output modules like `omprog`.
    **Critical Node: Manipulate Rsyslog Configuration (Requires Prior Access):**  Gaining control over the rsyslog configuration is a critical point of compromise, enabling various malicious actions.
    **Critical Node: Modify configuration to execute arbitrary commands via scripting modules (e.g., omprog):** This specific configuration change allows for direct command execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Processing Modules (e.g., property replacers) -> Target known vulnerabilities in specific processing modules](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_processing_modules__e_g___property_replacers__-_target_kno_03a63baf.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target known security vulnerabilities within the modules responsible for processing and manipulating log data (e.g., property replacers). Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the rsyslog process.
    **Critical Node: Target known vulnerabilities in specific processing modules:** This is the point where the attacker leverages a specific flaw in a processing module to gain control.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Output Modules (e.g., ommysql, omelasticsearch) -> Target known vulnerabilities in specific output modules](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_output_modules__e_g___ommysql__omelasticsearch__-_target_k_220ca856.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target known security vulnerabilities within the modules responsible for outputting log data to various destinations (e.g., `ommysql` for MySQL, `omelasticsearch` for Elasticsearch). Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the rsyslog process or potentially compromise the output destination itself.
    **Critical Node: Target known vulnerabilities in specific output modules:** This is the point where the attacker leverages a specific flaw in an output module to gain control.
