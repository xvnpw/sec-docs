## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rsyslog Input Handling [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rsyslog_input_handling__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical entry point because successfully exploiting input handling allows attackers to inject malicious content directly into the rsyslog processing pipeline. This can lead to code execution or other unintended consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Log Messages [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_log_messages__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers craft log messages specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how rsyslog processes and formats log data. This path is high-risk due to the potential for code execution and the relative ease with which attackers can inject log messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious Log Payload](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_log_payload.md)

This step involves creating the specific content of the malicious log message.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Rsyslog uses templates to format log messages. Vulnerabilities in template processing can allow attackers to inject code that gets executed during template rendering. This is critical because it directly leads to code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Unsanitized Input Fields [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_unsanitized_input_fields__high_risk_path_.md)

If rsyslog doesn't properly sanitize input fields from log messages, attackers can inject shell commands or scripting code that might be executed by output modules or during processing. This path is high-risk due to the commonality of unsanitized input issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rsyslog Output Actions [CRITICAL_NODE] [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rsyslog_output_actions__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This is a critical area because it allows attackers to directly interact with the underlying system through rsyslog's output mechanisms. It's high-risk due to the potential for significant damage, including arbitrary command execution and data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Write to Unauthorized Destinations [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/write_to_unauthorized_destinations__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers manipulate rsyslog to write log data to locations they control or to overwrite critical system files. This path is high-risk due to the potential for data compromise and system disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Configuration to Change Output Path [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_configuration_to_change_output_path__critical_node_.md)

Gaining control over rsyslog's configuration is a critical step that enables the "Write to Unauthorized Destinations" attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Commands via Output Actions [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_commands_via_output_actions__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers leverage rsyslog's output modules (like `omprog`) to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This is a high-risk path due to the potential for full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage `omprog` or Similar Modules [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage__omprog__or_similar_modules__critical_node_.md)

Modules like `omprog` provide a direct mechanism for executing commands, making them critical points of vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Data via Output Destinations [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_data_via_output_destinations__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers configure rsyslog to forward logs containing sensitive data to an external server they control. This path is high-risk due to the direct threat to data confidentiality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rsyslog Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE] [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rsyslog_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

Compromising rsyslog's configuration grants attackers significant control over its behavior, enabling various malicious activities. This is a critical and high-risk area.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Rsyslog Configuration Files [CRITICAL_NODE] [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_rsyslog_configuration_files__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

Gaining access to the configuration files is a crucial step for exploiting configuration vulnerabilities and is itself a high-risk path, often achieved through OS-level vulnerabilities or weak file permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Rsyslog Vulnerabilities [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_rsyslog_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in specific versions of rsyslog. This is a high-risk path because the impact can be severe (code execution), and exploits are often readily available once a vulnerability is disclosed.
