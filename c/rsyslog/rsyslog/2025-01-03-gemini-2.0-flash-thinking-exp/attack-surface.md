# Attack Surface Analysis for rsyslog/rsyslog

## Attack Surface: [Log Injection](./attack_surfaces/log_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects malicious content into log messages that are processed by `rsyslog`.
* **How Rsyslog Contributes:** `rsyslog` faithfully records the log messages it receives. If the application doesn't sanitize user-controlled input before logging, `rsyslog` will store the malicious content. This content can then be exploited by systems consuming these logs.
* **Example:** A web application logs user input directly: `logger->info("User provided name: {}", request.getParameter("name"));`. If a user provides the name `"; $(reboot)"`, this could be logged verbatim. If `rsyslog` is configured to execute commands based on log content, this could lead to unintended actions.
* **Impact:** Log tampering, command injection on systems processing the logs, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in log analysis tools.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Sanitization:** Developers should sanitize or escape user-controlled data before including it in log messages.
    * **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** When logs are displayed or processed by other systems, ensure proper encoding to prevent interpretation of malicious content.
    * **Structured Logging:** Use structured logging formats (like JSON) where data is treated as data, not executable code, making injection harder.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Input Modules](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_input_modules.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the `rsyslog` input modules (e.g., `imudp`, `imtcp`, `imrelp`).
* **How Rsyslog Contributes:** `rsyslog` relies on these modules to receive log messages. If these modules have security flaws, attackers can send specially crafted messages to exploit them.
* **Example:** A vulnerability in the `imudp` module allows an attacker to send a malformed UDP packet that causes `rsyslog` to crash or execute arbitrary code.
* **Impact:** Denial of service, remote code execution on the system running `rsyslog`.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical (if remote code execution is possible), High (for DoS).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Keep Rsyslog Updated:** Regularly update `rsyslog` to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Minimize Input Modules:** Only enable the input modules that are necessary for the application's logging requirements.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the logging infrastructure on a separate network segment to limit the impact of potential breaches.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary File Write (via Output Modules)](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_file_write__via_output_modules_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can manipulate `rsyslog`'s configuration or exploit vulnerabilities in output modules to write data to arbitrary files on the system.
* **How Rsyslog Contributes:** `rsyslog` uses output modules (e.g., `omfile`, `omprog`) to write logs to various destinations. If the configuration allows user-controlled data to influence the output path or if vulnerabilities exist in the output modules, arbitrary file writes are possible.
* **Example:** If the `omfile` module is configured with a template that includes user-provided data without proper sanitization, an attacker could craft a log message that causes `rsyslog` to write to a sensitive system file.
* **Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, introducing malicious executables, information disclosure.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Configuration:** Carefully review and restrict the configuration of output modules, especially those that write to files. Avoid using user-controlled data directly in file paths.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `rsyslog` with the minimum necessary privileges.
    * **Output Validation:** If possible, validate output paths and filenames before `rsyslog` attempts to write to them.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Output Modules](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_output_modules.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in `rsyslog` output modules (e.g., database connectors, remote syslog forwarders).
* **How Rsyslog Contributes:** `rsyslog` uses these modules to send logs to external systems. Vulnerabilities in these modules can allow attackers to compromise those external systems.
* **Example:** A vulnerability in the `ommysql` module could allow an attacker to inject SQL commands through specially crafted log messages, leading to database compromise.
* **Impact:** Compromise of external logging systems, data breaches, remote code execution on connected systems.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability and the target system).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Keep Rsyslog Updated:** Regularly update `rsyslog` to patch vulnerabilities in output modules.
    * **Secure Communication:** Use secure protocols (e.g., TLS) when forwarding logs to remote systems.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant `rsyslog` only the necessary permissions to interact with external systems.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain access to and modify the `rsyslog` configuration file.
* **How Rsyslog Contributes:** The `rsyslog` configuration file dictates how it processes and outputs logs. If an attacker can modify this file, they can completely control `rsyslog`'s behavior.
* **Example:** An attacker gains access to `rsyslog.conf` and modifies it to forward all logs to their own server or to execute arbitrary commands via the `omprog` module.
* **Impact:** Complete compromise of the logging system, redirection of sensitive data, execution of arbitrary commands.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Restrict File Permissions:** Ensure the `rsyslog` configuration file has restrictive permissions, allowing only the `rsyslog` process (and authorized administrators) to read and write it.
    * **Secure Access Control:** Implement strong access control measures to prevent unauthorized access to the server hosting the `rsyslog` configuration.
    * **Configuration Management:** Use secure configuration management tools to manage and audit changes to the `rsyslog` configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Dependent Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_dependent_libraries.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in libraries that `rsyslog` depends on (e.g., `libestr`).
* **How Rsyslog Contributes:** `rsyslog` relies on these libraries for various functionalities. If these libraries have vulnerabilities, `rsyslog` can inherit those vulnerabilities.
* **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in `libestr` could be triggered by processing a specially crafted log message, potentially leading to a crash or remote code execution in `rsyslog`.
* **Impact:** Denial of service, remote code execution.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical (if remote code execution is possible), High (for DoS).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Keep System Updated:** Regularly update the operating system and all installed libraries, including those that `rsyslog` depends on.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `rsyslog` and its dependencies.
