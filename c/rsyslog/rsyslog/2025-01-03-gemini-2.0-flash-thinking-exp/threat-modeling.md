# Threat Model Analysis for rsyslog/rsyslog

## Threat: [Log Tampering](./threats/log_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the rsyslog server or the log storage destination and modifies existing log entries to cover their tracks, frame others, or disrupt investigations. This directly involves the rsyslog server or its storage.

**Impact:**
*   Compromised integrity of audit logs, making them unreliable for security analysis and incident response.
*   Difficulty in identifying the true source and nature of security incidents.
*   Potential for legal and compliance issues due to inaccurate or incomplete logs.

## Threat: [Log Deletion](./threats/log_deletion.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges deletes crucial log entries from the rsyslog server or the log storage destination to hide their malicious activities. This directly targets the rsyslog server or its storage.

**Impact:**
*   Loss of critical audit data, making it impossible to reconstruct security events and understand the scope of an attack.
*   Hindered incident response and forensic analysis.
*   Potential for prolonged undetected breaches.

## Threat: [Rsyslog Configuration Vulnerabilities](./threats/rsyslog_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Misconfigurations in rsyslog can create security weaknesses. This could involve overly permissive file permissions, weak authentication for remote logging, or the use of insecure protocols. An attacker could exploit these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access, intercept logs, or even execute arbitrary code on the rsyslog server.

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive log data managed by rsyslog.
*   Interception of log data in transit handled by rsyslog.
*   Remote code execution on the rsyslog server if vulnerabilities in configuration parsing or action modules are exploited.

## Threat: [Rsyslog Software Vulnerabilities](./threats/rsyslog_software_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Like any software, rsyslog can contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or execute arbitrary code on the rsyslog server.

**Impact:**
*   Remote code execution on the rsyslog server.
*   Denial of service by crashing the rsyslog service or exhausting resources.
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive log data managed by rsyslog.
*   Compromise of the rsyslog server, potentially allowing it to be used as a pivot point for further attacks.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution through Configuration Exploits](./threats/remote_code_execution_through_configuration_exploits.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in rsyslog's configuration parsing or action modules to execute arbitrary code on the rsyslog server. This is a direct exploitation of rsyslog components.

**Impact:**
*   Full compromise of the rsyslog server.
*   Potential for lateral movement to other systems.
*   Data breaches involving sensitive log information.
