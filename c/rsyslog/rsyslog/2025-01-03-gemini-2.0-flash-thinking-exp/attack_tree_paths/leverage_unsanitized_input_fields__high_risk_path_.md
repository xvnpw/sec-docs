## Deep Analysis: Leverage Unsanitized Input Fields in rsyslog

**Context:** We are analyzing a specific attack tree path, "Leverage Unsanitized Input Fields," within the context of an application using rsyslog (https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog). This path is flagged as HIGH_RISK.

**Overview:**

The "Leverage Unsanitized Input Fields" attack path highlights a fundamental vulnerability where rsyslog, in its role as a log management system, fails to adequately sanitize data received from various input sources. This lack of sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious code or commands within log messages. If these unsanitized inputs are then processed or used by rsyslog's output modules or other processing stages, the injected code can be executed with the privileges of the rsyslog process. This can lead to severe consequences, including system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

rsyslog is designed to receive, process, and forward log messages from various sources. This involves several stages where unsanitized input can be exploited:

1. **Input Stage:**
    * **Sources:** Rsyslog can receive logs from various sources, including:
        * **Network Protocols:** Syslog (UDP/TCP), RELP, etc. Attackers can craft malicious log messages and send them to the rsyslog server.
        * **Local Files:**  Rsyslog can monitor local files for new log entries. If an attacker can write to a file monitored by rsyslog, they can inject malicious content.
        * **Internal Application Logs:** Applications might send logs directly to rsyslog. If these applications don't sanitize their own log messages, the vulnerability can propagate.
        * **Database Inputs:**  Some rsyslog configurations might pull logs from databases. If the data in the database is compromised, it can lead to injected content.
    * **Vulnerability:**  If rsyslog doesn't implement proper input validation and sanitization at this stage, it will accept the malicious payload as part of the log message.

2. **Processing Stage:**
    * **Rulesets and Filters:** Rsyslog uses rulesets to filter and process log messages. While rules themselves might not directly execute code, how they are used in conjunction with other modules can be a factor. For example, a rule might extract a field from an unsanitized message and use it in a later stage.
    * **Property Replacers:** Rsyslog uses property replacers (e.g., `%msg%`, `%hostname%`) to access and manipulate parts of the log message. If these replacers are used on unsanitized input and then passed to vulnerable output modules, it can trigger the exploit.

3. **Output Stage:**
    * **Output Modules:** This is where the most critical exploitation often occurs. Rsyslog uses various output modules to write logs to different destinations:
        * **File Output (omfile):** If the filename or the content being written is derived from unsanitized input, attackers could potentially overwrite critical system files or inject commands into log files that are later processed by other tools (e.g., log rotation scripts).
        * **Database Output (ommysql, ompostgresql, etc.):**  Unsanitized input can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the output module doesn't properly escape data before inserting it into the database.
        * **Program Execution Output (omprog):** This module explicitly executes external programs. If the command or its arguments are derived from unsanitized input, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the system. This is a particularly high-risk scenario.
        * **Email Output (ommail):**  While less likely for direct code execution, unsanitized input in email headers or body could be used for phishing or other malicious purposes.
        * **Other Network Outputs (omfwd, omrelp):**  Maliciously crafted log messages forwarded to other systems could potentially exploit vulnerabilities on those systems.

**Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

* **Command Injection via `omprog`:** An attacker sends a log message containing a malicious command within a field that is used as an argument for `omprog`. For example, a log message like: `User 'victim' logged in from 192.168.1.1 ; $(rm -rf /tmp/*)`  could, if not properly sanitized, lead to the execution of `rm -rf /tmp/*` on the rsyslog server.
* **File Overwrite via `omfile`:** An attacker injects a path manipulation sequence into a log message that is used to determine the output filename in `omfile`. This could allow them to overwrite critical system files.
* **SQL Injection via Database Output Modules:** If log data containing malicious SQL code is inserted into a database without proper escaping, it could lead to data breaches or manipulation.
* **Scripting Code Injection:**  If rsyslog utilizes scripting capabilities (e.g., through modules or external scripts), unsanitized input could be used to inject malicious code that is later executed by the scripting engine.

**Risk Assessment (HIGH_RISK_PATH Justification):**

This attack path is considered high-risk due to several factors:

* **Commonality of Unsanitized Input Issues:**  Lack of proper input validation and sanitization is a widespread vulnerability across many applications.
* **Ease of Exploitation:**  Crafting malicious log messages is often relatively straightforward. Attackers can leverage existing knowledge of command injection or other injection techniques.
* **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    * **Full System Compromise:**  Execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the rsyslog process (which might be root or a privileged user).
    * **Data Breaches:** Access to sensitive information stored in logs or through database exploitation.
    * **Denial of Service:**  Overloading the system with malicious logs or disrupting logging functionality.
    * **Log Manipulation:**  Altering or deleting logs to cover tracks or disrupt forensic investigations.
* **Wide Attack Surface:** Rsyslog can receive logs from numerous sources, increasing the potential entry points for attackers.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

The development team should implement the following mitigation strategies to address this vulnerability:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Whitelisting:** Define acceptable characters and formats for input fields and reject anything that doesn't conform.
    * **Blacklisting:**  Identify and remove or escape potentially dangerous characters or sequences (e.g., shell metacharacters, SQL keywords). However, blacklisting is less robust than whitelisting.
    * **Contextual Sanitization:** Sanitize input based on how it will be used. For example, if a value will be used in a shell command, apply shell escaping. If it will be used in an SQL query, use parameterized queries or proper escaping for the specific database.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the rsyslog process with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of a successful attack.
* **Secure Configuration:**
    * Disable or restrict the use of high-risk output modules like `omprog` if they are not strictly necessary.
    * Carefully configure the parameters of output modules to avoid relying on user-supplied input for critical settings like filenames or command arguments.
* **Regular Updates and Patching:** Keep rsyslog updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches that address known vulnerabilities.
* **Security Auditing and Code Reviews:** Regularly review the rsyslog configuration and any custom configurations or modules for potential vulnerabilities.
* **Consider Sandboxing or Containerization:**  Isolate the rsyslog process within a sandbox or container to limit the damage an attacker can inflict if they gain control.
* **Implement Logging and Monitoring:** Monitor rsyslog logs for suspicious activity that might indicate an attempted exploitation.

**Example Scenario and Remediation:**

**Vulnerable Configuration:**

```rsyslog
template(name="DynFile" type="string" string="/var/log/%HOSTNAME%/%msg:R,ERE,1,FIELD:.*user='(.*)'.*--end%")
*.* /var/log/%HOSTNAME%/%DynFile%.log
```

In this example, the filename is dynamically generated based on the `HOSTNAME` and a portion of the `msg` containing the username. An attacker could inject characters into the username field to manipulate the filename, potentially writing to unintended locations.

**Remediation:**

```rsyslog
template(name="SafeDynFile" type="string" string="/var/log/%HOSTNAME%/%msg:R,ERE,1,FIELD:.*user='([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)'.*--end%")
*.* /var/log/%HOSTNAME%/%SafeDynFile%.log
```

By using a regular expression with a whitelist (`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`), we ensure that only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens are allowed in the username, preventing path manipulation.

**Collaboration with Development Team:**

As a cybersecurity expert, it's crucial to work closely with the development team to:

* **Educate developers:** Explain the risks associated with unsanitized input and best practices for secure coding.
* **Provide specific guidance:** Offer concrete examples and recommendations for sanitizing input in the context of rsyslog.
* **Review code and configurations:** Participate in code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Test and validate fixes:** Conduct security testing to ensure that implemented mitigations are effective.

**Conclusion:**

The "Leverage Unsanitized Input Fields" attack path represents a significant security risk for applications using rsyslog. By understanding the various stages where this vulnerability can be exploited and implementing robust input validation and sanitization techniques, the development team can significantly reduce the attack surface and protect the system from potential compromise. Continuous vigilance, regular security assessments, and collaboration between security and development teams are essential to maintain a secure logging infrastructure.
