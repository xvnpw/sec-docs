# Threat Model Analysis for rsyslog/rsyslog

## Threat: [Malicious Log Injection via Network Inputs (TCP/UDP)](./threats/malicious_log_injection_via_network_inputs__tcpudp_.md)

Description: An attacker might send crafted log messages over TCP or UDP to the `imtcp` or `imudp` modules. They could flood the system with excessive logs, inject false or misleading information, or attempt to exploit potential vulnerabilities in input parsing logic by sending specially crafted log payloads.
Impact: Denial of Service (DoS) of the logging system and downstream consumers, corruption of log data integrity, misleading audit trails, potential for exploitation of rsyslog vulnerabilities leading to further compromise.
Affected Rsyslog Component: `imtcp`, `imudp` input modules, input parsing logic.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
- Implement robust input validation and sanitization rules within rsyslog configuration to filter and normalize incoming log messages.
- Configure rate limiting on `imtcp` and `imudp` modules to prevent log flooding attacks.
- Utilize source IP filtering to restrict log reception to trusted sources.
- Employ `imtls` for encrypted and authenticated network input to ensure confidentiality and source verification.

## Threat: [Log Data Leakage to Unauthorized Destinations](./threats/log_data_leakage_to_unauthorized_destinations.md)

Description: Misconfiguration of rsyslog output modules (e.g., `omtcp`, `omfile`, `omelasticsearch`) can inadvertently cause logs to be sent to unintended or unauthorized destinations. This could result from typographical errors in configuration, overly permissive output rules, or compromised output destinations.
Impact: Confidentiality breach leading to exposure of sensitive information contained within logs, such as user credentials, application secrets, internal system details, or personal data.
Affected Rsyslog Component: Output modules (`omtcp`, `omfile`, `omelasticsearch`, etc.), rule processing logic.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
- Conduct thorough reviews and testing of rsyslog output configurations to ensure accuracy and intended destinations.
- Apply the principle of least privilege when defining output rules, restricting log forwarding to only necessary destinations.
- Secure all log destinations with appropriate access controls and security measures to prevent unauthorized access.
- Encrypt log data both in transit (using `omtls` for network outputs) and at rest at the destination to protect confidentiality.

## Threat: [Configuration Injection/Tampering](./threats/configuration_injectiontampering.md)

Description: If an attacker gains unauthorized write access to rsyslog configuration files (e.g., `rsyslog.conf`), they can maliciously modify the configuration. This could involve redirecting logs to attacker-controlled servers, disabling logging of critical events, or injecting malicious rules to manipulate log processing or potentially exploit rsyslog itself.
Impact: Loss of logging functionality, creation of corrupted or incomplete audit trails, potential data leakage to unauthorized parties, and possible further system compromise if malicious rules are successfully injected.
Affected Rsyslog Component: Configuration files, configuration parsing and loading mechanisms.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
- Enforce strong file system permissions on rsyslog configuration files, ensuring only the `root` user or a dedicated rsyslog user has write access.
- Implement configuration file integrity monitoring to detect any unauthorized modifications to configuration files.
- Utilize version control systems to manage rsyslog configuration files, enabling tracking of changes and facilitating rollback to known good configurations.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) of Rsyslog Process](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__of_rsyslog_process.md)

Description: An attacker can attempt to disrupt logging services by causing a Denial of Service (DoS) against the rsyslog process itself. This could be achieved by exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in rsyslog, or by overwhelming the process with excessive log data or resource-intensive processing requests.
Impact: Complete loss of logging capability, rendering the system unable to record security events or operational issues, potentially hindering incident detection and response, and potentially leading to system instability if other components depend on rsyslog.
Affected Rsyslog Component: Rsyslog core process, input modules, processing engine.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
- Maintain rsyslog installations by promptly applying security patches and updates to address known vulnerabilities.
- Implement resource limits for the rsyslog process at the operating system level (e.g., using `ulimit` or systemd resource control) to prevent resource exhaustion.
- Employ input rate limiting and queue management features within rsyslog to handle bursts of log data and prevent resource overload.
- Implement monitoring of the rsyslog process health and resource usage, and configure automated restarts in case of unresponsiveness or failure.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Network Log Transmission](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_network_log_transmission.md)

Description: If log data is transmitted over a network using unencrypted protocols like plain TCP or UDP, an attacker positioned in the network path can intercept the communication. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on the log data (passive MITM) or actively modify log messages in transit (active MITM).
Impact: Confidentiality breach due to eavesdropping on sensitive log data, integrity compromise if log messages are modified in transit, potentially leading to misleading audit trails or undetected malicious activity.
Affected Rsyslog Component: Network communication via `imtcp`, `imudp`, `omtcp`, `omudp`.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
- Mandatorily use `imtls` and `omtls` modules to enforce TLS encryption for all network log transmission, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.
- Avoid using plain TCP or UDP protocols for transmitting sensitive log data, especially over untrusted networks.
