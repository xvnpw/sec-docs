# Attack Surface Analysis for rsyslog/rsyslog

## Attack Surface: [Log Injection leading to Command Injection via `omprog`/`ompipe`](./attack_surfaces/log_injection_leading_to_command_injection_via__omprog__ompipe_.md)

### 1. Log Injection leading to Command Injection via `omprog`/`ompipe`

*   **Description:** Malicious log messages injected into rsyslog can lead to arbitrary command execution on the system when processed by `omprog` or `ompipe` modules, due to insufficient sanitization of log data used in external commands.
*   **Rsyslog Contribution:** `omprog` and `ompipe` modules in rsyslog are designed to execute external programs based on log messages, creating a direct pathway for command injection if log data is not handled securely.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a log message containing shell commands. Rsyslog's `omprog` module executes a script that naively uses this log data in a shell command, resulting in the attacker's commands being executed with rsyslog's privileges.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, arbitrary code execution, data loss, denial of service, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize or Eliminate `omprog`/`ompipe` Usage:**  Prefer safer output methods if possible.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all log data before using it in commands executed by `omprog` or `ompipe`. Use parameterized commands or safe APIs.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run rsyslog with the lowest necessary privileges, especially when using `omprog`/`ompipe`.
    *   **Input Filtering:** Implement robust filtering rules in rsyslog to discard or sanitize potentially malicious log messages before they reach `omprog`/`ompipe`.

## Attack Surface: [SQL/NoSQL Injection via Database Output Modules](./attack_surfaces/sqlnosql_injection_via_database_output_modules.md)

### 2. SQL/NoSQL Injection via Database Output Modules

*   **Description:**  Improperly sanitized log data written to databases via rsyslog's database output modules (e.g., `ommysql`, `ompgsql`) can be interpreted as SQL or NoSQL commands, leading to database injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Rsyslog Contribution:** Rsyslog's database output modules directly interface with databases. Lack of proper data sanitization before database insertion creates a vulnerability to SQL/NoSQL injection attacks through log messages.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a log message containing SQL injection code. Rsyslog's `ommysql` module inserts this unsanitized log message into a MySQL database, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive database information, potential denial of service on the database.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize Parameterized Queries:** Configure rsyslog's database output modules to use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database insertions.
    *   **Log Data Sanitization:** Sanitize log messages to remove or escape characters that could be interpreted as SQL/NoSQL control characters before database insertion.
    *   **Least Privilege Database Access:** Grant rsyslog database users only the minimum necessary privileges required for logging (e.g., INSERT only).

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Network Packets to Input Modules](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_malformed_network_packets_to_input_modules.md)

### 3. Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Network Packets to Input Modules

*   **Description:** Sending crafted or malformed network packets to rsyslog's network input modules (e.g., `imtcp`, `imudp`) can exploit parsing vulnerabilities or resource exhaustion, causing the rsyslog daemon to crash or become unresponsive, leading to a denial of logging service.
*   **Rsyslog Contribution:** Rsyslog's network input modules are the entry point for network-based log ingestion. Vulnerabilities in these modules' packet parsing or resource handling directly expose rsyslog to DoS attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods rsyslog's `imtcp` port with malformed TCP packets that trigger a buffer overflow or excessive resource consumption in the `imtcp` module, causing rsyslog to crash.
*   **Impact:** Loss of logging functionality, inability to monitor system events, potential masking of security incidents, system instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Especially critical in environments where real-time logging is crucial for security monitoring and incident response).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Rsyslog Updated:** Regularly update rsyslog to patch known vulnerabilities in input modules and core components.
    *   **Input Validation and Rate Limiting:** Implement input validation and rate limiting within rsyslog configurations to discard malformed packets and mitigate resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Network Firewalls:** Restrict access to rsyslog's network ports to trusted sources using firewalls.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor rsyslog's resource usage (CPU, memory) to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Information Leakage via Unencrypted Network Log Transmission](./attack_surfaces/information_leakage_via_unencrypted_network_log_transmission.md)

### 4. Information Leakage via Unencrypted Network Log Transmission

*   **Description:** Transmitting sensitive log data over the network without encryption using rsyslog's network output modules (e.g., `omtcp`, `omudp`, `omrelp`, `omfwd` without TLS) exposes the data to eavesdropping and interception by attackers.
*   **Rsyslog Contribution:** Rsyslog's network output modules are responsible for forwarding logs. Configuring them without TLS encryption directly leads to unencrypted transmission of potentially sensitive log data.
*   **Example:** Rsyslog forwards logs to a central server using `omtcp` without TLS. An attacker on the network captures the unencrypted TCP traffic and gains access to sensitive information contained within the logs.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information (credentials, application data, security events), privacy violations, potential system compromise based on leaked data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Severity depends on the sensitivity of the logged data).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce TLS Encryption:** Always enable TLS encryption for network log transmission using `omtcp`, `omrelp`, and `omfwd` when sending logs over networks that are not fully trusted.
    *   **Strong TLS Configuration:** Use strong ciphers and current TLS versions in rsyslog's TLS settings.
    *   **Certificate Management:** Implement proper certificate management for TLS, including certificate validation and secure storage of private keys.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate logging networks to reduce the risk of unauthorized network access and eavesdropping.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Write via Misconfigured `omfile`](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_write_via_misconfigured__omfile_.md)

### 5. Path Traversal Write via Misconfigured `omfile`

*   **Description:** Misconfiguration of the `omfile` output module, particularly with dynamically constructed or user-influenced file paths, can allow attackers to write log files to arbitrary locations on the system, potentially overwriting critical files or creating files in sensitive directories.
*   **Rsyslog Contribution:** `omfile` module's functionality is to write logs to files.  Insufficient validation or restriction of output file paths in `omfile` configuration directly enables path traversal write vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Rsyslog `omfile` configuration uses a variable to define the output file path, and this variable is not properly sanitized. An attacker can manipulate this variable to include path traversal sequences, causing rsyslog to write logs to locations like `/etc/cron.d/malicious_cron`.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise (overwriting critical files), potential privilege escalation (if attacker can overwrite executable files or configuration files), denial of service, system instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Can be critical depending on the files that can be overwritten and the privileges of the rsyslog process).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Output File Paths:**  Strictly define and restrict the file paths used in `omfile` configurations. Avoid dynamic or user-controlled file paths.
    *   **Input Validation:** If dynamic file paths are necessary, rigorously validate and sanitize any input used to construct file paths to prevent path traversal sequences.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (File System):** Run rsyslog with minimal file system write permissions. Limit the directories where rsyslog can write files.
    *   **Configuration Review and Auditing:** Regularly review and audit rsyslog configurations to identify and correct any overly permissive or insecure `omfile` configurations.
