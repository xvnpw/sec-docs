## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Rsyslog Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH if using outdated version]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_rsyslog_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_if_using_outdated_version_.md)

* **AND 1.1: Identify Rsyslog Version [CRITICAL NODE - Reconnaissance Prerequisite]:** Attackers first identify the rsyslog version to target version-specific vulnerabilities. This is a necessary step for exploiting known vulnerabilities.
* **OR 1.2: Exploit Known CVEs [CRITICAL NODE - Direct Exploitation] [HIGH RISK PATH if vulnerable version exists]:** If the rsyslog version is outdated and vulnerable to known CVEs, attackers can leverage publicly available exploits to compromise the system.
    * **1.2.1: Exploit Buffer Overflow Vulnerability (CVE-XXXX-XXXX) [CRITICAL NODE - High Impact Vulnerability] [HIGH RISK PATH if vulnerable version exists]:** Buffer overflow vulnerabilities are common in older software and can lead to code execution and system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Rsyslog Configuration & Features [HIGH RISK PATH if misconfigured]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_rsyslog_configuration_&_features__high_risk_path_if_misconfigured_.md)

* **OR 2.1: Exploit Insecure Input Modules [CRITICAL NODE - Input Vector] [HIGH RISK PATH if imtcp/imudp open without auth]:** Insecurely configured input modules, especially `imtcp` and `imudp` without authentication, are major entry points for attacks.
    * **2.1.1: Abuse imtcp/imudp without proper authentication/authorization [CRITICAL NODE - Common Misconfiguration] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Leaving `imtcp` or `imudp` open without authentication allows anyone to send logs, leading to injection and spoofing.
        * **2.1.1.1: Spoof Log Source IP Address [CRITICAL NODE - Log Injection Enabler]:** Spoofing source IPs allows attackers to inject logs that appear to come from trusted sources, bypassing security measures.
    * **OR 2.2: Exploit Insecure Output Modules [CRITICAL NODE - Output Vector] [HIGH RISK PATH if omprog or DB output used insecurely]:** Misusing output modules, especially `omprog` and database output, can lead to severe consequences.
        * **2.2.1.2: Overwrite Sensitive Files via Misconfiguration [CRITICAL NODE - High Impact Misconfiguration]:** Extreme misconfiguration of `omfile` could allow overwriting critical system files, causing system instability or compromise.
        * **2.2.2: Abuse omprog to execute arbitrary commands [CRITICAL NODE - High Risk Module] [HIGH RISK PATH if omprog is used]:** The `omprog` module, if used, is a high-risk path due to its ability to execute external commands based on log content.
            * **2.2.2.1: Inject Malicious Commands via Log Content [CRITICAL NODE - Command Injection] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  If log content is not sanitized before being passed to `omprog`, attackers can inject malicious commands for execution.
        * **2.2.3: Abuse Database Output Modules (ommysql, ompostgresql, etc.) [HIGH RISK PATH if DB output used without sanitization]:** Database output modules are vulnerable to SQL injection if log content is not properly sanitized before database insertion.
            * **2.2.3.1: SQL Injection via Log Content [CRITICAL NODE - SQL Injection] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers can inject SQL commands within log messages to be executed against the database.
            * **2.2.3.2: Database Credential Theft via Rsyslog Configuration [CRITICAL NODE - Credential Exposure]:** Database credentials stored insecurely in rsyslog configuration files can be stolen.
    * **OR 2.3: Exploit Misconfiguration of Rsyslog Itself [CRITICAL NODE - Configuration Security] [HIGH RISK PATH if config files are insecure]:** General misconfigurations of rsyslog itself, especially related to configuration file security and privileges, are high-risk.
        * **2.3.1: Weak Permissions on Rsyslog Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE - Access Control] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Weak permissions on configuration files allow attackers to modify rsyslog's behavior.
            * **2.3.1.1: Modify Rsyslog Configuration to Gain Persistence [CRITICAL NODE - Persistence Mechanism] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers can modify the configuration to establish persistence, execute commands, or redirect logs.
        * **2.3.2: Running Rsyslog with Excessive Privileges [CRITICAL NODE - Privilege Management] [HIGH RISK PATH if running as root]:** Running rsyslog with root privileges amplifies the impact of any vulnerability.
            * **2.3.2.1: Privilege Escalation via Rsyslog Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE - Amplified Impact] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** If rsyslog runs as root, exploiting any vulnerability can lead to immediate root access.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Log Injection & Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH - Log Integrity]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__log_injection_&_manipulation__high_risk_path_-_log_integrity_.md)

* **3.1: Direct Log Injection [CRITICAL NODE - Injection Point] [HIGH RISK PATH if application logs unsanitized input or input ports are open]:** Direct injection of malicious logs is a significant threat, especially if input channels are open or applications log unsanitized user input.
    * **3.1.1: Application Logs User-Controlled Input without Sanitization [CRITICAL NODE - Application Vulnerability] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Applications logging unsanitized user input create a direct pathway for log injection attacks.
        * **3.1.1.1: Inject Malicious Payloads via Log Messages [CRITICAL NODE - Payload Delivery] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers can inject malicious payloads within log messages that are later processed by other systems or viewed by users.
    * **3.1.2: Inject Logs via Unsecured Input Channels (e.g., open TCP/UDP ports) [CRITICAL NODE - Unsecured Input] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Open and unsecured input channels like TCP/UDP ports allow direct log injection.
    * **3.2: Log Forgery & Spoofing [HIGH RISK PATH - Audit Trail Manipulation]:** Forging and spoofing logs can compromise audit trails and bypass security monitoring.
        * **3.2.1: Spoof Logs from Trusted Sources [CRITICAL NODE - Monitoring Bypass]:** Spoofing logs to appear from trusted sources allows attackers to bypass source-based security monitoring.
            * **3.2.1.1: Bypass Security Monitoring by Injecting False Logs [CRITICAL NODE - Evasion Technique] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Injecting false or misleading logs can drown out malicious activity and evade detection.
    * **3.3: Log Tampering (If Logs are Stored Insecurely) [CRITICAL NODE - Insecure Log Storage] [HIGH RISK PATH if log storage is insecure]:** If log storage is insecure, attackers can directly manipulate log files.
        * **3.3.1: Modify Log Files Directly [CRITICAL NODE - Evidence Destruction] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Direct modification of log files allows attackers to delete evidence of their actions.
            * **3.3.1.1: Delete Evidence of Attack [CRITICAL NODE - Cover-up] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Deleting log entries related to malicious activity is a direct attempt to cover up an attack.
