# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rsyslog/rsyslog

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Filtering with Regular Expressions](./mitigation_strategies/input_filtering_with_regular_expressions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Filtering with Regular Expressions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Potential Malicious Patterns:** Analyze common attack vectors like log injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS) to identify patterns that might appear in log messages (e.g., shell commands, HTML tags, SQL injection attempts).
    2.  **Define Regular Expressions in `rsyslog.conf`:** Create regular expressions within your `rsyslog.conf` file to match these identified malicious patterns.
    3.  **Implement Filtering Rules in `rsyslog.conf`:** Use `rsyslog`'s conditional statements (`if`, `then`, `stop`) and property replacers with the `regex` function to filter or modify log messages based on the defined regular expressions.
        *   **Example (Dropping messages containing "malicious pattern"):**
            ```
            if $msg contains 'malicious pattern' then {
                stop
            }
            ```
        *   **Example (Sanitizing messages by escaping special characters):**
            ```
            :msg, regex, replace, "([<>&'\"/])", "\\\\$1"
            ```
    4.  **Test and Refine Filtering Rules:** Thoroughly test the implemented filtering rules to ensure they effectively block malicious patterns without inadvertently dropping legitimate log messages. Regularly review and update the regular expressions in `rsyslog.conf` as new attack patterns emerge.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Attackers inject malicious commands or data into logs to manipulate logging systems, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data breaches.
    *   **Command Injection via Logs (High Severity):** If logs are processed by scripts or applications vulnerable to command injection, malicious log entries can trigger unintended command execution.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Logs (Medium Severity):** If logs are displayed in web interfaces without proper sanitization, injected XSS payloads can execute in users' browsers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Log Injection Attacks:** High risk reduction by preventing malicious data from being processed or stored as logs by `rsyslog`.
    *   **Command Injection via Logs:** High risk reduction by sanitizing or dropping log entries within `rsyslog` that could be exploited in downstream processing.
    *   **XSS via Logs:** Medium risk reduction by preventing malicious scripts from being logged by `rsyslog` and potentially displayed unsafely later.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the project's `rsyslog.conf`. Basic filtering for common error patterns is configured.
    *   **Location:** `rsyslog.conf` file on application servers.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing comprehensive regular expressions in `rsyslog.conf` for a wider range of potential malicious patterns. Need to expand filtering rules to cover more attack vectors and establish a process to regularly update them within `rsyslog.conf`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Log Sources and Expected Rates:** Analyze log sources that `rsyslog` is processing and determine the expected normal rate of log messages for each source.
    2.  **Load Rate Limiting Module in `rsyslog.conf`:** Ensure the `ratelimit` module is loaded in your `rsyslog.conf` file using the `module(load="ratelimit")` directive.
    3.  **Define Rate Limits in `rsyslog.conf`:** Configure rate limits within `rsyslog.conf` for different log sources or message types based on the expected normal rates. Use conditional statements and the `action(type="ratelimit" ...)` action within rulesets.
        *   **Example (Limiting messages from 'my-app' to 100 messages per second):**
            ```
            module(load="ratelimit")
            ruleset(name="my-ruleset") {
                if $programname == 'my-app' then {
                    action(type="ratelimit" burst="100" rate="1/sec" msg="Rate limit exceeded for my-app")
                    action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/my-app.log")
                    stop # Stop processing after rate limiting action for this rule
                }
                action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/other.log")
            }
            ```
    4.  **Monitor Rate Limiting Effectiveness:** Monitor `rsyslog` logs and system performance to ensure rate limiting is effective in preventing log floods and not inadvertently dropping legitimate logs during normal operation. Adjust rate limits in `rsyslog.conf` as needed based on monitoring.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Log Flooding (High Severity):** Attackers flood the logging system with excessive log messages to overwhelm `rsyslog` resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), potentially causing `rsyslog` instability or impacting log processing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Log Flooding:** High risk reduction by preventing `rsyslog` from being overwhelmed by excessive log traffic, ensuring continued log processing and system stability.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not currently implemented in the project's `rsyslog.conf`.
    *   **Location:** N/A - Configuration needs to be added to `rsyslog.conf` on application and infrastructure servers.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting needs to be implemented in `rsyslog.conf` for critical log sources to protect against DoS attacks targeting the logging system itself. Configuration should be added to `rsyslog.conf` on all relevant servers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Log Destinations with TLS Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/secure_log_destinations_with_tls_encryption.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Log Destinations with TLS Encryption
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose TLS-Capable Output Module in `rsyslog.conf`:** Select the `omtcp` output module in `rsyslog.conf` as it supports TLS encryption using `GnuTLS` or `OpenSSL`. Ensure the module is loaded: `module(load="omtcp")`.
    2.  **Generate TLS Certificates (External to Rsyslog):** Generate TLS certificates for both the `rsyslog` client (sending logs) and the server (receiving logs). Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or create self-signed certificates for testing (ensure secure key management for self-signed certificates). This step is performed outside of `rsyslog` configuration itself.
    3.  **Configure TLS in `rsyslog.conf` Client Configuration:** Configure the `omtcp` output module in `rsyslog.conf` to use TLS. Specify the server address, port, and TLS related parameters like certificate paths and key paths directly within the `action()` directive.
        *   **Example (using GnuTLS in `rsyslog.conf`):**
            ```
            module(load="omtcp")
            action(type="omtcp"
                   target="log-server.example.com"
                   port="6514"
                   tls="on"
                   tls.compression="none"
                   tls.certificate="/etc/rsyslog/certs/client-cert.pem"
                   tls.key="/etc/rsyslog/certs/client-key.pem"
                   tls.cacert="/etc/rsyslog/certs/ca-cert.pem"
                   )
            ```
    4.  **Configure TLS on Log Server (External to Rsyslog):** Configure the log server (e.g., central `rsyslog` server, SIEM) to accept TLS-encrypted connections and validate client certificates if necessary. This is server-side `rsyslog` or SIEM configuration, external to the client `rsyslog.conf`.
    5.  **Test TLS Connection:** Verify the TLS connection between the `rsyslog` client and server. Check `rsyslog` logs for connection errors and use network tools if needed to confirm encrypted communication.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping/Data Interception (High Severity):** Attackers intercept log data in transit over the network, potentially gaining access to sensitive information contained in logs being sent by `rsyslog`.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Attackers intercept and potentially modify log data in transit between `rsyslog` and the log server, or impersonate the log server to steal logs or inject malicious data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping/Data Interception:** High risk reduction by encrypting log data in transit using `rsyslog`'s TLS capabilities, making it unreadable to eavesdroppers.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** High risk reduction by enabling server authentication and encrypted communication within `rsyslog`, making it difficult for attackers to intercept or modify logs undetected.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. TLS is configured in `rsyslog.conf` for sending logs to the central logging server from some, but not all, application servers.
    *   **Location:** `rsyslog.conf` on some application servers.
*   **Missing Implementation:** TLS encryption needs to be enabled in `rsyslog.conf` for all `rsyslog` clients sending logs to the central logging server. Implementation is missing in `rsyslog.conf` on several older application servers and infrastructure components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Filtering and Redaction of Sensitive Data](./mitigation_strategies/output_filtering_and_redaction_of_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Output Filtering and Redaction of Sensitive Data
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data in Logs:** Analyze log messages processed by `rsyslog` to identify types of sensitive information that might be logged (e.g., passwords, API keys, PII, credit card numbers).
    2.  **Define Redaction Rules in `rsyslog.conf`:** Create rules directly within `rsyslog.conf` using property replacers and the `regex, replace` function to identify and redact or mask sensitive data *before* logs are written to destinations.
        *   **Example (Redacting credit card numbers in `rsyslog.conf`):**
            ```
            :msg, regex, replace, "(credit card number: )([0-9]{16})", "$1XXXXXXXXXXXX$2"
            ```
        *   **Example (Removing API keys in `rsyslog.conf`):**
            ```
            :msg, regex, replace, "(API-KEY=)[a-zA-Z0-9]+", "$1[REDACTED]"
            ```
    3.  **Apply Filtering Based on Destination in `rsyslog.conf`:** Use conditional statements in `rsyslog.conf` to apply redaction rules selectively based on the output destination configured within `rsyslog.conf`. Redact more aggressively for less secure destinations and potentially less for highly secure, internal logging systems.
        *   **Example (Redact for file output, less redact for central server, configured in `rsyslog.conf`):**
            ```
            if $programname == 'sensitive-app' then {
                if $action_type == "omfile" then { # Check action type, assuming 'omfile' is used for file output
                    :msg, regex, replace, "(sensitive data)", "[REDACTED]"
                }
                action(type=$action_type ...) # Use the original action type
            }
            ```
    4.  **Test and Validate Redaction in Rsyslog:** Thoroughly test the redaction rules configured in `rsyslog.conf` to ensure they effectively remove or mask sensitive data without impacting the usability of logs for debugging and analysis. Regularly review and update redaction rules in `rsyslog.conf` as logging practices and sensitive data types evolve.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breaches due to Log Exposure (High Severity):** Sensitive data inadvertently logged and stored in logs processed by `rsyslog` can be exposed in data breaches if log files are compromised or accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium to High Severity):** Logging sensitive data via `rsyslog` can violate data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) and lead to fines and reputational damage.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breaches due to Log Exposure:** High risk reduction by preventing sensitive data from being stored in logs processed by `rsyslog`, minimizing the impact of potential log breaches.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Medium to High risk reduction by helping to meet data privacy requirements and avoid compliance penalties through `rsyslog`'s redaction capabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic redaction of passwords in some application logs is configured in `rsyslog.conf`.
    *   **Location:** `rsyslog.conf` for specific application servers.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to expand redaction rules in `rsyslog.conf` to cover a wider range of sensitive data types (API keys, PII, etc.) across all applications and log destinations. A comprehensive review of logging practices is needed to identify all sensitive data being logged and configure appropriate redaction rules in `rsyslog.conf`.
