## High and Critical Rsyslog Threats

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Rsyslog Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Log Source Spoofing** | An attacker crafts log messages with a forged source IP address or hostname to impersonate a legitimate application or system. This can be done by directly sending syslog messages to the rsyslog listener (if network logging is enabled). | **False Information:** Can lead to incorrect security analysis, masking of real attacks, or triggering false alarms. **Reputation Damage:** If malicious logs are forwarded to external systems, it can damage the application's reputation. | **Input Modules (e.g., `imudp`, `imtcp`)** | High | * **Secure Communication Channel:** Use TLS/SSL for network syslog (`omfwd` with `StreamDriver` and `StreamDriverMode`). * **Input Validation (within rsyslog):** While limited, explore rsyslog's filtering capabilities (`if`, `property`) to identify and potentially discard suspicious log patterns based on content or source (use with caution as it can be bypassed). * **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the rsyslog listener. |
| **Log Message Tampering (in transit)** | An attacker intercepts log messages being transmitted over the network (between the application and rsyslog or between rsyslog and its destination) and modifies their content. This is possible if network communication is not encrypted. | **Loss of Integrity:** Log data becomes unreliable for auditing, incident response, and debugging. **Concealment of Attacks:** Attackers can alter logs to hide their activities. | **Forwarding Output Modules (e.g., `omfwd`)** | High | * **Secure Communication Channel:** Use TLS/SSL for network logging (`omfwd` with `StreamDriver` and `StreamDriverMode`). |
| **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Logs** | The application inadvertently logs sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data) which is then accessible through rsyslog's output to various destinations. An attacker gaining access to these logs can then exploit this information. | **Data Breach:** Sensitive information can be exposed to unauthorized parties. **Compliance Violations:** May violate data privacy regulations. | **All Output Modules (e.g., `omfile`, `omfwd`, `ommongodb`)** | Critical | * **Filtering in Rsyslog:** Use rsyslog's filtering capabilities (`if`, `property`, regular expressions) to identify and drop logs containing sensitive information before forwarding them to less secure destinations. * **Secure Log Destinations:** Ensure that log destinations are appropriately secured based on the sensitivity of the data they might contain. |
| **Log Injection Attack (DoS)** | An attacker sends a large volume of crafted log messages to overwhelm rsyslog, consuming resources (CPU, memory, disk space) and potentially causing it to crash or become unresponsive. This can be done via network or local logging mechanisms. | **Logging Service Disruption:** Prevents legitimate log messages from being processed and stored. **Resource Exhaustion:** Can impact the performance of the server running rsyslog. | **Input Modules (e.g., `imudp`, `imtcp`, `imuxsock`)** | High | * **Rate Limiting in Rsyslog:** Configure rsyslog to limit the rate of incoming log messages from specific sources using modules like `limittomod`. * **Input Validation (within rsyslog):** Implement filters to discard excessively large or malformed log messages. * **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor rsyslog's resource usage and set alerts for unusual spikes. |
| **Rsyslog Configuration Vulnerabilities** | If rsyslog is misconfigured, an attacker with access to the configuration files or the rsyslog process might be able to exploit it to gain elevated privileges or execute arbitrary commands. For example, using output modules to write to arbitrary files with elevated permissions. | **System Compromise:** Attackers can gain control of the server running rsyslog. | **Core Rsyslog Functionality, Configuration Files (`rsyslog.conf`)** | Critical | * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run rsyslog with the minimum necessary privileges. * **Secure Configuration:** Follow security best practices for rsyslog configuration, including restricting file permissions on configuration files and log directories. * **Configuration Auditing:** Regularly review rsyslog configuration for potential security weaknesses. * **Restrict Access to Configuration Files:** Limit who can read and modify `rsyslog.conf`. |
| **Exploiting Rsyslog Module Vulnerabilities** | Vulnerabilities in specific rsyslog modules (input, output, or processing modules) could be exploited by an attacker to gain elevated privileges, cause a denial of service, or leak information. This requires a known vulnerability in a specific module. | **System Compromise, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure:** Depends on the specific vulnerability. | **Specific Rsyslog Modules (e.g., `imfile`, `omprog`, `omhttp`)** | Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability) | * **Regular Updates:** Keep rsyslog and its modules updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. * **Module Auditing:** Be aware of the modules being used and their potential security implications. * **Disable Unnecessary Modules:** Only enable the modules that are strictly required. * **Follow Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security vulnerabilities related to rsyslog. |
| **Unintended Side Effects of Output Modules** | Misconfigured or poorly understood output modules (e.g., `omprog` which executes external commands) can be exploited to perform unintended actions on the system. An attacker might manipulate log messages to trigger malicious commands. | **System Compromise, Data Manipulation:** Depends on the capabilities of the external program executed by the output module. | **Output Modules that Execute External Commands (e.g., `omprog`)** | Critical | * **Avoid `omprog` if possible:** Use safer alternatives for log processing or forwarding. * **Strict Input Validation for `omprog`:** If `omprog` is necessary, carefully sanitize and validate any data passed to the external program from log messages. * **Principle of Least Privilege for External Programs:** Ensure the external program executed by `omprog` runs with the minimum necessary privileges. |
