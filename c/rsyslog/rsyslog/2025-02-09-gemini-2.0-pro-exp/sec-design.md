# Project Design Document: rsyslog

## BUSINESS POSTURE

Rsyslog is a widely-used, open-source software utility for forwarding log messages over a network. It's a core component in many systems for centralized logging, security auditing, and compliance. Given its widespread use and critical function, the business posture focuses on reliability, performance, security, and maintainability.

Priorities:

*   Reliability: Ensuring log messages are delivered reliably and without loss is paramount. System administrators rely on rsyslog for critical system monitoring and troubleshooting.
*   Performance: Rsyslog must handle high volumes of log data with minimal overhead to avoid impacting the performance of the systems it monitors.
*   Security: Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of log data is crucial, especially as logs often contain sensitive information.
*   Maintainability: The project must be maintainable and extensible to adapt to evolving logging needs and security threats.
*   Compatibility: Maintaining compatibility with a wide range of systems and log formats is essential for its broad adoption.

Business Goals:

*   Provide a robust and reliable logging solution for system administrators.
*   Offer a high-performance logging solution that scales to meet demanding workloads.
*   Ensure the secure transmission and storage of log data.
*   Maintain a well-documented and easily extensible codebase.
*   Support a wide range of input and output formats.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Log data loss: Failure to capture or deliver log messages can hinder troubleshooting, security investigations, and compliance efforts.
*   Performance bottlenecks: Slow log processing can impact the performance of other systems.
*   Security breaches: Unauthorized access to or modification of log data can compromise sensitive information and undermine security audits.
*   Lack of compatibility: Inability to integrate with new systems or log formats can limit adoption and usefulness.
*   Code vulnerabilities: Security flaws in the codebase can be exploited by attackers.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: TLS encryption: Rsyslog supports TLS encryption for secure log transmission. (Implemented in network communication modules).
*   security control: Authentication: Rsyslog supports various authentication mechanisms, including TLS client certificates and GSSAPI. (Implemented in network communication and authentication modules).
*   security control: Access control: Rsyslog can be configured to restrict access to specific sources and destinations. (Implemented via configuration files).
*   security control: Input validation: Rsyslog performs input validation to mitigate some injection attacks. (Implemented in input processing modules).
*   security control: Regular security audits: The Rsyslog project undergoes periodic security reviews and audits. (Documented in project security policy).
*   security control: Community involvement: A large and active community contributes to identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities. (Evidenced by the project's GitHub repository and mailing lists).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity of configuration: Rsyslog's configuration can be complex, potentially leading to misconfigurations that could impact security.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on external libraries: Rsyslog relies on external libraries, which may introduce vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Potential for denial-of-service: Rsyslog, like any network service, is susceptible to denial-of-service attacks.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement SELinux/AppArmor policies: Provide pre-built SELinux or AppArmor policies to further restrict Rsyslog's privileges.
*   security control: Enhanced input validation: Strengthen input validation to prevent more sophisticated injection attacks.
*   security control: Fuzz testing: Integrate regular fuzz testing into the development process to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Static analysis: Incorporate static analysis tools into the build process to detect potential code vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Supply chain security: Implement measures to verify the integrity of dependencies and build tools.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support strong authentication mechanisms for remote connections (e.g., TLS client certificates, GSSAPI).
    *   Provide options for local authentication (e.g., PAM).
    *   Protect against brute-force attacks.

*   Authorization:
    *   Implement granular access control based on source, destination, and message content.
    *   Allow administrators to define rules for filtering and routing log messages.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, format string vulnerabilities).
    *   Sanitize log messages to remove potentially harmful characters.
    *   Handle malformed input gracefully without crashing.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong cryptographic algorithms for encryption and authentication (e.g., TLS 1.3 or higher).
    *   Protect cryptographic keys securely.
    *   Provide options for using hardware security modules (HSMs).

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer[Developer] --> GitRepository[Git Repository]
    GitRepository --> BuildServer[Build Server (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)]
    BuildServer --> SAST[SAST Tools]
    BuildServer --> DependencyCheck[Dependency Check Tools]

    DependencyCheck --> VulnerabilityReport[Vulnerability Report]
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer: Developers write and commit code to the Git repository.
2.  Git Repository: The source code is stored in a Git repository (GitHub).
3.  Build Server: A build server (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) automatically triggers builds upon code changes.
4.  SAST Tools: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools (e.g., SonarQube, Coverity) analyze the source code for potential vulnerabilities.
5.  Dependency Check Tools: Dependency check tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check) scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
6.  Build Artifacts: The build server compiles the code and creates build artifacts (e.g., .deb, .rpm packages).
7.  Artifact Repository: Build artifacts are stored in an artifact repository.
8.  Security Report: SAST tools generate security reports, highlighting potential vulnerabilities.
9.  Vulnerability Report: Dependency check tools generate reports listing known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code review: All code changes undergo peer review before being merged.
*   security control: SAST: Static analysis tools are used to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Dependency checking: Dependencies are scanned for known vulnerabilities.

*   security control: Signed releases: Release artifacts are digitally signed to ensure authenticity and integrity.
*   security control: Supply chain security: Efforts are made to verify the integrity of build tools and dependencies (though this is an ongoing challenge).

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   System monitoring and troubleshooting: Rsyslog is essential for monitoring the health and performance of systems and for diagnosing issues.
*   Security auditing and incident response: Rsyslog provides the audit trail necessary for investigating security incidents and demonstrating compliance.
*   Compliance with regulations: Many regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) require logging and auditing, which Rsyslog facilitates.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   Log data: This includes system logs, application logs, and security logs.
    *   Sensitivity: Varies widely. Can range from low (e.g., routine system events) to high (e.g., authentication logs, error logs containing sensitive data, security event logs).  The sensitivity depends on the specific content of the logs and the context in which they are generated.  Logs may contain personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), or other confidential data.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific compliance requirements (if any) apply to the systems using Rsyslog? (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)
*   What is the expected volume of log data? (This impacts performance requirements and resource allocation.)

*   DESIGN: It is assumed that the network infrastructure supports the chosen logging protocols.
*   DESIGN: It is assumed that sufficient resources (CPU, memory, storage) will be allocated to Rsyslog to handle the expected log volume.
