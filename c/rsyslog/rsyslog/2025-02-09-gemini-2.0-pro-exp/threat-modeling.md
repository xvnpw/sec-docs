# Threat Model Analysis for rsyslog/rsyslog

## Threat: [Threat: Forged Log Message Injection (Spoofing)](./threats/threat_forged_log_message_injection__spoofing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts and sends log messages to the rsyslog instance that appear to originate from a legitimate source.  The attacker leverages vulnerabilities in how rsyslog processes incoming messages, bypassing intended source verification. This differs from simply sending a message *to* rsyslog; it involves exploiting weaknesses *within* rsyslog's handling of message metadata.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Corruption of log data, leading to inaccurate analysis.
    *   Masking of actual malicious activity.
    *   Triggering of false positive alerts.
    *   Misleading investigations.
*   **Affected Rsyslog Component:**
    *   Input Modules: `imudp`, `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imrelp`, `imfile`, `imjournal`, `imklog`, `imuxsock` (specifically, their message parsing and source validation logic).
    *   Message Parsing:  The core message parsing engine within rsyslog, including handling of syslog headers and structured data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation (Rsyslog Config):** Implement robust input validation *within rsyslog's configuration* using RainerScript. Check for expected message formats, allowed characters, reasonable message lengths, and valid source identifiers (where applicable). Use `property-based filters` to examine specific message properties (e.g., `$fromhost`, `$hostname`, `$syslogtag`, `$msg`). Reject messages that don't conform.
    *   **TLS with Mutual Authentication (Rsyslog Config):**  Require TLS encryption with client certificate authentication (mutual TLS) for all network-based input modules (`imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imrelp`). Configure rsyslog to *require* and *verify* client certificates. This is configured within the rsyslog configuration itself.
    *   **Relp Authentication (Rsyslog Config):** If using RELP (`imrelp`), configure strong authentication and authorization mechanisms *within the rsyslog configuration*.
    *  **GSSAPI/Kerberos (Rsyslog Config):** If using, configure correctly within rsyslog.

## Threat: [Threat: Log Message Tampering in Transit (Tampering)](./threats/threat_log_message_tampering_in_transit__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and modifies log messages *as they are being processed by rsyslog*, exploiting vulnerabilities in network input or output modules. This is distinct from general network interception; it targets weaknesses *within rsyslog's handling* of network traffic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Loss of log integrity.
    *   Repudiation.
    *   Compromised investigations.
*   **Affected Rsyslog Component:**
    *   Network Input Modules: `imudp`, `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imrelp` (specifically, their data handling and integrity check mechanisms).
    *   Network Output Modules (if forwarding): `omrelp`, `omfwd`, `omhttp` (specifically, their data handling and integrity check mechanisms).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **TLS Encryption (Rsyslog Config):**  Use TLS encryption for all network-based communication with rsyslog (both input and output modules). Configure strong cipher suites and certificate validation *within the rsyslog configuration*.
    *   **Relp Integrity Checks (Rsyslog Config):**  For RELP (`imrelp`, `omrelp`), ensure that built-in integrity checks are enabled and properly configured *within the rsyslog configuration*.

## Threat: [Threat: Log File Tampering on Disk (Tampering)](./threats/threat_log_file_tampering_on_disk__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker, having gained some level of access, exploits vulnerabilities *within rsyslog's file handling* to modify log files. This goes beyond simply having write access to the files; it implies exploiting a flaw in how rsyslog writes or manages them.  (Example: a race condition or a buffer overflow in `omfile`).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Loss of log integrity.
    *   Repudiation.
    *   Compromised investigations.
*   **Affected Rsyslog Component:**
    *   Output Modules: `omfile`, `ompipe` (specifically, their file writing and permission handling logic).
    *   Rsyslog Core: File handling and writing operations (potential vulnerabilities in core file I/O routines).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **SELinux/AppArmor (Targeted Policies):**  Use SELinux or AppArmor with *highly specific policies* that restrict rsyslog's file access *beyond* standard file permissions.  These policies should limit even the rsyslog user's ability to modify files in unexpected ways. This is a system-level mitigation, but the *policy itself* is highly specific to rsyslog's behavior.
    *   **Keep Rsyslog Updated:**  Address potential vulnerabilities in rsyslog's file handling code.
    * **Auditing (auditd - Rsyslog Specific Rules):** Configure auditd with rules specifically targeting rsyslog's file access, going beyond general file monitoring.

## Threat: [Threat: Sensitive Information Disclosure in Logs (Information Disclosure)](./threats/threat_sensitive_information_disclosure_in_logs__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** Applications log sensitive data, and rsyslog processes and stores these logs.  The threat here is that rsyslog's *configuration or processing* might inadvertently expose this data (e.g., through debug logging, improper filtering, or vulnerabilities in output modules).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise of credentials.
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Compliance violations.
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **Affected Rsyslog Component:**
    *   All Input Modules.
    *   All Output Modules.
    *   Filtering and Processing:  Any component that handles the log message content (e.g., RainerScript, legacy filters, modules like `mmjsonparse`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Filtering (Rsyslog Config):**  Use rsyslog's filtering capabilities *within the rsyslog configuration* (e.g., `property-based filters`, `regex filters`, `mmfields`) to identify and *discard* or *modify* log messages containing sensitive data.  This is a *crucial* rsyslog-specific mitigation, even if application-level sanitization is also used. Use regular expressions cautiously to avoid performance issues and ReDoS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Encryption at Rest (Targeted):** Encrypt the log files using file system encryption, but this is less rsyslog-specific. The *key management* and *access control* to the encryption keys are crucial and should be tightly integrated with rsyslog's operation.
    *   **Avoid Debug Logging in Production:** Ensure that debug logging features (e.g., `$DebugLevel`, `$DebugFile`) are *disabled* in production environments.

## Threat: [Threat: Rsyslog Configuration Exposure (Information Disclosure)](./threats/threat_rsyslog_configuration_exposure__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** Rsyslog configuration files contain sensitive information (credentials), and vulnerabilities in *how rsyslog handles these files* could lead to exposure. This is distinct from simply having read access to the files; it implies a flaw in rsyslog's configuration loading or handling.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise of connected systems.
    *   Unauthorized data access.
    *   Lateral movement.
*   **Affected Rsyslog Component:**
    *   Configuration Files: The main configuration file and any included configuration files.
    *   Configuration Parsing: The code within rsyslog that parses and loads the configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials (Rsyslog Config):**  *Never* hardcode credentials directly in the configuration files. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system. Rsyslog can access environment variables using the `$!VARNAME` syntax *within the configuration file*. This is a *key rsyslog-specific* mitigation.
    *   **Regular Configuration Audits (Automated):** Regularly review rsyslog configuration files, ideally using *automated tools* that specifically understand rsyslog's syntax and can identify potential secrets or misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Threat: Denial of Service via Log Flooding (DoS)](./threats/threat_denial_of_service_via_log_flooding__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms rsyslog with log messages, exploiting vulnerabilities in rsyslog's *input handling or queueing mechanisms*. This is not just about sending a lot of data; it's about exploiting weaknesses *within rsyslog* to cause resource exhaustion.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Loss of log data.
    *   Disruption of log monitoring.
    *   Potential application impact.
*   **Affected Rsyslog Component:**
    *   Input Modules: `imudp`, `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imrelp` (specifically, their connection handling and rate limiting logic).
    *   Queueing System:  The internal queueing mechanisms within rsyslog (potential vulnerabilities in queue management).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (Rsyslog Config):**  Use rsyslog's built-in rate limiting features *within the rsyslog configuration*.  Use `impstats` to monitor input rates, and configure options within `imptcp`, `imudp`, and `imrelp` to limit connections and message rates. Use RainerScript to implement custom rate limiting logic *within rsyslog*.
    *   **Queue Management (Rsyslog Config):**  Configure appropriate queue sizes and settings *within the rsyslog configuration* to handle bursts of log messages. Use disk-assisted queues (`queue.type="DiskAssisted"`) and tune `queue.size`, `queue.dequeueBatchSize`, and `queue.workerThreads`. This is a *key rsyslog-specific* mitigation.
    *   **Input Validation (Rsyslog Config):** Strict input validation *within the rsyslog configuration* can help prevent malformed messages from causing unexpected resource consumption.

## Threat: [Threat: Denial of Service via Disk Space Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/threat_denial_of_service_via_disk_space_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in rsyslog's *file writing or log rotation* to cause excessive disk usage. This is not just about sending large logs; it's about exploiting flaws *within rsyslog* to bypass intended limits.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Loss of log data.
    *   Rsyslog service failure.
    *   Potential system instability.
*   **Affected Rsyslog Component:**
    *   Output Modules: `omfile` (specifically, its file writing, rotation, and compression logic).
    *   Rsyslog Core: File writing operations (potential vulnerabilities in core file I/O routines).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Log Rotation and Compression (Rsyslog Config):**  Configure aggressive log rotation and compression *using `omfile` options within the rsyslog configuration* (e.g., `$outchannel`, `$ActionFileEnableCompression`, `$ActionFileMaxSize`, `$ActionRotateWhenFileSizeExceeds`). This is a *key rsyslog-specific* mitigation.
    * **Keep Rsyslog Updated:** Address potential vulnerabilities in rsyslog's file handling and rotation code.

## Threat: [Threat: Privilege Escalation via Rsyslog Vulnerability (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/threat_privilege_escalation_via_rsyslog_vulnerability__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within the rsyslog daemon itself, a loaded module, or a misconfiguration* to gain elevated privileges. This is the core threat of a direct rsyslog vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete system compromise.
    *   Unauthorized access to all data.
    *   Lateral movement.
*   **Affected Rsyslog Component:**
    *   Potentially *any* component, depending on the vulnerability. This could include input modules, output modules, message parsing, configuration parsing, or the core rsyslog daemon itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Rsyslog Updated:**  *Always* run the latest stable version of rsyslog. This is the *primary* mitigation for vulnerabilities in rsyslog itself.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Rsyslog Config):**  Run rsyslog with the *minimum* necessary privileges. Avoid running it as root. Use the `$PrivDropToUser` and `$PrivDropToGroup` directives *within the rsyslog configuration*.
    *   **SELinux/AppArmor (Targeted Policies):** Use SELinux/AppArmor with *highly specific policies* to confine rsyslog, even if compromised. This is a system-level mitigation, but the *policy* is tailored to rsyslog.
    *   **Minimize Modules (Rsyslog Config):**  Only load necessary rsyslog modules. Disable unused modules *in the configuration file*.
    *   **Code Auditing (Custom Modules):** If using custom modules, perform thorough code auditing.
    * **Input validation (Rsyslog Config):** Validate all data that is used to generate configuration files *within rsyslog configuration*.

## Threat: [Threat:  Improper Handling of Malformed Messages (DoS, Information Disclosure, EoP)](./threats/threat__improper_handling_of_malformed_messages__dos__information_disclosure__eop_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted, malformed log messages that exploit vulnerabilities in rsyslog's *parsing logic*. This is specifically about flaws *within rsyslog's code* that handles message parsing.
* **Impact:**
    * Denial of Service (DoS).
    * Potential Information Disclosure.
    * In rare cases, potential Elevation of Privilege (EoP).
* **Affected Rsyslog Component:**
    * Input Modules: Primarily those handling raw message input (`imudp`, `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imfile`).
    * Message Parsing: The core message parsing engine and any related modules (e.g., `mmjsonparse`, `mmanon`).
* **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if EoP is possible)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Validation (Rsyslog Config):** Implement strict input validation *within the rsyslog configuration* *before* the message reaches the core parsing logic. Use RainerScript to check for message length, allowed characters, and expected structure. Reject or sanitize malformed messages. This is a *key rsyslog-specific* mitigation.
    * **Fuzz Testing:** Perform fuzz testing on rsyslog's input modules to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
    * **Keep Rsyslog Updated:** Regularly update rsyslog.
    * **Use well-tested input modules (Rsyslog Config):** Prefer well-tested and maintained input modules.
