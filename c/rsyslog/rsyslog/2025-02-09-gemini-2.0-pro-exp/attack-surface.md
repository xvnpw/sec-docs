# Attack Surface Analysis for rsyslog/rsyslog

## Attack Surface: [1. Maliciously Crafted Log Messages (Input Validation - High/Critical)](./attack_surfaces/1__maliciously_crafted_log_messages__input_validation_-_highcritical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send specially crafted log messages designed to exploit vulnerabilities in rsyslog's parsing and processing logic.
    *   **Rsyslog Contribution:** Rsyslog's core function is to parse and process log messages from various sources and formats. Vulnerabilities in the parsing logic of *any* input module or message modification module are directly attributable to rsyslog.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a log message with an extremely long string to trigger a buffer overflow in a specific parser (e.g., `mmrfc5424`, `mmjsonparse`). Another example: injecting format string specifiers into a component that uses `printf`-like functions internally.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution (Critical), denial of service (High/Critical), information disclosure (High).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement *strict* input validation within rsyslog configurations and any custom modules. Validate length, character sets, and data types for *all* incoming messages. Reject non-conforming messages.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Regularly fuzz test *all* of rsyslog's input parsers and message modification modules with a wide range of malformed and unexpected inputs.
        *   **Safe String Handling:** Enforce the use of safe string handling functions (e.g., `snprintf` instead of `sprintf`) throughout rsyslog's codebase and any custom modules. Avoid *all* format string vulnerabilities.
        *   **Memory Protection:** Compile rsyslog with all available memory protection features (e.g., stack canaries, ASLR, DEP/NX).
        *   **Regular Expression Security:**  Rigorously review and test *all* regular expressions used in rsyslog configurations and modules to prevent ReDoS. Use tools to analyze regex complexity.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run rsyslog with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges (never as root).

## Attack Surface: [2. Network Protocol Attacks (Communication Security - High)](./attack_surfaces/2__network_protocol_attacks__communication_security_-_high_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the network protocols used by rsyslog to intercept, modify, or inject log data. *Focus here is on rsyslog's implementation and configuration of these protocols.*
    *   **Rsyslog Contribution:** Rsyslog's implementation of network protocols (specifically, its handling of TLS, RELP, and even basic TCP/UDP) is the direct source of this attack surface. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in *rsyslog's* TLS stack are key.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a weak TLS cipher suite *configured within rsyslog* to decrypt encrypted log traffic. Another example: exploiting a vulnerability in *rsyslog's* RELP implementation to inject forged messages.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (eavesdropping), data tampering, log injection, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory TLS:** Enforce the use of TLS for *all* network communication.  Completely disable plaintext protocols (UDP/TCP syslog) in rsyslog's configuration.
        *   **Strong TLS Configuration:** Configure TLS *within rsyslog* with strong cipher suites, proper certificate validation (including revocation checks), and up-to-date TLS libraries. Regularly review and update rsyslog's TLS settings.
        *   **Authentication:** Implement authentication for RELP and other protocols *within rsyslog's configuration* to prevent unauthorized connections.
        *   **Rsyslog-Specific Firewall Rules:** Configure firewall rules to restrict access to rsyslog's listening ports to *only* authorized clients, based on IP address or other criteria.

## Attack Surface: [3. RainerScript Code Injection (Critical)](./attack_surfaces/3__rainerscript_code_injection__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious RainerScript code into rsyslog configurations, leading to arbitrary command execution.
    *   **Rsyslog Contribution:** RainerScript is rsyslog's *own* scripting language.  Any vulnerability related to its execution or the handling of user-provided input within RainerScript is entirely within rsyslog's domain.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects RainerScript code that executes a shell command. This is possible if user input is directly incorporated into a RainerScript template *without proper escaping or validation within the rsyslog configuration*.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** *Strictly* validate and sanitize *any* user-provided input that is used in *any* part of a RainerScript script within the rsyslog configuration.  *Never* directly embed user input. Use parameterized queries or escaping functions if available.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review *all* RainerScript code within rsyslog configurations for potential injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run rsyslog with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges (never as root) to limit the damage from successful code injection.

## Attack Surface: [4. Local Attacks (Privilege Escalation - High/Critical)](./attack_surfaces/4__local_attacks__privilege_escalation_-_highcritical_.md)

* **Description:** Local, unprivileged users exploit vulnerabilities *within rsyslog* to gain elevated privileges or access sensitive data.
    * **Rsyslog Contribution:** This focuses on vulnerabilities in rsyslog's handling of local resources (files, shared memory, sockets), *not* general system misconfigurations.
    * **Example:** A local user exploits a vulnerability in rsyslog's handling of Unix domain sockets *to inject messages or read log data*. Another example: a vulnerability in how rsyslog handles temporary files allows a local user to overwrite critical system files.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation (Critical), information disclosure (High), denial of service (High).
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run rsyslog with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges. *Never* run as root. Use dedicated, unprivileged user accounts.
        *   **Secure File Permissions:** Ensure that rsyslog configuration files, log files, and *all related directories* have *strict* permissions, preventing unauthorized access or modification by *any* unprivileged user.
        *   **SELinux/AppArmor:** Use mandatory access control systems (SELinux/AppArmor) to *confine rsyslog's access* to system resources, even if it's compromised. This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.
        *   **Proper Socket Permissions:** If rsyslog uses Unix domain sockets, ensure they have *appropriate permissions* to restrict access to *only* authorized users and processes, as defined within the rsyslog configuration and system security policies.
        * **Audit Rsyslog Code:** Audit the rsyslog source code for vulnerabilities related to local resource handling (file operations, shared memory, sockets).
