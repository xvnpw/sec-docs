# Deep Analysis: Rsyslog Input Validation (mmfields, mmnormalize)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, and potential limitations of using `mmfields` and `mmnormalize` for input validation within an rsyslog deployment.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for implementation, including specific configuration examples and considerations for ongoing maintenance.  The analysis will also identify potential gaps in the mitigation strategy and suggest supplementary controls.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the proposed mitigation strategy: using the `mmfields` and `mmnormalize` modules in rsyslog for input validation.  It encompasses:

*   **Functionality:**  How `mmfields` and `mmnormalize` work, individually and together.
*   **Configuration:**  Best practices for configuring these modules, including rulebase design.
*   **Threat Mitigation:**  A detailed assessment of how effectively this strategy mitigates the identified threats (Message Tampering, Message Spoofing, Log Injection Attacks).
*   **Performance Impact:**  Consideration of the potential performance overhead of using these modules.
*   **Implementation Steps:**  A breakdown of the necessary steps to implement the strategy.
*   **Limitations:**  Identification of scenarios where this strategy might be insufficient.
*   **Complementary Controls:**  Suggestions for additional security measures to enhance the overall security posture.
*   **Specific log sources:** Analysis will consider generic log sources, but will also provide examples for common log formats like syslog (RFC3164 and RFC5424), and application-specific JSON logs.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will be conducted using the following methodology:

1.  **Documentation Review:**  Thorough review of the official rsyslog documentation for `mmfields` and `mmnormalize`.
2.  **Practical Experimentation:**  Setting up a test rsyslog environment to experiment with different configurations and rulebases.  This will involve generating both valid and invalid log messages to test the effectiveness of the validation.
3.  **Best Practice Research:**  Investigating industry best practices for log normalization and validation.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Analyzing the identified threats in the context of the rsyslog deployment and assessing the mitigation provided by the proposed strategy.
5.  **Code Review (if applicable):** If custom scripts or configurations are involved, a review of their security implications will be performed.  This is less applicable to the core modules themselves, but relevant to any custom rulebases.
6.  **Expert Consultation:** Leveraging existing knowledge and potentially consulting with other cybersecurity experts specializing in logging and SIEM.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Input Validation Strategy

### 2.1 Module Functionality

*   **`mmfields` (Field Extraction):** This module extracts data from log messages based on defined field separators.  It's crucial for breaking down unstructured or semi-structured log data into individual fields that can then be validated.  It supports various extraction methods, including character-based splitting, regular expressions, and JSON parsing.  `mmfields` *does not* perform validation itself; it prepares the data for validation.

*   **`mmnormalize` (Normalization and Validation):** This module is the core of the validation strategy.  It uses *rulebases* to define the expected structure and content of log messages.  A rulebase consists of a set of rules, each specifying:
    *   **Parser:**  How to parse the message (e.g., `rfc3164`, `rfc5424`, `csv`, `json`, or a custom parser).
    *   **Rules:**  A sequence of actions to extract and validate fields.  These actions can include:
        *   `parse`:  Extract a field.
        *   `check`:  Validate a field against a pattern (e.g., regular expression, list of allowed values).
        *   `rename`:  Rename a field.
        *   `drop`:  Discard a field.
        *   `constant`:  Assign a constant value to a field.
    *   **`$parsesuccess`:**  A built-in variable that indicates whether the message successfully parsed according to the rulebase.  This is critical for determining whether to accept or reject a message.

### 2.2 Configuration Best Practices

*   **Modular Rulebases:**  Create separate rulebases for different log sources or message types.  This improves maintainability and reduces complexity.  Don't try to validate everything in a single, massive rulebase.

*   **Prioritize Critical Fields:**  Focus validation efforts on fields that are most critical for security monitoring and incident response (e.g., timestamps, source IPs, usernames, event IDs).

*   **Use Regular Expressions Carefully:**  Regular expressions are powerful but can be complex and performance-intensive.  Use them judiciously and ensure they are well-tested and optimized.  Avoid overly broad regular expressions (e.g., `.*`) that could match unexpected input.  Use online regex testers to validate your expressions.

*   **Leverage Built-in Parsers:**  Use the built-in parsers (`rfc3164`, `rfc5424`, `json`, etc.) whenever possible.  These are generally more efficient and reliable than custom parsers.

*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Before deploying any rulebase to production, test it extensively with a wide range of valid and invalid log messages.  This is crucial to ensure that the rulebase is working as expected and not inadvertently dropping legitimate log data.

*   **Version Control:**  Store your rulebases in a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and facilitate rollbacks if necessary.

*   **Documentation:**  Document your rulebases thoroughly, explaining the purpose of each rule and the expected format of the log messages.

### 2.3 Threat Mitigation Assessment

*   **Message Tampering (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  `mmnormalize` can effectively detect message tampering if the tampering alters the structure or content of the message in a way that violates the defined rules.  For example, if a timestamp is modified to an invalid format, or a critical field is removed, `mmnormalize` can detect this.
    *   **Limitations:**  If the tampering is subtle and maintains the expected format (e.g., changing a username to another valid username), `mmnormalize` might not detect it *without additional context*.  This highlights the need for complementary controls like correlation rules in a SIEM.

*   **Message Spoofing (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  `mmnormalize` can make spoofing more difficult by enforcing strict format requirements.  If a spoofed message doesn't conform to the expected format, it will be rejected.
    *   **Limitations:**  `mmnormalize` primarily validates the *content* of the message, not its *origin*.  It cannot, by itself, prevent an attacker from sending a perfectly formatted message from a spoofed IP address.  This requires additional controls like network-level filtering (firewalls) and sender verification (e.g., SPF, DKIM, DMARC for email logs).

*   **Log Injection Attacks (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  `mmnormalize` can help prevent some log injection attacks by validating the format of log messages and rejecting messages that contain unexpected characters or patterns.  For example, if an attacker tries to inject SQL code into a log message, `mmnormalize` can be configured to detect and reject this.
    *   **Limitations:**  `mmnormalize` is not a complete solution for preventing log injection attacks.  It's primarily focused on structural validation.  Sophisticated injection attacks might be able to bypass `mmnormalize` if they can craft malicious input that conforms to the expected format.  This requires additional controls like output encoding and contextual validation.  For example, if a log message contains a URL, `mmnormalize` might validate that it's a valid URL format, but it won't necessarily check if the URL is malicious.

### 2.4 Performance Impact

*   **`mmfields`:**  The performance impact of `mmfields` depends on the complexity of the field extraction rules.  Simple character-based splitting is generally very fast.  Regular expressions can be more expensive, especially if they are complex or poorly optimized.  JSON parsing is also relatively efficient.

*   **`mmnormalize`:**  The performance impact of `mmnormalize` depends on the number and complexity of the rules in the rulebase.  A large number of rules, especially those involving regular expressions, can increase processing time.  It's important to optimize rulebases for performance by minimizing the number of rules and using efficient regular expressions.

*   **Mitigation:**  To minimize performance impact:
    *   Use the most efficient parser possible.
    *   Optimize regular expressions.
    *   Minimize the number of rules in each rulebase.
    *   Use hardware with sufficient processing power.
    *   Monitor rsyslog performance and adjust configurations as needed.
    *   Consider using a dedicated logging server.

### 2.5 Implementation Steps (Detailed)

1.  **Identify Critical Log Sources:**  Create a list of all log sources that will be processed by rsyslog.  Prioritize those that are most critical for security monitoring and compliance.  Examples:
    *   System logs (auth.log, syslog, messages)
    *   Web server logs (Apache, Nginx)
    *   Database logs (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
    *   Application logs (custom applications)
    *   Firewall logs
    *   Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) logs

2.  **Define Normalization Rules (Rulebases):**  For each critical log source, create a separate rulebase file (e.g., `/etc/rsyslog.d/rulebases/apache.rb`).  Example (Apache access log):

    ```ruby
    # /etc/rsyslog.d/rulebases/apache.rb
    rulebase(name="apache_access") {
        parser(name="apache_combined" type="cee_syslog")
        action(name="parse_apache"
               parser="apache_combined"
               rule="\"%clientip% %ident% %authuser% [%timestamp%] \\\"%method% %request% %protocol%\\\" %status% %bytes% %referer% %agent%\""
        )
        action(name="validate_clientip"
               check="clientip"
               pattern="^[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}$"
        )
        action(name="validate_status"
               check="status"
               pattern="^[1-5][0-9]{2}$"
        )
        # Add more validation rules as needed
    }
    ```
    Example (JSON log):
    ```ruby
    # /etc/rsyslog.d/rulebases/app_json.rb
    rulebase(name="app_json") {
        parser(name="json_parser" type="json")
        action(name="parse_json" parser="json_parser")
        action(name="validate_userid"
               check="userid"
               pattern="^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"
        )
        action(name="validate_event_type"
               check="event_type"
               list=["login", "logout", "create", "update", "delete"]
        )
    }
    ```

3.  **Load Modules:**  In your main rsyslog configuration file (e.g., `/etc/rsyslog.conf` or a file in `/etc/rsyslog.d/`), load the required modules:

    ```
    module(load="mmfields")
    module(load="mmnormalize")
    ```

4.  **Create Rulesets:**  Define rulesets that use the `mmnormalize` action and reference your rulebases.  These rulesets should be placed *before* any output actions (e.g., writing to files, forwarding to a SIEM).

    ```
    ruleset(name="validate_apache") {
        action(type="mmnormalize" rulebase="/etc/rsyslog.d/rulebases/apache.rb")
        if $parsesuccess == "apache_access" then {
            # Actions for valid Apache logs
            action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/apache/access.log")
        } else {
            # Actions for invalid Apache logs
            action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/apache/invalid.log")
            # Or, drop the message:
            # action(type="omdiscard")
        }
    }

    ruleset(name="validate_app_json") {
        action(type="mmnormalize" rulebase="/etc/rsyslog.d/rulebases/app_json.rb")
        if $parsesuccess == "app_json" then {
            action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/app/valid.log")
        } else {
            action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/app/invalid.log")
        }
    }
    ```
    Then, apply these rulesets to your inputs:
    ```
    input(type="imfile" file="/var/log/httpd/access_log" tag="apache-access" ruleset="validate_apache")
    input(type="imfile" file="/var/log/myapp/app.log" tag="app-json" ruleset="validate_app_json")
    ```

5.  **Validate Parsing (`$parsesuccess`):**  Use the `$parsesuccess` variable in your rulesets to determine whether a message was successfully parsed according to the rulebase.  This is the key to implementing conditional actions based on the validity of the message.

6.  **Implement Actions:**  Define actions to be taken for both valid and invalid messages.  Common actions include:
    *   **`omfile`:**  Write the message to a file.
    *   **`omfwd`:**  Forward the message to another rsyslog server or a SIEM.
    *   **`omdiscard`:**  Drop the message.
    *   **`omhttp`:** Send the message to a web service via HTTP.
    *   **`omrelp`:**  Forward the message using the RELP protocol (more reliable than UDP).

7.  **Testing:**  Use the `logger` command or other tools to generate both valid and invalid log messages.  Verify that the messages are being processed correctly and that the appropriate actions are being taken.  Example:

    ```bash
    # Valid Apache log
    logger -t apache-access "192.168.1.1 - - [01/Jan/2024:00:00:00 +0000] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 1234"

    # Invalid Apache log (invalid IP)
    logger -t apache-access "invalid-ip - - [01/Jan/2024:00:00:00 +0000] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 1234"

    # Valid JSON log
    logger -t app-json '{"userid": "user123", "event_type": "login", "message": "User logged in"}'

    # Invalid JSON log (invalid event_type)
    logger -t app-json '{"userid": "user123", "event_type": "invalid", "message": "User logged in"}'
    ```

8.  **Regular Review:**  Periodically review and update your rulebases to ensure they remain effective and relevant.  This is especially important as your applications and infrastructure evolve.  Consider automating this review process using scripts or configuration management tools.

### 2.6 Limitations and Complementary Controls

*   **Contextual Awareness:** `mmnormalize` lacks contextual awareness.  It validates the *format* of the data, but not its *meaning* or relationship to other events.  This requires a SIEM or other security analytics platform for correlation and anomaly detection.

*   **Zero-Day Attacks:**  `mmnormalize` can only protect against known attack patterns that are reflected in the rulebases.  It cannot protect against zero-day attacks that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities.

*   **Sophisticated Attacks:**  Attackers may be able to craft malicious input that conforms to the expected format, bypassing `mmnormalize`.

*   **Performance Bottlenecks:**  Overly complex rulebases can create performance bottlenecks.

**Complementary Controls:**

*   **SIEM Integration:**  Forward validated logs to a SIEM for correlation, alerting, and incident response.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Deploy IDS/IPS to detect and prevent network-based attacks.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Use a WAF to protect web applications from common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in your systems and applications.
*   **Security Training:**  Provide security training to developers and system administrators to raise awareness of security threats and best practices.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on log sources to prevent log flooding attacks.
* **Network Segmentation:** Isolate critical systems and log sources to limit the impact of a potential breach.

### 2.7 Conclusion
Using `mmfields` and `mmnormalize` in rsyslog provides a valuable layer of defense against message tampering, spoofing, and some log injection attacks.  It's a cost-effective way to improve the quality and reliability of your log data.  However, it's not a silver bullet and should be used in conjunction with other security controls as part of a defense-in-depth strategy.  Careful planning, thorough testing, and regular review are essential for successful implementation. The detailed implementation steps and examples provided above should give a solid foundation for deploying this mitigation strategy.
