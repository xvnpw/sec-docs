# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rsyslog/rsyslog

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization using Rsyslog Input Filters](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_using_rsyslog_input_filters.md)

### Description:
1.  **Analyze log data for malicious patterns:** Developers and security teams should analyze application logs and identify patterns indicative of potential attacks or exploits that might be logged. This includes looking for common injection attack strings, unusual characters, or excessively long messages.
2.  **Define Rsyslog filters in configuration:**  Within `rsyslog.conf` (or included configuration files), developers should define filters using rsyslog's conditional statements and property-based filtering capabilities. These filters should target identified malicious patterns within log messages. For example, to drop logs containing potential command injection attempts in the `msg` property:
    ```rsyslog
    if $msg contains '`' or $msg contains '$(' or $msg contains ')' then {
      stop
    }
    ```
3.  **Implement sanitization using Rsyslog functions (optional):** Instead of discarding logs, developers can use rsyslog's string manipulation functions (like `replace()`) to sanitize messages by removing or replacing potentially harmful parts. For example, to replace potential script injection attempts:
    ```rsyslog
    if $msg contains '<script>' then {
      set $!msg = replace($msg, /<script>/g, '[SCRIPT_REMOVED]');
    }
    ```
4.  **Test filter effectiveness within Rsyslog:**  Developers should test these filters directly within the rsyslog configuration in a non-production environment. This involves sending test log messages, both benign and malicious, through rsyslog to verify that filters correctly identify and handle the intended patterns without unintended side effects on legitimate logs.
5.  **Maintain and update Rsyslog filters regularly:**  As applications evolve and new attack vectors emerge, developers should regularly review and update rsyslog input filters. This ensures filters remain effective against current threats and adapt to changes in log formats and application behavior.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Log Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Malicious actors injecting crafted log messages to manipulate logging systems via rsyslog, potentially leading to false alarms, hiding malicious activities, or exploiting vulnerabilities in log processing tools that consume rsyslog's output.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Log Flooding (Medium Severity):** Attackers sending a large volume of crafted log messages designed to overwhelm the rsyslog system itself, consuming rsyslog resources and potentially impacting log processing performance.

### Impact:
*   **Log Injection Attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing malicious logs from being fully processed by rsyslog and passed to downstream systems, limiting the potential for exploitation.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Log Flooding:** Moderately reduces the risk by filtering out some malicious patterns *at the rsyslog input stage*, lessening the load on rsyslog's processing pipeline, although rsyslog's rate limiting modules (`imratelimit`) are more directly designed for DoS mitigation.

### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented in the project's `rsyslog.conf`. Input filters are used to manage log volume from specific sources, but security-specific input validation and sanitization using rsyslog filters are not actively implemented.

### Missing Implementation:
Security-focused input validation and sanitization filters are missing from the project's rsyslog configuration. Developers need to define and implement filters within `rsyslog.conf` to address common injection attack patterns and sanitize potentially harmful characters directly within rsyslog's processing pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Network Input using Rsyslog's `imtcp` with TLS Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/secure_network_input_using_rsyslog's__imtcp__with_tls_encryption.md)

### Description:
1.  **Generate TLS certificates for Rsyslog:**  Using standard TLS certificate generation tools (like `openssl`), generate TLS certificates and private keys specifically for the rsyslog server and any clients sending logs via TCP. Ensure proper key management and secure storage of private keys.
2.  **Configure `imtcp` module in `rsyslog.conf` for TLS:**  Within the `rsyslog.conf` file, load the `imtcp` module and configure an input directive to enable TLS encryption. This involves specifying the paths to the server certificate, private key, and optionally a CA certificate for client authentication using rsyslog's `StreamDriver` options. Example configuration:
    ```rsyslog
    module(load="imtcp")

    input(type="imtcp"
          port="6514" # Standard syslog-tls port
          StreamDriver.Name="omssl"
          StreamDriver.Mode="1" # Run in TLS mode
          StreamDriver.CertificateFile="/path/to/server.crt"
          StreamDriver.KeyFile="/path/to/server.key"
          StreamDriver.CAFile="/path/to/ca.crt" # Optional, for client certificate verification
    )
    ```
3.  **Configure log clients to use Rsyslog's TLS port:**  Developers need to configure applications and systems sending logs to target the rsyslog server's TLS-enabled TCP port (e.g., 6514).  Client-side logging configurations must be adjusted to use TLS when communicating with the rsyslog server.
4.  **Verify TLS connection via Rsyslog logs:** After configuration, developers should verify the TLS connection by checking rsyslog's own logs for messages indicating successful TLS connection establishment.  Testing with client log messages confirms end-to-end secure logging.
5.  **Harden TLS settings in `rsyslog.conf` (optional but recommended):**  For enhanced security, developers can further configure TLS settings within the `imtcp` input directive in `rsyslog.conf`. This includes specifying minimum TLS versions and preferred cipher suites using `StreamDriver.SecurityLevel` and `StreamDriver.Ciphers` options to enforce stronger encryption standards within rsyslog.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Log Data Interception (High Severity):** Attackers intercepting network traffic to eavesdrop on log messages transmitted in plaintext to rsyslog, potentially exposing sensitive information before rsyslog processes them.
*   **Log Data Tampering (Medium Severity):** Attackers modifying log messages in transit to rsyslog, compromising the integrity of logs *before* they are processed and stored by rsyslog.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Attackers intercepting and potentially manipulating communication between log senders and the rsyslog server, potentially feeding false logs or preventing legitimate logs from reaching rsyslog.

### Impact:
*   **Log Data Interception:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring that log data transmitted to rsyslog over the network is encrypted, protecting confidentiality from network eavesdropping.
*   **Log Data Tampering:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring the integrity of log data in transit to rsyslog, making it difficult for attackers to alter logs without detection.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Moderately reduces the risk by providing authentication and encryption for connections to rsyslog, making MitM attacks significantly more complex.

### Currently Implemented:
Not currently implemented for application logs being ingested by rsyslog.  While internal infrastructure components might use TLS for rsyslog-to-rsyslog communication, application logs are currently received by rsyslog over unencrypted TCP.

### Missing Implementation:
TLS encryption for application logs received by rsyslog is missing. Developers need to configure the `imtcp` module in `rsyslog.conf` to enable TLS, generate and deploy necessary certificates, and update application logging configurations to send logs to rsyslog over TLS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Output Destination - Encrypted Remote Forwarding using Rsyslog's `omtcp` with TLS](./mitigation_strategies/secure_output_destination_-_encrypted_remote_forwarding_using_rsyslog's__omtcp__with_tls.md)

### Description:
1.  **Verify remote Rsyslog server TLS support:** Ensure the remote rsyslog server intended for log forwarding is configured to accept TLS-encrypted connections using `imtcp` with TLS (as described in the previous mitigation strategy).
2.  **Configure `omtcp` module in `rsyslog.conf` for TLS forwarding:** In the local `rsyslog.conf`, configure the `omtcp` output module within relevant rules to use TLS when forwarding logs to the remote server. This involves specifying the remote server's address, TLS port, and TLS-related options using rsyslog's `StreamDriver` parameters. Example configuration within a rule:
    ```rsyslog
    *.* action(type="omtcp"
          target="remote-rsyslog-server.example.com"
          port="6514"
          StreamDriver.Name="omssl"
          StreamDriver.Mode="1"
          StreamDriver.CertificateFile="/path/to/client.crt" # Client certificate for authentication (optional)
          StreamDriver.KeyFile="/path/to/client.key"       # Client key (optional)
          StreamDriver.CAFile="/path/to/remote-ca.crt"      # CA certificate of remote server
    )
    ```
3.  **Implement client authentication in `rsyslog.conf` (optional, stronger security):** For enhanced security, configure client authentication using TLS client certificates within the `omtcp` output configuration in `rsyslog.conf`. This ensures only authorized rsyslog instances can forward logs to the remote destination. Set `StreamDriver.Mode="2"` on the receiving server and provide client certificates in the `omtcp` configuration of forwarding rsyslog instances.
4.  **Test encrypted forwarding via Rsyslog logs:** After configuration, test log forwarding and verify success by checking logs on both the forwarding and receiving rsyslog servers for connection status messages and any errors related to TLS.
5.  **Monitor TLS forwarding health via Rsyslog monitoring:** Implement monitoring of rsyslog itself to track the health of the TLS connection used for forwarding. This includes alerting on connection failures reported by rsyslog or certificate expiration warnings that rsyslog might log.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Log Data Interception during Forwarding (High Severity):** Attackers intercepting network traffic while rsyslog forwards logs to remote servers, potentially exposing sensitive log data in transit.
*   **Log Data Tampering during Forwarding (Medium Severity):** Attackers modifying log messages as rsyslog forwards them, compromising the integrity of logs *after* they have been processed by the initial rsyslog instance.
*   **Unauthorized Log Forwarding Destination (Medium Severity):** Logs being inadvertently or maliciously forwarded by rsyslog to an unintended or insecure remote server, potentially due to misconfiguration in `rsyslog.conf`.

### Impact:
*   **Log Data Interception during Forwarding:** Significantly reduces the risk by encrypting log data as rsyslog forwards it, protecting confidentiality during transmission to remote systems.
*   **Log Data Tampering during Forwarding:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring data integrity during forwarding from rsyslog, making tampering difficult to achieve undetected.
*   **Unauthorized Log Forwarding Destination:** Moderately reduces the risk, especially if client authentication is used in `rsyslog.conf`, limiting forwarding to only authorized rsyslog instances. Configuration management practices are also crucial to prevent misconfigurations in `rsyslog.conf` that could lead to unintended forwarding.

### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented. Log forwarding to a central logging system is configured in `rsyslog.conf`, but it currently uses unencrypted TCP via `omtcp` without TLS.

### Missing Implementation:
TLS encryption for log forwarding from rsyslog to the central logging system is missing. Developers need to reconfigure `omtcp` in `rsyslog.conf` to use TLS for forwarding, ensure the central logging server is TLS-enabled, and manage certificates for rsyslog instances involved in forwarding.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Log Redaction and Masking using Rsyslog Property Replacers and Templates](./mitigation_strategies/log_redaction_and_masking_using_rsyslog_property_replacers_and_templates.md)

### Description:
1.  **Identify sensitive data patterns in logs processed by Rsyslog:** Developers and security teams need to analyze the types of logs being processed by rsyslog and pinpoint specific patterns or fields that contain sensitive information (e.g., IP addresses, usernames, API keys, etc.) *before* rsyslog outputs or stores these logs.
2.  **Define redaction/masking rules using Rsyslog features:** Determine appropriate redaction or masking techniques for identified sensitive data. Rsyslog's property replacers and string manipulation functions within templates are key tools for this. Common techniques include replacement with fixed strings, partial masking, or even hashing using rsyslog's capabilities.
3.  **Implement redaction rules in `rsyslog.conf` using templates:**  Within `rsyslog.conf`, create templates that define how log messages should be formatted *after* redaction. Use rsyslog property replacers within these templates to apply redaction rules to specific properties (like `$msg`). For example, to redact email addresses in the `msg` property using a template:
    ```rsyslog
    template(name="RedactedLogFormat" type="string"
              string="%msg:R,ERE,1,2,\"([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})\",\"[EMAIL_REDACTED]\"%\n") # Regex to find email addresses and replace
    *.*  action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/application.log" template="RedactedLogFormat")
    ```
    This example uses a regular expression within a template to find email addresses and replace them with "[EMAIL_REDACTED]" in the output log file.
4.  **Test redaction templates within Rsyslog:**  Thoroughly test these redaction templates in a non-production rsyslog environment. Send test log messages containing sensitive data through rsyslog and verify that the templates correctly redact the intended information in the output logs generated by rsyslog.
5.  **Maintain and update Rsyslog redaction rules:** Regularly review and update redaction rules defined in `rsyslog.conf` templates. As applications and data sensitivity requirements change, ensure rsyslog's redaction configurations remain effective and comprehensive in protecting sensitive information *at the rsyslog processing level*.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Data Exposure in Logs Processed by Rsyslog (High Severity):** Sensitive data being logged and potentially exposed through rsyslog's output to unauthorized individuals or systems, either via log files, centralized logging systems receiving logs from rsyslog, or in case of security breaches affecting systems where rsyslog stores or forwards logs.
*   **Compliance Violations related to Rsyslog Logging (Medium to High Severity):** Logging sensitive data in plaintext via rsyslog can lead to violations of data privacy regulations if rsyslog's output is not properly secured or if logs are retained for longer than compliant periods without redaction.

### Impact:
*   **Data Exposure in Logs Processed by Rsyslog:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring that sensitive data is removed or masked *by rsyslog itself* before logs are stored or forwarded, minimizing the chance of exposure.
*   **Compliance Violations related to Rsyslog Logging:** Significantly reduces the risk of compliance violations by ensuring rsyslog is configured to handle sensitive data in a privacy-preserving manner through redaction.

### Currently Implemented:
Not currently implemented for application logs processed by rsyslog. Rsyslog is configured to store and forward logs without any redaction or masking applied *within rsyslog itself*.

### Missing Implementation:
Redaction and masking rules using rsyslog's property replacers and templates are missing from the project's rsyslog configuration. Developers need to analyze log content processed by rsyslog, define appropriate redaction rules within `rsyslog.conf` templates, and apply these templates to relevant output actions in rsyslog.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Hardening - Rsyslog User Principle of Least Privilege](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_hardening_-_rsyslog_user_principle_of_least_privilege.md)

### Description:
1.  **Identify minimum Rsyslog process privileges:** Determine the absolute minimum Linux privileges required for the `rsyslogd` process to function correctly in the specific deployment environment. This focuses on file system access needed by rsyslog, network permissions for rsyslog modules, and any other system interactions rsyslog requires.
2.  **Run Rsyslog as a dedicated non-root user:** Ensure the `rsyslogd` process is configured to run as a dedicated, non-root system user. Avoid running `rsyslogd` as the `root` user. This is typically configured through systemd service definitions or init scripts used to start rsyslog.
3.  **Restrict file system permissions for Rsyslog:** Set restrictive file system permissions on all files and directories accessed by rsyslog. This includes `rsyslog.conf` and related configuration files, log directories where rsyslog writes logs, and any input files rsyslog might read. Permissions should be set so that the dedicated rsyslog user has only the necessary read/write/execute permissions, and access for other users is minimized. Example using `chown` and `chmod`:
    ```bash
    chown rsyslog:rsyslog /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d /var/log
    chmod 600 /etc/rsyslog.conf
    chmod 750 /etc/rsyslog.d /var/log
    ```
4.  **Utilize Linux Capabilities for Rsyslog (advanced):** For a more granular approach to least privilege specifically for rsyslog, consider using Linux capabilities. Instead of granting broad user/group permissions, capabilities allow granting specific privileges directly to the `rsyslogd` executable.  Relevant capabilities for rsyslog might include `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` (to allow binding to privileged ports for network input) and `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` (if absolutely necessary for specific file access scenarios). Use `setcap` to apply capabilities to the `rsyslogd` binary.
5.  **Regularly audit Rsyslog user permissions and capabilities:** Periodically review the permissions and capabilities assigned to the rsyslog user and the `rsyslogd` process. Ensure these remain minimal and aligned with the principle of least privilege as the system and rsyslog configuration evolve.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Privilege Escalation via Rsyslog Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** If a vulnerability is discovered in `rsyslogd` or one of its modules, running rsyslog with excessive privileges could allow an attacker to exploit the vulnerability to escalate privileges to the level of the rsyslog user, or potentially to root if rsyslog is running as root.
*   **System-Wide Compromise via Rsyslog (High Severity):** If `rsyslogd` is compromised and has broad file system access permissions, an attacker could potentially leverage this access to read or modify sensitive system files, leading to a wider system compromise beyond just the logging subsystem.

### Impact:
*   **Privilege Escalation via Rsyslog Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the privileges available to a compromised `rsyslogd` process. Even if a vulnerability is exploited, the attacker's ability to escalate privileges is severely restricted.
*   **System-Wide Compromise via Rsyslog:** Moderately reduces the risk by limiting the file system access of the `rsyslogd` process. This restricts the potential damage an attacker could inflict on the system if they manage to compromise rsyslog.

### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented. `rsyslogd` is configured to run as a dedicated `rsyslog` user, which is a positive step. However, file system permissions for rsyslog-related files and directories might not be fully hardened to the minimum necessary, and Linux capabilities are not currently utilized to further restrict rsyslog's privileges.

### Missing Implementation:
Full implementation of the principle of least privilege for the rsyslog user is missing. Developers and system administrators need to review and harden file system permissions for all files and directories relevant to rsyslog.  A further step would be to explore and implement Linux capabilities to provide a more fine-grained control over the privileges granted to the `rsyslogd` process, moving beyond basic user/group permissions. Specifically, verify that `rsyslogd` is definitively *not* running as root and that the dedicated rsyslog user has only the absolutely essential permissions for its logging tasks.
