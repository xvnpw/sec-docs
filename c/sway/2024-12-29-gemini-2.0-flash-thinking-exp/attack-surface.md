Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Sway, with high or critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Input Events via Wayland
    *   **Description:** Sway processes input events (keyboard, mouse, etc.) received through the Wayland protocol from client applications. A malicious or compromised client can send crafted input events.
    *   **How Sway Contributes:** Sway's role as the Wayland compositor means it's responsible for interpreting and acting upon these events. Vulnerabilities in Sway's input handling logic can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A malicious application sends a crafted keyboard event that triggers an unintended action within Sway, such as closing a critical window or executing a command.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (crashing Sway), unexpected behavior, potential for triggering unintended actions with system-level consequences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization within Sway's event handling logic. Fuzz testing the input event processing code.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about running untrusted Wayland applications. Isolate potentially risky applications using sandboxing techniques.

*   **Attack Surface:** Wayland Protocol Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** The Wayland protocol defines the communication between the compositor (Sway) and client applications. Vulnerabilities can exist in Sway's implementation of this protocol.
    *   **How Sway Contributes:** Sway's codebase implements the Wayland protocol. Bugs or oversights in this implementation can create exploitable weaknesses.
    *   **Example:** A malicious client sends a specially crafted Wayland message that exploits a buffer overflow in Sway's message parsing, leading to a crash or potentially remote code execution within the Sway process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure, potential for code execution within the compositor process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Adhere strictly to the Wayland protocol specification. Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits of the Wayland protocol implementation. Utilize memory-safe programming practices.
        *   **Users:** Keep Sway updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for protocol vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Sway Configuration File Manipulation
    *   **Description:** Sway's behavior is controlled by its configuration file. If an attacker can modify this file, they can alter Sway's behavior.
    *   **How Sway Contributes:** Sway relies on this configuration file to define keybindings, window rules, and other settings.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the user's configuration directory and modifies the Sway config to execute a malicious script when a specific key combination is pressed, effectively gaining command execution within the user's session.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution, persistence of malicious actions, denial of service by misconfiguring Sway.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure Sway handles invalid or malicious configuration options gracefully without crashing. Consider implementing stricter parsing and validation of the configuration file.
        *   **Users:** Protect the Sway configuration file with appropriate file system permissions. Regularly review the configuration file for unexpected changes.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in `wlroots`
    *   **Description:** Sway is built upon the `wlroots` library. Vulnerabilities in `wlroots` directly impact Sway's security.
    *   **How Sway Contributes:** Sway relies on `wlroots` for core Wayland compositor functionality. Any security flaws in `wlroots` are inherited by Sway.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in `wlroots`'s input handling allows a malicious client to trigger a buffer overflow, leading to code execution within the Sway process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure, potential for code execution within the compositor process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability in `wlroots`)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Stay up-to-date with the latest `wlroots` releases and security patches. Contribute to `wlroots` security efforts by reporting and fixing vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:** Ensure Sway and its dependencies, including `wlroots`, are updated to the latest versions.
