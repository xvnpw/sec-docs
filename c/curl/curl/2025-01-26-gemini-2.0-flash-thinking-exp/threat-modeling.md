# Threat Model Analysis for curl/curl

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Unvalidated URL Input](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_unvalidated_url_input.md)

Description: An attacker manipulates user-provided URL input, which is directly used by `curl`, to force the application to make requests to unintended internal or external resources. The attacker might target internal services, localhost, or malicious external servers to access sensitive data, perform actions on internal systems, or launch further attacks.
Impact: Information disclosure of internal resources, unauthorized access to internal services, potential for further exploitation of internal systems, denial of service against internal or external targets.
Affected curl component: URL parsing and request initiation within `curl` library, specifically when handling user-provided URLs.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
- Input Validation and Sanitization:  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided URL inputs before passing them to `curl`. Use allowlists of permitted protocols, hostnames, and paths.
- URL Parsing and Whitelisting: Parse the URL to extract hostname and protocol. Validate against a whitelist of allowed destinations.
- Network Segmentation: Isolate the application using `curl` from sensitive internal networks if possible.

## Threat: [Data Injection in Request Body](./threats/data_injection_in_request_body.md)

Description: An attacker injects malicious data into the request body of requests made by `curl` (e.g., POST, PUT). This is possible if the application allows user input to be included in the request body without proper sanitization. The injected data can be interpreted by the backend server in unintended ways, potentially leading to backend injection vulnerabilities like command injection or data manipulation, which in turn can lead to critical impacts.
Impact: Backend injection vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, SQL injection), data manipulation, denial of service, potential for remote code execution on backend systems.
Affected curl component: Request body handling and sending functionality within `curl` library, specifically when applications construct request bodies with user input.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
- Input Validation and Sanitization:  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input that is included in the request body.
- Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements: If the backend uses databases, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- Output Encoding: Encode output from the backend before displaying it to users to prevent XSS if backend injection leads to reflected output.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known curl Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_known_curl_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: An attacker exploits publicly known vulnerabilities in the version of `curl` used by the application. This can be done by crafting specific requests or inputs that trigger the vulnerability in `curl`. Exploits can lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
Impact: Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.
Affected curl component: Various modules and functions within the `curl` library, depending on the specific CVE. Vulnerabilities can exist in protocol parsing, TLS/SSL handling, or other core functionalities.
Risk Severity: Critical to High
Mitigation Strategies:
- Regularly Update curl: Keep the `curl` library updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerability Scanning: Regularly scan dependencies, including `curl`, for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
- Security Monitoring: Monitor security advisories and CVE databases for newly disclosed `curl` vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Protocol-Specific Vulnerabilities](./threats/protocol-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: An attacker exploits vulnerabilities specific to how `curl` implements certain protocols (e.g., HTTP/2, TLS/SSL, FTP). These vulnerabilities might be related to parsing protocol messages, handling protocol features, or implementation flaws in `curl`'s protocol handling logic.
Impact: Protocol downgrade attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, denial of service, information disclosure, potentially remote code execution.
Affected curl component: Protocol-specific modules within `curl`, such as HTTP/2 handling, TLS/SSL implementation (using libraries like OpenSSL or wolfSSL), FTP handling, etc.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
- Regularly Update curl: Updating `curl` often includes fixes for protocol-specific vulnerabilities.
- Disable Unnecessary Protocols: If possible, disable protocols that are not required by the application to reduce the attack surface.
- Strong TLS/SSL Configuration: Use strong TLS/SSL configurations, including up-to-date TLS versions and strong cipher suites.

## Threat: [Option-Related Misuse (`--insecure` for example)](./threats/option-related_misuse___--insecure__for_example_.md)

Description: Developers or operators misconfigure `curl` options, leading to security weaknesses. A critical example is using `--insecure` (or equivalent options in code) in production, which disables certificate verification and makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing attackers to intercept and modify communication.
Impact: Disabling security features, weakening security posture, man-in-the-middle attacks, information disclosure, loss of confidentiality and integrity, potential for data manipulation and further attacks.
Affected curl component: `curl`'s option parsing and configuration handling, specifically when insecure options are used.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
- Avoid `--insecure` in Production: Never use `--insecure` or equivalent options that disable certificate verification in production environments.
- Secure Default Options: Configure `curl` with secure default options.
- Security Training: Train developers and operators on secure `curl` usage and the security implications of different options.
- Code Reviews: Conduct code reviews to identify and prevent misuse of `curl` options.
