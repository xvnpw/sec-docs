# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Fuzzing: Continuous fuzzing is employed to identify potential vulnerabilities. (Described in docs/Fuzzing.md)
*   security control: Code Reviews: All code changes undergo thorough review by maintainers. (Described in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
*   security control: Static Analysis: Static analysis tools are used to detect potential code quality and security issues. (Described in docs/INSTALL.md)
*   security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy: A clear process is in place for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities. (Described in SECURITY.md)
*   security control: HTTPS Support: curl defaults to HTTPS and verifies SSL certificates by default. (Described in docs/cmdline-opts/--ssl-reqd.d)
*   security control: Support for various authentication methods: curl supports a wide range of authentication mechanisms, including Basic, Digest, NTLM, Kerberos, and OAuth 2.0. (Described in docs/cmdline-opts/-u.d)
*   security control: Safe handling of cookies: curl provides options for managing cookies securely, including the ability to restrict cookie sharing and use secure cookies. (Described in docs/cmdline-opts/--cookie.d)
*   security control: Support for secure protocols: curl supports various secure protocols, including HTTPS, SFTP, FTPS, and SCP. (Described in docs/cmdline-opts/--proto.d)
*   security control: Regular security audits: curl undergoes periodic security audits by external experts. (Described in SECURITY.md)
*   security control: CVE Numbering Authority (CNA): curl project is a CNA, allowing it to assign CVE identifiers to vulnerabilities. (Described in SECURITY.md)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on System Libraries: curl relies on system-provided libraries for some functionality (e.g., SSL/TLS), which may introduce vulnerabilities outside of curl's direct control.
*   accepted risk: User Misconfiguration: Users may inadvertently configure curl insecurely, leading to potential risks.
*   accepted risk: Complexity of Supported Protocols: The vast number of supported protocols increases the attack surface and complexity of security management.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all dependencies and their versions.
*   security control: Integrate dynamic analysis tools (e.g., DAST) into the testing process.
*   security control: Enhance documentation with security best practices and common misconfiguration pitfalls.
*   security control: Consider implementing a bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support a wide range of authentication mechanisms, including Basic, Digest, NTLM, Kerberos, and OAuth 2.0.
    *   Provide secure storage and handling of credentials.
    *   Implement robust protection against credential stuffing and brute-force attacks.

*   Authorization:
    *   Enforce access controls based on protocol and resource restrictions.
    *   Provide mechanisms for fine-grained authorization, where applicable.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all user-supplied input, including URLs, headers, and data.
    *   Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, cross-site scripting).
    *   Implement robust error handling to avoid information leakage.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Verify SSL/TLS certificates by default.
    *   Provide options for users to customize cryptographic settings, with secure defaults.
    *   Securely manage cryptographic keys and certificates.

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer writes code and commits it to the GitHub repository.
2.  The Build System (Autotools or CMake) configures the build process based on the target platform and options.
3.  Static Analysis Tools (e.g., Coverity, clang-tidy) analyze the source code for potential vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
4.  Fuzzing Infrastructure continuously tests curl with various inputs to identify potential crashes and vulnerabilities.
5.  The Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) compiles the source code into object files. Security flags (e.g., stack protection, ASLR) are enabled during compilation.
6.  The Linker links the object files and system libraries to create the curl executable (curlBinary) and the libcurl library (libcurl).
7.  The Test Suite is run to verify the functionality and security of curl and libcurl.
8.  Build artifacts (curlBinary and libcurl) are created.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code Reviews: All code changes are reviewed before being merged.
*   security control: Static Analysis: Static analysis tools are used to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Fuzzing: Continuous fuzzing is used to find vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Compiler Security Flags: Security flags are enabled during compilation to mitigate potential exploits.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   Data transfer operations: Ensuring the reliable and secure transfer of data is the core function of curl.
*   Software distribution: Protecting the integrity of curl binaries and libraries distributed to users.
*   Community trust: Maintaining the trust of the open-source community and users.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   User credentials (passwords, API keys): High sensitivity. These must be protected from unauthorized access and disclosure.
*   Data transferred using curl: Sensitivity varies depending on the data. Could range from public data (low sensitivity) to highly confidential data (high sensitivity).
*   SSL/TLS certificates and keys: High sensitivity. These must be protected to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   Source code: Medium sensitivity. Unauthorized modification could introduce vulnerabilities.
*   Cookies: Medium to high sensitivity, depending on the cookies' contents and associated services.
