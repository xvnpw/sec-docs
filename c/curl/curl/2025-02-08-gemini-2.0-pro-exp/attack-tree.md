## Attack Tree Path: [1. Protocol-Specific Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/1__protocol-specific_attacks.md)

*   **1a. HTTP/S:**

    *   **1a1. Smuggling [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploits discrepancies in how front-end proxies and back-end servers interpret HTTP requests, particularly those with ambiguous `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding` headers.  Allows attackers to "smuggle" a second request hidden within the first, bypassing security controls.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

*   **1b. FTP/S:**

    *   **1b1. Credential Stuffing [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  Uses lists of compromised username/password pairs (often obtained from data breaches) to attempt to gain unauthorized access to FTP accounts.  Automated tools make this attack easy to execute.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Vulnerability Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/2__vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **2d. Other CVEs:**

    *   **2d1. Specific CVE Exploits [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  Leverages publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in libcurl or its dependencies.  Exploits may be readily available, making this a common attack vector.  Examples include buffer overflows, integer overflows, and use-after-free vulnerabilities.  The specific details depend on the particular CVE.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if unpatched), Low (if patched)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (often code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (if a public exploit exists)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (using a public exploit) to Advanced (developing a new exploit)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Misconfiguration Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/3__misconfiguration_exploitation.md)

*   **3a. Insecure Defaults:**

    *   **3a1. No TLS Verification {CRITICAL}:**
        *   **Description:**  Disabling TLS certificate verification (`CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` set to 0) allows man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  The attacker can intercept and modify communication between the client and server without detection.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (should be avoided, but mistakes happen)
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

*   **3b. Protocol Downgrade:**

    *   **3b1. HTTP to HTTPS Downgrade [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  Occurs when an application initially connects securely (HTTPS) but then follows a redirect to an insecure (HTTP) URL.  This exposes the communication to MitM attacks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

    *   **3b2. Ignoring Certificate Errors [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  Similar to disabling TLS verification, ignoring certificate errors (e.g., expired certificates, invalid hostnames) allows MitM attacks.  The application proceeds with the connection despite security warnings.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

    *   **3b3. Allowing Redirects to Untrusted Protocols (file://) [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  If libcurl is configured to follow redirects and doesn't restrict the allowed protocols, an attacker could redirect the application to a `file://` URL, potentially allowing them to read arbitrary files from the system.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
