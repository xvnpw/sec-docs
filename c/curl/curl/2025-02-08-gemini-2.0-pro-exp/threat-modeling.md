# Threat Model Analysis for curl/curl

## Threat: [TLS Certificate Validation Bypass](./threats/tls_certificate_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack by presenting a forged or invalid TLS certificate.  Due to *misconfiguration of libcurl*, the application accepts this invalid certificate. This allows the attacker to intercept, decrypt, and potentially modify communication between the application and the intended server. The attacker might use a self-signed certificate, a certificate for a different domain, or an expired certificate.  This is a direct result of improper use of libcurl's API.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete compromise of confidentiality and integrity of the communication.
    *   Exposure of sensitive data (credentials, API keys, personal information).
    *   Potential for data modification, leading to incorrect application behavior or data corruption.
    *   Loss of user trust and potential legal/regulatory consequences.

*   **Affected curl Component:**
    *   TLS/SSL handshake and certificate verification logic *within libcurl*.
    *   Specifically, the options `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` and `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` control this behavior.  The vulnerability arises from *incorrectly setting* these options.

*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory:** Ensure `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` is set to 1 (enabled) and `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` is set to 2 (verify hostname) in production environments.  *Never* disable these options in production. This is the primary and most crucial mitigation.
    *   Use `CURLOPT_CAINFO` or `CURLOPT_CAPATH` to specify a trusted CA bundle, providing control over which CAs are trusted.
    *   Consider certificate pinning (`CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY`) for high-security connections, but manage it carefully.
    *   Implement robust error handling to detect and respond to certificate validation failures.  Do *not* proceed with the connection if validation fails.

## Threat: [Protocol Downgrade Attack (Induced by libcurl Misconfiguration)](./threats/protocol_downgrade_attack__induced_by_libcurl_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:** Although often initiated by a network attacker, this threat becomes *critical* due to libcurl being misconfigured to *allow* insecure protocols. An attacker intercepts the connection and forces libcurl to use a less secure protocol than intended (e.g., HTTPS to HTTP).  The vulnerability lies in the application's *failure to restrict* libcurl's allowed protocols.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the insecure protocol.
    *   Potential for data modification.
    *   Circumvention of security controls that rely on the stronger protocol.

*   **Affected curl Component:**
    *   Protocol negotiation logic *within libcurl*.
    *   `CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS` and `CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS` options.  The vulnerability is the *failure to use these options correctly*.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use `CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS` to explicitly allow *only* the required secure protocols (e.g., `CURLPROTO_HTTPS`).  Do *not* allow insecure protocols like HTTP or FTP. This is the primary mitigation.
    *   Use `CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS` similarly to restrict protocols allowed during redirects.
    *   Although TLS library configuration can help, the *primary* responsibility here is to correctly configure libcurl's protocol restrictions.

## Threat: [URL Redirection Hijacking (Due to Insufficient Validation with libcurl)](./threats/url_redirection_hijacking__due_to_insufficient_validation_with_libcurl_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when followed by libcurl, redirects the application to an attacker-controlled server. While the initial redirect might originate from a server vulnerability, the *critical* aspect here is the application's *failure to properly validate the redirected URL* when using libcurl's redirection features.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Redirection to a phishing site or a site serving malware.
    *   Exposure of sensitive data (e.g., cookies, session tokens) to the attacker's server.
    *   Potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) or other client-side attacks.

*   **Affected curl Component:**
    *   Redirection handling logic *within libcurl* (`CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION`).
    *   `CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS` and `CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS` options. The vulnerability is the *inadequate use* of these options and the *lack of post-redirection URL validation*.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION` with extreme caution. If redirects are necessary, *validate the target URL after each redirect* to ensure it's still within the expected domain and uses the expected protocol. This validation is *crucial* and is the application's responsibility.
    *   Use `CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS` to limit the number of redirects, preventing infinite loops.
    *   Use `CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS` to restrict allowed protocols during redirects (e.g., only HTTPS).
    *   Implement robust input validation to prevent attackers from injecting malicious URLs.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow *within libcurl*](./threats/integer_overflow_within_libcurl.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted input (e.g., a very large header value, a malformed chunked encoding, or a specially crafted URL) that triggers an integer overflow vulnerability *within the libcurl code itself*. This is distinct from overflows in dependencies. This could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially RCE.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial-of-service (DoS) due to application crashes.
    *   Potential for remote code execution (RCE) in severe cases, although less likely than with memory corruption.
    *   Unexpected application behavior.

*   **Affected curl Component:**
    *   Various components *within libcurl*, depending on the specific vulnerability. This could include:
        *   Header parsing logic.
        *   Chunked encoding handling.
        *   URL parsing.
        *   Potentially other internal data handling routines.

*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if RCE is possible)

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep libcurl updated to the latest version. The curl project actively addresses security vulnerabilities, including integer overflows. This is the *primary* mitigation.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to libcurl, reducing the likelihood of triggering an overflow. While this doesn't fix a libcurl bug, it reduces the attack surface.
    *   Fuzz testing of libcurl itself (by the curl project or security researchers) is crucial for identifying these vulnerabilities. As a developer using libcurl, you rely on this external testing.
