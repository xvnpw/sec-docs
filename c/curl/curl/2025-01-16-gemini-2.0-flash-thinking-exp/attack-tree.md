## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Curl's Request Sending Capabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_curl's_request_sending_capabilities.md)

- Attack Vector: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL manipulation [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Description: An attacker manipulates the URL that the application uses with curl to make requests to unintended locations. This could be internal resources within the organization's network or external services.
    - How it works: The application takes user-controlled input and incorporates it into a curl URL without proper validation. An attacker provides a malicious URL (e.g., `http://localhost:6379/` to access an internal Redis server).
    - Potential Impact: Access to internal services, reading sensitive configuration data, performing actions on behalf of the server, potential for further exploitation of internal systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Curl Options](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_curl_options.md)

- Attack Vector: Use `--insecure` or equivalent to disable SSL verification [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Description: The application uses the `--insecure` curl option (or its equivalent in programming language bindings), which disables SSL certificate verification.
    - How it works: Developers might use this option during testing or due to a misunderstanding of its security implications. An attacker on the network can then perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, intercepting and potentially modifying communication between the application and the remote server.
    - Potential Impact: Data interception, credential theft, injection of malicious content, complete compromise of the communication channel.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Curl's Response Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_curl's_response_handling.md)

- Attack Vector: DNS Poisoning to redirect curl to a malicious server [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Description: An attacker compromises the DNS resolution process, causing the application's curl requests to be directed to a malicious server instead of the intended one.
    - How it works: Attackers might poison the DNS cache of the application's server or the DNS server it uses. When the application tries to resolve the domain name for a curl request, it receives the IP address of the attacker's server.
    - Potential Impact: The application connects to the attacker's server, which can serve malicious content, steal credentials sent by the application, or exploit vulnerabilities in the application's response handling.
- Attack Vector: Inject Data that Exploits Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable) [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Description: If the application deserializes data received from curl responses, an attacker can inject malicious serialized objects into the response.
    - How it works: The attacker needs to identify an endpoint where the application uses curl to fetch data and then deserializes it. By controlling the response (e.g., through a MITM attack or by compromising the target server), the attacker injects a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by the application, leads to arbitrary code execution.
    - Potential Impact: Remote code execution on the application server, complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within the Curl Library Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_the_curl_library_itself.md)

- Attack Vector: Trigger Known Curl Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Description: The application uses a vulnerable version of the curl library, and an attacker crafts specific inputs (e.g., URLs, headers, data) to trigger a known vulnerability (identified by a CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).
    - How it works: Attackers research known vulnerabilities in the curl version used by the application. They then craft malicious requests that exploit these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to memory corruption, denial of service, or remote code execution.
    - Potential Impact: Depending on the specific vulnerability, the impact can range from denial of service to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the application server.
