# BUSINESS POSTURE

The curl project provides a command-line tool and a library (libcurl) for transferring data with URLs. It supports a wide range of protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, and many others. The primary business priority for curl is to offer a reliable, versatile, and performant tool for data transfer across various network protocols.  The project aims to be widely adopted and trusted by developers and systems worldwide.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of vulnerabilities in curl leading to data breaches or unauthorized access when used to transfer sensitive information.
- Risk of denial-of-service vulnerabilities in curl affecting applications and systems that rely on it.
- Risk of curl being misused by malicious actors for data exfiltration, command injection, or other attacks due to vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
- Risk of supply chain attacks targeting curl's dependencies or build process, potentially introducing malicious code.
- Risk of compatibility issues or protocol implementation flaws leading to unreliable data transfer or unexpected behavior in critical systems.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Secure coding practices are employed throughout the development lifecycle, focusing on memory safety, input validation, and avoiding common vulnerabilities. (Implemented in source code and development guidelines, described in project documentation and developer community discussions).
- security control: Regular vulnerability scanning and static analysis are likely performed by developers and external security researchers. (Likely integrated into development workflow, reported through bug bounty programs and security advisories).
- security control: TLS/SSL support for encrypted communication is a core feature, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data in transit for HTTPS and other protocols. (Implemented in libcurl, documented in man pages and online documentation).
- security control: Input validation is performed to handle URLs and other inputs, preventing injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities. (Implemented in source code, details in code comments and security-related discussions).
- security control: Adherence to security standards and best practices for network protocols and secure communication. (Implicit in design and implementation, referenced in discussions about protocol compliance).
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in less frequently used or more complex protocols might be discovered later due to less extensive testing. (Acknowledged implicitly by the nature of software development and the wide range of protocols supported).
- accepted risk: Edge cases and protocol interactions might introduce unexpected security issues that are hard to predict. (Acknowledged implicitly by the continuous security monitoring and patching process).

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated fuzzing as part of the continuous integration process to proactively discover potential vulnerabilities.
- security control: Integrate dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by curl.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits by external security experts to identify and address weaknesses in the codebase and architecture.
- security control: Implement a robust Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation and management process to enhance supply chain security visibility.
- security control: Enforce code signing for curl binaries and packages to ensure integrity and authenticity.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
  - Requirement: Support authentication mechanisms for protocols that require it (e.g., HTTP Basic Auth, Digest Auth, Kerberos, OAuth).
  - Requirement: Securely handle and store credentials when authentication is used, avoiding plaintext storage or insecure transmission.
  - Requirement: Provide options for users to configure and manage authentication credentials securely.
- Authorization:
  - Requirement: Implement proper authorization checks within curl to ensure that users can only access resources they are permitted to access, based on protocol-specific authorization mechanisms.
  - Requirement: Prevent unauthorized access to local files or system resources when curl is used to handle file URLs or interact with the local file system.
  - Requirement: Adhere to protocol-specific authorization models and ensure consistent enforcement of access controls.
- Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Thoroughly validate all inputs, including URLs, headers, data, and command-line arguments, to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, header injection).
  - Requirement: Sanitize and encode outputs appropriately to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in applications that use libcurl.
  - Requirement: Implement robust error handling for invalid inputs to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Utilize strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and libraries for TLS/SSL and other cryptographic operations.
  - Requirement: Properly manage cryptographic keys and certificates, ensuring secure storage and handling.
  - Requirement: Implement protection against known cryptographic attacks and vulnerabilities, staying current with security best practices in cryptography.
  - Requirement: Provide options for users to configure TLS/SSL settings, such as cipher suites and protocol versions, while encouraging secure defaults.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Secure and reliable data transfer using various network protocols. This is critical for applications and systems relying on curl for communication.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Data in transit: Potentially sensitive data being transferred by curl, including user credentials, personal information, financial data, application secrets, and confidential business data. Sensitivity depends on the specific use case of curl.
- Configuration data: Configuration files and command-line arguments might contain sensitive information like credentials or API keys.
- Build artifacts: Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of curl binaries and libraries to prevent supply chain attacks.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the specific context of use for this design document? Is it for a particular organization or a general assessment of the curl project?
- Are there any specific business requirements or compliance standards that need to be considered?
- What is the risk appetite of the organization using curl? (This will influence the prioritization of security controls).
- Are there any existing security policies or guidelines within the organization that need to be aligned with?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure, reliable, and versatile data transfer tool for general use. Security is a high priority due to the potential impact of vulnerabilities.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The curl project has a good existing security posture with established security controls. However, there is always room for improvement, especially in areas like automated fuzzing, dependency scanning, and formal security audits.
- DESIGN: The design is based on the current architecture of the curl project as understood from public information and general knowledge of similar projects. The deployment model assumes a standalone binary deployment as a common use case. The build process is based on typical open-source project CI/CD practices.
