# Threat Model Analysis for curl/curl

## Threat: [`curl` Library Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/_curl__library_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability within the `curl` library code itself (e.g., buffer overflow, integer overflow). This could be triggered by a malicious server response or crafted network data processed by `curl`. The attacker aims to gain control of the application process or cause disruption.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server, allowing the attacker to fully compromise the system. Denial of Service (DoS) if the vulnerability leads to crashes or resource exhaustion. Information Disclosure if memory corruption leaks sensitive data.

**Affected curl component:** Core `curl` library code (e.g., URL parsing, protocol handling, data processing functions).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `curl` library updated to the latest stable version.
* Subscribe to `curl` security mailing lists and advisories.
* Implement automated update mechanisms for dependencies.
* Consider using static analysis and fuzzing tools during development.

## Threat: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration - `--insecure` Usage](./threats/insecure_tlsssl_configuration_-__--insecure__usage.md)

**Description:** Developers mistakenly or intentionally use the `--insecure` option (or equivalent API settings) in `curl` requests. This disables certificate verification, allowing Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. An attacker intercepts communication between the application and the server, potentially stealing credentials, sensitive data, or modifying traffic.

**Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, leading to data confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, and potential account hijacking.

**Affected curl component:** TLS/SSL module, certificate verification functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never use `--insecure` in production environments.**
* Enforce certificate verification in all environments except for specific, controlled testing scenarios.
* Implement code reviews to catch and prevent `--insecure` usage.
* Use configuration management to ensure consistent and secure `curl` options.

## Threat: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration - Weak Ciphers or Disabled Revocation](./threats/insecure_tlsssl_configuration_-_weak_ciphers_or_disabled_revocation.md)

**Description:** Developers configure `curl` to use weak or outdated cipher suites or disable certificate revocation checks (`--ssl-no-revoke`). This weakens TLS/SSL security, making it easier for attackers to decrypt traffic or use compromised certificates. An attacker might exploit these weaknesses to perform MitM attacks or bypass certificate revocation mechanisms.

**Impact:**  Weakened TLS/SSL security, increasing the risk of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, data confidentiality breach, and potential bypass of security controls.

**Affected curl component:** TLS/SSL module, cipher selection, certificate revocation checking functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure `curl` to use strong and modern cipher suites.
* Enable and properly configure certificate revocation checks (OCSP or CRL).
* Regularly review and update TLS/SSL configurations based on security best practices.
* Use tools to assess TLS/SSL configuration strength.

## Threat: [Unrestricted Redirect Following](./threats/unrestricted_redirect_following.md)

**Description:** Developers use `curl` to follow redirects (`-L`) without limiting the number of redirects or validating redirect destinations. An attacker crafts a series of redirects that lead to internal resources (SSRF), external malicious sites, or cause a redirect loop leading to DoS.

**Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) allowing access to internal resources. Exposure to malicious external websites. Denial of Service (DoS) through resource exhaustion from excessive redirects.

**Affected curl component:** HTTP redirect handling module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use `--max-redirs` to limit the number of redirects `curl` will follow.
* Validate redirect destination URLs against a whitelist before following them.
* Consider disabling redirects entirely if not strictly necessary and handle redirects in application logic with more control.

## Threat: [Command Injection via URL or Options](./threats/command_injection_via_url_or_options.md)

**Description:** Developers construct `curl` commands by directly concatenating user-supplied data into URLs or command-line options without proper sanitization or escaping. An attacker injects malicious commands within the user-provided input that are then executed by the system when `curl` is invoked.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server, allowing full system compromise. Data exfiltration, system manipulation, and further attacks.

**Affected curl component:**  Operating System shell interaction when `curl` is executed as a command-line tool.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Prefer using `curl` library bindings** (e.g., `libcurl` bindings in various languages) instead of shelling out to the `curl` command-line tool.
* If shelling out is unavoidable, **strictly sanitize and escape user-provided input** before including it in `curl` commands. Use proper escaping mechanisms for the shell.
* Implement robust input validation and whitelisting for user-provided data used in `curl` commands.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via User-Controlled URLs](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_user-controlled_urls.md)

**Description:** Developers allow user-provided input to directly or indirectly control the URLs accessed by `curl` without proper validation. An attacker manipulates the URL to make `curl` send requests to internal resources, cloud metadata services, or other unintended targets, exploiting SSRF vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), allowing access to internal resources, data exfiltration from internal networks, privilege escalation in cloud environments, denial of service of internal services.

**Affected curl component:** URL parsing, request initiation module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided input** that influences URLs used by `curl`.
* Implement URL whitelisting, allowing only access to predefined and trusted domains/paths.
* Restrict allowed URL schemes to `https` and `http` if other schemes are not needed.
* Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF.
* Apply the principle of least privilege to the application server and its network access.

## Threat: [Malicious File Download and Execution](./threats/malicious_file_download_and_execution.md)

**Description:** Developers use `curl` to download files from user-controlled URLs and then execute these downloaded files without proper validation. An attacker can provide a URL to a malicious executable, which the application downloads and executes, leading to complete system compromise.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server, complete system compromise, data breach, and further malicious activities.

**Affected curl component:** File download module, interaction with the operating system for file saving.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid downloading and executing code directly from user-provided URLs or untrusted sources.**
* If downloading files is necessary, rigorously validate file type, content, and source before any processing.
* Implement strong input validation and sanitization for URLs used for downloading.
* Use sandboxing or containerization to isolate the application and limit the impact of malicious code execution if it occurs.
