## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Application Misuse of Curl [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_application_misuse_of_curl__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application *uses* curl, which are often more readily exploitable than inherent curl library vulnerabilities.

    *   **1.1 Insecure Configuration [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting applications that weaken or disable curl's security features.
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **1.1.1 Disable Security Features [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Goal:** Exploit applications that disable crucial security features, primarily TLS certificate verification.
                *   **Example:** Application sets `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER = 0`.
                *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle Attack, Data Breach.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High (Common misconfiguration).
                *   **Effort:** Low (Easy to exploit).
                *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Easily detectable).

        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **1.1.1 Disable Security Features [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Goal:** Exploit applications that disable crucial security features, primarily TLS certificate verification.
                *   **Example:** Application sets `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER = 0`.

                *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Easily detectable).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Disable Security Features [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_disable_security_features__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Goal:** Exploit applications that disable crucial security features, primarily TLS certificate verification.
                *   **Example:** Application sets `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER = 0`.
                *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle Attack, Data Breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Command Injection via Curl [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_command_injection_via_curl__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious commands or parameters into curl commands due to improper input handling by the application.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **1.2.1 Unsanitized Input in URL [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Goal:** Inject malicious code or parameters into the URL passed to curl due to lack of sanitization of user-provided input.
                *   **Example:** Application constructs URL by directly concatenating user input, leading to SSRF.
                *   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Arbitrary File Access, Information Disclosure.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High (Common input validation issue).
                *   **Effort:** Low (Easy to exploit).
                *   **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate.
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires network monitoring).

            *   **1.2.2 Unescaped Shell Characters in Options [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Goal:** Inject shell commands or options into curl command-line options if the application uses string options in `curl_easy_setopt` or constructs shell commands directly without proper escaping.
                *   **Example:** Application uses `curl_easy_setopt` with `CURLOPT_URL` or `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` and doesn't escape shell characters in user input, or directly executes `curl` command in shell with unsanitized input.
                *   **Impact:** Arbitrary Command Execution on the server.
                *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Less common in modern frameworks, but possible with manual curl command construction or misuse of string options).
                *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Relatively easy to exploit).
                *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires system and application log analysis).

                *   **Example:** Application uses `curl_easy_setopt` with `CURLOPT_URL` or `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` and doesn't escape shell characters in user input, or directly executes `curl` command in shell with unsanitized input.
