# Threat Model Analysis for curl/curl

## Threat: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in `curl` Command](./threats/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input_in_`curl`_command.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the `curl` command string if the application constructs the command using unsanitized user input or external data. The application then executes this modified command via a shell.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary command execution on the server hosting the application, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Affected `curl` Component:** Command-line argument parsing and execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid constructing `curl` commands using string concatenation with user-provided input.
*   Utilize libraries or methods that allow for safe parameterization of `curl` options, if available in your programming language's `curl` bindings.
*   If direct command construction is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate all user-provided input to prevent injection of shell metacharacters or additional options.
*   Consider using `curl` bindings that offer safer ways to set options programmatically, reducing the need for direct command string manipulation.

## Threat: [URL Manipulation Leading to SSRF or Information Disclosure](./threats/url_manipulation_leading_to_ssrf_or_information_disclosure.md)

**Description:** If the target URL for a `curl` request is built using unsanitized input, an attacker can manipulate the URL to point to internal resources or external malicious sites. This can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or information disclosure by making requests to unintended targets.

**Impact:** Access to internal services or data not meant to be publicly accessible, potential for further attacks on internal infrastructure, or leakage of sensitive information to attacker-controlled servers.

**Affected `curl` Component:** URL parsing and request construction.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input that contributes to the target URL.
*   Use allow-lists of permitted domains or URL patterns instead of relying solely on blacklists.
*   Avoid directly using user input to construct the entire URL; instead, use it for specific parameters within a controlled base URL.
*   Implement network segmentation and restrict outbound traffic from the application server to only necessary destinations.

## Threat: [Insecure Option Usage: Disabling SSL Verification](./threats/insecure_option_usage_disabling_ssl_verification.md)

**Description:** An attacker might be able to trick the application into making insecure requests by exploiting configurations where SSL certificate verification is disabled (e.g., using `-k` or `--insecure`). This bypasses the intended security of HTTPS.

**Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks become possible, allowing attackers to intercept and potentially modify communication between the application and the remote server. Sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS can be exposed.

**Affected `curl` Component:** SSL/TLS handling and certificate verification.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never** disable SSL certificate verification in production environments.
*   Ensure that the application is configured to use a valid set of trusted CA certificates.
*   If connecting to internal servers with self-signed certificates, manage those certificates securely and configure `curl` to trust them specifically, rather than disabling verification globally.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `curl` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_`curl`_library_itself.md)

**Description:**  The `curl` library itself may contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited if the application uses a vulnerable version.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, potentially ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution within the application's context.

**Affected `curl` Component:** Various modules and functions within the `curl` library depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update the `curl` library to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `curl`.
*   Implement a process for promptly applying security updates.

## Threat: [Exposure of Authentication Credentials in `curl` Options](./threats/exposure_of_authentication_credentials_in_`curl`_options.md)

**Description:**  Developers might inadvertently include sensitive authentication credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) directly in `curl` command-line options (e.g., using `--user` or in headers). This can expose these credentials if the command is logged or visible in process listings.

**Impact:**  Compromise of authentication credentials, allowing attackers to impersonate the application or access protected resources.

**Affected `curl` Component:** Option parsing and request construction.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid including credentials directly in `curl` command-line options.
*   Use secure methods for managing and providing credentials, such as environment variables, dedicated credential management systems, or secure vault solutions.
*   If using authentication headers, ensure they are handled securely and not logged or exposed.
