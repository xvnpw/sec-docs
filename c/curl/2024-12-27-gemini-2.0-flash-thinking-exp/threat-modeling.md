## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving curl

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the `curl` library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected curl Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **URL Spoofing/Manipulation** | An attacker manipulates the URL passed to `curl` (e.g., through user input, application logic flaws, or injection vulnerabilities). This could involve changing the hostname, path, or query parameters to redirect the request to a malicious server or resource. |  Fetching malicious content, interacting with internal services, performing actions on behalf of the application, data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers. | `libcurl`'s URL parsing and handling logic (within functions like `curl_easy_setopt` with `CURLOPT_URL`). | High | - **Strict URL Validation:** Implement robust validation and sanitization of URLs before passing them to `curl`. Use allow-lists instead of block-lists where possible. <br> - **Parameterization:** If constructing URLs dynamically, use parameterization techniques to avoid injection vulnerabilities. <br> - **Avoid User-Controlled URLs:** Minimize or eliminate scenarios where users directly control the entire URL passed to `curl`. |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack (Disabled Certificate Verification)** | An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the remote server when HTTPS is used but certificate verification is disabled (e.g., using `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` set to 0). This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on and potentially modify the communication. | Data breaches, injection of malicious content, credential theft, session hijacking. | `libcurl`'s TLS/SSL handling (specifically the certificate verification logic within functions related to `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` and `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST`). | Critical | - **Enable Certificate Verification:** Ensure `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` is set to 1 and `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` is set to 2. <br> - **Use a Trusted CA Bundle:** Ensure the application uses an up-to-date and trusted CA certificate bundle (configured via `CURLOPT_CAINFO` or system defaults). |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack (Outdated or Compromised CA Bundle)** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the CA certificate bundle used by `curl` or if the bundle is outdated or compromised. This allows them to forge certificates for legitimate websites, enabling MITM attacks even with certificate verification enabled. | Data breaches, injection of malicious content, credential theft, session hijacking. | `libcurl`'s TLS/SSL handling and the underlying operating system's or application's CA certificate store. | High | - **Keep CA Bundle Updated:** Regularly update the CA certificate bundle used by the application. This might involve updating the operating system's CA store or providing a custom bundle. <br> - **Consider Certificate Pinning:** For critical connections, consider implementing certificate pinning to further restrict accepted certificates. |
| **Data Injection via Redirects (Unrestricted FollowLocation)** | An attacker manipulates redirects on the target server to inject malicious content or redirect the application to a different, attacker-controlled server when `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION` is enabled without proper safeguards. | Fetching malicious content, phishing attacks, cross-site scripting (if the fetched content is processed by the application). | `libcurl`'s HTTP handling, specifically the redirect following logic controlled by `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION` and related options like `CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS`. | High | - **Limit Redirects:** Use `CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS` to limit the number of redirects `curl` will follow. <br> - **Validate Redirect Destinations:** If possible, validate the destination of redirects before following them. <br> - **Be Cautious with `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION`:** Understand the implications of automatically following redirects and consider disabling it if not strictly necessary. |
| **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `libcurl`** | An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the `libcurl` library itself (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows, use-after-free). | Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, arbitrary file access. | Core `libcurl` library code. | Critical | - **Keep `curl` Up-to-Date:** Regularly update the `curl` library to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. <br> - **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to `curl`. <br> - **Secure Compilation:** Ensure `curl` is compiled with appropriate security flags. |
| **Local File Inclusion/Exfiltration via `file://` URLs** | If the application allows user-controlled URLs and doesn't properly sanitize them, an attacker might be able to use `file://` URLs to access local files on the server where the application is running. | Information disclosure, potential for reading sensitive configuration files or application code. | `libcurl`'s URL handling and the application's lack of input validation. | High | - **Disable or Restrict `file://` Protocol:** If not strictly necessary, disable the `file://` protocol in `curl` using appropriate options or by filtering URLs. <br> - **Strict URL Validation:** Implement robust validation to prevent the use of `file://` URLs. |
