### High and Critical Tengine Threats

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to Tengine configuration files (e.g., `nginx.conf`) due to misconfigured file permissions or directory traversal vulnerabilities in the application. These files might contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials (if embedded), or internal network details.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive credentials and internal network information, potentially leading to further compromise of backend systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** File system access controls, potentially vulnerabilities in application code allowing file access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure proper file system permissions are set on Tengine configuration files, restricting access to only the necessary user accounts.
        *   Avoid embedding sensitive credentials directly in configuration files; use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in the application to prevent directory traversal attacks.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Dynamic Module Loading
    *   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges on the server could load a malicious dynamic module into Tengine. This module could contain backdoors, keyloggers, or other malicious code that compromises the server's security and potentially the entire system.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data theft, installation of malware, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dynamic module loading functionality within Tengine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the Tengine configuration directory and the ability to load dynamic modules to only trusted administrators.
        *   Implement strict controls over the source and integrity of dynamic modules.
        *   Regularly audit loaded modules and their sources.
        *   Consider disabling dynamic module loading if it's not strictly necessary.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Tengine-Specific Modules
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities present in modules that are specific to Tengine and not found in standard Nginx. This could involve sending specially crafted requests that trigger buffer overflows, logic errors, or other exploitable conditions within the module's code.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure, remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific Tengine modules (e.g., `ngx_http_concat_module`, custom modules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated on security advisories and patch Tengine and its modules promptly.
        *   Thoroughly test and audit any Tengine-specific modules before deploying them to production.
        *   Minimize the number of non-essential Tengine-specific modules used.

*   **Threat:** Integer Overflow in Request Parsing (Tengine Specific)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP request with excessively large values in headers or other fields that trigger an integer overflow in Tengine's request parsing logic (or within a Tengine-specific module). This could lead to memory corruption and potentially remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Tengine's core request parsing functions or specific modules handling request data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated on security advisories and patch Tengine promptly.
        *   Implement input validation to limit the size and range of values in HTTP requests.
        *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious requests.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion (Tengine Specific)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could send a large number of requests or specially crafted requests that exploit Tengine-specific features or module behavior to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, performance degradation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core Tengine request handling, potentially specific modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (in scenarios leading to significant impact).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address.
        *   Configure appropriate timeouts and resource limits in Tengine.
        *   Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to absorb some of the traffic.
        *   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in `ngx_http_concat_module`
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within the `ngx_http_concat_module` (if enabled) to manipulate the file concatenation process. This could potentially lead to information disclosure by accessing unintended files or denial of service by causing errors during concatenation.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ngx_http_concat_module`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated on security advisories for Tengine and its modules.
        *   Carefully review the configuration of `ngx_http_concat_module`.
        *   Consider disabling the module if it's not essential.
