## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Trigger Buffer Overflow during Decompression](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_trigger_buffer_overflow_during_decompression.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path exploits a classic memory corruption vulnerability. The attacker crafts malicious compressed data specifically designed to overflow a buffer during the decompression process performed by zlib.
*   **Steps:**
    *   The attacker provides a specially crafted compressed data stream to the application.
    *   The application uses zlib to decompress this data.
    *   Due to a flaw in the application's buffer management or a vulnerability in zlib, the decompressed data exceeds the allocated buffer size.
    *   This overflow overwrites adjacent memory regions, potentially corrupting data or injecting malicious code.
    *   If the attacker can control the overwritten memory, they can potentially gain control of the application's execution flow and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Critical Node: zlib Decompresses Data into Insufficiently Sized Buffer:** This node represents the point where the buffer overflow actually occurs. It's critical because it's the direct cause of the memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Cause Denial of Service (DoS) through zlib - Trigger Decompression Bomb (Zip Bomb)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_cause_denial_of_service__dos__through_zlib_-_trigger_decompression_bomb__zip_bomb_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path leverages the inherent nature of compression algorithms to create a small compressed file that expands to a massive size when decompressed, overwhelming the target system's resources.
*   **Steps:**
    *   The attacker provides a "zip bomb" or decompression bomb file to the application. This file is small in size but contains highly repetitive data that compresses very efficiently.
    *   The application, attempting to process this file, uses zlib to decompress it.
    *   The decompression process rapidly expands the data to an enormous size, consuming excessive CPU, memory, and potentially disk space.
    *   This resource exhaustion can lead to the application becoming unresponsive, crashing, or even causing the entire server to become unavailable, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Critical Node: Application Attempts to Decompress the Data Fully:** This node is critical because it represents the point where the application commits to the resource-intensive decompression process without proper safeguards.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes:](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes.md)

*   **Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerability in zlib:** This is a critical node because it represents the broad category of attacks that can lead to the most severe outcome: arbitrary code execution. Success at this node means the attacker has bypassed memory safety mechanisms and can potentially take full control of the application. It encompasses various specific memory corruption techniques like buffer overflows, heap overflows, use-after-free, and double-free vulnerabilities.

*   **zlib Decompresses Data into Insufficiently Sized Buffer:** As mentioned above, this node is critical within the buffer overflow attack path. It's the direct action that causes memory corruption.

*   **Application Attempts to Decompress the Data Fully:** As mentioned above, this node is critical within the decompression bomb attack path. It highlights the lack of resource limits or validation that allows the attack to succeed.
