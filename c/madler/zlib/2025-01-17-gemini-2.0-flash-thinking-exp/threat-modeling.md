# Threat Model Analysis for madler/zlib

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Decompression](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_decompression.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious compressed data stream that, when decompressed by `zlib`, writes data beyond the allocated buffer. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions. The attacker might achieve this by manipulating the compression ratios or internal structures within the compressed data.

**Impact:**  Memory corruption can lead to application crashes, denial of service, or, more critically, arbitrary code execution. If the attacker can control the overwritten memory, they can potentially inject and execute malicious code on the system.

**Affected Component:**  Decompression routines within `zlib`, specifically functions like `inflate()` and related internal functions responsible for handling the decompression process.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `zlib` library updated to the latest stable version, as updates often include fixes for known buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
*   Implement strict size limits on the decompressed data. Before decompression, check the expected output size and allocate sufficient buffer space.
*   Utilize safe memory allocation practices and consider using memory-safe languages or wrappers around `zlib` if feasible.
*   Employ compiler-level protections like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and stack canaries to make exploitation more difficult.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Memory Allocation (Decompression)](./threats/integer_overflow_in_memory_allocation__decompression_.md)

**Description:** A specially crafted compressed data stream can cause `zlib` to calculate an insufficient buffer size due to an integer overflow during the memory allocation phase of decompression. The attacker manipulates the compressed data in a way that triggers an overflow when calculating the required output buffer size.

**Impact:** When the decompressed data is written to the undersized buffer, it results in a heap overflow, similar to a buffer overflow. This can lead to application crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** Memory allocation routines within `zlib` used during decompression, specifically the logic that calculates the required buffer size before calling memory allocation functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `zlib` library updated to the latest stable version, as updates often include fixes for integer overflow vulnerabilities.
*   Implement checks on the calculated output size before allocating memory. Ensure the calculated size does not exceed reasonable limits or wrap around.
*   Consider using libraries or wrappers that provide bounds checking or safer memory management.

## Threat: [Decompression Bomb (Zip Bomb)](./threats/decompression_bomb__zip_bomb_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a small, highly compressed file that expands to an extremely large size when decompressed by `zlib`. The attacker's goal is to exhaust system resources. This is achieved by exploiting the compression algorithm's ability to represent repetitive data efficiently.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Excessive memory consumption can exhaust system RAM, causing the application or even the entire system to become unresponsive.

**Affected Component:** The core decompression algorithm within `zlib`, specifically the `inflate()` function and its related routines.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict limits on the maximum size of the decompressed output. Set a threshold beyond which decompression is aborted.
*   Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) during decompression operations and terminate the process if resource consumption exceeds acceptable levels.
*   Implement timeouts for decompression operations. If decompression takes an unusually long time, it might indicate a decompression bomb.
*   Consider using streaming decompression techniques where the output is processed in chunks, limiting the amount of memory held at any given time.
