# Attack Surface Analysis for madler/zlib

## Attack Surface: [Decompression Buffer Overflow](./attack_surfaces/decompression_buffer_overflow.md)

**Description:** A maliciously crafted compressed stream causes zlib's decompression process to write data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions.

**How zlib Contributes:** zlib's core function is decompression. If the library doesn't properly validate the compressed data or calculate the required output buffer size, it can be tricked into writing beyond buffer boundaries.

**Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted `.gz` file. When the application uses zlib to decompress this file, the decompression process writes past the end of the allocated buffer for the decompressed data.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, leading to application crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution if attacker-controlled data overwrites critical memory locations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Developers:**
    - Keep zlib updated to the latest stable version, as newer versions may contain fixes for buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
    - Utilize zlib's functions that allow for incremental decompression and careful buffer management (e.g., `inflateInit`, `inflate`, `inflateEnd`).

## Attack Surface: [Decompression Integer Overflow](./attack_surfaces/decompression_integer_overflow.md)

**Description:** Maliciously crafted headers within a compressed stream cause integer overflows when zlib calculates the required output buffer size. This can lead to allocating an insufficient buffer, resulting in a subsequent buffer overflow during decompression.

**How zlib Contributes:** zlib's decompression process relies on interpreting header information within the compressed data to determine the output size. If this calculation overflows, the allocated buffer will be too small.

**Example:** A compressed file has header values that, when multiplied to determine the output size, result in an integer overflow within zlib. The application allocates a smaller-than-needed buffer, and decompression writes beyond its bounds.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, leading to application crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Developers:**
    - Ensure the application is using a version of zlib where known integer overflow vulnerabilities are patched.
    - While direct developer control over zlib's internal integer handling is limited, staying updated is crucial.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service via Compression Bomb (Zip Bomb)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_via_compression_bomb__zip_bomb_.md)

**Description:** A small, specially crafted compressed archive expands to an extremely large size when decompressed, consuming excessive system resources (CPU, memory, disk space) and potentially causing a denial of service.

**How zlib Contributes:** zlib is the decompression engine that performs the expansion of the compressed data. It faithfully follows the instructions within the compressed stream, even if those instructions lead to massive output.

**Example:** An attacker sends a 100KB `.gz` file that, when decompressed by zlib, expands to several gigabytes, overwhelming the server's memory and causing it to crash.

**Impact:** Application or system unavailability, resource exhaustion.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Developers:**
    - Implement limits on the maximum decompressed size allowed, regardless of the compressed size.
    - Set timeouts for decompression operations to prevent indefinite resource consumption.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in zlib Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_zlib_library_itself.md)

**Description:**  Security flaws exist within the zlib library's code itself (e.g., bugs in the compression or decompression algorithms, memory management issues).

**How zlib Contributes:** The vulnerabilities are inherent to the zlib codebase.

**Example:** A known CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) exists for a specific version of zlib that allows for remote code execution if a specially crafted compressed stream is processed by that version.

**Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure and denial of service to arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Developers:**
    - **Critically, keep the zlib library updated to the latest stable version.** This is the primary defense against known vulnerabilities in zlib itself.
    - Monitor security advisories related to zlib to be aware of and address newly discovered vulnerabilities promptly.
