# Threat Model Analysis for madler/zlib

## Threat: [Compression Bomb (Zip Bomb)](./threats/compression_bomb__zip_bomb_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a small, highly-compressed file that expands to an extremely large size upon decompression. The attacker sends this to the application, aiming to exhaust server resources.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion (memory, CPU, or disk space).
    *   **Affected zlib Component:** `inflate()` function and related streaming API functions (`inflateInit()`, `inflate()`, `inflateEnd()`). The core decompression logic is exploited.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can easily lead to DoS)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Output Size Limits:** Implement a hard limit on decompressed data size *before* full decompression. Use the streaming API (`inflate()`) and check output size incrementally. Reject input exceeding the limit.
        *   **Input Size Limits:** Set reasonable limits on compressed input size *before* decompression.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Use OS-level resource limits (memory, CPU time, disk space).
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage during decompression; terminate if thresholds are exceeded.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider decompressing in a separate process or sandbox.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption (Buffer Overflow/Over-read)](./threats/memory_corruption__buffer_overflowover-read_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malformed compressed data that exploits a vulnerability (buffer overflow/over-read) in zlib's code, leading to writing outside allocated buffers or reading from unintended memory. The attacker aims for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure. The attacker could gain control of the application or system.
    *   **Affected zlib Component:** Potentially any part of zlib involved in decompression, including `inflate()`, memory allocation routines, and internal data structure handling. Specific vulnerabilities are tied to specific code flaws.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a remotely exploitable vulnerability exists; severity depends on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update zlib:** *Crucially*, use the *latest* stable version of zlib. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Memory Safety:** Use memory-safe languages (Rust, Go) or memory safety features in C/C++ (AddressSanitizer, bounds checking).
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Perform fuzz testing of the application's zlib integration.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate compressed data integrity (if possible) before decompression (e.g., checksums).
        *   **Code Audits:** Conduct regular code audits.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow](./threats/integer_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted input that triggers an integer overflow within zlib's calculations, especially with very large compressed/uncompressed sizes.  This can lead to incorrect memory allocation or other unexpected behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Potential Memory Corruption (depending on how the overflow is handled).
    *   **Affected zlib Component:** Functions handling size calculations, like `inflate()`, `compress()`, and related memory allocation routines.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can lead to DoS or potentially worse)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update zlib:** Use the latest version of zlib.
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review code interacting with zlib, especially size calculations, to prevent overflows. Use appropriate data types and checks.
        *   **Input Validation:** Limit input sizes to reasonable values.
