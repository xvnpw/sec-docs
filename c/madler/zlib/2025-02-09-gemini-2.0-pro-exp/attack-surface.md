# Attack Surface Analysis for madler/zlib

## Attack Surface: [1. Decompression Bombs (Zip Bombs)](./attack_surfaces/1__decompression_bombs__zip_bombs_.md)

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted compressed data designed to expand to an extremely large size upon decompression, consuming excessive resources.
*   **How zlib Contributes:** zlib performs the decompression. While it provides mechanisms to *help* mitigate this (e.g., `avail_out`, `total_out`), it doesn't inherently prevent bombs. The application's *incorrect* use of zlib, failing to limit output size, is the primary vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a small (e.g., 10KB) compressed file that expands to many gigabytes (e.g., 10GB or more) upon decompression, exhausting server memory.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) through resource exhaustion (memory, CPU, disk space). Application crashes.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if output size is not limited) / **High** (if output size is poorly limited).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Size Limits:** Enforce a maximum size for the *compressed* input.
    *   **Strict Output Size Limits:** *Crucially*, enforce a maximum size for the *decompressed* output. Use `avail_out` and `total_out` to track this during decompression and abort if the limit is approached.
    *   **Streaming Decompression:** Process data in chunks, checking resource usage after each chunk.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor memory and CPU usage; terminate if thresholds are exceeded.
    *   **Avoid Nested Decompression:** Disallow or strictly limit nested decompression.

## Attack Surface: [2. Integer Overflows / Buffer Overflows](./attack_surfaces/2__integer_overflows__buffer_overflows.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities *within* zlib's internal code (calculations or buffer handling) that can lead to memory corruption.
*   **How zlib Contributes:** These are bugs *within* the zlib library itself. While zlib is actively maintained, new vulnerabilities can be discovered.
*   **Example:** A crafted compressed input triggers an integer overflow in a buffer size calculation within zlib, leading to a buffer overflow when zlib writes decompressed data. This could allow overwriting arbitrary memory.
*   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution (ACE), leading to complete system compromise. Application crashes and data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if exploitable for ACE) / **High** (if leading to crashes or data corruption).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep zlib Updated:** *Always* use the latest, patched version of zlib. This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   **Input Validation (Application):** Basic input validation (size limits) can reduce the likelihood of triggering *some* vulnerabilities, but it's not a complete solution.
    *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Use tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan) or Valgrind during development/testing.
    *   **Fuzzing:** (Primarily for zlib maintainers, but beneficial for application developers if feasible).

## Attack Surface: [3. API Misuse (Leading to Security Issues)](./attack_surfaces/3__api_misuse__leading_to_security_issues_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect usage of the zlib API by the application, specifically where this misuse *directly* creates a security vulnerability.
*   **How zlib Contributes:** zlib provides the API, but the application's *incorrect* implementation is the vulnerability. This entry is narrowed to cases where the misuse has direct security implications.
*   **Example:** The application fails to check the return value of `inflate()` and continues processing data even after a `Z_DATA_ERROR` (indicating corrupted input) has occurred.  If the application then uses this potentially corrupted data in a security-sensitive context (e.g., without further validation), this could lead to a vulnerability.  Another critical example: providing a grossly undersized output buffer and not checking `avail_out`, leading to a buffer overflow *within the application's memory*.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific misuse, but can include data corruption leading to security vulnerabilities, or buffer overflows within the *application's* memory space (not zlib's).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (potential for significant security issues depending on the context).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough API Understanding:** Developers *must* carefully read and understand the zlib documentation.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews by experienced developers.
    *   **Unit Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests, including error handling and edge cases.
    *   **Check Return Values:** *Always* check return values and handle errors appropriately.
    * **Proper Buffer Management (Application):** Ensure that the application provides sufficiently sized input and output buffers to zlib functions, and correctly uses `avail_in` and `avail_out`.
