## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve RCE](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_rce.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit zlib Vulnerability**
    *   **1.1.1  `***CVE-2018-25032*** [CRITICAL]` (zlib < 1.2.12):**
        *   **Description:** A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability in the `inflate` function of zlib versions prior to 1.2.12.  It occurs when processing a specially crafted Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY stream.  This can lead to information disclosure and, depending on the memory layout and application, potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (If zlib is updated) / Very High (If zlib is outdated)
        *   **Impact:** High (Potential RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Public exploit available)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (IDS/IPS can detect, but might require specific signatures)
        *   **Mitigation:** *Update zlib to version 1.2.12 or later.* This is the most critical and immediate action.

*   **1.2 Exploit Incorrect zlib Usage**
    *   **1.2.1 `***Missing Input Validation*** [CRITICAL]`:**
        *   **Description:** The application fails to properly validate the size, structure, or content of data *before* passing it to zlib functions (e.g., `inflate`, `deflate`).  This lack of validation can exacerbate existing vulnerabilities in zlib or create new vulnerabilities in the application's handling of the data.  It's a common programming error that opens the door to various attacks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common programming error)
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Can enable other attacks, DoS, or potentially RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Simple to exploit if present)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Code review, fuzzing)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement strict size limits on both compressed and decompressed data.
            *   Validate the structure of compressed data (to the extent possible without fully decompressing) to ensure it conforms to expected formats.
            *   Use a well-defined data format (e.g., a specific protocol) rather than arbitrary compressed blobs.
            *   Sanitize input to remove potentially harmful characters or sequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Achieve DoS](./attack_tree_paths/2__achieve_dos.md)

*   **2.1 Craft Maliciously Compressed Data**
    *   **2.1.1 `***Highly Compressible Data*** [CRITICAL]` ("Billion Laughs" variant):**
        *   **Description:**  An attacker provides a small input that, when decompressed by zlib, expands to a massively large size.  This exploits the principle of compression, where repetitive data can be represented very efficiently.  This can exhaust the application's memory, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).  This is analogous to the XML "Billion Laughs" attack.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Easy to create, but requires lack of size limits)
        *   **Impact:** High (DoS)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Simple to create)
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If size limits are monitored) / Medium (If only resource usage is monitored)
        *   **Mitigation:** *Implement strict limits on the *decompressed* size of data.* Terminate decompression if the output exceeds a predefined threshold.

    *   **2.1.2 `***Adversarially Crafted Data*** [CRITICAL]` ("Zip Bomb"):**
        *   **Description:** A classic "zip bomb" is a small, highly compressed archive file that, when decompressed, expands to an extremely large size, often using nested compression layers.  The goal is to consume excessive resources (memory or disk space) and cause a Denial of Service (DoS).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Easy to create, but requires lack of size limits)
        *   **Impact:** High (DoS)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Simple to create, readily available)
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If size limits are monitored) / Medium (If only resource usage is monitored)
        *   **Mitigation:** *Implement strict limits on the *decompressed* size of data.* Terminate decompression if the output exceeds a predefined threshold. Consider using a "decompression bomb" detection library or technique.
