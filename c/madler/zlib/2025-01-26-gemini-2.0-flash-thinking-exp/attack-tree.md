## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in zlib [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities_in_zlib__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Buffer Overflow in Decompression [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Heap Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Trigger Heap Overflow via Malicious Compressed Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                * **Description:** Attacker crafts malicious compressed data that, when decompressed, writes beyond the bounds of a heap-allocated buffer used by `zlib`.
                * **Mechanism:** Exploits vulnerabilities in `zlib`'s decompression routines to cause out-of-bounds writes on the heap.
                * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, system compromise.
                * **Mitigation:** Use latest `zlib` version, robust input validation, memory-safe language wrappers.
        * **Integer Overflow in Size Calculations [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Cause Integer Overflow Leading to Buffer Underrun/Overflow [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                * **Craft Compressed Data to Trigger Integer Overflow in Length/Size Checks [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                    * **Description:** Attacker crafts compressed data that causes integer overflows in `zlib`'s size calculations, leading to incorrect buffer allocations and memory corruption.
                    * **Mechanism:** Exploits integer overflow vulnerabilities in `zlib`'s length or size checks during decompression.
                    * **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially code execution.
                    * **Mitigation:** Use latest `zlib` version, careful size limit implementations, safer integer arithmetic.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) via zlib [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos__via_zlib__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Decompression Bomb (Zip Bomb) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Exhaust Resources (CPU, Memory) by Decompressing Highly Compressed Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Provide Extremely High Compression Ratio Data to Consume Excessive Resources [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                * **Description:** Attacker provides maliciously crafted compressed data (zip bomb) that decompresses to an extremely large size, overwhelming system resources.
                * **Mechanism:** Exploits the nature of compression algorithms to create small compressed files that expand dramatically upon decompression.
                * **Impact:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion, application crash.
                * **Mitigation:** Implement strict decompressed size limits, decompression timeouts, resource limits.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Logic/Implementation Flaws in zlib Usage (Application-Specific, but Zlib-Related) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__logicimplementation_flaws_in_zlib_usage__application-specific__but_zlib-related___critical_node___6323d4f2.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Insecure Handling of Decompressed Data [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application Logic Post-Decompression [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Decompress Data Containing Malicious Payloads (e.g., Path Traversal, Command Injection) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                * **Description:** Attacker embeds malicious payloads within compressed data. After decompression, the application processes this data insecurely, leading to vulnerabilities.
                * **Mechanism:** Exploits application logic flaws in handling decompressed data, such as lack of sanitization or validation.
                * **Impact:** Path traversal, command injection, SQL injection, XSS, data breaches, remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability).
                * **Mitigation:** Strict input validation and sanitization of decompressed data, secure coding practices.
    * **Incorrect Size Checks/Limits on Decompressed Data [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Bypass Application Size Limits via Crafted Compressed Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Provide Compressed Data that Decompresses to Exceed Expected/Allowed Size [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                * **Description:** Attacker crafts compressed data to bypass application's size limit checks, still resulting in a large decompressed size and resource exhaustion.
                * **Mechanism:** Exploits flaws in the application's size limit implementation, such as checking compressed size instead of decompressed size.
                * **Impact:** DoS, resource exhaustion.
                * **Mitigation:** Implement size limits based on decompressed size, thorough testing of size limit implementations.
