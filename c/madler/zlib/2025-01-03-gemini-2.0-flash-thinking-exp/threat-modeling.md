# Threat Model Analysis for madler/zlib

## Threat: [Infinite Loop in Decompression](./threats/infinite_loop_in_decompression.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor provides a carefully crafted compressed stream that triggers an infinite loop within the zlib decompression logic. This could exploit edge cases or vulnerabilities in the state machine of the decompression algorithm within zlib itself.

**Impact:** The decompression process gets stuck in an infinite loop, consuming CPU resources indefinitely. This can lead to a denial of service condition for the application or the system.

**Affected Component:** Decompression routines (e.g., `inflate`, `inflateInit`, related functions within zlib).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the zlib library to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address such vulnerabilities.
* Consider fuzzing the zlib library directly with various malformed compressed inputs to proactively identify potential loop conditions (this is more relevant for zlib developers but informs application developers about potential risks).

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Decompression](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_decompression.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted compressed data stream that exploits a vulnerability in zlib's decompression routines, allowing them to write data beyond the allocated buffer within zlib's memory space.

**Impact:** Memory corruption within the zlib library can lead to unpredictable application behavior, crashes, or, in more severe cases, allow for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten memory. This is a critical security vulnerability within zlib.

**Affected Component:** Decompression routines (e.g., specific internal functions within `inflate` in zlib).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Crucially:** Keep the zlib library updated to the latest version, as buffer overflows are often patched.
* If possible, utilize memory protection mechanisms offered by the operating system to limit the impact of potential buffer overflows within zlib's memory space.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Size Calculations](./threats/integer_overflow_in_size_calculations.md)

**Description:** During decompression, calculations within zlib involving the size of the uncompressed data or internal buffer sizes might overflow, leading to incorrect memory allocation or buffer handling within zlib. An attacker could manipulate the compressed data to trigger these overflows within zlib's processing.

**Impact:** Integer overflows within zlib can lead to undersized buffer allocations, resulting in buffer overflows during decompression, or other unexpected behavior within the library that could be exploited.

**Affected Component:** Decompression routines (e.g., functions involved in calculating output buffer sizes within zlib).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the zlib library updated, as these issues are often addressed in newer versions.
* If contributing to zlib, use secure coding practices to prevent integer overflows in size calculations.

## Threat: [State Corruption](./threats/state_corruption.md)

**Description:** Under specific conditions, a malicious compressed stream or a sequence of operations could corrupt the internal state of the zlib decompression engine itself. This corruption resides within zlib's internal data structures.

**Impact:** State corruption within zlib can lead to incorrect decompression results, application crashes due to zlib errors, or potentially exploitable conditions in subsequent compression/decompression operations performed by zlib.

**Affected Component:** Internal state management within the decompression engine of zlib.

**Risk Severity:** Medium  *(Note: While generally medium, specific state corruption vulnerabilities could be high or critical. We'll include it as it directly involves zlib)*

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the zlib library updated.
* If contributing to zlib, ensure robust state management and error handling within the library.
