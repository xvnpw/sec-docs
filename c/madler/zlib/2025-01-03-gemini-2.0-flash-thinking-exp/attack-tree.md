## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] 3. Malicious Compressed Data Exploitation**](./attack_tree_paths/[critical]_3._malicious_compressed_data_exploitation.md)

This is the overarching category for attacks that involve crafting malicious compressed data to exploit vulnerabilities during the decompression process. It serves as the entry point for several high-risk scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] 3.1. Buffer Overflow during Decompression**](./attack_tree_paths/[critical]_3.1._buffer_overflow_during_decompression.md)

This occurs when the application allocates a buffer of a fixed size to store decompressed data, and a malicious compressed input causes the decompressed data to exceed this buffer. This overwrites adjacent memory locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] 3.1.1. Craft compressed data that expands beyond allocated buffer**](./attack_tree_paths/[critical]_3.1.1._craft_compressed_data_that_expands_beyond_allocated_buffer.md)

Attackers meticulously design compressed data with specific compression ratios and content to ensure that the decompressed output is larger than the expected buffer size.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] 3.1.1.1. Achieve Arbitrary Code Execution [HIGH-RISK PATH END]**](./attack_tree_paths/[critical]_3.1.1.1._achieve_arbitrary_code_execution_[high-risk_path_end].md)

By carefully crafting the overflowing data, attackers can overwrite critical memory locations, including the instruction pointer, allowing them to redirect program execution to their own malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Integer Overflow during Decompression](./attack_tree_paths/3.2._integer_overflow_during_decompression.md)

This vulnerability arises when calculations involving the size of the decompressed data overflow the maximum value of an integer data type.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1. Craft compressed data causing integer overflow in size calculations](./attack_tree_paths/3.2.1._craft_compressed_data_causing_integer_overflow_in_size_calculations.md)

Attackers create compressed data that, when its decompressed size is calculated, results in an integer overflow. This can lead to allocating a smaller-than-needed buffer.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1.1. Lead to undersized buffer allocation and subsequent overflow (see 3.1) [HIGH-RISK PATH - Leads to Critical Node]](./attack_tree_paths/3.2.1.1._lead_to_undersized_buffer_allocation_and_subsequent_overflow_(see_3.1)_[high-risk_path_-_leads_to_critical_node].md)

The undersized buffer allocated due to the integer overflow then becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow (as described in 3.1) when the actual decompressed data is written into it.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] 3.3. Heap Overflow during Decompression**](./attack_tree_paths/[critical]_3.3._heap_overflow_during_decompression.md)

Similar to a buffer overflow, but this occurs in memory allocated on the heap (dynamic memory allocation) rather than the stack. Malicious compressed data corrupts heap metadata or other heap-allocated structures.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] 3.3.1. Craft compressed data that corrupts heap memory during decompression**](./attack_tree_paths/[critical]_3.3.1._craft_compressed_data_that_corrupts_heap_memory_during_decompression.md)

Attackers carefully craft compressed data to manipulate heap allocation patterns and overwrite heap metadata or other critical data structures during decompression.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] 3.3.1.1. Achieve Arbitrary Code Execution [HIGH-RISK PATH END]**](./attack_tree_paths/[critical]_3.3.1.1._achieve_arbitrary_code_execution_[high-risk_path_end].md)

By corrupting heap metadata, attackers can manipulate memory management functions to gain control of program execution, similar to stack-based buffer overflows.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] 3.4. Decompression Bomb (Zip Bomb) [HIGH-RISK PATH START]**](./attack_tree_paths/[critical]_3.4._decompression_bomb_(zip_bomb)_[high-risk_path_start].md)

This attack involves providing a small, highly compressed file that expands to an enormous size when decompressed.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] 3.4.1. Provide highly compressed data that expands to an extremely large size**](./attack_tree_paths/[critical]_3.4.1._provide_highly_compressed_data_that_expands_to_an_extremely_large_size.md)

Attackers utilize compression techniques to create files with extremely high compression ratios, leading to exponential expansion upon decompression.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] 3.4.1.1. Exhaust memory and cause Denial of Service [HIGH-RISK PATH END]**](./attack_tree_paths/[critical]_3.4.1.1._exhaust_memory_and_cause_denial_of_service_[high-risk_path_end].md)

The massive expansion of the compressed data consumes all available system resources (memory, disk space), causing the application and potentially the entire system to crash or become unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1. Insecure Handling of Decompressed Data](./attack_tree_paths/4.1._insecure_handling_of_decompressed_data.md)

This category covers vulnerabilities arising from how the application processes the data *after* it has been successfully decompressed by zlib.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1. Application fails to sanitize or validate decompressed data](./attack_tree_paths/4.1.1._application_fails_to_sanitize_or_validate_decompressed_data.md)

The application trusts the decompressed data without proper checks, making it susceptible to malicious content embedded within.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1.1. Introduce malicious data that is later interpreted as commands or code [HIGH-RISK PATH - Application Specific]](./attack_tree_paths/4.1.1.1._introduce_malicious_data_that_is_later_interpreted_as_commands_or_code_[high-risk_path_-_application_specific].md)

Attackers embed malicious payloads within the compressed data, which, after decompression, are interpreted by the application as commands, code, or other actions, leading to vulnerabilities like command injection or cross-site scripting.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] 4.3. Lack of Resource Limits on Decompression [HIGH-RISK PATH START]**](./attack_tree_paths/[critical]_4.3._lack_of_resource_limits_on_decompression_[high-risk_path_start].md)

This is a flaw in the application's design where it doesn't impose any restrictions on the amount of data that can be decompressed.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] 4.3.1. Application doesn't limit the size of decompressed data**](./attack_tree_paths/[critical]_4.3.1._application_doesn't_limit_the_size_of_decompressed_data.md)

The application code lacks checks or mechanisms to prevent the decompression process from consuming excessive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL] 4.3.1.1. Allow decompression bombs to exhaust resources (see 3.4) [HIGH-RISK PATH END]**](./attack_tree_paths/[critical]_4.3.1.1._allow_decompression_bombs_to_exhaust_resources_(see_3.4)_[high-risk_path_end].md)

Without resource limits, the application becomes directly vulnerable to decompression bomb attacks, as it will attempt to decompress the malicious file without any safeguards.
