Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces with high and critical severity that directly involve raylib:

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Image Loading
    *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within raylib's image loading functionality when processing specially crafted image files.
    *   **How raylib Contributes:** Raylib's `LoadImage()` and related functions utilize underlying libraries (like stb_image) to decode various image formats. Vulnerabilities in these decoding processes, exposed through raylib's API, can be triggered by malformed image data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a PNG file with an excessively large header, causing a buffer overflow within the stb_image library when `LoadImage()` is called by the raylib application.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep raylib updated to benefit from patched vulnerabilities in its dependencies. Implement robust error handling around image loading functions. Consider validating image file headers before attempting to load them with raylib.

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Audio Loading
    *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within raylib's audio loading functionality when processing specially crafted audio files.
    *   **How raylib Contributes:** Raylib's `LoadSound()` and `LoadMusicStream()` functions rely on libraries (like miniaudio) to decode various audio formats. Malformed audio data can trigger vulnerabilities in these decoding processes exposed through raylib's API.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides an OGG file with a malformed header that causes a buffer overflow within the miniaudio library when `LoadSound()` is called by the raylib application.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep raylib updated to benefit from patched vulnerabilities in its dependencies. Implement robust error handling around audio loading functions. Consider validating audio file headers before attempting to load them with raylib.

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Font Loading
    *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within raylib's font loading and rendering functionality when processing specially crafted font files.
    *   **How raylib Contributes:** Raylib's `LoadFont()` and related functions utilize libraries (like stb_truetype) to load and render font files. Malformed font data can trigger vulnerabilities in the parsing or rendering process exposed through raylib's API.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a TTF file with a malformed glyph definition that causes a buffer overflow within the stb_truetype library when `LoadFont()` is called by the raylib application.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep raylib updated to benefit from patched vulnerabilities in its dependencies. Implement robust error handling around font loading functions.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in External Libraries (stb)
    *   **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities present in the "stb" single-file public domain libraries that are directly embedded and used by raylib.
    *   **How raylib Contributes:** Raylib directly includes and utilizes libraries like `stb_image`, `stb_vorbis`, and `stb_truetype`. Vulnerabilities within these libraries become inherent vulnerabilities within any application using that version of raylib.
    *   **Example:** A known heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a specific version of `stb_image`. An application using a raylib version that includes this vulnerable `stb_image` is susceptible when loading a specially crafted image.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, ranging from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Prioritize keeping raylib updated to the latest version. Raylib updates often incorporate updated and patched versions of the stb libraries. Regularly check the changelogs and security advisories for raylib releases.
