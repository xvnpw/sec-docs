*   **Threat:** Buffer Overflow in Input Processing
    *   **Description:** An attacker could send a specially crafted input string exceeding the buffer size allocated *within raylib* when handling keyboard, mouse, or gamepad input. This could overwrite adjacent memory regions managed by raylib.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution *within the application's context* due to memory corruption within raylib's data structures.
    *   **Affected raylib Component:** raylib's input handling functions (e.g., `GetKeyPressed`, `GetMousePosition`) and internal input buffers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep raylib updated to benefit from potential fixes for buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
        *   Report any suspected buffer overflow vulnerabilities in raylib's input handling to the developers.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Asset Loading Leading to Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker could provide a specially crafted image, sound, model, or font file that exploits vulnerabilities in *raylib's* asset loading and parsing routines. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft, installation of malware.
    *   **Affected raylib Component:** Asset loading functions (e.g., `LoadImage`, `LoadSound`, `LoadModel`, `LoadFont`) and their underlying parsing code *within raylib*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep raylib updated to benefit from security patches in asset loading routines.
        *   Be cautious about loading assets from untrusted sources, even if the application performs its own validation. Vulnerabilities might exist within raylib's parsing logic before the application's validation takes place.

*   **Threat:** Use-After-Free Errors
    *   **Description:** *Within raylib's internal memory management*, memory associated with a raylib object (e.g., a texture) might be freed, but a dangling pointer within raylib is later dereferenced, leading to unpredictable behavior or potential for exploitation.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if the freed memory is reallocated and contains attacker-controlled data.
    *   **Affected raylib Component:** Various resource management functions *within raylib* and its internal memory management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep raylib updated to benefit from fixes for use-after-free vulnerabilities.
        *   Report any suspected use-after-free vulnerabilities observed when using raylib to the developers.

*   **Threat:** Integer Overflow in Input Handling
    *   **Description:** An attacker could provide extremely large input values (e.g., for mouse coordinates or gamepad axis) that cause integer overflows during calculations *within raylib*. This can lead to unexpected behavior or memory corruption within raylib's internal data structures.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, incorrect game logic due to faulty calculations within raylib, potential for memory corruption if the overflowed value is used in memory access calculations *within raylib*.
    *   **Affected raylib Component:** raylib's input handling functions and related internal calculations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep raylib updated to benefit from fixes for integer overflow vulnerabilities in input handling.
        *   Report any suspected integer overflow issues in raylib's input handling to the developers.
