# Threat Model Analysis for krallin/tini

## Threat: [Signal Handling Exploitation](./threats/signal_handling_exploitation.md)

Description: An attacker might craft specific signal sequences or malformed signals to exploit vulnerabilities in `tini`'s signal handling logic. This could involve sending signals designed to trigger buffer overflows, race conditions, or logic errors within `tini`'s signal processing routines. Successful exploitation could lead to unexpected program behavior, crashes, or even arbitrary code execution within the container.
Impact: Application instability, Denial of Service, potential container compromise (though less likely due to `tini`'s simplicity).
Tini Component Affected: Signal Handling Module (specifically functions related to signal interception, processing, and forwarding like `sigaction`, `kill`, signal queue management).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
        * Use stable and actively maintained versions of `tini`.
        * Regularly update `tini` to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Monitor `tini`'s logs and behavior for unusual signal handling patterns.
        * Implement robust error handling in the main application to gracefully handle unexpected termination or signal-related issues, even if caused by `tini` flaws.

## Threat: [PID 1 Privilege Abuse via Tini Vulnerability](./threats/pid_1_privilege_abuse_via_tini_vulnerability.md)

Description: If a vulnerability exists in `tini`, an attacker exploiting it gains control within the context of PID 1. While `tini` is designed to be minimal, any code execution vulnerability at PID 1 within a container is inherently more impactful. An attacker could leverage this to attempt container escape, privilege escalation within the container, or perform container-wide Denial of Service.
Impact: Critical - Container compromise, privilege escalation, Denial of Service.
Tini Component Affected: Any component of `tini` that contains a vulnerability (e.g., memory management, input parsing, signal handling).
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
        * Prioritize using the latest stable and security-patched version of `tini`.
        * Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scanning of container images, including `tini`.
        * Implement strong container security practices in general to limit the blast radius of any container compromise.
        * Employ security monitoring and intrusion detection systems to detect and respond to suspicious activity within containers.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of Tini Binary](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_tini_binary.md)

Description: An attacker could compromise the supply chain of `tini` by injecting malicious code into the build process or distribution channels. This could result in users unknowingly using a backdoored or vulnerable version of `tini` in their container images. A compromised `tini` could perform malicious actions from within the container, potentially undetected.
Impact: High - Full container compromise, data exfiltration, malicious activity, long-term persistent access.
Tini Component Affected: Entire `tini` binary and build/distribution infrastructure.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
        * Obtain `tini` binaries from trusted and verified sources (official GitHub releases, reputable package registries).
        * Verify the integrity of downloaded `tini` binaries using checksums or cryptographic signatures provided by the `tini` maintainers.
        * Implement secure container image build pipelines with supply chain security best practices.
        * Regularly scan container images for known vulnerabilities and signs of tampering.
        * Consider using binary transparency and provenance tools if available for `tini` or container base images.
