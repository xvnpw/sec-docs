# Threat Model Analysis for krallin/tini

## Threat: [Unexpected Signal Handling Leading to Container Instability](./threats/unexpected_signal_handling_leading_to_container_instability.md)

* **Description:** An attacker might send specific signals to the `tini` process (PID 1) that are not handled correctly due to bugs or unexpected edge cases in `tini`'s signal handling logic. This could cause `tini` to terminate unexpectedly or enter an unstable state.
    * **Impact:** The containerized application might become unresponsive or crash. Processes within the container might not be terminated gracefully, leading to data corruption or resource leaks.
    * **Affected Component:** `Signal Handling Module` (specifically the functions responsible for intercepting and forwarding signals).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update `tini` to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * Thoroughly test the application's behavior under various signal conditions in a controlled environment.
        * Consider using alternative, well-vetted init systems if severe signal handling issues are discovered in `tini` and no immediate fix is available.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Fork Bomb Exploitation](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_fork_bomb_exploitation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could attempt to create a "fork bomb" within the container, rapidly spawning new processes. While `tini` is designed to reap zombie processes, a sufficiently rapid fork bomb might overwhelm `tini`'s ability to manage them, leading to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) at the container level.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service for the application within the container. The container might become unresponsive, and potentially impact the host system if resource limits are not properly configured.
    * **Affected Component:** `Process Reaping Logic` (the part of `tini` responsible for collecting and cleaning up zombie processes).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, process limits) for the container using the container runtime environment (e.g., Docker's `--cpus`, `--memory`, `--pids-limit`).
        * Monitor resource usage within the container and set up alerts for unusual spikes in process creation.
        * Implement application-level safeguards to prevent or mitigate fork bomb scenarios.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of Tini Binary](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_tini_binary.md)

* **Description:** Although less likely for a relatively small and well-established project like `tini`, there's a theoretical risk that the official `tini` binary could be compromised at the source or during the build/release process. A malicious binary could contain backdoors or other malicious code.
    * **Impact:**  If a compromised `tini` binary is used, it could grant attackers significant control over the container, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.
    * **Affected Component:** The entire `tini` executable.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Obtain the `tini` binary from trusted sources (official GitHub releases).
        * Verify the integrity of the downloaded binary using checksums or digital signatures provided by the `tini` project.
        * Regularly scan container images for known vulnerabilities, including the `tini` binary.
        * Consider using base images that include verified and trusted versions of `tini`.
