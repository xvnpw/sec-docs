# Attack Surface Analysis for krallin/tini

## Attack Surface: [Signal Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/signal_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Flaws in how `tini` processes and forwards signals to the main application process.

**How Tini Contributes:** `tini` acts as the signal handler for the container's main process. Incorrect or insecure signal handling within `tini` directly creates this attack surface.

**Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted signal that `tini` mishandles, preventing a `SIGTERM` from reaching the application, thus preventing a graceful shutdown.

**Impact:** Denial of service (inability to gracefully stop the application), potential for application instability or unexpected behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `tini` Updated: Ensure you are using the latest version of `tini` with known signal handling bugs fixed.
* Minimal `tini` Configuration: Avoid custom signal handling configurations for `tini` unless absolutely necessary.
* Container Runtime Security: Ensure the underlying container runtime provides proper signal isolation and security.
