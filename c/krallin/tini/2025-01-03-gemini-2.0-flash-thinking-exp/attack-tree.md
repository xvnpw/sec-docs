## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Tini Vulnerability Directly](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_tini_vulnerability_directly.md)

**Attack Vector: Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow) [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Description:** This involves discovering and exploiting a memory corruption vulnerability within Tini's code. A buffer overflow is a common example where providing more data than allocated can overwrite adjacent memory locations.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * Identify a memory corruption vulnerability in Tini's source code. This requires reverse engineering or identifying publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
        * Craft a specific input that triggers the vulnerable code path and causes memory corruption.
        * Trigger the vulnerability by executing the application within the container with the crafted input.
        * If successful, the memory corruption can be leveraged to overwrite critical data or inject malicious code.
    * **Potential Impact:** Achieving arbitrary code execution within the container, granting the attacker full control.
* **Attack Vector: Gain arbitrary code execution [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Description:** This is the successful outcome of exploiting a memory corruption vulnerability. The attacker can now execute arbitrary commands within the container's context.
    * **Attack Steps:** This step is the result of the previous step. The attacker uses the memory corruption to inject and execute their own code.
    * **Potential Impact:** Full control over the container, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, modify files, install malware, or pivot to other systems.
* **Attack Vector: Exploit Logic Flaw [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Description:** This involves identifying and exploiting a flaw in Tini's logic or design that leads to unintended behavior.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * Analyze Tini's code to identify logical inconsistencies or flaws in its execution flow.
        * Devise a specific sequence of actions or inputs that trigger the logic flaw.
        * Execute the application in a way that triggers the identified flaw.
    * **Potential Impact:** Could lead to code execution if the logic flaw allows for manipulation of execution flow, or denial of service if the flaw causes Tini to crash or hang.
* **Attack Vector: Achieve code execution or denial of service [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Description:** This is the potential outcome of exploiting a logic flaw.
    * **Attack Steps:** This step is the result of the previous step. The exploited logic flaw leads to either the execution of attacker-controlled code or a disruption of Tini's functionality.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Code execution grants full control. Denial of service renders the application unusable.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Manipulate Signal Handling](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_manipulate_signal_handling.md)

* **Attack Vector: Manipulate Signal Handling [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Description:** This involves exploiting Tini's primary function of forwarding signals to the application's main process.
    * **Attack Steps:** The attacker attempts to send signals to the container that Tini will forward to the application. The goal is to leverage this signal forwarding mechanism to trigger vulnerabilities in the application.
    * **Potential Impact:** Depending on the application's signal handling, this could lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or even code execution.
* **Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Signals [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Description:** The attacker actively sends signals to the container with the intent of causing harm.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * Identify signals that could potentially trigger vulnerabilities in the target application.
        * Use tools like `docker kill -s <signal> <container_id>` to send these signals to the container.
        * Tini will forward these signals to the application's main process.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Disrupting application functionality, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.
* **Attack Vector: Target application vulnerability triggered by specific signal [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Description:** The attacker successfully sends a signal that exploits a vulnerability in how the application handles that specific signal.
    * **Attack Steps:** This step is the successful outcome of the previous step. The sent signal triggers a bug in the application's signal handling logic.
    * **Potential Impact:**  This could range from denial of service (e.g., sending `SIGKILL`) to more severe vulnerabilities leading to code execution if the application has flaws in how it processes signal handlers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Process Group IDs (PGIDs) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_process_group_ids_(pgids)_[critical_node].md)

* **Description:** This involves exploiting potential weaknesses in how Tini manages process group IDs. Tini uses PGIDs to manage and forward signals to groups of processes.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * Identify potential vulnerabilities in Tini's PGID handling logic.
        * Attempt to manipulate the PGIDs of processes within the container.
        * This could involve techniques to misrepresent process relationships or interfere with Tini's tracking of process groups.
    * **Potential Impact:** Could lead to Tini sending signals to the wrong processes or failing to send signals to the correct processes, causing application disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Tini to terminate the wrong processes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_tini_to_terminate_the_wrong_processes_[critical_node].md)

* **Description:** A successful exploitation of PGID manipulation could lead to Tini incorrectly identifying and terminating critical application processes.
    * **Attack Steps:** This is the result of the previous step. By manipulating PGIDs, the attacker tricks Tini into sending termination signals (like SIGTERM or SIGKILL) to essential application components.
    * **Potential Impact:** Significant disruption of application functionality, potentially leading to a complete application failure.
