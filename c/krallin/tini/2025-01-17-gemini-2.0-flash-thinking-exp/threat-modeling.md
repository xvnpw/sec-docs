# Threat Model Analysis for krallin/tini

## Threat: [Malicious Signal Injection](./threats/malicious_signal_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges within the container or on the host system could send arbitrary signals to the `tini` process. This could be done using tools like `kill` or through programming interfaces. The attacker might target signals that cause `tini` to terminate unexpectedly (e.g., `SIGKILL`).

**Impact:** Denial of service if `tini` is terminated, as it's the init process.

**Affected Component:** Signal Handling Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong container isolation to limit access to the container's process namespace.
* Minimize the privileges of processes running within the container.
* Consider using security policies (e.g., seccomp profiles) to restrict the ability of processes to send signals.

## Threat: [Exploiting `tini` Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting__tini__vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Like any software, `tini` might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain control over the `tini` process or the container environment. This could involve sending specially crafted signals or exploiting flaws in `tini`'s internal logic.

**Impact:** Container escape, denial of service, arbitrary code execution within the container, or other security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** Entire `tini` executable

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `tini` updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to `tini`.
* Consider using static analysis tools on the `tini` codebase (if feasible) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
