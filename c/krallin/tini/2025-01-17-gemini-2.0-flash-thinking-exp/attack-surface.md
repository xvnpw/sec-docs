# Attack Surface Analysis for krallin/tini

## Attack Surface: [Signal Misinterpretation/Dropping](./attack_surfaces/signal_misinterpretationdropping.md)

**Description:**  `tini` is responsible for forwarding signals to child processes. If `tini` has a bug or design flaw in its signal handling logic, it might misinterpret or drop signals intended for the application.

**How Tini Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `tini`'s core function is signal forwarding. Any vulnerability in this process directly creates an attack surface.

**Example:** An attacker sends a `SIGTERM` signal intended to gracefully shut down a specific application process. Due to a bug in `tini`, this signal is dropped, leading to an abrupt termination and potential data corruption.

**Impact:** Application instability, data loss, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use the latest stable version of `tini`:** Ensure you are using a version with known bug fixes and security patches.
* **Monitor `tini`'s behavior:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect unexpected signal handling issues.
* **Thoroughly test signal handling:**  Test how your application behaves under various signal conditions with `tini` in place.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Tini Itself (Supply Chain)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_tini_itself__supply_chain_.md)

**Description:** Like any software, `tini` could contain undiscovered vulnerabilities. Using an outdated or unpatched version exposes the application.

**How Tini Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  As a dependency, any vulnerability in `tini` directly impacts the security of the application using it.

**Example:** A newly discovered vulnerability in `tini`'s signal handling logic allows an attacker to send a specially crafted signal that crashes the init process, terminating all container processes.

**Impact:** Denial of service, potential for more severe exploits depending on the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regularly update `tini`:** Keep `tini` updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
* **Monitor for security advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or use vulnerability scanning tools to be aware of any reported vulnerabilities in `tini`.
* **Consider using a trusted source for the `tini` binary:**  Obtain the binary from official repositories or trusted sources to minimize the risk of using a compromised version.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Tini Binary (Supply Chain)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_tini_binary__supply_chain_.md)

**Description:** If the `tini` binary is sourced from an untrusted location or is compromised during the build process, it could contain malicious code.

**How Tini Contributes to the Attack Surface:** A compromised `tini` binary executes with the privileges of the init process within the container, giving it significant control.

**Example:** A malicious actor replaces the legitimate `tini` binary with a modified version that includes a backdoor. This backdoor could allow the attacker to gain remote access to the container or exfiltrate data.

**Impact:** Full container compromise, data breach, malicious activity within the container.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Verify the integrity of the `tini` binary:** Use checksums or digital signatures to verify the authenticity of the downloaded binary.
* **Build `tini` from source (if feasible):** Building from source provides greater control over the build process but requires more effort.
* **Use trusted base images:** Ensure the base container image used includes a verified and trusted version of `tini`.
* **Implement security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline:** Scan container images for known vulnerabilities and malware before deployment.
