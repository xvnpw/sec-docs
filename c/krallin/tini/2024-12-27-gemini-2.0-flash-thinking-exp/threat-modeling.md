## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving `tini`

| Threat | Description (Attacker Actions & How) | Impact | Affected `tini` Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Signal Blocking/Dropping** | An attacker might exploit a vulnerability or misconfiguration in `tini` that causes it to block or drop signals intended for the main application process. This could be achieved by sending specific signal sequences or exploiting a bug in `tini`'s signal handling logic. | Application might not respond to critical signals like `SIGTERM` or `SIGKILL`, leading to a hung or unresponsive state. This can cause data loss if shutdown procedures are not executed. | Signal Handling Logic | High | - Thoroughly test signal handling within the containerized environment. <br> - Review `tini`'s configuration (though minimal) and ensure it aligns with application needs. <br> - Stay updated with `tini` releases and security patches. <br> - Implement application-level timeouts and health checks to detect unresponsiveness. |
| **Compromised `tini` Binary (Supply Chain Attack)** | An attacker could compromise the `tini` binary during the build or distribution process, injecting malicious code. This compromised `tini` would then be used as the init process in the container. | Complete compromise of the container environment, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code, steal data, or disrupt the application. | Entire `tini` Binary | Critical | - Use trusted sources for obtaining the `tini` binary. <br> - Implement checksum verification for the `tini` binary. <br> - Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities. <br> - Consider using a minimal base image to reduce the attack surface. |
