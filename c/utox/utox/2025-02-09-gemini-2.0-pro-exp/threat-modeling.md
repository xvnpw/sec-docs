# Threat Model Analysis for utox/utox

## Threat: [File Transfer Abuse / Malware Delivery (uTox Vulnerability)](./threats/file_transfer_abuse__malware_delivery__utox_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in uTox's file transfer handling (e.g., a buffer overflow in the file parsing logic, or a failure to properly sanitize filenames) to execute arbitrary code on the user's system *without* requiring the user to explicitly open the file.  This differs from the previous file transfer threat, which relied on user interaction. This focuses on a *direct* vulnerability in uTox.
*   **Impact:**  Malware infection of the user's system, potentially without any user interaction beyond accepting the file transfer (or even automatically, if auto-accept is enabled and the vulnerability allows it).  Data exfiltration.  System compromise.
*   **uTox Component Affected:**  `File Transfer` (networking, file I/O, and potentially UI components).  Specifically, vulnerabilities in functions related to `tox_file_send`, `tox_file_send_chunk`, `tox_file_control` with `TOX_FILE_CONTROL_ACCEPT`, and the handling of incoming file transfer requests and data, including any parsing or processing of file metadata or content.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **uTox Client:**  Rigorous input validation and sanitization of all file transfer data.  Fuzz testing of file transfer components.  Memory safety checks (e.g., using a memory-safe language or employing static analysis tools).  Disable auto-accept of files by default.
    *   **Application:**  If the application interacts with uTox's file transfer API, ensure it does *not* automatically accept files or process them without thorough validation.

## Threat: [Audio/Video Call Eavesdropping (uTox Vulnerability)](./threats/audiovideo_call_eavesdropping__utox_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:**  A vulnerability exists in uTox's audio/video encryption implementation, key exchange mechanism, or codec handling, allowing an attacker to decrypt or intercept the audio/video stream. This is *not* about general network eavesdropping, but a specific flaw within uTox.
*   **Impact:**  Disclosure of sensitive information discussed during calls.  Privacy violation.
*   **uTox Component Affected:**  `Audio/Video Calling` (networking, encryption, audio/video codecs).  Vulnerabilities in functions related to `tox_call`, `tox_answer`, `tox_call_control`, and the handling of audio/video streams and encryption keys.  This could involve flaws in the underlying encryption library (e.g., libsodium) or in how uTox uses it.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **uTox Client:**  Thorough security audits of the audio/video calling code.  Use of well-vetted encryption libraries and adherence to best practices for cryptographic implementations.  Regular penetration testing.  Keep dependencies (like libsodium and codecs) up-to-date.
    *   **Application:**  If the application interacts with uTox's audio/video API, ensure it uses the latest version and handles security-related callbacks appropriately.

## Threat: [uTox Client Compromise (Remote Code Execution)](./threats/utox_client_compromise__remote_code_execution_.md)

*   **Description:**  A vulnerability in *any* part of uTox (e.g., a buffer overflow, format string vulnerability, use-after-free error, or other memory corruption issue) is exploited by a malicious actor to execute arbitrary code on the user's system.  This could be triggered by a specially crafted message, file, friend request, or even a malformed DHT packet if the vulnerability is in the networking code.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise.  Data exfiltration.  Installation of malware.  Use of the system for further attacks.  This is the most severe threat.
*   **uTox Component Affected:**  Potentially *any* component.  High-risk areas include:
    *   `Networking Code`: Handling of incoming and outgoing Tox packets.
    *   `Message Parsing`: Processing of messages, including text, formatting, and potentially embedded data.
    *   `File Handling`:  As described above.
    *   `Audio/Video Codec Processing`:  Decoding of audio and video streams.
    *   `DHT Implementation`:  Handling of DHT packets.
    *   `UI Components`:  Potentially, if vulnerabilities exist in how user input or data is displayed.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **uTox Client:**
        *   **Code Audits:**  Regular and thorough security audits of the entire codebase, with a focus on high-risk areas.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Extensive fuzz testing of all input vectors (messages, files, network packets, etc.).
        *   **Memory Safety:**  Use of memory-safe programming techniques (e.g., bounds checking, avoiding unsafe functions).  Consider migrating to a memory-safe language (e.g., Rust) for critical components.
        *   **Static Analysis:**  Use of static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Exploit Mitigation Techniques:**  Enable compiler and operating system security features like ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), DEP (Data Execution Prevention), and stack canaries.
        *   **Sandboxing:**  Consider running uTox in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run uTox with the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Application:**  If the application interacts with uTox via an API, ensure that the API is used securely and that *all* input passed to uTox is rigorously validated and sanitized.  Strongly consider sandboxing the uTox process.
