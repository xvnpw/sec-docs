### Key Attack Surface List (Mongoose Specific, High & Critical):

*   **Description:** HTTP Request Parsing Vulnerabilities
    *   **How Mongoose Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mongoose's HTTP request parser interprets incoming HTTP requests. If the parser is flawed, it can be exploited by sending malformed or oversized requests directly to the Mongoose server.
    *   **Example:** Sending a request with an excessively long header or a header with unusual characters that the *Mongoose parser* doesn't handle correctly, potentially leading to a crash or unexpected behavior within the Mongoose process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) of the Mongoose server, potential for memory corruption or other unexpected behavior *within Mongoose's execution environment*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Mongoose updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for parsing vulnerabilities *within Mongoose itself*.
        *   Configure Mongoose with reasonable limits for header sizes and request body sizes *within its configuration*.

*   **Description:** Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Serving
    *   **How Mongoose Contributes to the Attack Surface:** When *Mongoose* is configured to serve static files, it handles requests for specific file paths. If not properly secured *within Mongoose's path handling logic*, attackers can manipulate the requested path to access files outside the intended document root.
    *   **Example:** A request like `GET /../../../../etc/passwd` could potentially expose sensitive system files if *Mongoose's path sanitization* is insufficient.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential access to sensitive configuration files or application data *served directly by Mongoose*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure the document root *within Mongoose's settings* and ensure it points to the intended directory.
        *   Disable directory listing *in Mongoose's configuration* if not required.
        *   Avoid relying on user input to directly construct file paths *that Mongoose will serve*, without thorough validation.

*   **Description:** Command Injection through CGI/SSI
    *   **How Mongoose Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If CGI or SSI execution is enabled *within Mongoose*, it executes external programs or includes server-side content based on requests. Improper handling of input *by Mongoose when invoking these features* can lead to attackers injecting arbitrary commands.
    *   **Example:** A CGI script that takes user input and *Mongoose passes this input to the system shell* without sanitization. An attacker could inject commands like `; rm -rf /` within the input.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server *running the Mongoose process*, data loss, and potential for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strongly consider disabling CGI and SSI within Mongoose unless absolutely necessary.** These features introduce significant security risks *directly through Mongoose's execution capabilities*.
        *   If CGI/SSI is required, rigorously sanitize all user input *before Mongoose uses it to execute external programs or includes*.
        *   Run CGI scripts with the least privileges necessary *at the operating system level*.

*   **Description:** Weak Authentication/Authorization
    *   **How Mongoose Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mongoose provides basic authentication mechanisms *as part of its built-in features*. If these are not configured securely *within Mongoose's settings* or if the application relies solely on them without additional layers of security, it can be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Using basic authentication over HTTP (without HTTPS) *handled directly by Mongoose*, which transmits credentials in plain text. Or relying on easily guessable usernames and passwords *configured within Mongoose*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to application features or data *protected by Mongoose's authentication*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) to encrypt communication, especially when Mongoose is handling authentication credentials.** Configure TLS properly within Mongoose.
        *   Enforce strong password policies *for any users managed by Mongoose's authentication*.
        *   Consider using more robust authentication mechanisms *external to Mongoose* if its built-in features are insufficient.

*   **Description:** TLS/SSL Vulnerabilities and Misconfiguration
    *   **How Mongoose Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mongoose handles TLS/SSL termination for HTTPS connections *as a core function*. Vulnerabilities in the underlying TLS library *used by Mongoose* or misconfigurations *within Mongoose's TLS settings* can weaken the encryption and expose communication.
    *   **Example:** Using outdated TLS protocols (like SSLv3 or TLS 1.0), weak cipher suites, or not properly configuring certificate validation *within Mongoose's TLS configuration*.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, eavesdropping on sensitive data *transmitted through Mongoose's HTTPS connections*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Mongoose is linked against an up-to-date version of the TLS library (e.g., OpenSSL).
        *   Configure Mongoose to use strong and modern TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher) *within its configuration*.
        *   Disable weak cipher suites *in Mongoose's TLS settings*.
        *   Properly configure and validate SSL/TLS certificates *used by Mongoose*.
