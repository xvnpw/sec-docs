# Threat Model Analysis for pgvector/pgvector

## Threat: [Malicious Vector Injection](./threats/malicious_vector_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects specially crafted vector embeddings into the database. These vectors are designed to manipulate similarity search results, leading to incorrect or biased outcomes. The attacker aims to promote specific items, suppress others, or disrupt the intended functionality.

**Impact:** Skewed search results, biased recommendations, manipulation of application features relying on vector similarity, potential for reputational damage due to inaccurate information.

**Affected Component:** Vector storage within PostgreSQL, specifically the data structures managed by `pgvector` for storing vector embeddings.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation on vector data before insertion, checking dimensionality and potentially value ranges.
*   Enforce strong authentication and authorization controls for database access to prevent unauthorized insertions.
*   Consider using write-only access for the application inserting vectors, limiting the potential for direct manipulation of existing data.
*   Implement anomaly detection mechanisms to identify unusual patterns in inserted vector data.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Expensive Similarity Searches](./threats/denial_of_service_through_expensive_similarity_searches.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious similarity search queries that are computationally expensive to execute. This could involve searching with very high-dimensional vectors, using complex distance functions, or performing a large number of concurrent searches, overwhelming the database server and causing a denial of service.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation for legitimate users, potential for infrastructure costs to increase due to resource consumption.

**Affected Component:** Similarity search functionality, particularly the indexing mechanisms (e.g., IVFFlat) and distance calculation functions within `pgvector`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting on similarity search requests.
*   Set resource limits for database queries to prevent runaway processes.
*   Optimize vector indexing strategies and choose appropriate distance functions based on performance considerations.
*   Monitor database resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
*   Implement query timeouts to prevent long-running, expensive searches from blocking resources.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Vector Search Parameters](./threats/sql_injection_in_vector_search_parameters.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application's code where user-provided input is directly incorporated into SQL queries involving `pgvector`'s similarity search functions (e.g., the query vector itself or distance thresholds) without proper sanitization. This allows the attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized database access or manipulation.

**Impact:** Database compromise, data exfiltration, unauthorized data modification, potential for arbitrary code execution on the database server.

**Affected Component:** The interface between the application and `pgvector`, specifically the parsing and execution of SQL queries involving vector operations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Crucially, use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions involving `pgvector`'s functions.** This prevents user input from being interpreted as executable code.
*   Implement strict input validation on vector data and any parameters used in similarity searches, ensuring they conform to expected formats and ranges.
*   Follow secure coding practices to avoid constructing SQL queries dynamically from user input.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `pgvector` Extension](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__pgvector__extension.md)

**Description:** The `pgvector` extension itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities in its code. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they can interact with the extension through the application or directly within the database.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution within the database context, data corruption, denial of service, or privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** The core code and functionality of the `pgvector` extension.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep the `pgvector` extension updated to the latest stable version.** This ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched.
*   Monitor security advisories and release notes for `pgvector` for any reported vulnerabilities.
*   Follow security best practices for managing PostgreSQL extensions.
