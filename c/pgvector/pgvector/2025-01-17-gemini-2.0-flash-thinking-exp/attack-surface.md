# Attack Surface Analysis for pgvector/pgvector

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Vector Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_vector_data_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects crafted or malicious vector data directly into columns managed by `pgvector`.
    * **How pgvector Contributes:** `pgvector` provides the data types and indexing mechanisms to store and query vector embeddings. Lack of validation before storing data in `pgvector`'s data types makes this possible.
    * **Example:** An attacker inserts a user profile with a manipulated vector embedding designed to cause excessive resource consumption during indexing or querying by `pgvector`.
    * **Impact:** Skewed similarity search results, resource exhaustion due to large or complex vectors impacting `pgvector`'s indexing and query performance, potential exploitation of underlying indexing algorithm vulnerabilities within `pgvector`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation (at the pgvector level):**  Implement validation checks *before* inserting data into `pgvector`'s vector columns to ensure dimensions and values are within acceptable ranges.
        * **Resource Limits:** Configure PostgreSQL resource limits to prevent a single malicious insertion from overwhelming the system.

## Attack Surface: [Similarity Search Query Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/similarity_search_query_manipulation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker manipulates the vector used directly within a `pgvector` similarity search query.
    * **How pgvector Contributes:** `pgvector`'s core functionality is performing similarity searches using provided vectors. If the application allows user-controlled data to directly influence the search vector without sanitization, it's a `pgvector`-specific risk.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a search query with a vector designed to bypass intended filtering logic within `pgvector`'s search, potentially retrieving sensitive information.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure by retrieving unintended data through `pgvector`'s similarity search, potential Denial of Service (DoS) by submitting computationally expensive queries directly to `pgvector`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Parameterized Queries (for vector inputs):**  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements where the search vector itself is treated as a parameter, preventing direct injection of arbitrary vector values into the `pgvector` search.
        * **Input Validation (for search vectors):** Validate and sanitize any user input that is used to construct the search vector passed to `pgvector`.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Distance Function Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_distance_function_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  A vulnerability exists within the implementation of the distance functions (e.g., Euclidean, Cosine, Inner Product) provided directly by the `pgvector` extension.
    * **How pgvector Contributes:** `pgvector` provides these distance functions as integral parts of its similarity search capabilities. Bugs within these functions are direct `pgvector` vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A crafted vector pair, when used with a specific vulnerable distance function in a `pgvector` query, triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue within the `pgvector` extension's code.
    * **Impact:** Database crash, potential remote code execution on the database server due to a flaw in `pgvector`'s code.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep pgvector Updated:** Regularly update the `pgvector` extension to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches addressing vulnerabilities in its distance functions.
        * **Monitor for Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any reported vulnerabilities specifically affecting `pgvector`'s distance function implementations.

## Attack Surface: [Extension Management and Installation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/extension_management_and_installation_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to the installation, updating, or management of the `pgvector` extension itself.
    * **How pgvector Contributes:** `pgvector` is a PostgreSQL extension, and vulnerabilities in how extensions are handled by PostgreSQL or in `pgvector`'s installation scripts are direct risks.
    * **Example:** Exploiting a flaw in `pgvector`'s installation script to execute arbitrary code with database server privileges during the installation process.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the database server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Install from Trusted Sources:** Only install `pgvector` from official PostgreSQL extension repositories or trusted, verified sources.
        * **Secure Installation Procedures:** Follow secure procedures for installing and managing PostgreSQL extensions, ensuring appropriate permissions are set and installation processes are audited.
        * **Regular Auditing of Extensions:** Periodically review the installed extensions, including `pgvector`, and their sources.

## Attack Surface: [Version-Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/version-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  Specific versions of the `pgvector` extension contain known security vulnerabilities within its code.
    * **How pgvector Contributes:**  As with any software, vulnerabilities can be discovered in the `pgvector` codebase itself.
    * **Example:** A publicly disclosed vulnerability in a specific version of `pgvector` allows for remote code execution through a crafted similarity search query.
    * **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution directly within the `pgvector` extension.
    * **Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep pgvector Updated:**  Regularly update `pgvector` to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor for announcements specifically related to `pgvector` vulnerabilities.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Periodically scan the database environment for known vulnerabilities in the installed `pgvector` extension.
