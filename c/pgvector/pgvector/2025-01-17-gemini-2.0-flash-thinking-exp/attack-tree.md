## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploiting Memory Safety Issues leading to Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploiting_memory_safety_issues_leading_to_code_execution.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting low-level vulnerabilities within the pgvector extension itself, specifically related to how it manages memory.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit pgvector Internals:** The attacker's initial goal is to find weaknesses within the pgvector codebase.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Memory Safety Issues:** The attacker targets common memory management errors in C code.
*   **Critical Node: Trigger Buffer Overflow in Vector Operations:**
    *   **Attack Description:** The attacker crafts malicious vector data, such as extremely long vectors or vectors with specific patterns, that exceed the allocated buffer size during insertion or querying operations within pgvector's C code.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation can overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially corrupting data, crashing the PostgreSQL server, or, most critically, allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code within the context of the database server process. This grants the attacker complete control over the database and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: SQL Injection through Improper Vector Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_sql_injection_through_improper_vector_data_handling.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path exploits vulnerabilities in how the application interacts with pgvector, specifically when constructing SQL queries that include vector data.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Application's Interaction with pgvector:** The attacker focuses on the interface between the application code and the pgvector extension.
*   **Critical Node: SQL Injection through Vector Data Handling:** The attacker identifies that the application is dynamically building SQL queries using vector data without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious SQL in Application Logic:**
    *   **Attack Description:** The attacker crafts malicious input within the vector data that, when incorporated into the dynamically generated SQL query, injects unintended SQL commands. For example, a vector value could contain strings like `'); DROP TABLE users; --`.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Successful SQL injection can allow the attacker to bypass authentication, read sensitive data from other tables, modify or delete data, or even execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to complete database compromise and potentially allowing further exploitation of the application or the underlying system.
