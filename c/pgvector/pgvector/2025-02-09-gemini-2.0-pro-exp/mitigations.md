# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pgvector/pgvector

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Vector Dimensionality](./mitigation_strategies/limit_vector_dimensionality.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Analysis:** Before storing vectors, analyze data and determine the minimum dimensionality needed.
    2.  **Dimensionality Reduction:** If needed, apply dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, Truncated SVD, Autoencoders) *before* storing vectors in the `pgvector` column.
    3.  **Documentation and Enforcement:** Document the maximum dimensionality and enforce it. Reject vectors exceeding this limit. This might involve application-level checks or database triggers (though the trigger itself isn't *purely* `pgvector`).
    4.  **Monitoring:** Monitor the distribution of vector dimensionalities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** High dimensionality increases `pgvector`'s computational cost.
    *   **Data Leakage/Inference Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Lower dimensionality *indirectly* reduces risk.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces `pgvector`'s computational burden. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Data Leakage:** Minor indirect reduction. Risk reduction: Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Dimensionality reduction (PCA) is used before storing vectors. Maximum dimensionality of 128 is enforced in application code.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: No database-level trigger to enforce dimensionality (though this is borderline, as triggers aren't *purely* `pgvector`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Index Tuning and Selection](./mitigation_strategies/index_tuning_and_selection.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Understand Index Types:** Understand `pgvector`'s index types:
        *   **IVFFlat:** Partitions vectors into clusters. Faster for smaller datasets. Use the `lists` parameter.
        *   **HNSW:** Hierarchical navigable small world graph. Faster for larger datasets. Use `m` and `ef_construction` parameters.
    2.  **Experimentation:** Experiment with different `pgvector` index types and their specific parameters.
    3.  **Performance Analysis:** Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` with your `pgvector` similarity search queries to analyze performance.
    4.  **Regular Maintenance:** For IVFFlat, use `REINDEX` periodically. HNSW generally needs less maintenance.
    5. **Monitoring:** Monitor index size and build time.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Properly tuned `pgvector` indexes improve query performance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Significant reduction in `pgvector` query execution time. Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: HNSW index is used with `m=16` and `ef_construction=64`. `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` is used regularly.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: No automated re-evaluation of `pgvector` index parameters.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Number of Returned Results](./mitigation_strategies/limit_number_of_returned_results.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Always use `LIMIT`:** Enforce the use of the `LIMIT` clause in all SQL queries using `pgvector`'s similarity search operators (`<->`, `<=>`, `<#>`).
    2.  **Application-Level Enforcement:** (Borderline - included for completeness, but primarily application logic) Implement checks to ensure `LIMIT` is used and doesn't exceed a maximum.
    3.  **Default `LIMIT`:** (Borderline) Apply a default `LIMIT` if the user doesn't provide one.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Reduces data processed and transmitted by `pgvector`.
    *   **Data Leakage/Inference Attacks (Severity: Low):** Reduces information exposed by `pgvector`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Moderate reduction in `pgvector` resource usage. Risk reduction: Medium.
    *   **Data Leakage:** Minor reduction. Risk reduction: Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Application checks enforce a maximum `LIMIT` of 100. A default `LIMIT` of 10 is applied.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: No database-level enforcement of `LIMIT` (again, borderline).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Index Validation (if available)](./mitigation_strategies/index_validation__if_available_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Check for Validation Utilities:** Check if `pgvector` (or future versions) provides utilities for validating index integrity.
    2.  **Regular Execution:** If available, run these `pgvector` utilities periodically.
    3.  **Automated Scheduling:** Automate the execution of `pgvector`'s validation checks.
    4.  **Alerting:** Configure alerts for any validation errors reported by `pgvector`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Index Corruption/Data Integrity (Severity: High):** Directly checks for `pgvector` index corruption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Index Corruption:** Early detection via `pgvector`'s tools. Risk reduction: High (if available).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Not applicable; `pgvector` currently lacks a dedicated validation utility.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Entirely dependent on future `pgvector` features.
