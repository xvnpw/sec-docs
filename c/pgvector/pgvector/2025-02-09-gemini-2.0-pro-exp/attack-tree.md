## Attack Tree Path: [1. Unauthorized Data Access (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1__unauthorized_data_access__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.1 SQL Injection via pgvector Functions:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how pgvector functions handle user-supplied input to inject malicious SQL code. This is the most critical threat due to its potential for high impact.
    *   **1.1.1 Improper Input Validation in pgvector Functions [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** pgvector functions, such as those for distance calculations or nearest neighbor searches, may not properly sanitize input data (vectors, parameters). This allows an attacker to embed SQL commands within seemingly legitimate input.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
        *   **Example:**
            *   Attacker provides a crafted vector input that includes SQL code within a string parameter expected to be a numerical value.
            *   The pgvector function, lacking proper validation, incorporates this string directly into a SQL query.
            *   The injected SQL code executes, potentially allowing the attacker to read data from other tables, modify data, or even execute operating system commands (depending on database privileges).
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation *before* passing data to pgvector functions. Check data types, lengths, formats, and allowed characters.
            *   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** *Always* use parameterized queries. This prevents the database from interpreting user input as SQL code.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the database user only the minimum necessary permissions.
            *   **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Use PostgreSQL's RLS policies to further restrict data access based on user roles and attributes.
            *   **Fuzz Testing:** Test pgvector functions with a wide range of malformed and unexpected inputs to identify potential vulnerabilities.
            *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block common SQL injection patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **3.1 Resource Exhaustion:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts queries that consume excessive database resources (CPU, memory, I/O), leading to performance degradation or complete unavailability of the application.
    *   **3.1.1 Excessive Distance Calculations:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends queries that trigger a large number of computationally expensive distance calculations between high-dimensional vectors.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
        *   **Example:**
            *   Attacker repeatedly sends nearest neighbor search queries with very large `k` values (requesting many neighbors) or using a distance metric that is particularly computationally intensive.
            *   The database server becomes overwhelmed by the calculations, slowing down or crashing.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of pgvector function calls per user or IP address within a given time period.
            *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU, memory, and I/O usage. Set alerts for unusual spikes.
            *   **Query Timeouts:** Set timeouts to prevent long-running queries from monopolizing resources.
            *   **Input Validation (Limit `k`):** Restrict the maximum value of parameters like `k` in nearest neighbor searches.
            *   **Connection Limits:** Limit the number of concurrent database connections.

    *   **3.1.2 Triggering Complex Queries:**
        *   **Description:** Similar to 3.1.1, but the attacker exploits other complex operations within pgvector, such as index building or traversal, to consume resources.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
        *   **Example:**
            *   Attacker triggers the creation of a very large index on a table with a huge number of vectors, potentially exhausting disk space or memory.
            *   Attacker crafts queries that force the database to traverse a very large and complex index structure.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Rate Limiting:** (Same as 3.1.1)
            *   **Resource Monitoring:** (Same as 3.1.1)
            *   **Query Timeouts:** (Same as 3.1.1)
            *   **Careful Index Design:** Optimize index creation and maintenance. Avoid creating unnecessarily large or complex indexes.
            *   **Analyze Query Plans:** Use `EXPLAIN` to understand the execution plan of queries and identify potential performance bottlenecks.
