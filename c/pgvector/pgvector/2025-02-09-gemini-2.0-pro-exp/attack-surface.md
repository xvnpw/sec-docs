# Attack Surface Analysis for pgvector/pgvector

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Computationally Expensive Queries](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_computationally_expensive_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts queries that consume excessive CPU and memory resources, making the database unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **pgvector Contribution:** `pgvector` provides functions and operators (distance calculations) that can be computationally intensive, especially with high-dimensional vectors or large datasets.
*   **Example:**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <=> '[1,2,3,...]' LIMIT 10000000; -- No reasonable limit, forces full scan and distance calculation
    ```
    (Where `embedding` is a high-dimensional vector column, and the table `items` is very large, and no index is used).  Or, a query with a complex `WHERE` clause that prevents index usage.
*   **Impact:** Database unavailability, application downtime.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Query Timeouts:** Enforce short `statement_timeout` values in PostgreSQL to kill long-running queries.  (e.g., `SET statement_timeout = '5s';`)
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure PostgreSQL resource limits (`work_mem`, `max_connections`) to prevent individual queries from consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Careful Indexing:** Create appropriate IVFFlat or HNSW indexes and ensure queries are written to utilize them (use `EXPLAIN` to verify).
    *   **Avoid `ORDER BY` without `LIMIT`:**  Never use distance operators in `ORDER BY` without a reasonable `LIMIT` clause.

## Attack Surface: [Index Corruption (Data Integrity/DoS)](./attack_surfaces/index_corruption__data_integritydos_.md)

*   **Description:**  A bug in the `pgvector` index implementation allows an attacker to craft input that corrupts the index, leading to incorrect results or database crashes.
*   **pgvector Contribution:** `pgvector` introduces custom index types (IVFFlat, HNSW) with their own internal logic.
*   **Example:**  This is highly dependent on the specific bug, but could involve inserting vectors with specific values or sequences of operations that trigger an edge case in the index code.  This is *unlikely* but possible.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect query results, data loss, database crashes, potential denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (but low probability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay Updated:**  *Always* use the latest stable version of `pgvector` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches. This is the *primary* mitigation.
    *   **Report Bugs:** If you encounter any suspected index corruption, report it to the `pgvector` developers immediately.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection (Remote Code Execution)](./attack_surfaces/code_injection__remote_code_execution_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in the `pgvector` C code (e.g., buffer overflow) allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code within the PostgreSQL backend process.
*   **pgvector Contribution:** `pgvector` is implemented in C, introducing the possibility of memory safety vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  This would require a specific, exploitable vulnerability in the `pgvector` code.  An attacker might send a specially crafted vector that triggers a buffer overflow when processed by a `pgvector` function.  This is *highly unlikely* in well-vetted code.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft, data destruction.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (but very low probability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay Updated:**  *Always* use the latest stable version of `pgvector`. This is the *most critical* mitigation.
    *   **Code Auditing (pgvector Developers):**  The `pgvector` developers should conduct regular security audits and code reviews.
    *   **Fuzzing (pgvector Developers):** The `pgvector` developers should use fuzzing techniques to test the extension with a wide range of inputs.
