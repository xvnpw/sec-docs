# Threat Model Analysis for pgvector/pgvector

## Threat: [Dimensionality Exhaustion Denial of Service](./threats/dimensionality_exhaustion_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Threat:**  Dimensionality Exhaustion Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker submits queries or inserts data with excessively high-dimensional vectors.  The attacker might repeatedly send such requests, aiming to consume all available memory or CPU resources on the database server. This directly exploits how `pgvector` handles vector data and its indexing/search algorithms.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of service (DoS) for all database users.  The database server becomes unresponsive, and legitimate requests cannot be processed.  Potential data loss if the server crashes unexpectedly.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `pgvector` indexing (e.g., IVFFlat, HNSW) and search functions (e.g., `<=>`, `<->`, `<#>`). Memory allocation routines within `pgvector` and PostgreSQL.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Application-Level Validation:**  Enforce a strict maximum vector dimension limit *before* data reaches the database.  Reject any input exceeding this limit.
        *   **Rate Limiting:**  Limit the rate of vector insertions and search queries, especially for unauthenticated or low-trust users.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:**  Implement monitoring of CPU, memory, and disk I/O usage related to `pgvector` operations.  Set alerts for unusual spikes.
        *   **Connection Pooling & Timeouts:** Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.  Set appropriate query timeouts to prevent long-running, resource-intensive queries from blocking other operations.
        *   **Load Testing:** Conduct thorough load testing with high-dimensional vectors to determine the system's limits and refine the dimension and rate limits.

## Threat: [Massive Vector Insertion Denial of Service](./threats/massive_vector_insertion_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Threat:**  Massive Vector Insertion Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker submits a very large number of vectors in a single query or a rapid series of insert operations, even if the individual vectors are of a reasonable dimension.  The goal is to overwhelm the database's ability to process and index the data, directly impacting `pgvector`'s indexing mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS).  Slowdown or complete unresponsiveness of the database.  Potential disk space exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Component:** `pgvector` indexing (IVFFlat, HNSW), insert operations, and potentially the underlying PostgreSQL storage engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:**  Strictly limit the rate of vector insertions, particularly for unauthenticated or low-trust users.  Implement both short-term and long-term rate limits.
        *   **Batch Size Limits:**  Enforce limits on the number of vectors that can be inserted in a single transaction or batch operation.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor database resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, disk space) and set alerts for unusual activity.
        *   **Connection Pooling & Timeouts:**  Use connection pooling and query timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   **Asynchronous Processing:** For large uploads, consider using asynchronous processing (e.g., a message queue) to handle vector insertion in the background, preventing the main application from being blocked.

## Threat: [`pgvector` Code Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/_pgvector__code_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:**  `pgvector` Code Vulnerability Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a bug in the `pgvector` extension's code (e.g., a buffer overflow, integer overflow, or logic error).  The attacker crafts a malicious query or input that triggers the vulnerability, directly targeting the `pgvector` code.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution within the PostgreSQL process.  Data corruption or loss.  Denial of service.  Complete database compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The specific vulnerable code within the `pgvector` extension (could be in any part of the extension, depending on the bug).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Updated:**  Install the latest version of `pgvector` and apply security updates promptly.
        *   **Security Advisories:**  Monitor security advisories related to `pgvector` and PostgreSQL.
        *   **Code Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the PostgreSQL installation, including the `pgvector` extension.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to test `pgvector` and identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Reporting:**  If you discover a vulnerability, report it responsibly to the `pgvector` maintainers.

## Threat: [Index Corruption](./threats/index_corruption.md)

*   **Threat:** Index Corruption
    *   **Description:** The index used by `pgvector` (IVFFlat or HNSW) becomes corrupted due to hardware failure, software bugs, power outages, or potentially a malicious attack targeting the index files. This directly affects `pgvector`'s indexing functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect search results. Database crashes. Potential data loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `pgvector` index (IVFFlat or HNSW).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Backups:** Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy for the entire database, including the indexes.
        *   **Hardware Monitoring:** Monitor the health of the database server's hardware (disk, memory, etc.).
        *   **`REINDEX`:** Periodically use the `REINDEX` command in PostgreSQL to rebuild the `pgvector` indexes. This can be scheduled as a routine maintenance task.
        *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in the application to gracefully handle potential index corruption errors.
        *   **Filesystem Checks:** Regularly run filesystem checks (e.g., `fsck` on Linux) to detect and repair any underlying filesystem corruption.
