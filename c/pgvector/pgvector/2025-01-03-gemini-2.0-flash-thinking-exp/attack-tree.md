## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection in Vector Operations [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_in_vector_operations__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Target:** Input fields used to construct vector embeddings for querying.
    *   **Method:** Inject malicious SQL code within the vector embedding string or related parameters. For example, if the application constructs a query like `SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[user_provided_vector]' LIMIT 1;`, an attacker might inject something like `[1,1]'; DROP TABLE items; --'`.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration (retrieving sensitive data), data modification (altering or deleting data), or denial of service (disrupting application availability).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Significant
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements for all vector operations. Sanitize any input used in the construction of vector embeddings to remove or escape potentially malicious characters.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection via Vector Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/injection_via_vector_data__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Target:** Application logic that processes or displays data retrieved based on vector similarity.
    *   **Method:** Inject malicious content (e.g., script tags for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), HTML for content injection) into the data used to generate vector embeddings. When a similarity search retrieves data associated with these malicious vectors, the injected content is executed or displayed in a user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks (allowing attackers to execute malicious scripts in other users' browsers), or other forms of injection vulnerabilities leading to unintended content display or actions.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Moderate
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement proper output encoding and sanitization for all data retrieved based on vector similarity before displaying it to users. Follow secure coding practices for data handling, treating all retrieved data as potentially untrusted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Size or Format Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/size_or_format_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Target:** The storage or processing mechanisms for vector data within the database and application.
    *   **Method:** Provide excessively large vector embeddings (exceeding expected dimensions or storage limits) or malformed vector embeddings (in an unexpected format or with invalid data types). This can lead to buffer overflows, memory exhaustion, or other resource exhaustion issues.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (crashing the database or application), or potentially remote code execution if underlying vulnerabilities in the processing or storage mechanisms exist.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Significant
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict validation of vector data size and format *before* storing it in the database. Enforce limits on the dimensions of vector embeddings that can be accepted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Access Controls on Vector Data [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_access_controls_on_vector_data__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Target:** Direct access to the PostgreSQL database and the pgvector extension, bypassing the application's intended access logic.
    *   **Method:** Gain unauthorized access to the database (e.g., through compromised credentials, SQL injection in other parts of the application, or network vulnerabilities) and directly manipulate or retrieve vector data. This could involve reading sensitive embeddings, modifying them to alter search results, or deleting them entirely.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (exposure of sensitive vector data or data linked to the vectors), data manipulation (altering the vector representations and thus the application's behavior), or denial of service (deleting critical vector data).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust database access controls, adhering to the principle of least privilege. Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for database access. Implement network segmentation to restrict access to the database server. Regularly review and audit database permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in pgvector Extension Itself [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_pgvector_extension_itself__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Target:** The pgvector extension code itself.
    *   **Method:** Exploit known vulnerabilities (publicly disclosed security flaws) or zero-day vulnerabilities (previously unknown flaws) within the pgvector extension code. This would require a deep understanding of the extension's implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution on the database server (allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands), data corruption, or denial of service.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Difficult
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep the pgvector extension updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. Monitor security advisories and apply patches promptly. If feasible, consider using static analysis tools on the extension code or engaging security experts for code review.
