# Threat Model Analysis for pgvector/pgvector

## Threat: [Vector Tampering](./threats/vector_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the database directly modifies the values within the `vector` column, a data type provided by `pgvector`. This could involve changing the magnitude or direction of the vectors to misrepresent the underlying data. They might achieve this through compromised database credentials or an SQL injection vulnerability that allows arbitrary SQL execution affecting `pgvector` data.

**Impact:** Incorrect similarity search results, leading to flawed recommendations, inaccurate data retrieval, or compromised application logic that relies on `pgvector`'s vector similarity. This could also be used to subtly bias search results over time.

**Affected Component:** `pgvector`'s `vector` data type, database storage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong database access controls and the principle of least privilege.
* Utilize database auditing to track modifications to `pgvector` data.
* Consider data integrity checks or checksums for vector data (though this can be complex for floating-point vectors).
* Secure all application endpoints to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities that could target `pgvector` data.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `pgvector` Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__pgvector__itself.md)

**Description:** `pgvector`'s code itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to various issues, including arbitrary code execution within the PostgreSQL server context, denial of service by crashing or overloading `pgvector` functions, or data corruption within `pgvector`'s data structures.

**Impact:** Complete database compromise, data breaches affecting all data including vector embeddings, application downtime due to `pgvector` failures or database crashes.

**Affected Component:** All `pgvector` modules and functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay up-to-date with the latest `pgvector` releases and security patches.
* Monitor the `pgvector` GitHub repository and PostgreSQL security mailing lists for any reported vulnerabilities or security advisories related to `pgvector`.
* Follow secure coding practices if contributing to or extending `pgvector`.
* Consider using static analysis security testing (SAST) tools on the `pgvector` codebase if possible.
