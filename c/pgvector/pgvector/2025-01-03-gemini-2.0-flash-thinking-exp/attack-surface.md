# Attack Surface Analysis for pgvector/pgvector

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection in Vector Operations](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_in_vector_operations.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into queries that involve `pgvector` functions or operators.
    *   **How pgvector Contributes:**  `pgvector` introduces new functions and operators (e.g., `::`, `<->`, `<#>`) that can be targets for injection if queries are built dynamically without proper sanitization. The complexity of vector operations might make it less obvious where injection points exist.
    *   **Example:**  Imagine an application searching for similar vectors based on user input. A vulnerable query might look like: `SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[{user_provided_vector}]'::vector LIMIT 5;`. An attacker could input `']::vector; DROP TABLE items; --'` to execute arbitrary SQL.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration of vector embeddings or other sensitive data, modification of vector data, potentially leading to manipulation of application logic, or even full database compromise through arbitrary command execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when working with vector data and operations to ensure user-provided input is treated as data, not executable code.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize any user input that contributes to vector values or is used in vector-related queries. While directly sanitizing vector data can be complex, ensure that surrounding data used in the query is safe.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of pgvector Function/Operator Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_pgvector_functionoperator_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs or vulnerabilities exist within the C code implementation of `pgvector`'s functions or operators.
    *   **How pgvector Contributes:**  `pgvector` adds custom C code to PostgreSQL. Any vulnerabilities in this code (e.g., buffer overflows, memory corruption) could be exploited.
    *   **Example:**  A hypothetical buffer overflow in the `vector_distance` function could be triggered by providing extremely large vectors, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (database crash), potential for arbitrary code execution on the PostgreSQL server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep pgvector Updated:** Regularly update the `pgvector` extension to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   **Monitor for Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any security advisories or known vulnerabilities related to `pgvector`.
        *   **Consider Source Code Audits:** For high-security environments, consider performing or commissioning security audits of the `pgvector` source code.
