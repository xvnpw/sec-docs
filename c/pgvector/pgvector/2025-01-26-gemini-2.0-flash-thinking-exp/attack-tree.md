## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application Using pgvector [ROOT NODE - CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_using_pgvector__root_node_-_critical_.md)

* **Goal:** The attacker's ultimate objective is to compromise the application.
    * **Criticality:** Root node, representing the overall security objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit pgvector Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_pgvector_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Goal:** Exploit weaknesses specifically within the pgvector extension to compromise the application.
    * **Criticality:** Main path focusing on pgvector-related threats.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__sql_injection_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Goal:** Inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database and application.
    * **High-Risk Path:** SQL injection is a common and highly impactful vulnerability.
    * **Criticality:**  A major category of attacks with severe consequences.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **3.1. Vector Data Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL within vector data itself or associated metadata.
            * **3.1.1. [1.1.1.a] Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Application Logic [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                - **Likelihood:** Medium-High
                - **Impact:** High (Data Breach, Application Compromise)
                - **Effort:** Low-Medium
                - **Skill Level:** Medium
                - **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                - **Breakdown:** If the application doesn't properly sanitize vector data before constructing SQL queries, an attacker can inject SQL code within the vector data itself. This code will then be executed by the database when the vector is inserted or updated.
            * **3.1.2. [1.1.2.a] Exploit Lack of Sanitization in Metadata Handling [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                - **Likelihood:** Medium
                - **Impact:** High (Data Breach, Application Compromise)
                - **Effort:** Low-Medium
                - **Skill Level:** Medium
                - **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                - **Breakdown:** If the application stores metadata related to vectors and uses this metadata in SQL queries without sanitization, an attacker can inject SQL code within the metadata.
        * **3.2. Search Query Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL within parameters used for similarity searches.
            * **3.2.1. [1.2.1.a] Exploit Lack of Parameterized Queries in Application [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                - **Likelihood:** High
                - **Impact:** High (Data Breach, Application Compromise)
                - **Effort:** Low
                - **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
                - **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                - **Breakdown:** If the application constructs SQL queries for similarity searches by directly concatenating user-provided search parameters (like the target vector or distance thresholds) instead of using parameterized queries, it becomes vulnerable to SQL injection. Attackers can inject SQL code within these parameters.
            * **3.2.2. [1.2.2.a] Exploit Lack of Sanitization in Distance Function Input [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Depends on Application Complexity)
                - **Impact:** High (Data Breach, Application Compromise)
                - **Effort:** Medium
                - **Skill Level:** Medium
                - **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                - **Breakdown:** If the application allows users to customize or provide arguments to distance functions used in similarity searches and doesn't sanitize these inputs, SQL injection might be possible within the distance function context.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Data Leakage/Information Disclosure [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__data_leakageinformation_disclosure__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive vector data or information related to it.
    * **High-Risk Path:** Data breaches are a major security concern.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **4.1. Unauthorized Vector Data Access [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **4.1.1. [3.1.1] Exploit Lack of Proper Database Access Controls [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                - **Goal:** Bypass database access controls to directly access vector data.
                - **High-Risk Path:** Weak access controls are a fundamental vulnerability.
                - **Criticality:** Access control is essential for data protection.
                - **Attack Vectors:**
                    * **4.1.1.1. [3.1.1.a] Gain Access to Database Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                        - **Likelihood:** Medium (Phishing, Credential Stuffing, Misconfiguration)
                        - **Impact:** High (Data Breach, Full Database Access)
                        - **Effort:** Low-Medium (Depending on Security Posture)
                        - **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
                        - **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Security Auditing, Access Logs)
                        - **Breakdown:** Attackers can attempt to obtain database credentials through various methods like phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting misconfigurations. Once they have valid credentials, they can bypass application-level security and directly access the database, including vector data.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Supply Chain Attacks (Less pgvector Specific, but relevant) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__supply_chain_attacks__less_pgvector_specific__but_relevant___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Goal:** Compromise the application by compromising the pgvector extension itself during installation.
    * **High-Risk Path:** Supply chain attacks can have widespread and severe impact.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **5.1. Compromise pgvector Distribution [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **5.1.1. [5.1.1] Install Malicious pgvector Extension from Untrusted Source [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                - **Goal:** Trick the application administrator into installing a malicious version of pgvector.
                - **High-Risk Path:** User error in choosing sources can lead to malware installation.
                - **Criticality:** Compromising the extension itself is a critical supply chain attack.
                - **Attack Vectors:**
                    * **5.1.1.1. [5.1.1.a] Download pgvector from Unofficial Repositories [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                        - **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (User Error, Lack of Awareness)
                        - **Impact:** Critical (Full System Compromise)
                        - **Effort:** Low
                        - **Skill Level:** Low
                        - **Detection Difficulty:** Low (If not verifying sources) - Medium (If monitoring package installations)
                        - **Breakdown:** If the application administrator downloads and installs pgvector from unofficial or untrusted sources instead of the official pgvector GitHub repository or trusted package repositories, they risk installing a compromised version of the extension. This malicious extension could contain backdoors or vulnerabilities that allow attackers to fully compromise the system.
