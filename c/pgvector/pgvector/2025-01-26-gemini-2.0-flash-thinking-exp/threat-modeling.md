# Threat Model Analysis for pgvector/pgvector

## Threat: [Malicious Vector Injection](./threats/malicious_vector_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts and injects malicious vector embeddings into the database. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in input validation or SQL injection points in application code that handles vector data insertion or updates. The attacker might manipulate input fields or API parameters to insert vectors that are designed to skew search results or degrade performance.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Corruption: Inaccurate similarity search results.
    *   Performance Degradation: Slowed down or unresponsive similarity searches.
    *   Bias in Search Results: Manipulated search outcomes favoring attacker's objectives.
*   **Affected pgvector component:**
    *   `pgvector` module (specifically functions handling vector insertion and updates).
    *   Database tables storing vector data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Input Validation: Rigorously validate and sanitize all input data used to create or update vector embeddings before database insertion.
    *   Parameterized Queries/ORMs: Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities when working with vector data.
    *   Access Control: Implement role-based access control to restrict who can insert or modify vector data in the database.
    *   Data Type Enforcement: Ensure strict data type enforcement for vector columns to prevent unexpected data formats.

## Threat: [Similarity Search Denial of Service](./threats/similarity_search_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the system with a large volume of similarity search requests, especially with complex or high-dimensional vectors. This overwhelms the database server's resources (CPU, memory, I/O), making it unresponsive and causing a denial of service for legitimate users. The attacker might automate sending numerous search requests from multiple sources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Service Unavailability: Application becomes inaccessible due to database overload.
    *   Performance Degradation: Slow response times for all users, even legitimate ones.
*   **Affected pgvector component:**
    *   `pgvector` module (similarity search functions).
    *   PostgreSQL database server resources (CPU, memory, I/O).
    *   Vector indexes (IVFFlat, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rate Limiting: Implement strict rate limiting on similarity search queries based on user, IP address, or other criteria.
    *   Query Optimization: Optimize vector indexing (e.g., using appropriate IVFFlat parameters) and database configurations for efficient similarity searches.
    *   Resource Monitoring and Alerting: Monitor database server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes.
    *   Query Complexity Limits: Limit the complexity or dimensionality of vectors allowed in search queries if feasible.
    *   Caching: Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed similarity search results.
    *   Connection Limits: Configure PostgreSQL connection limits to prevent resource exhaustion from excessive connections.

## Threat: [`pgvector` Extension Vulnerabilities](./threats/_pgvector__extension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered or unpatched security vulnerabilities within the `pgvector` extension code itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause database crashes, or compromise data integrity. Exploitation might involve crafted SQL queries or specific input data that triggers a vulnerability in the extension's C code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach: Potential access to or modification of sensitive vector data.
    *   Denial of Service: Database crashes or instability.
    *   Privilege Escalation: Potential for attackers to gain elevated privileges within the database system.
*   **Affected pgvector component:**
    *   `pgvector` extension module (C code and SQL functions).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if vulnerabilities are severe and easily exploitable)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `pgvector` Updated: Regularly update `pgvector` to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor Security Advisories: Subscribe to PostgreSQL and `pgvector` security mailing lists or advisories.
    *   Vulnerability Scanning: Use database vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential weaknesses.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Run PostgreSQL with least privilege, limiting database user permissions.
    *   Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits of the database and application environment.
