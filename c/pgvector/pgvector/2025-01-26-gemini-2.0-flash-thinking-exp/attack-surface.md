# Attack Surface Analysis for pgvector/pgvector

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Vector Operations](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities_in_vector_operations.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through input fields used to construct vector operations within database queries. This leads to unauthorized data access, modification, or database compromise by exploiting how `pgvector` operators are used in SQL.
*   **pgvector Contribution:** `pgvector` introduces new operators (e.g., `<->`, `<#>`) for vector similarity searches.  If user-controlled input is directly incorporated into these operations without proper sanitization, it creates a direct pathway for SQL injection attacks specifically targeting `pgvector` functionality.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to search for similar items. The application dynamically builds a SQL query using user input to define the search vector: `SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[user_provided_vector]' LIMIT 10;`.  If `user_provided_vector` is not sanitized, an attacker could inject SQL like `'; DELETE FROM items; --'` leading to data loss.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored as vectors or related to vector data.
    *   Data Modification/Deletion: Corruption or loss of critical information, including vector embeddings and associated data.
    *   Database Compromise: Potential for full database takeover in severe cases, exploiting vulnerabilities through injected SQL executed within `pgvector` context.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Mandatory use of parameterized queries or prepared statements for all SQL queries involving `pgvector` operators and functions. This ensures user input is treated as data, not executable code, preventing SQL injection.
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to ensure user-provided data intended for vector operations conforms to expected formats and dimensions. While parameterized queries are primary defense, validation adds a layer of defense-in-depth.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious queries that intentionally consume excessive database resources (CPU, memory, I/O) by exploiting the computational intensity of `pgvector`'s similarity search operations. This leads to performance degradation or service unavailability for legitimate users.
*   **pgvector Contribution:** `pgvector`'s core functionality is similarity search, which can be resource-intensive, especially with large datasets and high-dimensional vectors.  Unbounded or poorly controlled similarity searches, facilitated by `pgvector` functions, become a direct vector for DoS attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly sends search requests with extremely broad or unbounded similarity searches against a large vector dataset using `pgvector` operators.  For instance, querying for all vectors within a very large distance of a given vector without result limits. This can overwhelm the database server, making it unresponsive to legitimate requests.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Service Disruption: Application becomes slow or completely unavailable, impacting user experience and business operations.
    *   Resource Starvation: Database server resources are exhausted, potentially affecting other applications sharing the same database instance.
    *   Financial Loss: Downtime and performance degradation can lead to financial losses and reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Limits and Pagination:** Implement strict limits on the number of results returned by `pgvector` similarity searches. Use pagination to control the amount of data processed and returned per request, preventing unbounded resource consumption.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Continuously monitor database resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O) and set up alerts to detect unusual spikes indicative of potential DoS attacks targeting `pgvector` operations.
    *   **Query Optimization and Indexing:** Optimize vector indexes (e.g., using appropriate index types like IVFFlat) and query structures to improve search performance and minimize resource consumption for `pgvector` operations.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints that trigger `pgvector` similarity searches to restrict the frequency of requests from individual users or IP addresses, mitigating rapid-fire DoS attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Extension-Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/extension-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered security vulnerabilities may exist within the `pgvector` extension's code itself. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to database compromise, bypassing security mechanisms inherent to `pgvector`'s implementation.
*   **pgvector Contribution:** As a custom PostgreSQL extension written in C, `pgvector` introduces a new code base into the database server. This code, while generally well-maintained, could contain unforeseen vulnerabilities specific to its vector operations and data handling.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical buffer overflow vulnerability in `pgvector`'s C code during vector distance calculations could be triggered by providing specially crafted vector data. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the database server, directly exploiting a flaw within the `pgvector` extension itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Database Compromise: Unauthorized access, data breach, data modification, or denial of service resulting from exploiting a vulnerability in `pgvector`'s code.
    *   System Compromise: In critical scenarios, potential for arbitrary code execution on the database server host, gaining complete control over the database system.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the nature and exploitability of the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep pgvector Updated:**  Crucially, always use the latest stable version of `pgvector`. Regularly update to benefit from security patches and bug fixes released by the `pgvector` maintainers. Monitor the official `pgvector` GitHub repository for security advisories and updates.
    *   **Security Audits (For High-Security Environments):** For applications with stringent security requirements, consider periodic security audits of the `pgvector` extension code by qualified security professionals to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use Reputable Sources:** Obtain `pgvector` from trusted sources like the official GitHub repository or official package repositories to minimize the risk of using tampered or malicious versions. Verify checksums when possible.
    *   **PostgreSQL Security Best Practices:** Adhere to general PostgreSQL security best practices, as these provide a foundational security posture that can limit the impact of any extension-specific vulnerabilities.
