# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/httpd

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting discrepancies in how httpd and backend servers parse HTTP requests with ambiguous `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers. This allows attackers to inject requests into other users' connections.
    *   **How httpd Contributes:**  Vulnerabilities in httpd's parsing logic or its interaction with proxy modules can lead to misinterpretations of request boundaries.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted request that httpd interprets as two separate requests, while the backend server sees only one. The second, malicious request is then processed in the context of a legitimate user's connection.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, session hijacking, bypassing security controls, cache poisoning.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure httpd and any proxy modules are updated to the latest versions with known smuggling vulnerabilities patched.
        *   Configure httpd to strictly adhere to HTTP specifications regarding `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`.
        *   Use a consistent web server implementation across the infrastructure to minimize parsing differences.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the backend.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Response Splitting/Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_response_splittinginjection.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious data into HTTP response headers, often by manipulating user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized before being included in headers. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other client-side attacks.
    *   **How httpd Contributes:**  If httpd directly sets headers based on unsanitized input (e.g., through CGI scripts or poorly written modules), it creates this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A CGI script takes user input for a redirect URL and directly sets the `Location` header without sanitization. An attacker injects newline characters and malicious JavaScript into the input, leading to XSS when the response is processed by the browser.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never directly use unsanitized user input to set HTTP response headers.
        *   Implement proper output encoding and sanitization for all data included in headers.
        *   Use HTTPOnly and Secure flags for cookies to mitigate some XSS risks.
        *   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Loaded Modules](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_loaded_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in specific Apache modules (e.g., `mod_php`, `mod_cgi`, `mod_ssl`) can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.
    *   **How httpd Contributes:**  httpd's modular architecture allows for extending its functionality, but vulnerabilities in these modules directly impact the security of the web server.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in an older version of `mod_php` allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code by crafting a specific request.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep all Apache modules updated to the latest stable versions.
        *   Only load necessary modules to reduce the attack surface.
        *   Regularly review the security advisories for the modules you are using.
        *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to mitigate known module vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Slowloris and Similar Denial-of-Service Attacks](./attack_surfaces/slowloris_and_similar_denial-of-service_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting httpd's connection handling by sending partial HTTP requests slowly, aiming to exhaust server resources and prevent legitimate users from accessing the service.
    *   **How httpd Contributes:**  httpd's default configuration might allow a large number of persistent connections, making it susceptible to attacks that tie up these resources.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends numerous incomplete HTTP requests, holding open connections on the server until the maximum connection limit is reached, preventing new connections from being established.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the impact of downtime)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure connection timeouts to close idle or slow connections.
        *   Limit the maximum number of concurrent connections.
        *   Use a reverse proxy or load balancer with connection limiting and rate limiting capabilities.
        *   Consider using modules like `mod_evasive` to detect and mitigate DoS attacks.
