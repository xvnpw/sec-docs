## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in httpd Core [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_httpd_core__critical_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * Exploiting known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) present in the specific version of Apache httpd being used. This involves crafting malicious requests or data that trigger the vulnerability.
    * Targeting memory corruption flaws like buffer overflows, integer overflows, and use-after-free vulnerabilities. Attackers send carefully crafted input that overwrites memory locations, potentially allowing them to control program execution.
    * Exploiting logical flaws in how httpd handles requests, processes data, or interacts with other components. This can involve complex sequences of requests or specific input patterns that expose unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___critical_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * Successfully exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, integer overflows) to overwrite return addresses or function pointers, redirecting execution flow to attacker-controlled code.
    * Leveraging logic vulnerabilities that allow the execution of arbitrary commands on the server, often through shell injection or other command execution flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Buffer Overflow Vulnerability:** Sending more data than a buffer is allocated to hold, overwriting adjacent memory regions. This can be achieved by crafting long HTTP headers, request parameters, or file uploads.
    * **Exploit Integer Overflow Vulnerability:** Providing input that causes an integer variable to exceed its maximum or minimum value, leading to unexpected behavior, including memory corruption. This might involve manipulating content lengths or other size-related parameters.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Logic Vulnerabilities Leading to RCE](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_logic_vulnerabilities_leading_to_rce.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * Identifying and exploiting flaws in how httpd processes specific types of requests or interacts with modules. This could involve manipulating request headers, methods, or content in unexpected ways to trigger unintended code execution.
    * Exploiting race conditions or other concurrency issues that allow attackers to manipulate the server's state and execute arbitrary commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Misconfigurations in httpd [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_misconfigurations_in_httpd__critical_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Gain Access via Directory Traversal:**  Manipulating URLs to access files and directories outside the intended web root. This often involves using ".." sequences in the URL path.
    * **Exploit Insecure Default Configurations:** Leveraging default settings that are known to be insecure, such as leaving default credentials unchanged, enabling unnecessary modules with known vulnerabilities, or having overly permissive access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Loaded Modules/Extensions [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_loaded_modulesextensions__critical_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Third-Party Module Vulnerabilities:** Targeting known CVEs or zero-day vulnerabilities present in third-party modules loaded into Apache httpd. This requires identifying the specific modules being used and researching their known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Cause Denial of Service (DoS) via httpd](./attack_tree_paths/7__cause_denial_of_service__dos__via_httpd.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Resource Exhaustion:** Sending a large volume of requests to overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This can be achieved through various methods, including simple flooding or more sophisticated distributed attacks.
