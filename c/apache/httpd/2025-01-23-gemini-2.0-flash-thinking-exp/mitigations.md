# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/httpd

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Apache httpd Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep_apache_httpd_up-to-date.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Apache Security Advisories:** Regularly check the official Apache HTTP Server Project website and security mailing lists for announcements of new vulnerabilities and security updates.
    2.  **Apply Security Patches Promptly:** When security updates are released, prioritize applying them to your Apache httpd installation as quickly as possible.
    3.  **Test Patches:** Before deploying patches to production, test them in a staging environment that mirrors your production setup to ensure compatibility and stability with your application.
    4.  **Automate Updates:** Implement automated update mechanisms using system package managers or configuration management tools to ensure timely patching across all Apache instances.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Apache Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Apache versions are susceptible to publicly known exploits that can lead to server compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Apache Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation by eliminating known attack vectors within Apache httpd itself.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. We monitor security advisories and have a staging environment. Patches are applied manually during maintenance windows.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automation of Apache patching is missing. We need to automate the patching process to ensure timely updates are applied consistently.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Enabled Apache Modules](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_enabled_apache_modules.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **List Enabled Modules:** Use `apachectl -M` or `httpd -M` to get a list of currently enabled Apache modules.
    2.  **Review Module Necessity:** For each enabled module, assess if it is absolutely required for your application's functionality. Consult with development teams if needed.
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary Modules:** Use `a2dismod <module_name>` (on Debian/Ubuntu) or manually comment out `LoadModule` directives in Apache configuration files to disable modules not in use.
    4.  **Restart Apache:** Restart the Apache service after disabling modules to apply the changes.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Increased Attack Surface in Apache (Medium Severity):** Each enabled module adds potential code that could contain vulnerabilities. Disabling unused modules reduces the attack surface within Apache.
        *   **Module-Specific Apache Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in specific Apache modules can be exploited if the module is enabled, even if not actively used by your application.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Increased Attack Surface in Apache (Medium Impact):** Reduces potential entry points for attackers targeting Apache modules.
        *   **Module-Specific Apache Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Impact):** Eliminates risks associated with vulnerabilities in disabled Apache modules.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Initial module review has been done, and some modules disabled.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A documented and regularly reviewed process for minimizing enabled Apache modules is needed. We should establish a schedule for reviewing and justifying enabled modules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Apache Configuration Practices](./mitigation_strategies/secure_apache_configuration_practices.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Apache:** Configure Apache to run as a dedicated, non-privileged user and group (e.g., `www-data`). Set `User` and `Group` directives in Apache configuration.
    2.  **Restrict Access to Apache Configuration Files:** Set file permissions on Apache configuration files (e.g., `httpd.conf`, `.htaccess`) to limit read and write access to only authorized administrators and the Apache user for reading where necessary.
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary Apache Features:**
        *   Disable Server-Side Includes (SSI) if not required by ensuring `Options Includes` is not enabled.
        *   Disable CGI execution unless necessary. If needed, configure `ScriptAlias` and `Options ExecCGI` carefully.
        *   Disable WebDAV by disabling `mod_dav` and `mod_dav_fs` modules and removing related configurations.
    4.  **Control Allowed HTTP Methods in Apache:** Use `<Limit>` directive to restrict HTTP methods to only those required (e.g., GET, POST, HEAD). Deny methods like PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT if unused.
    5.  **Disable Directory Listing in Apache:** Use `Options -Indexes` in Apache configuration to prevent automatic directory listing.
    6.  **Limit Request Body Size in Apache:** Configure `LimitRequestBody` to restrict the maximum size of HTTP request bodies to prevent potential DoS and buffer overflows targeting Apache.
    7.  **Set Apache Timeouts:** Configure `Timeout` and `KeepAliveTimeout` directives to prevent slowloris and other connection-based DoS attacks against Apache.
    8.  **Disable Server Signature and Server Tokens in Apache:** Use `ServerSignature Off` and `ServerTokens Prod` to prevent Apache from revealing version information in headers and error pages.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation via Apache (High Severity):** Running Apache as root increases the impact of vulnerabilities. Least privilege mitigates this within Apache.
        *   **Unauthorized Apache Configuration Changes (High Severity):** Unrestricted access to configuration files allows attackers to manipulate Apache settings.
        *   **Information Disclosure via Apache (Medium Severity):** Directory listing and verbose server signatures leak information about the Apache server.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Apache (Medium to High Severity):** Unrestricted request body sizes and timeouts can lead to resource exhaustion and DoS attacks targeting Apache.
        *   **Vulnerabilities related to SSI/CGI/WebDAV in Apache (Medium to High Severity):** Disabling these features eliminates potential vulnerabilities associated with them within Apache.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation via Apache (High Impact):** Limits the impact of Apache vulnerabilities by restricting process privileges.
        *   **Unauthorized Apache Configuration Changes (High Impact):** Prevents unauthorized modification of Apache server settings.
        *   **Information Disclosure via Apache (Medium Impact):** Reduces information leakage from Apache, making server profiling harder.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Apache (Medium to High Impact):** Mitigates certain DoS attacks targeting Apache resources.
        *   **Vulnerabilities related to SSI/CGI/WebDAV in Apache (Medium to High Impact):** Eliminates or reduces risks from these features within Apache.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Least privilege for Apache is configured. Server signature and tokens are disabled in Apache. Directory listing is generally disabled in Apache.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Systematic hardening of all Apache configuration practices is needed. We need to review and implement restrictions on HTTP methods, request body sizes, timeouts, and ensure unnecessary Apache features are disabled unless explicitly required and secured. Access control to Apache configuration files needs formal auditing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Apache Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/implement_apache_access_control.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Apache Virtual Hosts:** Configure virtual hosts to isolate different applications or websites on the same Apache instance.
    2.  **Implement IP-Based Access Control in Apache:** Use `Require ip` or `Require host` directives within Apache configuration to restrict access to specific directories or resources based on client IP addresses or hostnames.
    3.  **Implement Authentication and Authorization in Apache:** Use Apache's built-in authentication modules (`mod_auth_*`) and `Require` directives to protect sensitive areas with username/password authentication or integrate with external authentication providers via Apache modules.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Apache Resources (High Severity):** Lack of access control in Apache allows unauthorized users to access web resources served by Apache.
        *   **Lateral Movement via Apache (Medium Severity):** Virtual hosts limit the impact of a compromise in one virtual host on others hosted on the same Apache instance.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Apache Resources (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to web content served by Apache.
        *   **Lateral Movement via Apache (Medium Impact):** Limits the scope of a security breach within the Apache server.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Virtual hosts are used. Basic authentication is used for some administrative areas served by Apache.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   IP-based access control in Apache is not consistently applied. More granular authentication and authorization mechanisms within Apache are needed for different application functionalities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden Apache SSL/TLS Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/harden_apache_ssltls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Strong Ciphers and Protocols in Apache:** Use `SSLCipherSuite` and `SSLProtocol` directives in Apache virtual host configurations to enforce strong TLS protocols (TLS 1.2+) and secure cipher suites, disabling weak or outdated ones.
    2.  **Enable HSTS in Apache:** Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) by adding the `Strict-Transport-Security` header using Apache's `Header` directive to force HTTPS connections.
    3.  **Configure OCSP Stapling in Apache:** Enable OCSP stapling using `SSLUseStapling` and `SSLStaplingCache` directives in Apache to improve SSL/TLS handshake performance and reduce reliance on external OCSP responders.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks against Apache (High Severity):** Weak SSL/TLS configurations in Apache are vulnerable to MitM attacks.
        *   **Protocol Downgrade Attacks against Apache (Medium Severity):** Attackers can force browsers to use weaker protocols if strong protocols are not enforced in Apache.
        *   **SSL Stripping Attacks against Apache (Medium Severity - HSTS):** HSTS prevents SSL stripping attacks on websites served by Apache.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks against Apache (High Impact):** Significantly reduces MitM attack risks by enforcing strong encryption in Apache.
        *   **Protocol Downgrade Attacks against Apache (Medium Impact):** Prevents downgrade attacks by disabling weak protocols in Apache.
        *   **SSL Stripping Attacks against Apache (Medium Impact):** Effectively prevents SSL stripping for sites served by Apache.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Strong ciphers and protocols are configured based on general guidelines in Apache.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   HSTS and OCSP stapling are not enabled in Apache configuration. We need to implement these for enhanced SSL/TLS security and performance for Apache.
