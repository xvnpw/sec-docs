# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/httpd

## Attack Surface: [Request Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/request_smuggling.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate HTTP requests in a way that the frontend server (Apache) interprets the request differently from the backend server.

**How HTTPD Contributes:** Vulnerabilities in Apache's request parsing logic, particularly in handling `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a request with ambiguous `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers, causing Apache to forward part of a subsequent request as a new request to the backend.

**Impact:** Bypassing security controls, unauthorized access to resources, cache poisoning.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use the latest stable version of Apache HTTPD with known request smuggling vulnerabilities patched.
*   Configure `mod_proxy` carefully, ensuring consistent behavior between the frontend and backend servers.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into HTTP headers to manipulate server behavior or exploit vulnerabilities in downstream applications.

**How HTTPD Contributes:** Improper handling or sanitization of HTTP headers by Apache or its modules.

**Example:** An attacker injects a `X-Forwarded-For` header to bypass IP-based access controls or injects arbitrary cookies using the `Set-Cookie` header.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, cross-site scripting (XSS) via response headers, cache poisoning.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure Apache and its modules properly sanitize and validate HTTP headers.
*   Avoid trusting client-provided headers for security-sensitive decisions.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_(dos)_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** Attackers send a flood of requests or specially crafted requests to overwhelm Apache's resources, making the server unresponsive.

**How HTTPD Contributes:** Apache's architecture and default configurations can be susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks if not properly tuned.

**Example:**
*   **Slowloris:** Sending incomplete HTTP requests to keep connections open.
*   **HTTP Request Floods:** Sending a large volume of requests.
*   **Range Header Attacks:** Sending requests with malicious `Range` headers.

**Impact:** Service disruption, inability for legitimate users to access the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure Apache's `Timeout`, `KeepAliveTimeout`, and `MaxKeepAliveRequests` directives appropriately.
*   Implement connection limits and request rate limiting (e.g., using `mod_ratelimit`).
*   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_injectionmanipulation.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized write access to Apache's configuration files and modify them to introduce vulnerabilities or gain control.

**How HTTPD Contributes:** Apache relies on these configuration files to define its behavior.

**Example:** An attacker modifies `.htaccess` to redirect traffic to a malicious website or execute arbitrary scripts.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the web server, data breaches, malware distribution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict file system permissions on Apache's configuration files.
*   Implement file integrity monitoring.
*   Disable `.htaccess` files if not strictly necessary.
*   Regularly audit Apache's configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Core Modules (e.g., `mod_cgi`, `mod_php`, `mod_ssl`)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_core_modules_(e.g.,_`mod_cgi`,_`mod_php`,_`mod_ssl`).md)

**Description:** Security flaws in Apache's core modules can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code.

**How HTTPD Contributes:** Apache's modular architecture means vulnerabilities in any loaded module can expose the server.

**Example:** A known vulnerability in `mod_cgi` allows command execution via malicious CGI requests. A vulnerability in `mod_ssl` could allow decryption of HTTPS traffic.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Apache HTTPD and all loaded modules updated to the latest stable versions.
*   Only enable necessary modules and disable unused ones.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Modules](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_modules.md)

**Description:** Security flaws in third-party Apache modules can introduce vulnerabilities into the web server.

**How HTTPD Contributes:** Apache's extensibility allows the use of third-party modules, which may have security flaws.

**Example:** A vulnerable third-party authentication module allows bypassing authentication.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the module and vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully evaluate the security of third-party modules before deployment.
*   Use reputable sources for third-party modules.
*   Keep third-party modules updated.
*   Regularly audit the security of installed third-party modules.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to access files and directories outside of the intended webroot on the server.

**How HTTPD Contributes:** Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in Apache or its modules handling file serving or directory indexing.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a URL containing ".." sequences to access sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potential for further exploitation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure proper input validation and sanitization of file paths in applications and Apache configurations.
*   Disable directory listing if not necessary.
*   Configure Apache to restrict access to sensitive directories.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection (via CGI/SSI)](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_(via_cgissi).md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands that are executed by the server through CGI scripts or Server-Side Includes (SSI).

**How HTTPD Contributes:** Apache's support for CGI and SSI, if not handled securely, creates command injection vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A vulnerable CGI script takes user input and directly passes it to a system command without sanitization.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the web server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using CGI scripts if possible.
*   If CGI is necessary, thoroughly sanitize all user input.
*   Disable SSI if not required.
*   If SSI is necessary, carefully sanitize user input and avoid using directives that execute external commands.
*   Run CGI scripts with the least privileged user possible.
