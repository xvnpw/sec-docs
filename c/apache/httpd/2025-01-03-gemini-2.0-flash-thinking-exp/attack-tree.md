## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Core httpd Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_core_httpd_vulnerabilities_[critical].md)

* **Exploit Core httpd Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers target fundamental flaws within the core Apache httpd server code to gain unauthorized access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities_[critical].md)

* **Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities that allow them to overwrite memory locations within the httpd process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow_[critical].md)

* **Trigger Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers send crafted requests containing more data than allocated buffers can hold, overwriting adjacent memory locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Heap Overflow [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_heap_overflow_[critical].md)

* **Trigger Heap Overflow [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers manipulate memory allocation on the heap to overwrite data structures, potentially leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Use-After-Free Vulnerability [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_use-after-free_vulnerability_[critical].md)

* **Trigger Use-After-Free Vulnerability [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers trigger a scenario where memory is freed and then accessed again, potentially leading to crashes or code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Core Modules (e.g., mod_auth, mod_ssl) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_core_modules_(e.g.,_mod_auth,_mod_ssl)_[critical].md)

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Core Modules (e.g., mod_auth, mod_ssl) [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers target specific vulnerabilities within the core Apache modules that handle essential functionalities like authentication or SSL/TLS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Specific Vulnerabilities in Enabled Core Modules [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/target_specific_vulnerabilities_in_enabled_core_modules_[critical].md)

* **Target Specific Vulnerabilities in Enabled Core Modules [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers analyze public CVEs and available proof-of-concepts to exploit known weaknesses in enabled core modules.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Modules [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_modules_[critical].md)

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Modules [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers target vulnerabilities within third-party modules that have been added to extend the functionality of Apache httpd.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Enabled Modules [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_enabled_modules_[critical].md)

* **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Enabled Modules [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers search for public CVEs and exploits for the specific third-party modules that are enabled on the target server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_[critical].md)

* **Exploit Misconfigurations [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers leverage incorrect or insecure configurations of the Apache httpd server to gain unauthorized access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Improper Access Control Configuration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_improper_access_control_configuration_[critical].md)

* **Exploit Improper Access Control Configuration [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers exploit misconfigured access controls that allow them to access sensitive resources they should not have permission to view or modify.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Files/Directories Due to Lax Permissions [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_filesdirectories_due_to_lax_permissions_[critical].md)

* **Access Sensitive Files/Directories Due to Lax Permissions [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers attempt to access files like `.htpasswd` (containing user credentials) or configuration files due to overly permissive access rights.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure `.htaccess` Configurations [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_`.htaccess`_configurations_[critical].md)

* **Exploit Insecure `.htaccess` Configurations [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities related to the use and configuration of `.htaccess` files, which can override server configurations at the directory level.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious `.htaccess` Files (if allowed) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_`.htaccess`_files_(if_allowed)_[critical].md)

* **Upload Malicious `.htaccess` Files (if allowed) [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers find a way to upload malicious `.htaccess` files that can execute code or bypass security restrictions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure CGI Script Handling [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_cgi_script_handling_[critical].md)

* **Exploit Insecure CGI Script Handling [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how Apache httpd handles Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in CGI Scripts Themselves (Input Validation, Command Injection) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_cgi_scripts_themselves_(input_validation,_command_injection)_[critical].md)

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in CGI Scripts Themselves (Input Validation, Command Injection) [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers exploit weaknesses in the CGI scripts themselves, such as insufficient input validation, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
