# Threat Model Analysis for apache/httpd

## Threat: [Misconfigured Access Controls (.htaccess Bypass)](./threats/misconfigured_access_controls_(.htaccess_bypass).md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might find ways to bypass intended access restrictions defined in `.htaccess` files or `Directory` directives. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how these directives are processed or finding misconfigurations that grant unintended access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to restricted resources, potential for data breaches or modification.
*   **Affected Component:** `mod_authz_host`, `mod_authz_user`, `mod_access_compat`, core httpd access control mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test all `.htaccess` and `Directory` configurations.
    *   Prefer configuring access controls in the main `httpd.conf` file for better security and performance.
    *   Ensure the `AllowOverride` directive is set appropriately to limit the scope of `.htaccess` files.
    *   Regularly audit access control configurations.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers might gain access to httpd configuration files (e.g., `httpd.conf`, virtual host configurations) that contain sensitive information like database credentials or API keys. This access could be through vulnerabilities in the server or surrounding infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of credentials, leading to unauthorized access to other systems and data.
*   **Affected Component:** Core httpd configuration files.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files.
    *   Use environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions.
    *   Restrict file system permissions on configuration files to the httpd user.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Core Modules (e.g., mod_rewrite)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_core_modules_(e.g.,_mod_rewrite).md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws can be present in the core Apache httpd modules. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution, denial of service, or other malicious actions. For example, vulnerabilities in `mod_rewrite` could lead to unexpected behavior or security breaches.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:** Specific core modules like `mod_rewrite`, `mod_ssl`, etc.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Apache httpd updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
    *   Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor for vulnerability announcements.
    *   Carefully review and test any custom `mod_rewrite` rules.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Modules](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Using third-party modules introduces the risk of vulnerabilities existing within those modules. Attackers could exploit these flaws to compromise the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the module's functionality and the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:** Third-party modules installed and enabled in httpd.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Medium (depending on the module and vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install necessary third-party modules from trusted sources.
    *   Keep third-party modules updated to their latest versions.
    *   Monitor security advisories for the modules in use.
    *   Consider the security implications before installing new modules.

## Threat: [CGI Script Vulnerabilities (Command Injection)](./threats/cgi_script_vulnerabilities_(command_injection).md)

*   **Description:** If CGI scripts are used, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in these scripts, such as command injection flaws. By sending specially crafted input, they can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `mod_cgi`, CGI scripts themselves.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using CGI scripts if possible; opt for more modern alternatives.
    *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user input passed to CGI scripts.
    *   Run CGI scripts with the least privileges necessary.
    *   Keep CGI interpreters updated.

## Threat: [Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection](./threats/server-side_includes_(ssi)_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If Server-Side Includes (SSI) are enabled and user input is not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious code into web pages. This can lead to remote code execution or defacement.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, website defacement, information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:** `mod_include`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable SSI if not required (`Options -IncludesNOEXEC`).
    *   If SSI is necessary, carefully sanitize and validate all user input used in SSI directives.
    *   Avoid using `<!--#exec -->` or limit its usage with strict controls.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths in URLs to access files and directories outside the intended webroot. This is often achieved using "../" sequences in the URL.
*   **Impact:** Access to sensitive system files, application code, or configuration files.
*   **Affected Component:** Core httpd file serving functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid constructing file paths based on user input directly.
    *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization.
    *   Use `Alias` or `Directory` directives to restrict access to specific file system locations.
    *   Disable directory listing.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (Slowloris Attack)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_(slowloris_attack).md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can exploit the way Apache httpd handles connections by sending incomplete HTTP requests slowly. This can tie up server resources and prevent legitimate users from accessing the website.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the website unavailable.
*   **Affected Component:** Core httpd connection handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure connection timeouts (`Timeout` directive).
    *   Use `mod_reqtimeout` to limit the time allowed for receiving requests.
    *   Implement connection limits (e.g., using `mod_limitipconn` or similar).
    *   Consider using a reverse proxy or CDN with DDoS protection.

## Threat: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./threats/http_request_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit discrepancies in how front-end proxies and Apache httpd interpret HTTP requests. This allows them to "smuggle" malicious requests to the backend server, potentially bypassing security controls.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access, cache poisoning, request routing manipulation.
*   **Affected Component:** Core httpd request parsing, interaction with front-end proxies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the front-end proxy and Apache httpd are configured to handle HTTP requests consistently.
    *   Disable support for ambiguous or older HTTP features if not required.
    *   Use HTTP/2 where possible, as it mitigates many request smuggling vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Failure to Apply Security Patches](./threats/failure_to_apply_security_patches.md)

*   **Description:**  Not applying security updates for Apache httpd leaves the server vulnerable to known exploits that have been addressed in newer versions.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** The entire Apache httpd installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish a regular patching schedule for Apache httpd.
    *   Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor for vulnerability announcements.
    *   Test patches in a non-production environment before deploying to production.
