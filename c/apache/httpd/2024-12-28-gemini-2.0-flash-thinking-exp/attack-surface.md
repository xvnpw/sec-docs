**Key Attack Surfaces Directly Involving httpd (High & Critical Severity):**

*   **Description:** HTTP Request Smuggling
    *   **How httpd Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Inconsistencies in how httpd parses HTTP requests (e.g., handling of `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers) compared to backend servers or proxies allow attackers to inject additional requests within a single HTTP connection.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted request with ambiguous length indicators. httpd might forward part of the malicious request as a separate, unintended request to the backend.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access, cache poisoning, and potentially executing arbitrary code on backend servers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure httpd and backend servers to have strict and consistent request parsing behavior.
        *   Disable keep-alive connections if inconsistencies cannot be resolved.
        *   Use HTTP/2 where possible, as it is less susceptible to smuggling due to its framing mechanism.
        *   Implement strict validation of request headers and bodies at the httpd level.

*   **Description:** HTTP Response Splitting
    *   **How httpd Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Improper handling of user-controlled data within HTTP response headers generated *by httpd itself* (e.g., through modules or redirects) or when proxying responses from backend applications without proper sanitization.
    *   **Example:** A poorly written httpd module uses user input to set a header value without encoding. An attacker injects newline characters and additional headers, potentially setting malicious cookies or redirecting the user.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), cache poisoning, and session hijacking.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user input directly in HTTP response headers generated by httpd or its modules.
        *   Implement strict output encoding and sanitization for any data included in headers by httpd.
        *   Ensure httpd's proxy configurations do not blindly forward unsanitized headers from backends.

*   **Description:** Path Traversal
    *   **How httpd Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Misconfiguration of httpd's `DocumentRoot` directive, allowing access to files outside the intended web root, or vulnerabilities in how httpd handles file paths when serving static content or through modules.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a URL like `http://example.com/../../../../etc/passwd` that httpd resolves to a sensitive system file due to incorrect path handling.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files, configuration data, and potentially even source code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the `DocumentRoot` directive is correctly configured and restricts access to the necessary directories.
        *   Disable directory listing unless absolutely necessary and with strict access controls configured in httpd.
        *   Carefully review and secure any httpd modules that handle file access.

*   **Description:** Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection
    *   **How httpd Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If SSI is enabled in httpd's configuration, it processes directives within HTML files. Improper handling of user input within these directives can lead to code execution *by the httpd process*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious SSI directive like `<!--#exec cmd="whoami" -->` into a comment field of an HTML file served by httpd with SSI enabled.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server with the privileges of the httpd process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable SSI in httpd's configuration if it's not required.
        *   If SSI is necessary, carefully sanitize any user input that might be included in SSI directives before the files are processed by httpd.
        *   Restrict the capabilities of SSI using the `Options` directive (e.g., disable `ExecCGI`) in httpd's configuration.

*   **Description:** CGI Script Vulnerabilities
    *   **How httpd Contributes to the Attack Surface:** httpd's configuration allows the execution of CGI scripts. Vulnerabilities within these scripts, especially if they are written without proper security considerations, can be directly exploited through httpd.
    *   **Example:** A CGI script, executed by httpd, takes user input from a query parameter and directly uses it in a shell command without sanitization, allowing for command injection.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution with the privileges of the user running the CGI script (often the httpd user), information disclosure, and server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using CGI scripts if possible; consider more modern alternatives like WSGI or FastCGI.
        *   If CGI is necessary, write scripts in secure languages and follow secure coding practices.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user input within CGI scripts before using it in commands or database queries.
        *   Configure httpd to run CGI scripts with the least privileges necessary.

*   **Description:** Module-Specific Vulnerabilities
    *   **How httpd Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Each enabled httpd module introduces its own potential attack surface. Vulnerabilities within these modules can be directly exploited through interactions with httpd.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in `mod_php` allows for remote code execution through a specially crafted HTTP request processed by httpd.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the module and the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution with the privileges of the httpd process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep all httpd modules updated to the latest versions.
        *   Only enable necessary modules in httpd's configuration.
        *   Regularly review the security advisories for enabled httpd modules.

*   **Description:** TLS/SSL Vulnerabilities
    *   **How httpd Contributes to the Attack Surface:** httpd's configuration determines the TLS/SSL protocols and cipher suites used for HTTPS connections. Weak configurations or the use of vulnerable underlying TLS libraries (like OpenSSL) directly expose the server to attacks.
    *   **Example:** httpd is configured to allow outdated TLS protocols (like SSLv3) or weak cipher suites, making the connection vulnerable to attacks like POODLE or BEAST.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, and compromise of confidentiality and integrity of communication with the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the latest stable version of httpd and the underlying TLS library.
        *   Configure httpd to use strong and modern TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   Disable weak cipher suites in httpd's SSL configuration.
        *   Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) in httpd's configuration.
