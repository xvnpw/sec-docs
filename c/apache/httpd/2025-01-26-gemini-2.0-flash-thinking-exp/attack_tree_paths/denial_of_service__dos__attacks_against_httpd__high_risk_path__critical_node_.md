#### 4.1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks against httpd [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** Denial of Service (DoS) attacks aim to disrupt the normal functioning of the Apache httpd server, making it unavailable to legitimate users. This is a high-risk path as successful DoS attacks can lead to significant business disruption, reputational damage, and financial losses.

**Potential Impact:**
*   **Service Unavailability:** Legitimate users are unable to access the application or website hosted on the httpd server.
*   **Business Disruption:** Online services become unavailable, impacting business operations, sales, and customer service.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Service outages can erode user trust and damage the organization's reputation.
*   **Financial Losses:**  Downtime can lead to direct financial losses due to lost revenue, SLA breaches, and recovery costs.
*   **Resource Strain:**  DoS attacks can consume significant resources (network, personnel) in mitigation and recovery efforts.

**Mitigation Strategies (General DoS):**
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at various levels (web server, load balancer, network firewall) to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given timeframe.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to filter malicious traffic, identify and block known DoS attack patterns, and enforce security policies.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Utilize IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block malicious traffic patterns associated with DoS attacks.
*   **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers to prevent a single server from being overwhelmed.

*   **Traffic Monitoring and Anomaly Detection:** Implement robust monitoring systems to detect unusual traffic patterns that may indicate a DoS attack.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and regularly test a comprehensive incident response plan specifically for DoS attacks.
*   **Upstream Provider Protections:** Leverage DoS protection services offered by upstream network providers or hosting providers.

##### 4.1.1. Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Description:** Resource exhaustion attacks aim to deplete critical server resources, such as CPU, memory, bandwidth, or processing capacity, rendering the httpd server unable to handle legitimate requests. This is a high-risk path as it directly targets the server's ability to function.

**Mitigation Strategies (Resource Exhaustion):**
*   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement comprehensive monitoring of server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, disk I/O) and set up alerts for abnormal usage patterns.
*   **Resource Limits and Quotas:** Configure resource limits and quotas within the operating system and httpd configuration to prevent individual processes or requests from consuming excessive resources.
*   **Regular Performance Tuning and Optimization:** Regularly review and optimize httpd configurations, application code, and database queries to improve performance and resource efficiency.

###### 4.1.1.1. CPU Exhaustion [HIGH RISK PATH]

####### 4.1.1.1.1. httpd server CPU overloaded: Overloading the server CPU with computationally intensive requests.

**Description:** Attackers send requests that require significant CPU processing time on the httpd server, overwhelming the CPU and preventing it from processing legitimate requests.

**Attack Techniques:**
*   **Slowloris:** Sends slow, low-bandwidth HTTP requests designed to keep connections open for a long time, eventually exhausting server connection limits and CPU resources.
*   **HTTP POST Slow Body:** Sends a legitimate POST request with a very slow data rate, tying up server resources while waiting for the complete request body.
*   **Computationally Intensive Requests:**  Crafting requests that trigger computationally expensive operations on the server-side application or backend (e.g., complex regular expressions, cryptographic operations, large data processing).
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (in some contexts):**  While primarily a data exposure vulnerability, XXE can be exploited to cause CPU exhaustion if the server attempts to process a large or malicious external entity.

**Potential Impact:**
*   **High CPU Utilization:** Server CPU usage spikes to 100%, leading to slow response times and eventual service unavailability.
*   **Server Unresponsiveness:** The httpd server becomes unresponsive to legitimate requests due to CPU overload.
*   **Application Slowdown:** Applications relying on the httpd server become slow or unresponsive.

**Mitigation Strategies (CPU Exhaustion):**

####### 4.1.1.2.1. httpd server memory exhausted: Exhausting server memory with memory-intensive requests.

**Description:** Attackers send requests that force the httpd server to allocate excessive amounts of memory, eventually exhausting available RAM and causing the server to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Techniques:**
*   **Large HTTP Request Headers/Bodies:** Sending requests with extremely large headers or bodies, forcing the server to allocate significant memory to process them.
*   **Memory Leaks in Application Code:** Exploiting memory leaks in the server-side application code, causing memory usage to grow over time with repeated requests.
*   **Requesting Large Files or Resources:**  Repeatedly requesting very large files or resources, consuming server memory to serve these requests.
*   **Compression Bomb (Zip Bomb, etc.):**  Sending compressed data that expands to a much larger size when decompressed by the server, leading to memory exhaustion.
*   **Session State Manipulation:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in session management to create or manipulate large session states, consuming server memory.

**Attack Techniques:**
*   **Hash Collision Attacks:**  Exploiting hash table implementations with predictable hash functions to cause hash collisions, leading to worst-case performance (O(n) instead of O(1)) when processing requests.
*   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):**  Crafting regular expressions that exhibit catastrophic backtracking when matched against specific input strings, leading to exponential CPU consumption.
*   **Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerabilities in Application Logic:**  Identifying and exploiting inefficient algorithms or data structures in the application code that can be triggered by specific inputs, leading to excessive resource consumption.
*   **XML Bomb (Billion Laughs Attack):**  Crafting deeply nested XML documents that, when parsed, expand to a massive size in memory, leading to memory exhaustion and CPU overload.

**Potential Impact:**
*   **High CPU and/or Memory Utilization:** Server resources are consumed disproportionately for relatively small or simple requests.
*   **Slow Response Times:**  Requests take an excessively long time to process, leading to slow response times and potential timeouts.
