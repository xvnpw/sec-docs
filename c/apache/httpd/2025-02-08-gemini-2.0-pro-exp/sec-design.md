# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Apache HTTP Server project ("httpd") is a foundational piece of internet infrastructure. Its primary business goal is to provide a secure, efficient, and extensible server that implements the HTTP protocol. Given its widespread use, the project's priorities likely revolve around:

*   Maintaining stability and reliability: Downtime or instability in httpd can have cascading effects across the internet.
*   Ensuring security: As a public-facing server, httpd is a constant target for attacks. Security vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, website defacement, and other serious consequences.
*   Supporting a wide range of use cases: httpd is used in diverse environments, from small personal websites to large-scale enterprise deployments. It needs to be flexible and configurable to meet these varying needs.
*   Maintaining compatibility: Many systems and applications rely on httpd. The project needs to balance innovation with backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing setups.
*   Community-driven development: As an open-source project, httpd relies on contributions from a global community of developers. Fostering a healthy and productive community is crucial.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:

*   Compromise of the server, leading to data breaches, website defacement, or use of the server for malicious purposes (e.g., botnets, phishing).
*   Denial-of-service attacks that render websites and applications unavailable.
*   Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   Inability to adapt to evolving web standards and security threats.
*   Loss of community support and developer contributions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

The Apache HTTP Server project has a long history and a strong focus on security. The following security controls and accepted risks are likely in place:

*   security control: Secure coding practices: The httpd development team likely follows secure coding guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities. This includes input validation, output encoding, and careful memory management. Described in project documentation and coding style guidelines.
*   security control: Regular security audits and reviews: The codebase is likely subject to regular internal and external security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Described in project documentation and security advisories.
*   security control: Vulnerability disclosure program: The project likely has a process for handling vulnerability reports from external researchers. Described in project documentation and security advisories.
*   security control: Support for secure communication protocols: httpd supports HTTPS (HTTP over TLS/SSL) to encrypt communication between the server and clients. Described in project documentation.
*   security control: Access control mechanisms: httpd provides various mechanisms for controlling access to resources, such as authentication and authorization modules. Described in project documentation.
*   security control: Regular updates and patches: The project releases regular updates to address security vulnerabilities and other issues. Described in project documentation and release notes.
*   security control: Module architecture: The modular design of httpd allows users to enable only the necessary features, reducing the attack surface. Described in project documentation.
*   security control: Sandboxing and process isolation: Some configurations may involve running httpd processes with limited privileges or in sandboxed environments to contain potential exploits. Described in project documentation.
*   accepted risk: Complexity of configuration: httpd offers a vast array of configuration options, which can lead to misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
*   accepted risk: Legacy code and features: Maintaining backward compatibility may require retaining older code and features that are less secure than modern alternatives.
*   accepted risk: Third-party modules: While the core httpd codebase is rigorously reviewed, third-party modules may introduce vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Dependence on external libraries: httpd relies on external libraries (e.g., OpenSSL) for cryptography and other functions. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can impact httpd's security.

Recommended security controls:

*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to force clients to use HTTPS.
*   Regularly review and update configuration to ensure best practices are followed.
*   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to provide an additional layer of defense against common web attacks.
*   Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for various authentication mechanisms (e.g., Basic, Digest, OAuth, OpenID Connect).
    *   Secure storage of credentials (e.g., hashing and salting passwords).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks.
*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control to resources based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Support for different authorization models (e.g., role-based access control, attribute-based access control).
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, command injection).
    *   Whitelist-based validation whenever possible.
    *   Proper handling of special characters and encodings.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3, AES-256).
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Protection against known cryptographic attacks (e.g., padding oracle attacks, timing attacks).

    SourceCode("Source Code Repository (Git)")
    BuildServer("Build Server (e.g., Jenkins)")
    Compiler("Compiler (e.g., GCC)")
    Linker("Linker")
    Tests("Automated Tests")
    Artifacts("Build Artifacts (e.g., .tar.gz, .deb, .rpm)")
    SecurityScanners("Security Scanners (SAST)")

    Developer -- "Commits code" --> SourceCode
    SourceCode -- "Trigger build" --> BuildServer
    BuildServer -- "Fetches code" --> SourceCode
    BuildServer -- "Compiles code" --> Compiler
    Compiler -- "Produces object files" --> Linker
    Linker -- "Produces executable" --> Tests
    Tests -- "Run tests" --> Artifacts
    BuildServer -- "Runs scanners"--> SecurityScanners
    SecurityScanners -- "Report" --> BuildServer
```

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   Source Code Management: The project uses Git for version control, allowing tracking of changes and facilitating code reviews.
*   Build Automation: The build process is automated using tools like Jenkins, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
*   Compiler Warnings and Errors: The build process is configured to treat compiler warnings as errors, enforcing code quality and preventing potential vulnerabilities.
*   Static Application Security Testing (SAST): SAST tools are integrated into the build process to scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
*   Dependency Management: The project carefully manages its dependencies to minimize the risk of using vulnerable libraries.
*   Reproducible Builds: Efforts are made to ensure that the build process is reproducible, meaning that the same source code will always produce the same binary output. This helps to verify the integrity of the build artifacts.
*   Signed Releases: Official releases of the Apache HTTP Server are digitally signed, allowing users to verify their authenticity and integrity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
    *   Serving web content reliably and efficiently.
    *   Protecting sensitive data transmitted between clients and the server.
