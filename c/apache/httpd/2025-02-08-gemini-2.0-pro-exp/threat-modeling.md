# Threat Model Analysis for apache/httpd

## Threat: [HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Denial of Service (CVE-2023-44487)](./threats/http2_rapid_reset_denial_of_service__cve-2023-44487_.md)

*   **Threat:** HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Denial of Service (CVE-2023-44487)

    *   **Description:** If HTTP/2 is enabled, an attacker sends a stream of requests and immediately resets them using the RST_STREAM frame.  This exploits a flaw in how httpd handles these resets, leading to excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service; the website becomes unavailable.  Server CPU and potentially memory are exhausted.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `mod_http2` (the HTTP/2 module).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if HTTP/2 is enabled and unpatched).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update httpd:**  Apply the patch that addresses CVE-2023-44487.  This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   **Disable HTTP/2 (if not essential):**  If HTTP/2 is not strictly required, disabling it eliminates the vulnerability.  This can be done by not loading `mod_http2`.
        *   **WAF (limited effectiveness):**  Some WAFs may offer *partial* mitigation, but updating httpd is crucial.

## Threat: [Slowloris Denial of Service](./threats/slowloris_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Threat:** Slowloris Denial of Service

    *   **Description:** An attacker opens numerous connections to the Apache server but sends data extremely slowly (or not at all after the initial request).  This keeps connections open and consumes server resources (threads/processes), preventing legitimate users from connecting. The attacker doesn't need significant bandwidth.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of service; the website becomes unavailable to legitimate users.  Server resources are exhausted.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Core httpd connection handling; potentially exacerbated by modules that hold connections open (e.g., modules that wait for long-running processes).  Specifically, the way Apache handles worker threads/processes and their allocation to connections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can easily render a server unresponsive with minimal attacker resources).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use `mod_reqtimeout`:**  Configure this module to set timeouts for receiving request headers and bodies.  This is the primary defense.
        *   **Tune connection limits:**  Carefully configure `MaxRequestWorkers`, `ThreadsPerChild`, `KeepAliveTimeout`, and `Timeout`.  Lowering `KeepAliveTimeout` can help, but balance this against performance for legitimate users.
        *   **Use a reverse proxy:**  A reverse proxy (like Nginx) can often handle Slowloris attacks more effectively than Apache alone.
        *   **Employ a WAF:**  A Web Application Firewall can detect and block Slowloris-like behavior.

## Threat: [.htaccess File Exposure](./threats/_htaccess_file_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** .htaccess File Exposure

    *   **Description:**  If misconfigured, `.htaccess` files (which contain per-directory configuration directives) can be directly accessed by attackers via a web browser.  These files can reveal sensitive configuration settings, including access control rules, rewrite rules, and potentially even database credentials (if poorly configured).
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure; attackers gain access to sensitive configuration details, which can be used to further compromise the server.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Core httpd configuration; specifically, the handling of `.htaccess` files and the `AllowOverride` directive.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can reveal critical configuration information).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure proper `AllowOverride` settings:**  The default configuration usually protects `.htaccess` files.  Avoid using `AllowOverride All` unless absolutely necessary.  Use more specific `AllowOverride` options (e.g., `AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit`).
        *   **Verify file permissions:**  Ensure that `.htaccess` files have appropriate file system permissions (typically 644) and are owned by the correct user.
        *   **Centralize configuration (if possible):**  Avoid using `.htaccess` files altogether by placing configuration directives in the main server configuration files. This is generally more secure and performant.

## Threat: [Weak SSL/TLS Configuration](./threats/weak_ssltls_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Weak SSL/TLS Configuration

    *   **Description:** The server is configured to use outdated or insecure SSL/TLS protocols (e.g., SSLv2, SSLv3) or weak cipher suites. An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack, decrypting or modifying the traffic between the client and the server.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality and integrity of encrypted communications. Attackers can steal sensitive data (passwords, credit card numbers, etc.) or inject malicious content.
    *   **Affected Component:** `mod_ssl` (the SSL/TLS module); configuration directives related to SSL/TLS (e.g., `SSLCipherSuite`, `SSLProtocol`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (compromises the security of encrypted connections).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable outdated protocols:** Use `SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1` to enable only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.
        *   **Use strong cipher suites:** Configure `SSLCipherSuite` to use only strong, modern cipher suites. Consult security best practices (e.g., Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator) for recommended cipher suites.
        *   **Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** Use the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to force browsers to always connect to the server over HTTPS.
        *   **Use a valid and trusted certificate:** Obtain a certificate from a reputable Certificate Authority (CA).
        *   **Regularly review and update SSL/TLS configuration:** Stay informed about new vulnerabilities and best practices.

## Threat: [Misconfigured CGI Scripts](./threats/misconfigured_cgi_scripts.md)

*   **Threat:** Misconfigured CGI Scripts

    *   **Description:** If CGI scripts are enabled, and a CGI script itself has vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, shell injection), an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This is often due to flaws *within* the CGI script, but httpd's configuration enables the execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution; complete server compromise. The attacker gains control of the server with the privileges of the user running the httpd process (or the user configured with `suexec`).
    *   **Affected Component:** `mod_cgi` or `mod_cgid` (the CGI modules); configuration directives related to CGI execution (e.g., `ScriptAlias`, `AddHandler`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (can lead to complete server compromise).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid CGI scripts if possible:** Use more secure alternatives like FastCGI (e.g., with PHP-FPM), WSGI (for Python), or server-side modules.
        *   **Secure CGI scripts:** If CGI is unavoidable, ensure that the scripts themselves are secure and follow secure coding practices. Sanitize all user input.
        *   **Use `ScriptAlias` carefully:** Restrict CGI execution to specific directories using `ScriptAlias`.
        *   **Run CGI scripts with minimal privileges:** Use `suexec` to run CGI scripts under different user accounts, limiting the damage an attacker can do.
        *   **Regularly audit CGI scripts:** Review the code of CGI scripts for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in Third-Party Module leading to RCE](./threats/vulnerability_in_third-party_module_leading_to_rce.md)

* **Threat:** Vulnerability in Third-Party Module leading to RCE.

    *   **Description:**  A third-party Apache module contains a security vulnerability, such as a buffer overflow or similar, that allows remote code execution.  An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the httpd process and execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution and complete server compromise. The attacker gains control of the server.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The specific vulnerable third-party module.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical (can lead to complete server compromise).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use only trusted modules:**  Download modules only from reputable sources.
        *   **Keep modules updated:**  Regularly check for updates to all installed modules and apply them promptly.
        *   **Review module code (if possible):**  If the module is open-source, review the code for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Run httpd with minimal privileges:**  Use a dedicated user account with limited file system access to run httpd.
        *   **Disable unnecessary modules:**  Only load modules that are absolutely necessary.
        *   **Sandboxing (advanced):**  Consider using techniques like sandboxing or containerization to isolate httpd processes.
