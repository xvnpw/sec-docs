## Attack Tree Path: [[*** Gain Unauthorized RCE on Server ***] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/__gain_unauthorized_rce_on_server____critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Achieving RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, leading to complete server compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** N/A (Goal, not a step)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** N/A
*   **Skill Level:** N/A
*   **Detection Difficulty:** N/A

## Attack Tree Path: [-->[Exploit Vulnerability in httpd Modules] (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/--_exploit_vulnerability_in_httpd_modules___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within httpd modules (extensions) to gain control.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Varies
*   **Skill Level:** Varies
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

    *   **-->[Buffer Overflow] (High-Risk Path within Modules)**
        *   **Description:** Sending excessive data to a module's buffer, overwriting memory and potentially executing malicious code.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Varies (Low for known CVEs, High for 0-days)
        *   **Skill Level:** Varies (Script Kiddie to Expert)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

        *   **-->[CVE-XXX] (Known, Patched - High-Risk if Unpatched)**
            *   **Description:** Exploiting a specific, publicly known buffer overflow vulnerability (represented by a CVE identifier). High risk *only if the system is unpatched*.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (If patched) / High (If unpatched)
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploits often publicly available)
            *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Signature-based detection possible)

        *   **-->[CVE-YYY] (Known, Patched - High-Risk if Unpatched)**
            *   (Same characteristics as CVE-XXX, but for a different specific vulnerability)

        *   **[*** New 0-day ***] (Critical Node)**
            *   **Description:** Exploiting an unknown (zero-day) buffer overflow vulnerability.
            *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Very High
            *   **Skill Level:** Expert
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

    *   **-->[Default Module Enabled] (Vulnerable - High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Description:** A default httpd module that is enabled contains a known vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If the vulnerable module is enabled and unpatched)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **[*** Custom Module ***] (Vulnerable - Critical Node)**
        *   **Description:** A module developed in-house contains a vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Varies
        *   **Skill Level:** Varies
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [-->[Exploit Misconfiguration] (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/--_exploit_misconfiguration___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage incorrect or insecure httpd configurations.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Low to Very High (Depends on the specific misconfiguration)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

    *   **-->[Weak Auth (.htaccess)] (High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Description:** Weak or default passwords protecting resources via `.htaccess` files.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low (Brute-force attacks)
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Failed login attempts)

    *   **[Exposed Sensitive Files (/server-status)]**
        *   **Description:** Sensitive files or directories (like `/server-status`) are accessible without authentication.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy

    *   **-->[Insecure Directives (AllowOverride All)] (High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Description:** Using insecure configuration directives, such as `AllowOverride All`, which allows `.htaccess` files to override almost any server setting.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
