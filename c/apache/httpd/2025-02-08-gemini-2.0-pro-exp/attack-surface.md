# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/httpd

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched Software Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_software_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in the Apache httpd software or its modules.
*   **httpd Contribution:** The vulnerability exists *within* the httpd codebase or a loaded module, making httpd the direct target.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known buffer overflow in an older version of `mod_ssl` to gain remote code execution *on the httpd server*.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, privilege escalation (all directly impacting the httpd server).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (depending on the specific CVE).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Patch Management:** Implement a robust patch management process.  Regularly check for and apply security updates from the Apache Software Foundation.  Automate updates where possible.  This is the *primary* defense.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners to identify outdated or vulnerable versions of httpd and its modules.
    *   **Minimal Installation:** Install only the necessary modules to reduce the attack surface exposed by httpd.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Modules (Specifically High-Impact Modules)](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_modules__specifically_high-impact_modules_.md)

*   **Description:**  Improperly configured Apache modules, leading to *significant* security weaknesses directly exploitable through httpd.  Focus here is on modules with a high potential for severe impact.
*   **httpd Contribution:** The vulnerability arises from the configuration of a specific httpd module, and the exploitation occurs *through* httpd.
*   **Example:**
    *   `mod_proxy` configured as an open proxy, allowing attackers to use the server for malicious purposes (SSRF, relaying attacks).  This is a *direct* httpd configuration issue.
    *   `mod_rewrite` rules that are too permissive, allowing attackers to access files outside the intended webroot (directory traversal) *via crafted HTTP requests to httpd*.
    *   `mod_security` (if used) misconfigured to *allow* malicious requests that it should block.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access, server-side request forgery (SSRF), denial of service, potential for remote code execution (depending on the module and misconfiguration).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure each module with the *absolute minimum* necessary permissions and features.
    *   **Configuration Review:** Thoroughly review and understand the security implications of *every* configuration directive for high-impact modules.  Focus on modules that handle requests, proxies, or authentication.
    *   **Testing:**  *Extensively* test module configurations, including negative testing (attempting to exploit potential misconfigurations).
    *   **Documentation:**  Refer to the official Apache documentation for each module to understand secure configuration practices.  Pay close attention to security warnings.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Modules:** Disable all modules that are not strictly required. This is a crucial step to reduce httpd's attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (Targeting httpd Directly)](./attack_surfaces/denial-of-service__dos__attacks__targeting_httpd_directly_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks that aim to make the *httpd server itself* unavailable to legitimate users by exhausting its resources.
*   **httpd Contribution:**  httpd is the *direct target* of the DoS attack, and its configuration and resource limits determine its resilience.
*   **Example:**  A Slowloris attack targeting httpd, which keeps many connections open with slow data transfer, exhausting httpd's connection pool.  A flood of HTTP requests overwhelming httpd's processing capacity.
*   **Impact:**  Service unavailability (of httpd), degraded performance.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure appropriate limits within httpd on the number of concurrent connections, request sizes, and timeouts (e.g., `MaxRequestWorkers`, `Timeout`, `KeepAliveTimeout`).  These are *httpd-specific* settings.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Use httpd modules like `mod_qos`, `mod_evasive`, or `mod_security` to limit the rate of requests from individual clients or IP addresses.  These modules operate *within* httpd.
    *   **Connection Management:**  Use httpd modules like `mod_reqtimeout` to mitigate slow-request attacks *at the httpd level*.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting (Against httpd)](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smugglingsplitting__against_httpd_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting inconsistencies in how HTTP requests are parsed by front-end proxies and the *back-end Apache httpd server* to bypass security controls or inject malicious content.
*   **httpd Contribution:**  httpd's request parsing logic is a *key factor* in the vulnerability; the attack is successful due to how *httpd itself* handles the crafted request.
*   **Example:**  An attacker crafts a request that is interpreted as two separate requests by the back-end httpd server, allowing them to access restricted resources or inject malicious content into a subsequent request *handled by httpd*.
*   **Impact:**  Bypassing security controls, unauthorized access, request forgery, cache poisoning (all directly affecting httpd's behavior).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Consistent Configuration:** Ensure that front-end proxies and *Apache httpd* are configured to handle HTTP requests in a consistent manner, particularly regarding `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers.  This includes httpd's configuration.
    *   **HTTP/2:**  Using HTTP/2 can help mitigate some request smuggling vulnerabilities, as it has stricter request parsing rules.  This would involve configuring httpd for HTTP/2.
    *   **Keep httpd Updated:**  Ensure httpd is updated to the latest version, as patches often address these types of vulnerabilities *within httpd's parsing logic*.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Features:** If not using chunked encoding, consider disabling it within httpd's configuration.
