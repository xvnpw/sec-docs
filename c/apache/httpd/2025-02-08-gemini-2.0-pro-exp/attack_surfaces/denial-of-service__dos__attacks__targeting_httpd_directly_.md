# Deep Analysis: Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting Apache httpd

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack surface specifically targeting the Apache httpd web server.  This includes identifying vulnerabilities within httpd's configuration and operation that could be exploited to cause service disruption, and to recommend specific, actionable mitigation strategies within the context of httpd itself.  We aim to provide the development team with concrete steps to harden the httpd configuration against DoS attacks.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on DoS attacks that directly target the `httpd` process and its resources.  It *does not* cover:

*   DoS attacks targeting network infrastructure (e.g., SYN floods at the network layer).  While these can impact httpd, they are outside the scope of *httpd's* direct control.
*   DoS attacks targeting application logic *served by* httpd (e.g., vulnerabilities in a PHP application).  This analysis is concerned with httpd itself, not the applications it hosts.
*   Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, *except* in how httpd's configuration can contribute to resilience.  We acknowledge DDoS as a significant threat, but this analysis focuses on what httpd can do internally.

The scope is limited to the configuration and modules available within the Apache httpd server (version 2.4.x, assuming a relatively recent version unless otherwise specified).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Review common httpd configurations and modules known to be susceptible to DoS attacks.  This includes examining default settings and potential misconfigurations.
2.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  For each identified vulnerability, analyze specific attack vectors that could exploit it.  This includes describing the attack mechanism and how it impacts httpd's resources.
3.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**  For each vulnerability and attack vector, evaluate the effectiveness of specific httpd configuration directives and modules in mitigating the risk.  This includes providing concrete configuration examples.
4.  **Prioritization:**  Rank the identified vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies based on their potential impact and ease of implementation.
5.  **Documentation:**  Clearly document the findings, including vulnerabilities, attack vectors, mitigation strategies, and configuration recommendations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

This section details specific DoS attack vectors targeting httpd and their mitigations.

### 4.1. Slowloris and Slow Request Attacks

*   **Vulnerability:**  httpd's default configuration can be vulnerable to attacks that hold connections open for extended periods by sending data very slowly.  This exhausts the available connection pool (limited by `MaxRequestWorkers` or similar directives).

*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker opens numerous connections to the httpd server and sends HTTP headers or request bodies at an extremely slow rate (e.g., a few bytes per minute).  httpd waits for the complete request, keeping the connection open and consuming a worker thread.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **`mod_reqtimeout` (Highly Recommended):** This module is specifically designed to combat slow request attacks.  It allows setting timeouts for receiving request headers and bodies.

        ```apache
        <IfModule reqtimeout_module>
            RequestReadTimeout header=20-40,minrate=500 body=20,minrate=500
        </IfModule>
        ```
        *   `header=20-40,minrate=500`:  Clients must send headers within 20-40 seconds, and at a minimum rate of 500 bytes/second.
        *   `body=20,minrate=500`:  Clients must send the request body within 20 seconds, at a minimum rate of 500 bytes/second.

    *   **`Timeout` and `KeepAliveTimeout` (Essential):**  These core directives control the overall connection timeout and the timeout for subsequent requests on a keep-alive connection, respectively.  Lowering these values can help, but `mod_reqtimeout` provides more granular control.

        ```apache
        Timeout 60
        KeepAliveTimeout 5
        ```

    *   **`MaxRequestWorkers` (Careful Consideration):**  Increasing this value *can* provide more resilience, but it also increases the server's resource consumption.  It should be tuned carefully based on available RAM and expected legitimate traffic.  It's *not* a primary defense against Slowloris.

### 4.2. HTTP Flood Attacks

*   **Vulnerability:**  httpd can be overwhelmed by a large volume of legitimate-looking HTTP requests, exhausting CPU, memory, or network bandwidth.

*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker sends a flood of HTTP GET or POST requests to the server, aiming to saturate its processing capacity.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **`mod_qos` (Recommended):**  This module provides Quality of Service features, including rate limiting.

        ```apache
        <IfModule qos_module>
            # Limit the number of concurrent requests from a single IP
            QS_ClientEventBlockCount 10
            # Limit the overall request rate per IP
            QS_ClientEventPerSecLimit 5
        </IfModule>
        ```

    *   **`mod_evasive` (Alternative):**  Another module for rate limiting, focusing on detecting and blocking abusive clients.

        ```apache
        <IfModule mod_evasive20.c>
            DOSHashTableSize     3097
            DOSPageCount        2
            DOSSiteCount        50
            DOSPageInterval     1
            DOSSiteInterval     1
            DOSBlockingPeriod   10
        </IfModule>
        ```
        *   These settings control how `mod_evasive` tracks requests and blocks clients that exceed the defined limits.

    *   **`mod_security` (Advanced):**  A Web Application Firewall (WAF) module that can be configured with complex rules to detect and block malicious traffic, including flood attacks.  Requires more configuration effort.  Can be used to implement more sophisticated rate limiting and anomaly detection.

        ```apache
        # Example rule (simplified) - block if more than 100 requests in 10 seconds
        SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent "@rx (.*)" "id:1,phase:1,t:none,t:lowercase,deny,status:403,msg:'Too many requests',logdata:'%{matched_var}',setvar:ip.req_count=+1,expirevar:ip.req_count=10,initcol:ip=%{REMOTE_ADDR}"
        SecRule IP:REQ_COUNT "@gt 100" "id:2,phase:1,t:none,deny,status:403,msg:'Rate limit exceeded',log"

        ```

    * **Resource Limits (ulimit, cgroups):** While not strictly *within* httpd, setting resource limits at the operating system level (using `ulimit` on Linux or cgroups) can prevent httpd from consuming excessive system resources, even under attack. This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.

### 4.3. Large Request Attacks

*   **Vulnerability:**  httpd can be vulnerable to attacks that send excessively large requests (e.g., huge headers or POST bodies), consuming memory and processing time.

*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker sends a request with an extremely large header (e.g., a very long cookie) or a massive POST body.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **`LimitRequestFields` (Essential):**  Limits the number of request header fields.
    *   **`LimitRequestFieldSize` (Essential):**  Limits the size of each request header field.
    *   **`LimitRequestBody` (Essential):**  Limits the size of the request body.

        ```apache
        LimitRequestFields 50
        LimitRequestFieldSize 8190
        LimitRequestBody 10485760  # 10 MB
        ```

### 4.4. Keep-Alive Exhaustion

* **Vulnerability:** While Keep-Alive is beneficial for performance, an attacker can abuse it to hold connections open, exhausting resources.

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker opens many connections and requests a resource, utilizing Keep-Alive. However, the attacker never sends subsequent requests, tying up the connection until `KeepAliveTimeout` expires.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **`KeepAliveTimeout` (Essential):** Set this to a relatively low value (e.g., 5-10 seconds).  Balance this against the performance benefits of Keep-Alive for legitimate users.
    *   **`MaxKeepAliveRequests` (Useful):** Limit the number of requests allowed on a single Keep-Alive connection.

        ```apache
        KeepAlive On
        MaxKeepAliveRequests 100
        KeepAliveTimeout 5
        ```

## 5. Prioritization and Recommendations

1.  **Highest Priority (Implement Immediately):**
    *   Implement `mod_reqtimeout` to mitigate Slowloris and slow request attacks.
    *   Configure `LimitRequestFields`, `LimitRequestFieldSize`, and `LimitRequestBody` to prevent large request attacks.
    *   Set appropriate values for `Timeout` and `KeepAliveTimeout`.
    *   Implement OS-level resource limits (ulimit, cgroups).

2.  **High Priority (Implement Soon):**
    *   Implement `mod_qos` or `mod_evasive` for rate limiting to mitigate HTTP flood attacks.
    *   Configure `MaxKeepAliveRequests`.

3.  **Medium Priority (Consider Based on Risk Assessment):**
    *   Implement `mod_security` for more advanced protection and custom rules. This requires significant expertise.
    *   Fine-tune `MaxRequestWorkers` based on server resources and traffic patterns.
