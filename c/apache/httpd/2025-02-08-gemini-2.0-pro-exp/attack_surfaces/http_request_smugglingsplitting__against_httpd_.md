# Deep Analysis: HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting Against Apache httpd

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics of HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting vulnerabilities specifically targeting Apache httpd (referred to as "httpd" throughout this document).  This includes identifying the specific httpd configurations, modules, and parsing behaviors that contribute to the vulnerability, and proposing concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  We aim to provide developers with the knowledge to proactively prevent and remediate this class of vulnerability.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on:

*   **Apache httpd as the back-end server:**  While front-end proxies are involved in many smuggling attacks, our focus is on how httpd *interprets* and *processes* potentially malicious requests.
*   **Vulnerabilities arising from httpd's request parsing:** We will examine specific directives, modules, and code paths within httpd that can be exploited.
*   **HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:**  We will consider both protocols, with a focus on how httpd's handling differs between them.
*   **Common smuggling techniques:**  We will analyze techniques like CL.TE, TE.CL, and TE.TE, focusing on httpd's role.
* **Mitigation within httpd configuration and code:** We will not cover network-level mitigations (like WAF rules) except where they directly interact with httpd's behavior.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Review of Apache httpd Documentation:**  We will thoroughly examine the official httpd documentation for relevant directives, modules, and configuration options related to request processing, header handling, and chunked encoding.
2.  **Analysis of Known CVEs:**  We will study past Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) related to HTTP request smuggling in httpd to understand specific attack vectors and patched code.
3.  **Examination of httpd Source Code (Targeted):**  We will perform targeted source code analysis of relevant modules (e.g., `mod_proxy`, `mod_http`, core request parsing logic) to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This will be focused on areas identified in steps 1 and 2.
4.  **Configuration Analysis:** We will analyze default and recommended httpd configurations to identify potential weaknesses and recommend secure configurations.
5.  **Testing (Conceptual):** While we won't perform live penetration testing, we will describe conceptual test cases to illustrate how httpd's behavior can be exploited.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. Core Vulnerability Mechanics (httpd's Role)

HTTP Request Smuggling exploits discrepancies in how multiple HTTP devices (proxies, load balancers, and the back-end server â€“ httpd in our case) interpret a single, ambiguous HTTP request.  The attacker crafts a request that appears as one request to the front-end, but as two (or more) requests to httpd.  This "smuggled" second request bypasses front-end security checks.

httpd's role is crucial because it's the *final interpreter* of the request.  The vulnerability exists because of how *httpd itself* parses and processes the potentially ambiguous `Content-Length` (CL) and `Transfer-Encoding` (TE) headers.

**Key Smuggling Techniques (and httpd's Interpretation):**

*   **CL.TE (Content-Length . Transfer-Encoding):** The front-end uses the `Content-Length` header, while httpd prioritizes the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header.  The attacker sends a request with both headers.  The front-end sees the entire request as one, based on `Content-Length`.  httpd, seeing `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, processes the request body as chunked, potentially treating part of the body as a *second, smuggled request*.

    *   **httpd Specifics:** httpd's core request parsing logic, likely within `mod_http` or related functions, prioritizes `Transfer-Encoding` over `Content-Length` when both are present.  This is often compliant with RFCs, but creates the vulnerability when combined with a misconfigured front-end.
*   **TE.CL (Transfer-Encoding . Content-Length):** The front-end uses the `Transfer-Encoding` header, while httpd prioritizes the `Content-Length` header.  The attacker sends a chunked request, but also includes a `Content-Length` that is shorter than the actual chunked data.  The front-end processes the entire chunked request.  httpd, seeing the `Content-Length`, only processes part of the request, leaving the remaining chunked data to be interpreted as a *new, smuggled request*.

    *   **httpd Specifics:**  httpd's request parsing logic, in this scenario, prioritizes `Content-Length`.  This might be due to specific configuration directives or default behavior.  The key is that httpd *stops* processing the request body after reading the number of bytes specified in `Content-Length`, even if more data (the smuggled request) remains.
*   **TE.TE (Transfer-Encoding . Transfer-Encoding):** Both the front-end and httpd support `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, but the attacker obfuscates one of the `Transfer-Encoding` headers in a way that the front-end ignores it, but httpd still processes it.  For example, using variations like `Transfer-Encoding: chunked\r\nTransfer-Encoding: x` (where 'x' is an invalid value).  The front-end sees one chunked request.  httpd, after processing the first `Transfer-Encoding`, might still process the second, leading to smuggling.

    *   **httpd Specifics:** This highlights the importance of httpd's header parsing robustness.  Even seemingly minor variations in header names or values can lead to different interpretations.  httpd's handling of invalid or malformed `Transfer-Encoding` headers is critical.  Modules like `mod_headers` might play a role if they are used to modify or filter headers.

### 2.2. Relevant httpd Configuration Directives and Modules

Several httpd configuration directives and modules are relevant to HTTP Request Smuggling:

*   **`mod_proxy` (and related modules):** If httpd is acting as a reverse proxy, `mod_proxy` and its related modules (e.g., `mod_proxy_http`, `mod_proxy_balancer`) are *highly* relevant.  These modules handle forwarding requests to back-end servers and can be misconfigured to create smuggling vulnerabilities.  Directives like `ProxyPass`, `ProxyPassReverse`, and `ProxyPreserveHost` influence how headers are handled.
*   **`mod_http`:** This core module handles HTTP request processing and is directly involved in parsing headers like `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`.  Its internal logic is a primary target for analysis.
*   **`mod_headers`:** This module allows modification of HTTP request and response headers.  While not directly causing smuggling, it *could* be misused to obfuscate headers or interfere with correct header processing, potentially exacerbating a smuggling vulnerability.
*   **`mod_reqtimeout`:** This module sets timeouts for receiving client requests.  While not directly related to smuggling, it can influence the success of certain attacks, particularly those involving slowloris-style techniques combined with smuggling.
*   **`LimitRequestBody`:** This directive limits the size of the request body.  While it can help mitigate some denial-of-service attacks, it doesn't directly prevent request smuggling.
*   **`HttpProtocolOptions`:** (Apache 2.4.24 and later) This directive provides options to control HTTP protocol handling, including `Strict` and `Unsafe`.  `Strict` enforces stricter request parsing, which can help mitigate some smuggling vulnerabilities.
* **`ProxyBadHeader`:** Controls how httpd handles bad headers from the backend server when acting as a proxy.

### 2.3. CVE Analysis (Examples)

Several CVEs have been associated with HTTP Request Smuggling in httpd.  Examining these provides valuable insights:

*   **CVE-2022-26377:**  This vulnerability involved `mod_proxy_ajp`.  An attacker could smuggle requests due to improper handling of request headers, leading to information disclosure or denial of service.  This highlights the importance of proxy modules in smuggling vulnerabilities.
*   **CVE-2021-40438:** This is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in `mod_proxy`. While not purely request smuggling, it demonstrates how crafted requests can bypass intended restrictions.
*   **CVE-2019-17567:**  This vulnerability involved `mod_proxy_wstunnel`.  An attacker could smuggle WebSocket traffic, highlighting the potential for smuggling in specialized modules.
*   **CVE-2005-2700:** A very old, but illustrative, example.  It involved a flaw in how httpd handled chunked encoding, allowing for request smuggling.  This demonstrates that the core issue has been present for a long time.

These CVEs demonstrate that vulnerabilities can arise in various modules, not just the core HTTP processing logic.  They also highlight the importance of keeping httpd updated.

### 2.4. Conceptual Test Cases (Illustrating httpd's Behavior)

Let's consider a CL.TE scenario, assuming a front-end proxy that uses `Content-Length` and an httpd back-end that prioritizes `Transfer-Encoding`:

**Malicious Request:**

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable.example.com
Content-Length: 44
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable.example.com


```

**Expected Front-End Behavior:** The front-end sees a single POST request with a body length of 44 bytes.

**Expected httpd Behavior:** httpd sees the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header and processes the body as chunked.  The `0` indicates the end of the chunked data.  However, the remaining data (`GET /admin HTTP/1.1...`) is then interpreted as a *new, separate HTTP request*.  This smuggled request bypasses any front-end security checks that might have been in place for `/admin`.

### 2.5. Mitigation Strategies (httpd-Specific)

Beyond the high-level mitigations, here are httpd-specific recommendations:

1.  **`HttpProtocolOptions Strict`:**  Use the `HttpProtocolOptions Strict` directive (available in Apache 2.4.24 and later) to enforce stricter request parsing.  This can help prevent some smuggling attacks based on malformed or ambiguous requests.

2.  **Disable Chunked Encoding (If Possible):** If your application *does not require* chunked encoding, disable it in httpd's configuration.  This eliminates the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` attack vector entirely.  This can be done by carefully configuring `mod_proxy` and ensuring no other modules enable it.  However, this is often *not feasible* in modern web applications.

3.  **Careful `mod_proxy` Configuration:** If using httpd as a reverse proxy, meticulously configure `mod_proxy` and related modules.  Ensure that:
    *   `ProxyPreserveHost` is used appropriately.
    *   Headers are not being modified in ways that could introduce discrepancies.
    *   The back-end server is also configured to handle requests consistently.
    *   Consider using `ProxyPass` with the `flushpackets=on` option to help prevent some smuggling attacks.

4.  **Regular Updates:**  This is *crucial*.  Keep httpd updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches that address request smuggling vulnerabilities.  Pay close attention to release notes and CVE announcements.

5.  **HTTP/2:** Migrate to HTTP/2.  HTTP/2 has stricter request parsing rules and a single, well-defined way to determine request boundaries, eliminating the ambiguity that enables many smuggling attacks.  Configure httpd to use HTTP/2 (using `mod_http2`).

6.  **Input Validation (Within Application Logic):** While not strictly an httpd configuration, ensure that your application logic performs robust input validation.  Even if a request is smuggled, proper validation can limit the impact.

7.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (with httpd Awareness):** While a WAF is not a primary focus, a well-configured WAF *can* help detect and block request smuggling attempts.  Some WAFs can be configured to be aware of httpd's specific behavior, allowing for more accurate detection.

8. **Review Custom Modules:** If you are using any custom-built httpd modules, thoroughly review them for potential vulnerabilities related to request parsing and header handling.

## 3. Conclusion

HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting is a serious vulnerability that can have severe consequences.  By understanding how httpd processes HTTP requests, particularly the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers, and by carefully configuring httpd and related modules, developers can significantly reduce the risk of these attacks.  Regular updates, the use of `HttpProtocolOptions Strict`, and migration to HTTP/2 are key mitigation strategies.  A layered approach, combining httpd-specific configurations with network-level defenses and robust application-level validation, provides the most comprehensive protection.
