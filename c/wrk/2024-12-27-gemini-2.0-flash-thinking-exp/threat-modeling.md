| Threat | Description (What the attacker might do and how) | Impact | Affected `wrk` Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Resource Exhaustion via Maliciously High Load** | An attacker might intentionally configure `wrk` with excessively high parameters (threads, connections, duration) to flood the target application with requests, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network). This is done by manipulating the `wrk` command or configuration. | Application becomes unresponsive, leading to denial of service for legitimate users. Potential for data corruption or system crashes due to resource starvation. | `wrk` configuration parameters (threads, connections, duration), request generation logic. | High | - **Controlled Environment:** Run `wrk` in isolated testing or staging environments. <br> - **Gradual Load Increase:** Start with low load and incrementally increase while monitoring application performance. <br> - **Resource Monitoring:** Implement robust monitoring of the target application's resources during `wrk` execution. <br> - **Configuration Review:** Establish a process for reviewing and approving `wrk` configurations before execution. <br> - **Automated Testing with Limits:** Integrate `wrk` into automated testing pipelines with predefined and safe parameter limits. |
| **Tampering with `wrk` Scripts (Lua)** | If using `wrk`'s Lua scripting capabilities, an attacker could modify the Lua scripts to inject malicious logic. This could involve sending unexpected requests, manipulating request headers in ways that exploit application vulnerabilities, or potentially attempting to interact with the underlying system if the application is vulnerable. | Can lead to exploitation of application vulnerabilities, data manipulation, or even remote code execution on the target application if the application is susceptible to the crafted requests generated by the modified `wrk` script. | `wrk` Lua scripting engine, custom Lua scripts. | High | - **Secure Access Control:** Implement strong access controls to the systems and repositories where `wrk` scripts are stored. <br> - **Code Review:** Implement code review processes for `wrk` Lua scripts, especially for security implications. <br> - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `wrk` with the minimum necessary privileges. <br> - **Input Sanitization:** Ensure any data used within Lua scripts is sanitized to prevent injection attacks. |
| **Elevation of Privilege via Exploiting `wrk` Vulnerabilities** | If `wrk` itself has vulnerabilities, an attacker with control over the execution environment could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges on the system running `wrk`. This could then be used as a stepping stone to attack the target application or other systems. | Potential for full system compromise on the machine running `wrk`, which could then be used to further compromise the target application or its environment. | `wrk` executable, underlying libraries. | Critical | - **Keep `wrk` Updated:** Regularly update `wrk` to the latest version to patch any known vulnerabilities. <br> - **Run `wrk` with Least Privilege:** Execute `wrk` with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running it as root unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. <br> - **Containerization:** Run `wrk` within a containerized environment with restricted privileges. |
