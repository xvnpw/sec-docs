# BUSINESS POSTURE

Redis is a mature, widely-used, open-source project. It's not a startup, but rather a critical piece of infrastructure for many companies, ranging from small startups to Fortune 500 enterprises. The primary business goals are performance, reliability, and data persistence (optional). The project aims to provide a high-performance, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.

Business priorities:

- Performance: Extremely low latency data access.
- Reliability: High availability and data consistency.
- Scalability: Ability to handle increasing workloads.
- Data Durability (Optional): Configurable persistence options to prevent data loss.
- Operational Simplicity: Ease of deployment, configuration, and management.
- Community Support: Active and engaged community for support and contributions.
- Security: Protecting data from unauthorized access and ensuring the integrity of the system.

Most important business risks:

- Data Loss: Loss of in-memory data due to server crashes or power outages (if persistence is not configured or fails).
- Performance Degradation: Unexpected slowdowns impacting application performance.
- Security Breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Redis.
- Downtime: Service interruptions leading to application unavailability.
- Data Corruption: Data inconsistencies due to bugs or operational errors.
- Scalability Bottlenecks: Inability to handle increased load, leading to performance issues.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls (based on the GitHub repository and common Redis deployments):

- security control: Authentication: Redis supports password authentication (AUTH command) to restrict access. Implemented in Redis server core.
- security control: Network Security: Typically deployed within a trusted network environment, often behind firewalls and with restricted access policies. Implemented at the network/infrastructure level.
- security control: TLS/SSL Encryption: Redis supports TLS/SSL for encrypting client-server communication and cluster communication. Implemented in Redis server core and client libraries.
- security control: Command Renaming/Disabling: Sensitive commands can be renamed or disabled to prevent accidental or malicious use. Implemented in Redis configuration (redis.conf).
- security control: Access Control Lists (ACLs) (Redis 6+): Fine-grained access control to restrict commands and data access based on user roles. Implemented in Redis server core.
- security control: Client-Side Encryption: Data can be encrypted by the application before being stored in Redis. Implemented in client applications.
- security control: Auditing: Redis can log commands and events to a file or syslog. Implemented in Redis configuration (redis.conf).
- security control: Regular Security Updates: The Redis project releases updates to address security vulnerabilities. Implemented through system updates and package management.
- security control: Bounded Memory Usage: Redis can be configured with a maximum memory limit (maxmemory) to prevent it from consuming all available memory. Implemented in Redis configuration (redis.conf).
- security control: Lua Scripting Security: Redis provides a secure environment for executing Lua scripts, limiting access to potentially dangerous operations. Implemented in Redis server core.

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Default Configuration: Redis, by default, binds to all interfaces and has no authentication enabled. This is a known and accepted risk, requiring administrators to configure security properly.
- accepted risk: Denial of Service (DoS): Redis, like any network service, is susceptible to DoS attacks. Mitigation relies on network-level protections and resource limits.
- accepted risk: Insider Threats: Malicious or negligent insiders with network access can potentially bypass security controls. Mitigation relies on strong access controls and monitoring.
- accepted risk: Data Exposure in Memory: Data stored in Redis resides in memory, making it potentially vulnerable to memory scraping attacks if the server is compromised.

Recommended security controls:

- Implement Network Segmentation: Isolate Redis instances within a dedicated network segment with strict access control rules.
- Enable and Configure ACLs: Use Redis 6+ ACLs to implement the principle of least privilege.
- Enforce Strong Passwords: Use strong, randomly generated passwords for authentication.
- Monitor Redis Logs: Regularly review Redis logs for suspicious activity.
- Implement Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Deploy IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for malicious activity targeting Redis.
- Regularly Audit Security Configuration: Periodically review and update the Redis security configuration to address emerging threats.

Security requirements:

- Authentication:
    - All clients must authenticate before accessing Redis data.
    - Strong password policies must be enforced.
    - Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered (likely implemented externally).
- Authorization:
    - Access to Redis commands and data must be controlled using ACLs.
    - The principle of least privilege must be applied.
- Input Validation:
    - Redis itself does not perform extensive input validation as it primarily stores binary data. Input validation is largely the responsibility of the client application.
    - Client applications must sanitize data before storing it in Redis to prevent injection attacks (e.g., Lua script injection).
- Cryptography:
    - TLS/SSL must be used to encrypt all client-server and cluster communication.
    - Strong ciphers and protocols must be used.
    - Client-side encryption should be considered for sensitive data.
    - Key management procedures must be established and followed.

- Static Analysis: The Redis project uses static analysis tools (e.g., linters) to identify potential code quality and security issues. Implemented in CI workflows.
- Testing: Extensive test suite to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. Implemented in CI workflows.
- Dependency Management: Dependencies are carefully managed and reviewed for security vulnerabilities.
- Signed Releases: Official Redis releases are digitally signed to ensure authenticity and integrity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes to protect:

- Data access and retrieval: Ensuring fast and reliable access to data stored in Redis.
- Data consistency: Maintaining data integrity and consistency across replicas.
- Service availability: Preventing downtime and ensuring continuous operation.

Data to protect and sensitivity:

- Cached application data: Sensitivity varies depending on the application. Can range from non-sensitive to highly sensitive (e.g., session data, user profiles, financial data).
- Database data: If Redis is used as a primary database, the data sensitivity is determined by the application's data model.
- Message queue data: If Redis is used as a message broker, the data sensitivity depends on the messages being exchanged.
- Configuration data: Redis configuration files may contain sensitive information such as passwords and access keys.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
