# Attack Tree Analysis for redis/redis

Objective: To gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Redis, disrupt the application's functionality, or achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the Redis server, ultimately compromising the application relying on it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Redis {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_redis_{critical}.md)

*Description:* This is the overarching objective of the attacker. It represents the successful compromise of the application through vulnerabilities related to the Redis instance.
*Impact:* Very High - Complete application compromise, including data loss, service disruption, and potential further system compromise.
*Why Critical:* This is the ultimate goal; achieving this means the attacker has succeeded.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Data Breach/Exfiltration](./attack_tree_paths/1__data_breachexfiltration.md)

*Description:* The attacker aims to steal sensitive data stored within the Redis database.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Unauthorized Access {CRITICAL} [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_unauthorized_access_{critical}__high_risk_.md)

*Description:* Direct access to the Redis instance without proper authentication. This often occurs when Redis is exposed to the network without a password or with inadequate firewall rules.
*Likelihood:* High - Many automated scanners actively search for exposed Redis instances.
*Impact:* Very High - Complete data loss; potential for further system compromise.
*Effort:* Very Low - Requires minimal effort; automated tools can find and connect to open instances.
*Skill Level:* Novice - No specialized skills are needed.
*Detection Difficulty:* Medium - Connections will appear in logs, but distinguishing malicious from legitimate connections requires context. Failed authentication attempts (if a password *is* set) are a strong indicator.
*Why Critical:* Bypasses all other security if successful; direct path to data.
*Why High Risk:* High likelihood and very high impact with very low effort.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Weak/Default Credentials [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_weakdefault_credentials__high_risk_.md)

*Description:* Exploiting weak, default, or easily guessable passwords to gain access to the Redis instance.
*Likelihood:* High - Many deployments use default or weak passwords.
*Impact:* Very High - Complete data loss.
*Effort:* Very Low - Automated tools can brute-force weak passwords quickly.
*Skill Level:* Novice - Basic scripting or use of existing tools.
*Detection Difficulty:* Medium - Multiple failed login attempts would be logged.
*Why High Risk:* High likelihood and very high impact with very low effort.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/3__remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*Description:* The attacker aims to execute arbitrary code on the Redis server, gaining full control over it.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Unauthorized Access {CRITICAL} [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_unauthorized_access_{critical}__high_risk_.md)

*Description:* Gaining direct, unauthenticated access to the Redis instance, with the intention of achieving RCE. This is the same entry point as 1.1, but with a different ultimate goal.
*Likelihood:* High - Same as 1.1.
*Impact:* Very High - Complete system compromise.
*Effort:* Very Low - Same as 1.1.
*Skill Level:* Novice - Same as 1.1.
*Detection Difficulty:* Medium - Same as 1.1.
*Why Critical:* A crucial stepping stone to achieving RCE.
*Why High Risk:* High likelihood and very high impact with very low effort.
