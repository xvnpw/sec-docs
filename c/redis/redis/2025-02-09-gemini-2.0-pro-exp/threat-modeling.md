# Threat Model Analysis for redis/redis

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access and Data Manipulation](./threats/unauthorized_access_and_data_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Redis instance without proper authentication. This could be due to a misconfigured Redis server (no password set, a weak default password, or exposed network access), or leaked credentials. The attacker can then issue arbitrary Redis commands, including reading, modifying, and deleting data.
*   **Impact:** Complete data compromise (read, modify, delete). The attacker could steal sensitive data, corrupt existing data, or delete all data, leading to data loss, service disruption, and potential reputational damage.  This is the most fundamental and critical threat.
*   **Affected Component:** Redis Server (core), Authentication mechanisms (`requirepass`, ACLs).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:** *Always* require authentication. Use strong, unique passwords (or preferably ACLs in Redis 6+).  Never deploy Redis without authentication.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Redis server on a private network, accessible *only* to authorized clients. Use firewalls and security groups provided by your cloud provider or network infrastructure.  Do not expose Redis directly to the public internet.
    *   **Credential Management:** Securely store and manage Redis credentials. Never hardcode them in application code. Use environment variables, secrets management services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or configuration management tools.
    *   **Regular Password/ACL Rotation:** Implement a policy for regularly rotating Redis passwords or ACL credentials.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Untrusted Input](./threats/command_injection_via_untrusted_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is passed directly to Redis commands without proper sanitization or validation. This is particularly dangerous with commands like `EVAL` (Lua scripting) or commands that construct keys dynamically based on user input. If an application uses user input to build a key (e.g., `SET user:{user_input} "value"`), an attacker could inject arbitrary Redis commands.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data deletion, potential for denial of service, and, in severe cases with `EVAL`, potential for *remote code execution* on the Redis server (if the Lua environment is not properly sandboxed). This is a high-severity threat due to the potential for RCE.
*   **Affected Component:** Redis Server (core), `EVAL` command, any command accepting user input for key names or values.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Strictly validate and sanitize *all* user-supplied input before using it in *any* Redis command. Use whitelisting approaches where possible (allow only known-good characters).
    *   **Parameterized Queries (Conceptual):** While Redis doesn't have parameterized queries in the same way as SQL databases, strive for the same principle: separate data from commands. Avoid directly embedding user input into command strings.
    *   **Lua Script Security:** If using `EVAL`, treat Lua scripts as code and apply rigorous security practices. Avoid dynamic script generation based on user input. Use a Lua linter and static analysis tools. Consider disabling `EVAL` entirely if it's not strictly necessary.
    *   **Command Renaming/Disabling:** Rename or disable dangerous commands like `EVAL`, `CONFIG`, `FLUSHALL`, `FLUSHDB`, and `KEYS` if they are not absolutely required. Use the `rename-command` directive in `redis.conf`.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Memory)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__memory_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests or stores a large amount of data in Redis, exceeding the configured memory limits. This can be done by creating many large keys or by exploiting an application vulnerability that allows uncontrolled data storage in Redis.
*   **Impact:** Redis becomes unresponsive or crashes, leading to denial of service for all legitimate clients. Data loss may occur if persistence is not configured or if the crash occurs before data is written to disk.
*   **Affected Component:** Redis Server (core), Memory management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **`maxmemory` Configuration:** Set the `maxmemory` directive in `redis.conf` to a reasonable limit based on available system resources. This is a *critical* configuration setting.
    *   **Eviction Policies:** Configure an appropriate eviction policy (e.g., `volatile-lru`, `allkeys-lru`, `volatile-ttl`) to determine how Redis handles memory pressure when the `maxmemory` limit is reached. Choose a policy that aligns with your application's data usage patterns.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the *client side* to prevent a single client from overwhelming Redis with requests.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor Redis memory usage and set up alerts to detect potential memory exhaustion issues *before* they cause an outage.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (CPU)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__cpu_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends computationally expensive commands to Redis, such as `KEYS *` (which iterates over *all* keys), complex or poorly written Lua scripts, or large `SORT` operations, consuming excessive CPU resources.
*   **Impact:** Redis becomes slow or unresponsive, leading to denial of service for legitimate clients. This can severely impact application performance.
*   **Affected Component:** Redis Server (core), CPU-bound commands.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `KEYS *`:** *Never* use the `KEYS *` command in a production environment. Use `SCAN` for iterative key retrieval, which is much less impactful.
    *   **Lua Script Optimization:** Optimize Lua scripts for performance. Avoid computationally intensive operations within Lua scripts. Thoroughly test and profile Lua scripts before deploying them.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the client side, especially for potentially expensive commands.
    *   **Command Renaming/Disabling:** Rename or disable expensive commands (like `KEYS`, and potentially `SORT` if misused) if they are not essential.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor Redis CPU usage and set up alerts to detect high CPU utilization.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerable Redis Modules](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerable_redis_modules.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a loaded Redis module. Modules extend Redis functionality, but they can introduce significant security risks if they are not properly vetted, securely developed, and kept up-to-date. A vulnerable module could allow for a wide range of attacks.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the module and the specific vulnerability. Could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution on the Redis server, potentially leading to *complete system compromise*. This is a high-severity threat due to the potential for RCE and privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** Redis Modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Module Vetting:** Thoroughly vet any Redis modules *before* using them. Review the source code (if available), check for known vulnerabilities, and assess the module's security posture and the reputation of the developer.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Redis modules updated to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities. Subscribe to security advisories for any modules you use.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Redis with the least privileges necessary. Avoid running Redis as the root user.
    *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Consider using sandboxing techniques to isolate Redis modules and limit their access to the system. This is a more complex mitigation but can significantly reduce the impact of a module vulnerability.

## Threat: [Data Leakage via Unencrypted Connections](./threats/data_leakage_via_unencrypted_connections.md)

* **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the Redis client and server because the connection is not encrypted using TLS/SSL. This is a significant risk if the client and server are on different networks, communicate over the public internet, or if the internal network is not fully trusted.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored in Redis. The attacker can read all data transmitted between the client and server, including credentials, application data, and any other information stored in Redis.
* **Affected Component:** Network communication between Redis client and server.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **TLS/SSL Encryption:** *Always* enable TLS/SSL encryption for all Redis connections. Configure Redis with appropriate certificates and keys, and ensure that all clients are configured to use TLS. This is a fundamental security best practice.
    *   **Stunnel or Similar:** If the Redis client library does not natively support TLS, use a tool like Stunnel to create an encrypted tunnel between the client and the server.
