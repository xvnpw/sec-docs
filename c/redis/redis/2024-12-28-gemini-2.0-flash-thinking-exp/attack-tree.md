## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to application data, manipulate application behavior, or disrupt application availability by leveraging Redis vulnerabilities (focusing on high-risk scenarios).

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   Compromise Application via Redis Exploitation (OR)
    *   Exploit Direct Redis Access (OR)
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Lack of Authentication (AND)
            *   Identify Exposed Redis Instance (e.g., Shodan, network scan)
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Connect to Redis Instance
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Execute Arbitrary Redis Commands (e.g., `CONFIG SET dir`, `CONFIG SET dbfilename`, `SAVE`, `FLUSHALL`, `SHUTDOWN`)
                *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Read Sensitive Application Data from Redis
                *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Modify Application Data in Redis
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Command Injection via Application (AND)
            *   Identify Application Input that Directly Constructs Redis Commands
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Inject Malicious Redis Commands (e.g., `EVAL "os.execute('malicious_command')" 0`, `SET key "$(malicious_command)"`)
                *   Execute Arbitrary Redis Commands with Application Privileges
                    *   Read/Modify Application Data

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

**High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Direct Redis Access -> Lack of Authentication -> Connect to Redis Instance -> Execute Arbitrary Redis Commands -> Read Sensitive Application Data from Redis**

*   **Attack Vector:**
    1. **Identify Exposed Redis Instance:** The attacker uses network scanning tools or services like Shodan to find publicly accessible Redis instances that are not protected by authentication.
    2. **Connect to Redis Instance:**  Once an exposed instance is found, the attacker uses a Redis client to connect to it, as no password is required.
    3. **Execute Arbitrary Redis Commands:**  With an open connection, the attacker can execute any Redis command. In this case, they would use commands to locate and read keys containing sensitive application data. Examples include using `KEYS *` to list all keys and then `GET key_name` to retrieve the data, or using `SCAN` for more efficient key iteration.
    4. **Read Sensitive Application Data from Redis:** The attacker successfully retrieves sensitive information stored within the Redis database, potentially including user credentials, personal data, or business-critical information.

**High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Direct Redis Access -> Lack of Authentication -> Connect to Redis Instance -> Execute Arbitrary Redis Commands -> Modify Application Data in Redis**

*   **Attack Vector:**
    1. **Identify Exposed Redis Instance:**  Similar to the previous path, the attacker identifies an unprotected Redis instance.
    2. **Connect to Redis Instance:** The attacker establishes a connection without needing credentials.
    3. **Execute Arbitrary Redis Commands:** The attacker uses Redis commands to locate and modify application data. This could involve using `SET key value` to overwrite existing data, `DEL key` to delete data, or using list/set manipulation commands to alter data structures.
    4. **Modify Application Data in Redis:** The attacker successfully alters application data, potentially leading to incorrect application behavior, data corruption, or privilege escalation if user roles or permissions are stored in Redis.

**High-Risk Path 3: Exploit Direct Redis Access -> Command Injection via Application -> Inject Malicious Redis Commands -> Execute Arbitrary Redis Commands with Application Privileges -> Read/Modify Application Data**

*   **Attack Vector:**
    1. **Identify Application Input that Directly Constructs Redis Commands:** The attacker analyzes the application's code or behavior to find input fields or parameters that are directly used to build Redis commands without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    2. **Inject Malicious Redis Commands:** The attacker crafts input that includes malicious Redis commands. For example, if the application uses user input to set a key, the attacker might input `keyname\r\nDEL another_key\r\n` to inject a `DEL` command. Another example is using the `EVAL` command to execute Lua code within Redis.
    3. **Execute Arbitrary Redis Commands with Application Privileges:** The application, due to the injected commands, executes the attacker's commands within the Redis context. The privileges are limited to what the application's Redis connection is authorized to do.
    4. **Read/Modify Application Data:**  Using the injected commands, the attacker can read or modify data within Redis, similar to the direct access scenarios, but this time leveraging the application's connection.

**Critical Node 1: Lack of Authentication**

*   **Attack Vector:** The Redis instance is configured without requiring a password (`requirepass` directive not set or commented out in `redis.conf`).
*   **Consequences:** This is the most critical vulnerability as it allows anyone with network access to the Redis port to connect and execute arbitrary commands, immediately enabling all other direct access attack vectors.

**Critical Node 2: Connect to Redis Instance**

*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker successfully establishes a connection to the Redis instance, typically after bypassing authentication (or where no authentication is required).
*   **Consequences:**  A successful connection is the prerequisite for executing malicious commands and manipulating data. It signifies the attacker has gained initial access and can now interact with the Redis database.

**Critical Node 3: Execute Arbitrary Redis Commands**

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends Redis commands to the server, which are then executed. This can be achieved through direct access (after bypassing authentication) or via command injection vulnerabilities in the application.
*   **Consequences:** This node represents the point of full control over the Redis instance. The attacker can read, modify, or delete data, change the configuration, execute Lua scripts (if enabled), and even shut down the server, leading to a wide range of potential impacts.

**Critical Node 4: Inject Malicious Redis Commands**

*   **Attack Vector:** The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user input when constructing Redis commands, allowing an attacker to inject their own commands.
*   **Consequences:** Successful command injection allows the attacker to leverage the application's connection to Redis to execute arbitrary commands, potentially bypassing any network restrictions that might be in place for direct access. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and even remote code execution if Lua scripting is enabled and exploitable.
