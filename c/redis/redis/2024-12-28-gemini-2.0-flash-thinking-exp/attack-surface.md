*   **Attack Surface: Unsecured Network Interface**
    *   **Description:** Redis, by default, listens on all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`). If not properly configured, it becomes accessible from unintended networks.
    *   **How Redis Contributes:** The default binding behavior of Redis exposes it to any network reachable by the server.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network (or even the internet if the server is publicly accessible without firewall rules) can connect to the Redis instance without authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Redis data, potential data breaches, ability to execute arbitrary Redis commands, leading to data manipulation or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Bind to Specific Interface: Configure Redis to listen only on the loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`) or specific internal network interfaces using the `bind` directive in `redis.conf`.

*   **Attack Surface: Lack of Authentication**
    *   **Description:** By default, Redis does not require authentication for clients to connect and execute commands.
    *   **How Redis Contributes:** The default configuration lacks any access control mechanism.
    *   **Example:** An attacker who can connect to the Redis port can execute commands like `KEYS *`, `GET <key>`, `FLUSHALL`, potentially revealing or deleting all data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of Redis data, potential data loss, and ability to disrupt application functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable Authentication: Configure a strong password using the `requirepass` directive in `redis.conf`. Clients will need to authenticate using the `AUTH` command.
        *   Use Redis ACLs (Redis 6+): Implement more granular access control using Redis ACLs to define permissions for different users or applications.

*   **Attack Surface: Command Injection via `EVAL` (Lua Scripting)**
    *   **Description:** Redis allows executing Lua scripts using the `EVAL` command. If the application constructs these scripts using untrusted input, it can lead to command injection.
    *   **How Redis Contributes:** The `EVAL` command provides a powerful but potentially dangerous way to execute arbitrary code on the Redis server.
    *   **Example:** An application takes user input to filter data and constructs a Lua script like `EVAL "return redis.call('GET', KEYS[1])" 1 user:<user_input>`. A malicious user could input `*); redis.call('CONFIG', 'SET', 'dir', '/tmp'); redis.call('CONFIG', 'SET', 'dbfilename', 'shell.so'); redis.call('SAVE'); return 'done'` to potentially write a malicious shared object.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Redis server, potentially leading to full server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid Dynamic Script Generation: If possible, avoid constructing Lua scripts dynamically based on user input.
        *   Parameterize Scripts: Use the `EVAL` command's parameterization feature to pass data to the script instead of embedding it directly in the script string.
        *   Restrict `EVAL` Access (ACLs): If certain users or applications don't need to execute arbitrary scripts, restrict their access to the `EVAL` command using Redis ACLs.

*   **Attack Surface: Data Injection and Manipulation**
    *   **Description:** If the application doesn't properly sanitize data before storing it in Redis keys or values, attackers can inject malicious data.
    *   **How Redis Contributes:** Redis stores data as provided by the application without inherent input validation.
    *   **Example:** An application uses user input to create Redis keys. A malicious user could input a key like `user:admin\nCONFIG SET requirepass malicious_password`, potentially injecting commands that Redis might interpret if not handled carefully by the application logic retrieving and processing this data.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unexpected application behavior, potential for further exploitation if the application processes the injected data insecurely.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Validation and Sanitization:  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data before storing it in Redis keys and values.

*   **Attack Surface: Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can exploit Redis features to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network), leading to a denial of service.
    *   **How Redis Contributes:** Certain Redis commands or data structures can be resource-intensive if used maliciously.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Memory Exhaustion:** An attacker can create extremely large lists, sets, or hashes, consuming all available memory and causing Redis to crash or become unresponsive.
        *   **CPU Exhaustion:** Executing computationally expensive commands repeatedly can overload the Redis server's CPU.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, service disruption, potential infrastructure instability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   `maxmemory` Configuration: Set the `maxmemory` directive in `redis.conf` to limit the amount of memory Redis can use. Implement an eviction policy (`maxmemory-policy`) to manage memory usage.
        *   Limit Client Connections: Configure `maxclients` to prevent an excessive number of connections from overwhelming the server.
        *   Disable Dangerous Commands (rename-command): Rename or disable potentially dangerous commands like `FLUSHALL`, `KEYS`, `CONFIG` using the `rename-command` directive in `redis.conf`.

*   **Attack Surface: Exposure of Sensitive Data in Transit (Without TLS)**
    *   **Description:** Without TLS/SSL encryption, communication between the application and Redis is transmitted in plain text.
    *   **How Redis Contributes:** Redis itself doesn't enforce encryption by default.
    *   **Example:** An attacker eavesdropping on the network can capture sensitive data being exchanged between the application and Redis, including potentially authentication credentials or application data.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS/SSL: Configure Redis to use TLS/SSL encryption for client connections. This involves generating or obtaining certificates and configuring the `tls-port`, `tls-cert-file`, `tls-key-file`, and `tls-ca-cert-file` directives in `redis.conf`.
