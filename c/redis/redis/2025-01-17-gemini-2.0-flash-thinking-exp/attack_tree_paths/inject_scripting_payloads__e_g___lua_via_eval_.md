### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Scripting Payloads (e.g., Lua via EVAL)

**Attack Tree Path:** Inject Scripting Payloads (e.g., Lua via EVAL)

**Attack Vector:**

* **The attacker identifies a way to send the `EVAL` command to the Redis server with attacker-controlled input.** This is the crucial entry point. Several scenarios can lead to this:
    * **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application might construct Redis commands dynamically based on user input without proper sanitization or validation. For example, a function might take user input and directly embed it into an `EVAL` command string.
    * **Vulnerable API Endpoints:**  An API endpoint might directly expose the ability to execute Redis commands, including `EVAL`, without sufficient authentication or authorization checks.
    * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker might be able to trick the application server into sending malicious `EVAL` commands to the Redis server on their behalf.
    * **Code Injection Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in other parts of the application could allow an attacker to inject code that then interacts with Redis and sends malicious `EVAL` commands.
    * **Compromised Internal Systems:** If an attacker gains access to an internal system that interacts with Redis, they could directly send malicious `EVAL` commands.

* **The attacker crafts a malicious Lua script that, when executed by Redis, performs actions like:**
    * **Executing arbitrary system commands on the Redis server (if the `redis.call()` function is used to interact with external programs or if the `package.loadlib` function is accessible).**
        * **Technical Detail:** Redis's embedded Lua interpreter provides the `redis.call()` function, which allows executing other Redis commands. While it doesn't directly execute OS commands by default, if the Redis configuration allows loading external libraries (via `package.loadlib`), an attacker could load libraries that provide OS command execution capabilities. Even without `package.loadlib`, clever manipulation of Redis commands via `redis.call()` might indirectly lead to OS command execution in specific scenarios (though less common).
        * **Example Lua Payload:**
          ```lua
          local result = redis.call('CONFIG', 'SET', 'dir', '/tmp/');
          local result2 = redis.call('CONFIG', 'SET', 'dbfilename', 'evil.so');
          local result3 = redis.call('SAVE');
          local result4 = redis.call('MODULE', 'LOAD', '/tmp/evil.so'); -- Assuming attacker uploaded evil.so somehow
          return 'Executed!';
          ```
          This example demonstrates how an attacker might try to load a malicious Redis module. Other techniques might involve manipulating data to trigger OS commands through other application logic.
    * **Reading or writing arbitrary files on the Redis server's file system (if file system access is not restricted within the Lua environment).**
        * **Technical Detail:**  While the core Lua environment in Redis doesn't have direct file system access functions like `io.open` enabled by default for security reasons, attackers might try to leverage Redis commands to achieve similar effects. For instance, they could manipulate data stored in Redis and then trigger application logic that writes this data to a file. Alternatively, if `package.loadlib` is enabled and a vulnerable library is loaded, file system access might be possible.
        * **Example Lua Payload (Conceptual - might require specific application logic):**
          ```lua
          local file_content = redis.call('GET', 'sensitive_data');
          -- Assuming application logic later writes this 'sensitive_data' to a file
          return 'Attempted file read!';
          ```
    * **Manipulating data within Redis to further compromise the application.**
        * **Technical Detail:** This is a more direct and often easier path. Attackers can modify stored data, delete keys, or add new keys to disrupt the application's functionality or inject malicious data.
        * **Example Lua Payload:**
          ```lua
          redis.call('SET', 'user:admin:password', 'pwned');
          redis.call('DEL', 'important_configuration');
          return 'Data manipulated!';
          ```

* **If the Redis server and application server share the same host or have network access to each other, the attacker might be able to pivot from the Redis server to compromise the application server.**
    * **Technical Detail:**  A compromised Redis server can act as a stepping stone to attack the application server. If they are on the same host, the attacker might leverage local network interfaces or shared resources. If they are on different hosts but have network connectivity, the attacker could use the compromised Redis server to scan for vulnerabilities or launch attacks against the application server. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the application server's services or accessing sensitive data stored on it.

**Potential Vulnerabilities Enabling this Attack Path:**

* **Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization:**  The most common culprit. Failure to properly validate and sanitize user input before incorporating it into Redis commands.
* **Direct Exposure of Redis Commands:**  API endpoints or internal functions that allow users to directly execute arbitrary Redis commands, including `EVAL`.
* **Insufficient Authentication and Authorization:**  Lack of proper checks to ensure only authorized users can execute sensitive commands like `EVAL`.
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Vulnerabilities allowing attackers to make the application server send malicious requests to the Redis server.
* **Code Injection Vulnerabilities:**  Other vulnerabilities in the application that allow attackers to inject code that can then interact with Redis.
* **Overly Permissive Redis Configuration:**  Enabling features like `package.loadlib` without careful consideration of the security implications.
* **Running Redis with Elevated Privileges:**  If Redis runs with excessive privileges, a successful script injection attack can have more severe consequences.

**Impact Assessment:**

A successful "Inject Scripting Payloads (e.g., Lua via EVAL)" attack can have severe consequences:

* **Confidentiality Breach:**  Reading sensitive data stored in Redis or on the server's file system.
* **Integrity Violation:**  Modifying or deleting critical data within Redis, leading to application malfunction or data corruption.
* **Availability Disruption:**  Causing the Redis server to crash or become unresponsive, leading to application downtime.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Executing arbitrary system commands on the Redis server, potentially leading to full server compromise.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  Potentially gaining higher privileges on the Redis server or the application server.
* **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised Redis server as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate the risk of this attack, developers should implement the following strategies:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before incorporating them into Redis commands. Use parameterized queries or command builders to avoid direct string concatenation of user input into commands.
* **Principle of Least Privilege for Redis Users:**  Create dedicated Redis users with only the necessary permissions for the application's functionality. Avoid using the default `default` user or granting overly broad permissions.
* **Disable or Restrict Dangerous Commands:**  Use the `rename-command` directive in the Redis configuration to disable or rename potentially dangerous commands like `EVAL`, `SCRIPT`, `CONFIG`, `MODULE`, etc., if they are not absolutely necessary for the application's operation.
* **Secure Configuration of Redis:**
    * Disable `package.loadlib` unless absolutely required and with extreme caution.
    * Configure strong authentication (e.g., `requirepass`).
    * Bind Redis to specific network interfaces and restrict access using firewalls.
* **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Redis server on a private network segment and restrict access from the application server only.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application's interaction with Redis.
* **Monitor Redis Logs:**  Monitor Redis logs for suspicious activity, such as attempts to execute `EVAL` or other restricted commands.
* **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly preventing Redis attacks, CSP can help mitigate the impact of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that might be used to indirectly trigger malicious Redis commands.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**  Educate developers on secure coding practices related to database interactions and the risks of command injection.
* **Regularly Update Redis:**  Keep the Redis server updated with the latest security patches.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Scripting Payloads (e.g., Lua via EVAL)" attack path represents a significant security risk for applications using Redis. By understanding the attack vectors, potential impact, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation. A defense-in-depth approach, combining secure coding practices, proper configuration, and continuous monitoring, is crucial for protecting against this type of attack.
