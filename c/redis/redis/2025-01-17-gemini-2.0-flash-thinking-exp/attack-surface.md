# Attack Surface Analysis for redis/redis

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Network Communication](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_network_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Data transmitted between the application and Redis is vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **How Redis Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Redis, by default, does not enforce encryption on network connections.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network intercepts credentials or sensitive data being passed between the application and Redis.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential for data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for Redis connections using `tls-port` and related configuration options.
        *   Ensure proper certificate management and validation.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Absent Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_absent_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the Redis instance allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands and manipulate data.
    *   **How Redis Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Redis relies on password-based authentication (or no authentication by default) to control access.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Redis instance using a default or easily guessed password, or if no password is set. They then use commands like `FLUSHALL` to delete all data.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, unauthorized data access, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure a strong, unique password using the `requirepass` directive in the `redis.conf` file.
        *   Utilize Redis Access Control Lists (ACLs) for more granular permission management.
        *   Regularly rotate the Redis password.
        *   Disable or restrict access to administrative commands if not strictly necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Redis Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/redis_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** User-supplied data, if not properly sanitized, can be injected into Redis commands, leading to unintended actions.
    *   **How Redis Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Redis executes commands directly as provided by the client.
    *   **Example:** An application takes user input for a key name and directly constructs a Redis command like `GET user:{input}`. An attacker provides input like `*; CONFIG SET dir /tmp; CONFIG SET dbfilename shell.so; SAVE; system 'chmod +x /tmp/shell.so'; system '/tmp/shell.so'; *` potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Redis server, data manipulation, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat Redis commands as code.
        *   Use client libraries that offer parameterized queries or mechanisms to safely escape user input.
        *   Avoid directly concatenating user input into Redis command strings.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure on Default Port and Interfaces](./attack_surfaces/exposure_on_default_port_and_interfaces.md)

*   **Description:** Leaving Redis exposed on its default port (6379) and bound to all interfaces makes it easily discoverable and accessible to attackers.
    *   **How Redis Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Redis, by default, listens on port 6379 and can be configured to bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0).
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans for open port 6379 and attempts to connect to the Redis instance without proper authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, potential for data manipulation or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure firewalls to restrict access to the Redis port only from authorized application servers.
        *   Bind Redis to specific IP addresses (e.g., the application server's internal IP or the loopback interface if only local access is needed) using the `bind` directive in `redis.conf`.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Defaults](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_defaults.md)

*   **Description:** Relying on default Redis configurations without understanding their security implications can leave the instance vulnerable.
    *   **How Redis Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Redis ships with default configurations that may not be suitable for production environments.
    *   **Example:** Leaving the `rename-command` directive commented out allows attackers to use potentially dangerous commands like `FLUSHALL`.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific insecure default, but can range from data loss to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review and harden the Redis configuration file (`redis.conf`) based on security best practices.
        *   Disable or rename potentially dangerous commands using the `rename-command` directive.
