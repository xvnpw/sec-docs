# Threat Model Analysis for redis/redis

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access](./threats/unauthenticated_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker connects directly to the Redis instance without providing any credentials. This is possible due to a missing or misconfigured `requirepass` setting in `redis.conf`. The attacker can then execute any Redis command.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Redis instance. The attacker can read, modify, or delete any data. They can also execute commands that could potentially impact the underlying server if Redis is running with elevated privileges or if vulnerable commands are used (e.g., `CONFIG SET dir`, `CONFIG SET dbfilename`, `MODULE LOAD`).
    *   **Affected Component:** Redis Configuration, Network Listener
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Set a strong password using the `requirepass` configuration directive in `redis.conf`.
        *   Ensure the `redis.conf` file is properly configured and not using default settings.
        *   Bind Redis to specific internal interfaces using the `bind` directive in `redis.conf` instead of `0.0.0.0`.

## Threat: [Weak Password Brute-force](./threats/weak_password_brute-force.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to guess the Redis password through repeated login attempts. This is feasible if a weak or easily guessable password is used for authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Successful brute-force leads to the same impact as unauthenticated access, allowing the attacker to fully control the Redis instance and its data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Redis Authentication Mechanism
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for the Redis password. Use a long, complex, and unique password.
        *   Consider using connection limits or rate limiting on the network level to slow down brute-force attempts.
        *   Monitor Redis logs for failed authentication attempts and implement alerting mechanisms.

## Threat: [Abuse of Lua Scripting](./threats/abuse_of_lua_scripting.md)

*   **Description:** If Lua scripting is enabled in Redis, an attacker with the ability to execute scripts (either through direct access or application vulnerabilities) can run malicious code that can perform various actions, including data manipulation, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the malicious script, including data breaches, data corruption, and Redis instance compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Redis Lua Scripting Engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable Lua scripting if it's not required using the `disable-lua` configuration directive.
        *   If Lua scripting is necessary, carefully review and audit all scripts before deployment.
        *   Restrict access to the `EVAL` and `EVALSHA` commands to only trusted users or applications.
        *   Implement sandboxing or other security measures for Lua scripts if possible.
