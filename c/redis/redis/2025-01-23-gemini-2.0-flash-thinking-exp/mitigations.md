# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for redis/redis

## Mitigation Strategy: [Require Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/require_authentication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Require Authentication using `requirepass`.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Open `redis.conf` file:** Locate and open your Redis configuration file (usually `redis.conf`).
    2.  **Find `requirepass` directive:** Search for the line starting with `requirepass`. If it's commented out (starts with `#`), uncomment it by removing the `#`.
    3.  **Set a strong password:** Replace `foobared` (the default example) with a strong, randomly generated password.  The password should be long, complex, and unique. Example: `requirepass aVeryStrongPassword123!@#`.
    4.  **Save and close `redis.conf`:** Save the changes to the configuration file.
    5.  **Restart Redis server:** Restart your Redis server for the changes to take effect.  Use the appropriate command for your system (e.g., `redis-server /path/to/redis.conf` or system service restart command).
    6.  **Update application connection strings:** Modify your application's Redis connection strings to include the password.  For example, in many Redis clients, you can specify the password in the connection URI or configuration object.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity)
    *   Data Breach (High Severity)
    *   Data Manipulation/Destruction (High Severity)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High Risk Reduction
    *   Data Breach: High Risk Reduction
    *   Data Manipulation/Destruction: High Risk Reduction
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Describe if password authentication is currently enabled in your project's Redis instances. Specify where it's configured, e.g., "Yes, enabled in production Redis instances configured via Ansible." or "No, currently not implemented."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe where authentication is missing, e.g., "Not enabled in development and staging environments." or "Not implemented for the internal Redis instance used by the caching service."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Access Control Lists (ACLs)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_access_control_lists__acls_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs).
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Connect to Redis using `redis-cli` with authentication (if enabled):**  `redis-cli -a your_password`
    2.  **Create users with specific permissions:** Use the `ACL SETUSER` command to create users and define their permissions.  For example:
        *   `ACL SETUSER appuser +get +set ~keys:* on >apppassword` (Creates user `appuser` with `get` and `set` permissions on all keys, requiring password `apppassword`).
        *   `ACL SETUSER readonlyuser +get -set ~readonlykeys:* on nopass` (Creates user `readonlyuser` with only `get` permission on keys matching `readonlykeys:*`, no password required).
        *   `ACL SETUSER adminuser allkeys allcommands on >adminpassword` (Creates user `adminuser` with full access, requiring password `adminpassword`).
    3.  **Define permissions based on command categories, keys, and channels:**  Use ACL categories (`@read`, `@write`, `@admin`, `@pubsub`, `@keyspace`, `@string`, `@list`, `@set`, `@hash`, `@sortedset`, `@stream`, `@connection`, `@server`, `@scripting`, `@geo`, `@bitmap`, `@hyperloglog`, `@cluster`, `@generic`), key patterns (`~key_pattern`), and channel patterns (`>channel_pattern`) to fine-tune permissions.
    4.  **Test ACL configuration:** Use `ACL WHOAMI` to verify the current user and `ACL GETUSER <username>` to check user permissions.
    5.  **Update application to use specific users:** Modify your application code to connect to Redis using the newly created users and their respective passwords (if any).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity)
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity)
    *   Data Breach (Medium Severity)
    *   Internal Threat (Medium Severity)

    *   Unauthorized Access: High Risk Reduction
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Data Breach: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Internal Threat: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Describe if ACLs are currently used in your project. Specify which environments and for what purpose, e.g., "No, ACLs are not currently implemented." or "Partially implemented in production for separating application access from administrative access."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe where ACLs are missing, e.g., "ACLs are not configured in development, staging, and production environments." or "ACLs are not used to differentiate access levels for different application modules."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable or Rename Dangerous Commands](./mitigation_strategies/disable_or_rename_dangerous_commands.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable or Rename Dangerous Redis Commands.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify dangerous commands:** Review the list of potentially dangerous commands (e.g., `FLUSHALL`, `FLUSHDB`, `KEYS`, `EVAL`, `SCRIPT`, `CONFIG`, `DEBUG`, `SHUTDOWN`, `REPLICAOF`/`SLAVEOF`, `MODULE LOAD`).
    2.  **Assess command usage:** Determine which of these commands are actually required by your application.
    3.  **Disable unnecessary commands:** For commands not needed, disable them by adding `rename-command <command_name> "" ` to your `redis.conf` file. Example: `rename-command FLUSHALL ""`.
    4.  **Rename essential dangerous commands:** For commands that are necessary but potentially risky, rename them to less obvious names using `rename-command <command_name> <new_command_name>`. Example: `rename-command CONFIG my_secure_config`.
    5.  **Update application code (if renaming):** If you renamed commands, update your application code to use the new command names.
    6.  **Restart Redis server:** Restart Redis for the changes to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Destruction (High Severity)
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity)

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe which commands are not yet disabled/renamed and in which environments, e.g., "`EVAL` and `SCRIPT` are still enabled in all environments." or "Command renaming is not consistently applied across all Redis instances."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tls_encryption.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable TLS Encryption for client-server communication.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate TLS certificates and keys:** Obtain or generate TLS certificates and private keys for your Redis server. You can use tools like `openssl` to create self-signed certificates for testing or use certificates from a Certificate Authority (CA) for production.
    2.  **Configure TLS in `redis.conf`:**
        *   **Enable TLS port:** Uncomment and set `tls-port <port>` (e.g., `tls-port 6380`) to enable TLS on a separate port. You can also enable TLS on the standard port by setting `port 0` and `tls-port 6379`.
        *   **Specify certificate and key files:** Set `tls-cert-file <path_to_cert.pem>` and `tls-key-file <path_to_key.pem>` to point to your certificate and key files.
        *   **Optionally configure TLS version and ciphers:** You can further configure TLS versions (`tls-version`) and cipher suites (`tls-ciphers`) for stronger security.
    3.  **Restart Redis server:** Restart Redis for the TLS configuration to take effect.
    4.  **Update application connection strings to use TLS:** Modify your application's Redis client connection settings to enable TLS.  This usually involves specifying `ssl=True` or similar options in the connection URI or client configuration.  Ensure the client is configured to trust the server certificate (especially for self-signed certificates).
    5.  **Test TLS connection:** Verify that your application can connect to Redis over TLS and that connections to the non-TLS port (if still enabled) are blocked or restricted.

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe where TLS is missing, e.g., "TLS is not enabled in development and staging environments." or "TLS is enabled for client-server communication but not for replication."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Store Redis Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/securely_store_redis_configuration_files.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Securely Store Redis Configuration Files.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Redis configuration files:** Locate all Redis configuration files, primarily `redis.conf` and potentially any custom scripts or configuration snippets.
    2.  **Restrict file system permissions:** Use operating system commands (e.g., `chmod` and `chown` on Linux/Unix) to set restrictive file permissions.
        *   **Owner:** Set the owner to the Redis user account.
        *   **Group:** Set the group to a dedicated Redis group or `root`.
        *   **Permissions:** Set permissions to `600` (owner read/write only) or `640` (owner read/write, group read only) to prevent unauthorized users from reading or modifying the files. Example: `chmod 600 redis.conf` and `chown redis:redis redis.conf`.
    3.  **Regularly audit permissions:** Periodically review file permissions to ensure they remain correctly configured and haven't been inadvertently changed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**

    *   Information Disclosure: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Describe if secure storage of configuration files is currently implemented, e.g., "Yes, `redis.conf` permissions are set to 600 and owned by the redis user in production." or "No, configuration files are currently readable by the application group."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe where secure storage is missing, e.g., "Permissions are not consistently enforced across all environments." or "Permissions are not checked as part of the deployment process."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Memory Usage (`maxmemory`)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_memory_usage___maxmemory__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Memory Usage using `maxmemory`.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Open `redis.conf` file:** Locate and open your Redis configuration file (`redis.conf`).
    2.  **Find `maxmemory` directive:** Search for the line starting with `maxmemory`. If commented, uncomment it.
    3.  **Set `maxmemory` value:** Set `maxmemory` to a value appropriate for your system's resources and application needs.  Specify the value in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes (e.g., `maxmemory 1gb`, `maxmemory 500mb`).  Choose a value that leaves sufficient memory for the operating system and other processes.
    4.  **Configure `maxmemory-policy`:** Set `maxmemory-policy` to define how Redis should evict keys when `maxmemory` is reached. Common policies include:
        *   `volatile-lru`: Evict least recently used keys among those with an expire set.
        *   `allkeys-lru`: Evict least recently used keys among all keys.
        *   `volatile-ttl`: Evict keys with the shortest time-to-live (TTL) among those with an expire set.
        *   `noeviction`: Return errors when memory limit is reached (writes will fail).
    5.  **Save and restart Redis:** Save `redis.conf` and restart the Redis server.

    2.  **Find `client-output-buffer-limit` directive:** Search for `client-output-buffer-limit`.
    3.  **Configure limits for different client types:**  The directive takes three arguments: `<client-type> <hard-limit> <soft-limit> <soft-seconds>`. 
        *   `<client-type>`: `normal`, `replica`, `pubsub`.
        *   `<hard-limit>`:  Maximum buffer size in bytes. If exceeded, the client is immediately disconnected.
        *   `<soft-limit>`: Buffer size in bytes. If exceeded for `<soft-seconds>`, the client is disconnected.
        *   `<soft-seconds>`: Number of seconds the soft limit can be exceeded before disconnection.
    4.  **Set appropriate limits:** Configure limits based on your application's expected data transfer patterns.  Example: `client-output-buffer-limit normal 100mb 25mb 60` (Normal clients: hard limit 100MB, soft limit 25MB for 60 seconds).
    5.  **Save and restart Redis:** Save `redis.conf` and restart the Redis server.

    2.  **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (if available for Lua or Redis Lua scripting) to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities in scripts.
    3.  **Input Validation:** Ensure scripts properly validate and sanitize all inputs received from Redis commands or external sources to prevent injection attacks.
    4.  **Resource Limits:**  Analyze scripts for potential resource consumption issues (CPU, memory, execution time).  Avoid infinite loops or computationally expensive operations within scripts.
    5.  **Testing:**  Thoroughly test scripts in a non-production environment with various inputs, including edge cases and potentially malicious inputs, to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior.
    6.  **Version Control:** Store Lua scripts in version control (like Git) to track changes, facilitate reviews, and enable rollback if necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Lua Scripting (If Not Needed)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_lua_scripting__if_not_needed_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Lua Scripting if not required by the application.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Lua scripting necessity:** Determine if your application truly requires Lua scripting functionality in Redis. If not, disabling it significantly reduces the attack surface.
    2.  **Use ACLs to deny access:** Use Redis ACLs to deny permissions for the `@scripting` category (which includes `EVAL`, `EVALSHA`, `SCRIPT` commands) to all users except potentially a dedicated administrative user if script management is still needed. Example ACL rule: `ACL SETUSER default -@scripting`.
    3.  **Verify disabling:** After applying ACL changes, test that application users can no longer execute scripting commands.

    2.  **Configure TLS for replication in `redis.conf`:** On both master and replica instances, set `tls-replication yes` in `redis.conf`.
    3.  **Specify TLS certificate and key files (if different from client TLS):** If using separate certificates for replication, configure `tls-replication-cert-file` and `tls-replication-key-file` in `redis.conf` on both master and replicas. If reusing client TLS certificates, these directives might not be needed.
    4.  **Restart master and replicas:** Restart both master and replica Redis instances for TLS replication to be enabled.

    3.  **Access Control Review:** Audit ACL configurations, authentication mechanisms, and network access controls to ensure they are properly implemented and enforced.
    4.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools specifically designed for Redis or general infrastructure scanners that can identify Redis vulnerabilities. Run scans regularly, especially after updates or configuration changes.
    5.  **Penetration Testing (Optional):** Consider periodic penetration testing of your Redis deployments to simulate real-world attacks and identify exploitable vulnerabilities.
    6.  **Remediation:**  Address any vulnerabilities or security weaknesses identified during audits and scans promptly. Prioritize remediation based on risk severity.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Undiscovered Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity) - Proactively identifies and addresses potential security flaws before exploitation.
    *   Misconfigurations (Medium Severity) - Detects and corrects security misconfigurations that could lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   Compliance Issues (Varies) - Helps ensure compliance with security standards and regulations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Undiscovered Vulnerabilities: Medium to High Risk Reduction
    *   Misconfigurations: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Compliance Issues: Varies Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Describe the current security audit and vulnerability scanning practices for Redis in your project, e.g., "Yes, we perform quarterly security audits and monthly vulnerability scans of our Redis infrastructure." or "No regular security audits or vulnerability scans are currently conducted."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe missing aspects of security auditing and scanning, e.g., "Vulnerability scans are not performed regularly." or "Security audits are not conducted by external security experts."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring and Logging](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring_and_logging.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Monitoring and Logging for Redis Security Events.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Redis Logging:** Configure Redis logging in `redis.conf` using the `logfile` and `loglevel` directives. Set `loglevel` to `notice` or `verbose` to capture security-relevant events.
    2.  **Log Security-Relevant Events:** Ensure logs capture events such as:
        *   Client connections and disconnections (including source IP addresses).
        *   Authentication attempts (successful and failed).
        *   Execution of potentially dangerous commands (especially if not disabled/renamed).
        *   ACL violations.
        *   Errors and warnings related to security.
    3.  **Centralized Logging:**  Forward Redis logs to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, Graylog) for easier analysis, alerting, and long-term storage.
    4.  **Security Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up monitoring and alerting rules in your logging system to detect suspicious activity in Redis logs, such as:
        *   Repeated failed authentication attempts from the same IP.
        *   Unusual command patterns.
        *   Error messages indicating potential security issues.
    5.  **Regular Log Review:** Periodically review Redis logs for security incidents, anomalies, and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Delayed Detection of Security Incidents (Medium Severity) - Monitoring and logging enable faster detection and response to security breaches.
    *   Lack of Audit Trail (Medium Severity) - Logs provide an audit trail for security investigations and incident response.
    *   Insufficient Visibility into Redis Security Posture (Medium Severity) - Monitoring provides insights into Redis security status and potential issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Delayed Detection of Security Incidents: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Lack of Audit Trail: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Insufficient Visibility into Redis Security Posture: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Describe the current monitoring and logging setup for Redis in your project, e.g., "Yes, Redis logs are forwarded to our centralized logging system and monitored for security events." or "Basic Redis logging is enabled, but no security-specific monitoring is in place."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Describe missing aspects of monitoring and logging, e.g., "Security alerting rules are not yet configured for Redis logs." or "Logs are not centrally collected and analyzed."]
