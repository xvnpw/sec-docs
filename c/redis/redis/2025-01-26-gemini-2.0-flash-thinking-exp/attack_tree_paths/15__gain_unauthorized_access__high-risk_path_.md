### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain Unauthorized Access via Redis Command Injection

**Attack Vector Breakdown:**

This attack path leverages **Redis command injection**, a vulnerability that arises when user-controlled input is improperly incorporated into Redis commands executed by the application.  Because Redis commands are text-based and separated by newlines, attackers can inject malicious commands by manipulating input strings to include newline characters and additional Redis commands.

**Threat Scenario:**

An attacker aims to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or administrative privileges by manipulating authentication or authorization data stored in Redis. This is achieved by injecting malicious Redis commands that alter this data in a way that grants the attacker access.

**Detailed Steps of the Attack:**

1.  **Identify Injection Points:** The attacker first needs to identify points in the application where user input is used to construct Redis commands related to authentication or authorization. Common examples include:
    *   **Login Forms:** If username or password fields are directly used in Redis commands (highly insecure, but illustrative).
    *   **Session Management:** If session IDs or user identifiers are used in Redis commands to retrieve session data or user roles.
    *   **Authorization Checks:** If user roles or permissions are stored in Redis and accessed based on user input.
    *   **API Endpoints:** Any API endpoint that takes user input and interacts with Redis for authentication or authorization purposes.

2.  **Craft Malicious Payloads:** Once an injection point is identified, the attacker crafts a malicious payload that includes:
    *   **Valid Initial Input:**  Input that appears legitimate to the application's initial processing (e.g., a seemingly valid username).
    *   **Newline Character (`\n` or URL-encoded `%0a`):** This character acts as a command separator in Redis, allowing the attacker to inject a new command.
    *   **Malicious Redis Command(s):**  Commands designed to manipulate authentication or authorization data. Examples include:

    *   **Manipulating User Credentials (if stored directly in Redis):**
        ```redis
        SET user:attacker:password "new_password"
        ```
        If the application naively uses `GET user:attacker:password` for authentication, this could lead to account takeover.

    *   **Modifying User Roles/Permissions (if stored in Redis):**
        ```redis
        HSET user:attacker roles admin
        ```
        If user roles are stored as hashes, this could elevate the attacker's privileges.

    *   **Deleting Authentication Data:**
        ```redis
        DEL session:valid_session_id
        ```
        Potentially forcing a bypass of session-based authentication or disrupting legitimate user sessions.

    *   **Creating New Administrative Accounts (if application logic allows):**
        ```redis
        SADD admin_users attacker_username
        ```
        If the application uses sets to manage admin users, this could grant the attacker administrative access.

    *   **Bypassing Authentication Checks (depending on application logic):**  In some flawed implementations, injecting commands might disrupt the intended authentication flow, potentially leading to bypasses. This is highly application-specific.

3.  **Execute the Attack:** The attacker submits the crafted payload through the identified injection point (e.g., via a web form, API request). The application, if vulnerable, will construct and execute a Redis command that includes the injected malicious commands.

4.  **Gain Unauthorized Access:** If the malicious commands successfully manipulate authentication or authorization data as intended, the attacker can then leverage this altered data to gain unauthorized access. This could involve:
    *   **Logging in as the compromised user.**
    *   **Accessing administrative panels or features.**
    *   **Performing actions with elevated privileges.**
    *   **Accessing sensitive data protected by authorization mechanisms.**

**Example Scenario (Illustrative - Highly Simplified and Insecure Application):**

Imagine an extremely simplified (and insecure) application that checks user passwords directly against Redis using user input:

```python
import redis

r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

def authenticate_user(username, password_attempt):
    stored_password = r.get(f"user:{username}:password")
    if stored_password and stored_password.decode() == password_attempt:
        return True
    return False

# Vulnerable code - directly using user input in command construction
username = input("Username: ")
password = input("Password: ")

if authenticate_user(username, password):
    print("Authentication successful!")
else:
    print("Authentication failed.")
```

**Attack Payload Example:**

If an attacker enters the following as the username:

```
attacker\nSET user:attacker:password "hacked"
```

And any password, the Redis command executed (conceptually) might become:

```redis
GET user:attacker\nSET user:attacker:password "hacked":password
```

Due to newline injection, Redis would interpret this as two separate commands:

1.  `GET user:attacker` (This might fail or return null depending on existing data, but is less important for the attack).
2.  `SET user:attacker:password "hacked"` (This command *will* execute and overwrite the attacker's password in Redis).

Now, the attacker can log in as "attacker" with the password "hacked".

**Risk Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** Moderate to High, depending on the application's coding practices and awareness of Redis command injection risks. If developers are not explicitly sanitizing input used in Redis commands, the vulnerability is highly likely.
*   **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to complete account takeover, privilege escalation to administrative levels, and unauthorized access to sensitive application features and data. This can have severe consequences for data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Mitigation Recommendations:**

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Crucial):**
    *   **Strictly validate all user input** before incorporating it into Redis commands.
    *   **Sanitize input to remove or escape newline characters (`\n`, `\r`, `%0a`, `%0d`) and other potentially dangerous characters.**  Consider using whitelisting valid characters instead of blacklisting.
    *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:**  Sanitize input based on how it will be used in the Redis command.

2.  **Use Parameterized Queries or Safe Command Construction (Recommended):**
    *   **Avoid string concatenation to build Redis commands with user input.**
    *   **Utilize client libraries that offer parameterized query mechanisms or safe command building functions.**  While Redis itself doesn't have parameterized queries in the SQL sense, client libraries often provide methods to safely construct commands, reducing injection risks.  (Note:  Many Redis client libraries still rely on string construction under the hood, so careful usage is still required).
    *   **Example (Python redis-py - using `set` and `get` methods which are safer than manual string formatting):**

        ```python
        import redis

        r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

        username = input("Username: ")
        password = input("Password: ")

        # Safer approach - using client library methods
        r.set(f"user:{username}:password", password) # Still needs username sanitization!
        stored_password = r.get(f"user:{username}:password") # Safer retrieval
        ```
        **Important:** Even with client library methods, you still need to sanitize the `username` variable to prevent injection in the key name itself if user input directly controls the key name.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Redis Access:**
    *   **Configure Redis access control (ACLs in Redis 6+ or `requirepass` in older versions) to restrict the application's Redis user to only the necessary commands and data.**  If the application only needs to `GET` and `HGET`, restrict access to other potentially dangerous commands like `SET`, `DEL`, `FLUSHALL`, etc.
    *   **Use separate Redis databases or instances for different application components with varying security needs.**

4.  **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the application code, specifically focusing on Redis integration points.
    *   Perform code reviews to identify potential command injection vulnerabilities and ensure secure coding practices are followed.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Defense in Depth):**
    *   Consider deploying a WAF that can detect and block common command injection attempts in HTTP requests.  While not a primary defense against Redis command injection itself, it can add a layer of protection at the application perimeter.

6.  **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   Implement robust logging of Redis commands executed by the application.
    *   Monitor Redis logs for suspicious command patterns or errors that might indicate injection attempts.
    *   Set up alerts for unusual Redis activity.

**Conclusion:**

Redis command injection poses a significant threat to applications utilizing Redis for authentication and authorization. By understanding the attack mechanisms, potential impact, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and strengthen the overall security of their applications.  Prioritizing input validation and adopting secure coding practices when interacting with Redis are paramount to preventing this type of vulnerability.
