### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Redis Command Injection (via Application Vulnerability)

#### 4.1. Understanding the Attack Path

The "Redis Command Injection (via Application Vulnerability)" attack path highlights a critical security flaw where an attacker leverages vulnerabilities in the application code to inject and execute arbitrary Redis commands.  This bypasses the intended application logic and security measures, granting the attacker direct, unauthorized control over the Redis server through the application's connection.

**Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1.  **Application Vulnerability:** The attack originates from a weakness in the application code. This vulnerability typically arises from improper handling of user input or data that is used to construct Redis commands. Common examples include:
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied data before incorporating it into Redis commands.
    *   **String Interpolation/Concatenation:**  Using user input directly within string interpolation or concatenation to build Redis commands without proper escaping or parameterization.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** If the application deserializes data from external sources and uses it to construct Redis commands, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can be exploited.
    *   **Logic Flaws:**  Application logic errors that inadvertently allow user-controlled data to influence the structure or content of Redis commands.

2.  **Command Injection:**  An attacker identifies and exploits the application vulnerability to inject malicious Redis commands. This is achieved by crafting input that, when processed by the vulnerable application, results in the execution of unintended Redis commands.

3.  **Redis Command Execution:** The application, due to the vulnerability, sends the attacker-injected Redis commands to the Redis server. Redis, being a command-driven database, executes these commands as instructed.

4.  **Impact and Consequences:**  Successful command injection allows the attacker to perform a wide range of actions on the Redis server, leading to severe consequences.

#### 4.2. Examples of Application Vulnerabilities and Exploitation

Let's illustrate with a simplified example. Consider a hypothetical web application that uses Redis to store user profiles. The application might have a function to retrieve a user's profile based on their username.

**Vulnerable Code Example (Python - Flask with Redis):**

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import redis

app = Flask(__name__)
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

@app.route('/profile')
def get_profile():
    username = request.args.get('username')
    if username:
        key = f"user:{username}:profile" # Vulnerable string interpolation
        profile_data = r.get(key)
        if profile_data:
            return profile_data.decode('utf-8')
        else:
            return "Profile not found", 404
    else:
        return "Username parameter missing", 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Exploitation Scenario:**

An attacker could craft a malicious URL like this:

```
/profile?username=malicious'); FLUSHALL; --
```

**How the Injection Works:**

1.  The application receives the `username` parameter: `malicious'); FLUSHALL; --`
2.  The vulnerable line `key = f"user:{username}:profile"` constructs the Redis key using string interpolation.
3.  The resulting `key` becomes: `user:malicious'); FLUSHALL; --:profile`
4.  When this key is used in `r.get(key)`, Redis interprets the input as multiple commands due to the semicolon `;`.
    *   `GET user:malicious')`:  Redis attempts to get a key named `user:malicious')`. This might fail or return irrelevant data.
    *   `FLUSHALL`:  **This is the injected malicious command.** `FLUSHALL` command in Redis deletes all keys from all databases.
    *   `--:profile`:  The rest is treated as a comment (`--`) and ignored by Redis.

**Consequences of this Attack:**

Executing `FLUSHALL` would result in **complete data loss** in the Redis database, potentially disrupting the entire application and causing significant data integrity issues.

**Other Injectable Commands and Potential Impact:**

*   **`SET malicious_key malicious_value`:**  Allows the attacker to write arbitrary data into Redis, potentially overwriting existing data or injecting malicious content.
*   **`CONFIG GET *` / `CONFIG SET ...`:**  Allows the attacker to retrieve sensitive Redis configuration information or modify Redis settings, potentially weakening security or causing instability.
*   **`EVAL "os.execute('malicious_command')" 0` (if Lua scripting is enabled):**  In older Redis versions or configurations with Lua scripting enabled, this could lead to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** on the Redis server itself, allowing for complete system compromise.
*   **`SLOWLOG GET` / `CLIENT LIST`:**  Allows the attacker to gather information about Redis operations and connected clients, potentially aiding in further attacks or reconnaissance.
*   **`RENAME key newkey` / `DEL key`:**  Allows the attacker to manipulate data within Redis, potentially disrupting application functionality or causing data corruption.

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of successful Redis command injection can be severe and far-reaching, affecting all aspects of the CIA triad:

*   **Confidentiality:**
    *   Data breaches: Attackers can retrieve sensitive data stored in Redis using commands like `GET`, `HGETALL`, `SMEMBERS`, etc.
    *   Configuration disclosure: `CONFIG GET *` can expose sensitive configuration details.
*   **Integrity:**
    *   Data manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete data using commands like `SET`, `DEL`, `RENAME`, `FLUSHDB`, `FLUSHALL`, leading to data corruption and application malfunction.
    *   Data injection: Attackers can inject malicious data into Redis, potentially poisoning caches or influencing application behavior in unintended ways.
*   **Availability:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): `FLUSHDB` or `FLUSHALL` can cause complete data loss and service disruption.  Resource exhaustion through excessive commands or data manipulation can also lead to DoS.
    *   System instability: Modifying Redis configuration (`CONFIG SET`) can lead to instability or crashes.

In scenarios where Lua scripting is enabled and exploitable, the impact can escalate to **full system compromise** due to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

#### 4.4. Mitigation and Prevention Strategies

To effectively mitigate and prevent Redis command injection vulnerabilities, the development team should implement the following strategies:

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strictly validate all user inputs:**  Implement robust input validation on all data received from users or external sources before using it in Redis commands.
    *   **Use whitelists for allowed characters and formats:** Define allowed character sets and data formats for inputs and reject anything that deviates.
    *   **Sanitize inputs:**  Escape or encode special characters that could be interpreted as command separators or control characters in Redis.

2.  **Parameterized Queries / Command Building Libraries:**
    *   **Avoid string interpolation/concatenation for command construction:**  Never directly embed user input into Redis command strings using string interpolation or concatenation.
    *   **Utilize Redis client libraries' parameterized query features:**  Most Redis client libraries provide mechanisms for parameterized queries or command building that automatically handle escaping and prevent injection.  These methods typically separate command structure from user-provided data.  (e.g., in Python `redis-py`, use methods like `r.set('key', value)` instead of manually constructing the `SET` command string).

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Limit Redis user permissions:**  If Redis authentication is enabled (using `requirepass`), create Redis users with the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid granting application users full `ALL COMMANDS` access. Restrict access to only the commands required for the application's functionality.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Redis server on a private network segment, restricting access from untrusted networks.

4.  **Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    *   **Regular security audits:** Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, including Redis command injection flaws.
    *   **Code reviews:** Implement thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on code sections that interact with Redis and handle user input.

5.  **Disable or Restrict Dangerous Redis Commands:**
    *   **`rename-command` configuration:**  In Redis configuration, use the `rename-command` directive to rename or disable potentially dangerous commands like `FLUSHALL`, `FLUSHDB`, `CONFIG`, `EVAL`, `SCRIPT`, etc., if they are not absolutely necessary for the application's functionality. This adds a layer of defense in depth.

6.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Deploy a WAF:**  A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests that attempt to exploit Redis command injection vulnerabilities. Configure the WAF to identify patterns associated with command injection attempts.

7.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   While CSP primarily focuses on client-side attacks, a strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of certain types of attacks that might be related to or precede server-side vulnerabilities.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of Redis command injection attacks and enhance the overall security of the application.  Prioritizing secure coding practices, input validation, and leveraging the security features of Redis and its client libraries are crucial for preventing this critical vulnerability.
