# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for redis/redis

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Enable Authentication (`requirepass`)](./mitigation_strategies/1__enable_authentication___requirepass__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Redis Authentication using `requirepass`.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Modify `redis.conf`:** Open your `redis.conf` file.
    2.  **Uncomment or add `requirepass`:** Find the `requirepass` directive (it might be commented out). If it's not present, add it.
    3.  **Set a strong password:**  Replace the placeholder value (e.g., `foobared`) with a strong, randomly generated password.  Example: `requirepass aVeryStrongPassword123!@#`.
    4.  **Restart Redis:** Restart your Redis server for the configuration change to take effect.
    5.  **Update Application Code:** Modify your application's Redis client connection code to include the password when connecting to Redis.  This usually involves passing the password as an option during client initialization.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users or applications from connecting to Redis and accessing data.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by limiting access to authorized entities only.
    *   **Command Injection via Unauthenticated Access (Medium Severity):**  If Redis is exposed without authentication, attackers can directly send commands, potentially leading to command injection.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Data Breach:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Command Injection via Unauthenticated Access:** Moderately reduces the risk (command injection vulnerabilities within the application still need to be addressed separately).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the production Redis instance configuration. `requirepass` is set in `/etc/redis/redis.conf` on the production server. Application code in the backend service (`/app/backend/redis_client.py`) includes authentication credentials.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Not fully enforced in development and staging environments. Development Redis instances are often run without `requirepass` for ease of local development, which can lead to inconsistent security practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Utilize Access Control Lists (ACLs) (Redis 6+)](./mitigation_strategies/2__utilize_access_control_lists__acls___redis_6+_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Redis Access Control Lists (ACLs).
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable ACLs (if not default):** Ensure ACLs are enabled in your Redis configuration (Redis 6+).  This is usually the default.
    2.  **Define Users:** Use the `ACL SETUSER` command via `redis-cli` or programmatically to create users.  Specify usernames and passwords (if needed).
    3.  **Grant Permissions:**  For each user, grant specific permissions using `ACL SETUSER`. Permissions can include:
        *   **Commands:**  Control which Redis commands a user can execute (e.g., `+get`, `-set`, `+hgetall`, `-flushall`).
        *   **Keys:** Control access to specific key patterns (e.g., `~cache:*`, `~user:*`, `-*` to deny all keys).
        *   **Channels (Pub/Sub):** Control access to Pub/Sub channels.
    4.  **Update Application Code:** Modify your application code to connect to Redis using the newly created ACL users and their respective passwords (if set).
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update ACLs:** Periodically review and adjust ACLs as application requirements and user roles change.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Limits the impact of compromised credentials by restricting users to only necessary commands and data.
    *   **Internal Threats (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of malicious actions by internal users or compromised accounts with limited privileges.
    *   **Data Breach (Medium Severity):**  Limits the scope of a potential data breach by restricting access to sensitive data based on user roles.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Internal Threats:** Moderately reduces the risk.
    *   **Data Breach:** Moderately reduces the risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. ACLs are enabled on the production Redis instance.  A dedicated user `app_user` is created with basic read/write permissions for application data.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular ACLs are not fully utilized.  Currently, `app_user` has broad access to key patterns.  Need to refine ACLs to restrict access to specific key prefixes based on application modules (e.g., separate users for session data, cache data, etc.).  ACLs are not implemented in staging or development environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Bind to Specific Interface](./mitigation_strategies/3__bind_to_specific_interface.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Bind Redis to a specific network interface.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Modify `redis.conf`:** Open your `redis.conf` file.
    2.  **Locate `bind` directive:** Find the `bind` directive.
    3.  **Specify Interface:** Change the `bind` directive to listen only on specific interfaces.
        *   **Localhost Only:** If Redis is only accessed from the same server, bind to `127.0.0.1`. Example: `bind 127.0.0.1`.
        *   **Specific Network Interface:** If accessed from other servers within a private network, bind to the private IP address of the Redis server. Example: `bind 10.0.1.10`.
        *   **Multiple Interfaces:** Bind to multiple interfaces by listing them separated by spaces. Example: `bind 127.0.0.1 10.0.1.10`.
    4.  **Restart Redis:** Restart your Redis server for the configuration change to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access (High Severity):** Prevents external, unauthorized connections to Redis from the public internet or untrusted networks.
    *   **Remote Exploitation (High Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by making Redis inaccessible from external networks, mitigating remote exploitation attempts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Remote Exploitation:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in production and staging environments. Redis is bound to the private IP address of the server (`bind <private_ip>`) and `127.0.0.1`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Not consistently enforced in development environments. Developers sometimes run Redis bound to `0.0.0.0` for easier access from their local machines, which is less secure.  Need to document best practices for development environment setup.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Minimize Use of `EVAL` and `EVALSHA` with User-Supplied Scripts](./mitigation_strategies/4__minimize_use_of__eval__and__evalsha__with_user-supplied_scripts.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize or eliminate the use of `EVAL` and `EVALSHA` with user-supplied scripts.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Review:** Review your application code to identify all instances where `EVAL` or `EVALSHA` are used.
    2.  **Analyze Script Sources:** Determine if the Lua scripts used with `EVAL`/`EVALSHA` are:
        *   **Static/Predefined:** Scripts are fixed and part of the application code.
        *   **Dynamically Generated from User Input:** Scripts are constructed or modified based on user-provided data.
    3.  **Refactor for Static Scripts:** If possible, refactor code to use only static, predefined Lua scripts. Store scripts in files or constants within your application.
    4.  **Sanitize User Input (If Dynamic Scripts are Necessary):** If dynamic scripts are unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate all user-provided data before incorporating it into Lua scripts. Use proper escaping and input validation techniques to prevent Lua injection.
    5.  **Consider Alternative Approaches:** Explore alternative Redis commands or data structures that might achieve the desired functionality without relying on dynamic scripting (e.g., using sorted sets, lists, hashes, or server-side logic in application code).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lua Script Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious Lua code into Redis via user input, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the Redis server.
    *   **Data Manipulation (High Severity):**  Lua injection can be used to bypass application logic and directly manipulate data in Redis in unintended ways.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Lua Script Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk (if dynamic scripts are eliminated) or moderately reduces the risk (if input sanitization is implemented effectively).
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Significantly reduces the risk (if dynamic scripts are eliminated) or moderately reduces the risk (if input sanitization is implemented effectively).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  The application primarily uses predefined Lua scripts for specific atomic operations.  Direct user input is not directly used to construct Lua scripts in most parts of the application.
*   **Missing Implementation:** There are a few legacy modules where `EVAL` is used with dynamically constructed scripts based on complex user queries.  These modules need to be refactored to either use predefined scripts or alternative Redis commands.  Code review is needed to identify and address all instances of dynamic script generation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [5. Rename or Disable Dangerous Commands (`rename-command`)](./mitigation_strategies/5__rename_or_disable_dangerous_commands___rename-command__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rename or disable dangerous Redis commands using `rename-command`.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dangerous Commands:** Determine which Redis commands are considered dangerous in your application context. Common examples include: `FLUSHALL`, `FLUSHDB`, `KEYS`, `EVAL`, `SCRIPT`, `CONFIG`, `DEBUG`, `SHUTDOWN`, `REPLICAOF`/`SLAVEOF`.
    2.  **Modify `redis.conf`:** Open your `redis.conf` file.
    3.  **Use `rename-command`:** For each dangerous command, use the `rename-command` directive.
        *   **Rename:** Rename the command to a less obvious name. Example: `rename-command FLUSHALL very_unlikely_flushall_command`.
        *   **Disable:** Rename the command to an empty string `""` to effectively disable it. Example: `rename-command FLUSHALL ""`.
    4.  **Restart Redis:** Restart your Redis server for the configuration changes to take effect.
    5.  **Update Administrative Scripts (If Renamed):** If you renamed commands instead of disabling them, update any administrative scripts or tools that use these commands to use the new names.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (Medium Severity):** Reduces the impact of command injection vulnerabilities by limiting the attacker's ability to execute dangerous commands even if they can inject commands.
    *   **Accidental or Malicious Data Loss (Medium Severity):** Disabling `FLUSHALL` and `FLUSHDB` prevents accidental or malicious deletion of all data.
    *   **Configuration Tampering (Medium Severity):** Disabling `CONFIG` prevents unauthorized modification of Redis configuration.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low Severity):** Disabling `DEBUG` commands reduces the risk of information leakage through debugging commands.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** Moderately reduces the risk.
    *   **Accidental or Malicious Data Loss:** Moderately reduces the risk.
    *   **Configuration Tampering:** Moderately reduces the risk.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Slightly reduces the risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in production and staging. `FLUSHALL`, `FLUSHDB`, `CONFIG`, `DEBUG`, and `SHUTDOWN` are renamed to less obvious names.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  `KEYS`, `EVAL`, `SCRIPT`, and `REPLICAOF`/`SLAVEOF` are not yet renamed or disabled.  Need to evaluate the application's usage of these commands and determine if they can be safely renamed or disabled without impacting functionality.  Consider disabling them in production and staging, but potentially keeping them renamed in development for debugging purposes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [6. Set `maxmemory` and Eviction Policies](./mitigation_strategies/6__set__maxmemory__and_eviction_policies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure `maxmemory` and eviction policies in Redis.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Modify `redis.conf`:** Open your `redis.conf` file.
    2.  **Set `maxmemory`:**  Define the maximum amount of memory Redis can use.  Use appropriate units (e.g., `1gb`, `500mb`). Example: `maxmemory 2gb`. Choose a value based on your server's available RAM and application needs.
    3.  **Choose `maxmemory-policy`:** Select an eviction policy that suits your application's data usage patterns. Common policies include:
        *   `volatile-lru`: Evict least recently used keys among those with an expire set.
        *   `allkeys-lru`: Evict least recently used keys among all keys.
        *   `volatile-random`: Evict random keys among those with an expire set.
        *   `allkeys-random`: Evict random keys among all keys.
        *   `volatile-ttl`: Evict keys with the shortest remaining TTL (time-to-live) among those with an expire set.
        *   `noeviction`: Don't evict; return errors when memory limit is reached. (Use with caution).
        Example: `maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru`.
    4.  **Restart Redis:** Restart your Redis server for the configuration changes to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Memory Exhaustion (High Severity):** Prevents Redis from consuming excessive memory and crashing or becoming unresponsive due to memory exhaustion.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):**  Uncontrolled memory usage can lead to swapping and significant performance degradation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Memory Exhaustion:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Moderately reduces the risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in production and staging environments. `maxmemory` is set to a specific value based on instance size, and `allkeys-lru` eviction policy is configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  `maxmemory` and eviction policies are not consistently configured in development environments. Developers might run Redis without memory limits, which can mask potential memory leak issues in the application during development.

## Mitigation Strategy: [7. Limit Client Connections (`maxclients`)](./mitigation_strategies/7__limit_client_connections___maxclients__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit the maximum number of client connections using `maxclients`.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Modify `redis.conf`:** Open your `redis.conf` file.
    2.  **Set `maxclients`:** Define the maximum number of concurrent client connections Redis will accept. Example: `maxclients 10000`. Choose a value based on your application's expected connection load and server resources.
    3.  **Restart Redis:** Restart your Redis server for the configuration change to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Connection-Based Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents resource exhaustion from excessive connection attempts, mitigating connection-based DoS attacks.
    *   **Resource Starvation (Medium Severity):** Limits the number of connections, preventing a single application or attacker from monopolizing Redis connections and starving other legitimate clients.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Connection-Based Denial of Service (DoS):** Moderately reduces the risk.
    *   **Resource Starvation:** Moderately reduces the risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in production and staging environments. `maxclients` is set to a value appropriate for the expected load.
*   **Missing Implementation:** `maxclients` is not explicitly configured in development environments.  While default values might be sufficient for local development, explicitly setting it even in development can be a good practice.

## Mitigation Strategy: [8. Configure Connection Timeout (`timeout`)](./mitigation_strategies/8__configure_connection_timeout___timeout__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure connection timeout using `timeout`.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Modify `redis.conf`:** Open your `redis.conf` file.
    2.  **Set `timeout`:** Define the number of seconds after which an idle client connection will be closed.  Example: `timeout 300` (300 seconds = 5 minutes).  Choose a value that is appropriate for your application's connection patterns. A value of `0` disables timeout (not recommended for security).
    3.  **Restart Redis:** Restart your Redis server for the configuration change to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Slowloris DoS Attacks (Medium Severity):** Helps mitigate slowloris-style DoS attacks by closing idle connections that might be held open maliciously.
    *   **Resource Leaks from Idle Connections (Low Severity):** Prevents resource leaks caused by long-lived, idle connections that are no longer actively used.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Slowloris DoS Attacks:** Moderately reduces the risk.
    *   **Resource Leaks from Idle Connections:** Slightly reduces the risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in production and staging environments. `timeout` is set to 300 seconds.
*   **Missing Implementation:** `timeout` is not explicitly configured in development environments.  Default timeout might be in place, but explicitly setting it ensures consistent behavior across environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [9. Enable TLS/SSL Encryption for Client-Server Communication (`tls-port`, `tls-cert-file`, `tls-key-file`)](./mitigation_strategies/9__enable_tlsssl_encryption_for_client-server_communication___tls-port____tls-cert-file____tls-key-f_d7b96dc7.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable TLS/SSL encryption for client-server communication.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain TLS Certificates and Keys:** Acquire TLS/SSL certificates and private keys for your Redis server. You can use certificates from a Certificate Authority or generate self-signed certificates for testing (not recommended for production).
    2.  **Modify `redis.conf`:** Open your `redis.conf` file.
    3.  **Enable TLS Port:** Uncomment or add `tls-port <port>` to enable TLS on a separate port (e.g., `tls-port 6380`). Choose a different port than the standard non-TLS port.
    4.  **Specify Certificate and Key Files:** Configure the paths to your certificate and key files using `tls-cert-file <path/to/redis.crt>` and `tls-key-file <path/to/redis.key>`.
    5.  **(Optional) Configure TLS Client Authentication:**  For mutual TLS, configure `tls-client-cert-file` and `tls-client-key-file` and set `tls-auth-clients yes`.
    6.  **Restart Redis:** Restart your Redis server for the configuration changes to take effect.
    7.  **Update Application Code:** Modify your application's Redis client connection code to connect to the TLS port and enable TLS/SSL in the client connection options.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Protects sensitive data in transit from eavesdropping by encrypting communication between the application and Redis.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and manipulating communication between the application and Redis.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by protecting data confidentiality during transmission.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Data Breach:** Significantly reduces the risk related to data in transit.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. TLS/SSL encryption is not currently enabled for client-server communication in any environment (production, staging, or development).
*   **Missing Implementation:** TLS/SSL encryption needs to be implemented across all environments, starting with production and staging.  Certificate management and deployment processes need to be established. Application code needs to be updated to support TLS connections.

## Mitigation Strategy: [10. Secure Replication Link with Authentication (`masterauth`, `requirepass`)](./mitigation_strategies/10__secure_replication_link_with_authentication___masterauth____requirepass__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure the Redis replication link with authentication.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Master Configuration (Already Done - `requirepass`):** Ensure the master Redis instance has `requirepass` configured (as described in Mitigation Strategy #1).
    2.  **Replica Configuration:** On each replica Redis instance, modify `redis.conf`.
    3.  **Set `masterauth`:** Configure the `masterauth` directive on each replica to match the `requirepass` password set on the master. Example: `masterauth aVeryStrongPassword123!@#`.
    4.  **Restart Replicas:** Restart all replica Redis servers for the configuration changes to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Replica Connection (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized Redis instances from connecting as replicas to your master and potentially gaining access to data.
    *   **Data Breach via Unauthorized Replica (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by preventing unauthorized data replication to untrusted instances.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Replica Connection:** Moderately reduces the risk.
    *   **Data Breach via Unauthorized Replica:** Moderately reduces the risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `requirepass` is enabled on the master, but `masterauth` is not explicitly configured on replicas. Replication currently relies on network security to restrict access to the master.
*   **Missing Implementation:** `masterauth` needs to be configured on all replica instances in production and staging environments to explicitly authenticate replication connections.

## Mitigation Strategy: [11. TLS/SSL for Replication Traffic (`tls-replication`)](./mitigation_strategies/11__tlsssl_for_replication_traffic___tls-replication__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable TLS/SSL encryption for replication traffic.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable TLS (Prerequisite - TLS Certificates):** Ensure TLS certificates are configured for both master and replica Redis instances (as described in Mitigation Strategy #9).
    2.  **Modify `redis.conf` on Master and Replicas:** Open `redis.conf` on both master and replica instances.
    3.  **Enable `tls-replication`:** Set `tls-replication yes` in the `redis.conf` file on both master and replica instances.
    4.  **Restart Master and Replicas:** Restart the master and all replica Redis servers for the configuration changes to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping on Replication Traffic (Medium Severity):** Protects data transmitted during replication from eavesdropping by encrypting the replication stream.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Replication (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and manipulating data during replication.
    *   **Data Breach via Replication Eavesdropping (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by protecting data confidentiality during replication.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping on Replication Traffic:** Moderately reduces the risk.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Replication:** Moderately reduces the risk.
    *   **Data Breach via Replication Eavesdropping:** Moderately reduces the risk related to data in transit during replication.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. TLS/SSL encryption for replication traffic is not currently enabled in any environment.
*   **Missing Implementation:** TLS/SSL encryption for replication needs to be implemented in production and staging environments. This is dependent on implementing TLS for client-server communication first (Mitigation Strategy #9).
