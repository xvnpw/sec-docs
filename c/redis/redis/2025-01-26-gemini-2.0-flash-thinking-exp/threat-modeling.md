# Threat Model Analysis for redis/redis

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to Redis Instance](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_redis_instance.md)

Description: An attacker scans for publicly exposed Redis instances and connects without providing credentials. They can then execute any Redis command.
Impact: Full read and write access to all data in Redis, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
Affected Redis Component: Redis Server Core, Authentication Mechanism
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Enable `requirepass` with a strong password.
    * Implement ACLs (Redis 6+) to control user permissions.
    * Bind Redis to internal network interfaces using `bind`.
    * Use firewall rules to restrict access to the Redis port.

## Threat: [Data Exposure via Network Sniffing (Unencrypted Communication)](./threats/data_exposure_via_network_sniffing__unencrypted_communication_.md)

Description: An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and Redis using network sniffing tools. Since Redis communication is unencrypted by default, they can read sensitive data in transit.
Impact: Exposure of data transmitted between the application and Redis, including potentially sensitive information.
Affected Redis Component: Network Communication, Redis Protocol
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Enable TLS encryption for Redis connections using `tls-port`.
    * Configure the application to use TLS when connecting to Redis.
    * Use secure network infrastructure (VPNs, private networks).

## Threat: [Data Persistence on Disk (RDB/AOF) without Encryption](./threats/data_persistence_on_disk__rdbaof__without_encryption.md)

Description: An attacker gains access to the server's filesystem or backup storage where Redis RDB or AOF files are stored. If these files are not encrypted, the attacker can read the persisted data.
Impact: Exposure of all data persisted by Redis, even if the live instance is secured.
Affected Redis Component: Persistence Mechanisms (RDB, AOF), Disk Storage
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Enable disk encryption for the storage volume containing RDB/AOF files.
    * Consider in-memory Redis without persistence for sensitive data.
    * Use cloud-managed Redis with built-in encryption at rest if available.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Modification](./threats/unauthorized_data_modification.md)

Description: An attacker with unauthorized access to Redis (due to weak authentication or application vulnerability) uses write commands to modify or delete data in Redis.
Impact: Data corruption, application malfunction, denial of service by data deletion, manipulation of application logic.
Affected Redis Component: Redis Server Core, Data Storage, Command Processing
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement strong authentication and authorization using `requirepass` and ACLs.
    * Apply the principle of least privilege for Redis access.
    * Regularly audit Redis access logs for suspicious modifications.

## Threat: [Data Injection through Vulnerable Application Logic](./threats/data_injection_through_vulnerable_application_logic.md)

Description: An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application code that interacts with Redis (e.g., command injection) to send malicious Redis commands. While the vulnerability is in the application, it directly leverages Redis command processing.
Impact: Execution of arbitrary Redis commands, potentially leading to data manipulation, information disclosure, or remote code execution (if Lua scripting is enabled and vulnerable).
Affected Redis Component: Application-Redis Interaction, Redis Command Processing
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement input validation and sanitization in application code.
    * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for Redis commands.
    * Follow secure coding practices for Redis interactions.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion (Memory, Connections, CPU)](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion__memory__connections__cpu_.md)

Description: An attacker floods Redis with requests, stores excessive data, or uses resource-intensive commands to exhaust server resources (memory, connections, CPU).
Impact: Redis server becomes unresponsive, leading to application denial of service.
Affected Redis Component: Redis Server Core, Resource Management, Command Processing
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement rate limiting at the application level.
    * Set `maxmemory` limits and eviction policies.
    * Set `maxclients` limit.
    * Monitor Redis resource usage and detect DoS attacks.
    * Use firewall rules and intrusion detection systems.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known Redis Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_known_redis_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities in outdated Redis versions to gain unauthorized access, execute code, or cause denial of service.
Impact: Full compromise of the Redis server, data breaches, data manipulation, application downtime, potentially remote code execution.
Affected Redis Component: Redis Server Core, Specific Vulnerable Functions/Modules
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep Redis software up-to-date with security patches and stable versions.
    * Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor advisories.
    * Regularly scan Redis instances for vulnerabilities.
    * Follow secure configuration guidelines.
