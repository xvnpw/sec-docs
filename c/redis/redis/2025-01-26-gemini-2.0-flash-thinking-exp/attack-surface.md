# Attack Surface Analysis for redis/redis

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Network Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_network_access.md)

*   **Description:**  Exposing a Redis instance to a network without authentication allows unauthorized access and command execution. This is a direct consequence of Redis's default configuration.
*   **Redis Contribution:** Redis, by default, binds to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) and lacks built-in authentication unless explicitly configured. This default behavior directly creates the attack surface.
*   **Example:** A cloud-hosted Redis instance is launched with default settings, exposing port 6379 to the public internet. An attacker uses `redis-cli -h <public_ip>` and successfully connects without any password prompt, gaining full control over the Redis instance.
*   **Impact:** **Critical** - Full data breach (if sensitive data is stored), complete data manipulation or deletion, denial of service, and potential for further server compromise in specific environments.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Authentication:**  Immediately configure `requirepass` in `redis.conf` with a strong, randomly generated password. Enforce password usage in all application Redis clients.
    *   **Network Isolation:**  Bind Redis to `127.0.0.1` for local access only, or to specific private network interfaces using the `bind` directive in `redis.conf`.  Isolate Redis within a private network segment.
    *   **Firewall Enforcement:** Implement strict firewall rules to block external access to the Redis port (6379) from untrusted networks.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection and Abuse via Dangerous Commands](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_and_abuse_via_dangerous_commands.md)

*   **Description:**  Redis's powerful command set includes commands that, if misused by an attacker (even with authentication), can lead to severe security breaches. This attack surface stems from the inherent capabilities of Redis commands.
*   **Redis Contribution:** Redis provides commands like `EVAL`, `CONFIG SET`, `MODULE LOAD`, `SCRIPT LOAD`, and `DEBUG OBJECT` designed for advanced functionality but also offering significant potential for abuse if access is not carefully controlled.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains valid Redis credentials (e.g., through application vulnerability). They then use `CONFIG SET dir /var/www/html/` and `CONFIG SET dbfilename shell.php` followed by `SAVE`. This could potentially write a PHP shell to the web server's document root if the Redis process has write permissions and the directory is writable, leading to web server compromise. Alternatively, `EVAL` can be used for arbitrary Lua code execution within Redis.
*   **Impact:** **Critical** - Arbitrary code execution (via modules or Lua), full data breach and manipulation, configuration changes leading to weakened security, potential for lateral movement within the infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Command Access (ACLs):**  Utilize Redis ACLs (Redis 6+) to meticulously control command permissions for different users or roles.  Grant only the minimum necessary command access for application functionality.
    *   **Disable Dangerous Commands:**  Use `rename-command` in `redis.conf` to rename or completely disable highly sensitive commands like `EVAL`, `CONFIG`, `SCRIPT`, `MODULE`, `FUNCTION`, `DEBUG`, `CLUSTER SLOTS`, `KEYS`, `FLUSHALL`, `FLUSHDB`, if they are not absolutely essential for the application.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Application Layer):**  While not directly mitigating Redis's attack surface, robust input validation in the application is crucial to prevent application-level command injection vulnerabilities that could be exploited via Redis.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion Attacks](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can exploit resource-intensive Redis commands or patterns to overwhelm the server, causing denial of service. This vulnerability is inherent in how Redis processes commands and manages resources.
*   **Redis Contribution:**  Certain Redis commands, especially when used with large datasets or in high volumes, can consume significant CPU, memory, and connection resources.  Lack of proper resource limits and monitoring in Redis can exacerbate this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods the Redis server with `SORT` commands on extremely large sets without `LIMIT`, or sends a massive number of `KEYS *` commands. This rapidly consumes CPU and memory, causing Redis to become unresponsive and unable to serve legitimate application requests, leading to a service outage.
*   **Impact:** **High** - Service outage, application downtime, disruption of critical business functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Resource Limits:**  Configure `maxmemory` and eviction policies in `redis.conf` to control memory usage. Set `maxclients` to limit concurrent connections. Use OS-level resource limits (e.g., `ulimit`).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the application or network level to restrict the rate of requests to Redis, preventing command flooding attacks.
    *   **Monitor Redis Performance:**  Continuously monitor Redis resource usage (CPU, memory, connections, command latency) to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks or performance degradation. Set up alerts for resource thresholds.
    *   **Optimize Command Usage:**  Educate developers on efficient Redis command usage, avoiding resource-intensive operations where possible, and using techniques like pagination (`SCAN` instead of `KEYS`, `LIMIT` with `SORT`).

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Loaded Redis Modules](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_loaded_redis_modules.md)

*   **Description:**  If Redis modules are used, vulnerabilities within these modules can directly compromise the Redis instance and potentially the underlying system. This attack surface is introduced by extending Redis's core functionality with external code.
*   **Redis Contribution:** Redis's module system allows loading external code into the Redis server process.  The security of these modules is not guaranteed by Redis itself and depends entirely on the module's development and maintenance.
*   **Example:** A Redis module has a buffer overflow vulnerability in its command processing logic. An attacker crafts a malicious command that exploits this buffer overflow, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the Redis server process's context.
*   **Impact:** **Critical** - Arbitrary code execution within Redis, potential system compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, depending on the module vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if vulnerable modules are used)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Module Vetting:**  Implement a rigorous process for vetting and auditing all Redis modules before deployment. Review module source code, security assessments, and community reputation.
    *   **Use Trusted Modules Only:**  Prefer modules from reputable and well-maintained sources with a strong security track record. Avoid using modules from unknown or untrusted developers.
    *   **Keep Modules Updated:**  Regularly update Redis modules to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities. Subscribe to security advisories for used modules.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Module Context):**  Run Redis with modules under a user account with minimal privileges to limit the impact of a module compromise.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Modules:**  Only load modules that are absolutely required for application functionality. Disable or remove any modules that are not actively used.
