## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Redis `**Critical Node**`](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_redis__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the root goal. All subsequent nodes and paths contribute to achieving this goal.
*   **Threat:** Successful exploitation of Redis vulnerabilities or misconfigurations leading to compromise of the application's data, functionality, or availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Network-Based Attacks `**Critical Node**`](./attack_tree_paths/2__network-based_attacks__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities through network access to the Redis server.
*   **Threat:**  Gaining unauthorized access to Redis from the network, bypassing application-level security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Direct Access to Redis `**Critical Node**`](./attack_tree_paths/3__direct_access_to_redis__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Directly connecting to the Redis server over the network, bypassing the application entirely.
*   **Threat:** If Redis is exposed without proper network security, attackers can directly interact with it.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exposed Redis Port (6379/default) `**Critical Node**`](./attack_tree_paths/4__exposed_redis_port__6379default___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Redis listening on a publicly accessible network interface and port (default 6379).
*   **Threat:**  Makes Redis directly reachable from the internet or untrusted networks, significantly increasing attack surface.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. No Authentication (No 'requirepass') `**Critical Node**`](./attack_tree_paths/5__no_authentication__no_'requirepass'___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Redis configured without password authentication (`requirepass` not set).
*   **Threat:** Anyone who can connect to the Redis port can execute arbitrary commands without any credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Execute Arbitrary Redis Commands `**Critical Node**`](./attack_tree_paths/6__execute_arbitrary_redis_commands__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Ability to send and execute any Redis command.
*   **Threat:**  Allows attackers to read, modify, or delete data, execute Lua scripts, potentially load modules, and perform administrative actions if not restricted by ACLs (in Redis 6+).

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Read/Write Application Data in Redis `**Critical Node**`](./attack_tree_paths/7__readwrite_application_data_in_redis__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using arbitrary Redis commands to access and manipulate application data stored in Redis.
*   **Threat:** Data breaches, data corruption, manipulation of application state, and potential for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Weak Authentication (Weak 'requirepass') `**Critical Node**`](./attack_tree_paths/8__weak_authentication__weak_'requirepass'___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Redis configured with a weak or easily guessable password for `requirepass`.
*   **Threat:**  Vulnerable to brute-force attacks, allowing attackers to bypass authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Brute-Force Password `**High-Risk Path**`](./attack_tree_paths/9__brute-force_password__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Attempting to guess the Redis password through repeated authentication attempts.
*   **Threat:** If the password is weak, attackers can successfully brute-force it and gain authenticated access.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Successful Brute-Force `**Critical Node**`](./attack_tree_paths/10__successful_brute-force__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Successful password cracking of the weak `requirepass`.
*   **Threat:**  Leads to authenticated access to Redis, allowing execution of arbitrary commands (as in node 6).

## Attack Tree Path: [11. Redis Command Injection (via Application Vulnerability) `**Critical Node**`](./attack_tree_paths/11__redis_command_injection__via_application_vulnerability___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Flaws in application code (e.g., improper input sanitization, insecure string concatenation) that enable command injection.
*   **Threat:**  The root cause of Redis command injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [13. Bypass Application Logic `**High-Risk Path**`](./attack_tree_paths/13__bypass_application_logic__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Threat:** Data integrity compromise, data breaches, application malfunction.

## Attack Tree Path: [15. Gain Unauthorized Access `**High-Risk Path**`](./attack_tree_paths/15__gain_unauthorized_access__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using Redis command injection to manipulate authentication or authorization data in Redis to gain access to user accounts or administrative privileges.
*   **Threat:** Account takeover, privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive application features.

## Attack Tree Path: [16. Data Manipulation for Application Logic Exploitation `**Critical Node**`](./attack_tree_paths/16__data_manipulation_for_application_logic_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Directly modifying data within Redis to manipulate the application's behavior and logic.
*   **Threat:** Exploiting application logic flaws by altering data used by the application, even without command injection.

*   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating session data in Redis to hijack user sessions.
*   **Threat:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [18. Privilege Escalation (if roles/permissions stored in Redis) `**High-Risk Path**`](./attack_tree_paths/18__privilege_escalation__if_rolespermissions_stored_in_redis___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Modifying user role or permission data in Redis to gain elevated privileges.
*   **Threat:** Unauthorized administrative access, ability to perform privileged actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [19. Business Logic Bypass (e.g., manipulating counters, flags, etc.) `**High-Risk Path**`](./attack_tree_paths/19__business_logic_bypass__e_g___manipulating_counters__flags__etc____high-risk_path_.md)
