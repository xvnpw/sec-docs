# Analysis of "Weak or Missing Authentication" Attack Surface in Redis

"""
This analysis provides a deep dive into the "Weak or Missing Authentication" attack surface
for applications utilizing Redis (https://github.com/redis/redis). It is tailored for
a development team to understand the risks, implications, and necessary mitigation strategies.

        self.description = "Redis is configured with a weak password, default password, or no password at all."
        self.redis_contribution = """
        Redis relies on a simple password mechanism (`requirepass`) for authentication, which can be easily guessed if not set or set to a weak value.
        Older versions lack more robust authentication mechanisms like per-user accounts.
        While Redis 6+ introduces Access Control Lists (ACLs), many deployments might still rely on `requirepass`.
        The default configuration of Redis is to run without any authentication, making it immediately vulnerable if exposed.
        """
        self.example = """
        An attacker scans for open Redis ports (default 6379) on the network.
        Finding one without a password or with a default/weak password, they can connect using tools like `redis-cli`.
        Once connected, they can execute arbitrary Redis commands:
          - `KEYS *`: List all keys, potentially revealing sensitive data structures.
          - `GET <key>`: Retrieve the value of a specific key, exposing sensitive information.
          - `SET <key> <malicious_data>`: Modify existing data, leading to data corruption or application malfunction.
          - `FLUSHALL`: Delete all data in the Redis instance, causing a denial of service.
          - `CONFIG SET dir /tmp/`: Change the directory where Redis writes its database files.
          - `CONFIG SET dbfilename shell.so`: Change the database filename to a malicious shared object.
          - `SAVE`: Trigger a save operation, writing the malicious shared object to disk.
          - `MODULE LOAD /tmp/shell.so`: Load the malicious shared object, potentially leading to remote code execution.
          - `EVAL 'os.execute("malicious_command")'`: Execute arbitrary system commands using Lua scripting (if enabled).
        """
        self.impact = """
        Complete compromise of Redis data: Attackers can read, modify, or delete any data stored in Redis.
        Potential for data exfiltration: Sensitive information stored in Redis can be stolen.
        Data modification and corruption: Attackers can alter data, leading to application errors and inconsistencies.
        Denial of service: Attackers can delete all data or overload the server, making the application unavailable.
        Remote code execution: Through Lua scripting or module loading vulnerabilities, attackers can gain control of the server hosting Redis.
        Lateral movement: A compromised Redis instance can be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.
        Reputational damage: A security breach can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
        Compliance violations: Failure to secure Redis can lead to violations of data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

                        - Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.
                        - The password should be long (at least 16 characters), contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

                        - Enforces the principle of least privilege.

                        - The frequency of rotation should be based on the sensitivity of the data and the organization's security policies.
