# Threat Model Analysis for redis/redis

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access via Unprotected Instance](./threats/unauthorized_access_via_unprotected_instance.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a Redis instance that is exposed to the network without any authentication configured. The attacker can connect directly to the Redis port (default 6379) from any reachable network due to Redis's default behavior of listening on all interfaces without authentication.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can read all data stored in Redis, modify or delete data, execute arbitrary Redis commands including those that could lead to remote code execution on the server hosting Redis (e.g., using `CONFIG SET dir` and `CONFIG SET dbfilename` followed by `SAVE`). This is a direct consequence of Redis's initial configuration.
*   **Affected Component:** Redis Server (Networking, Configuration)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable the `requirepass` option in the `redis.conf` file and set a strong, randomly generated password.
    *   Use network firewalls (iptables, firewalld, cloud security groups) to restrict access to the Redis port (6379) only to authorized application servers.
    *   Consider binding Redis to a specific internal IP address or the loopback interface if it doesn't need to be accessed from outside the local machine.
    *   Use TLS encryption for client-server communication to protect credentials in transit.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Lua Scripting](./threats/command_injection_via_lua_scripting.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Lua scripting within Redis, an attacker might inject malicious code into the scripts or provide crafted input that, when processed by the script, executes unintended or harmful Redis commands. This vulnerability exists within Redis's Lua scripting engine.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can manipulate data, execute arbitrary Redis commands, potentially bypass access controls, or even perform actions that could impact the underlying server if the Lua script interacts with external systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Redis Server (Lua Scripting Engine)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all input data used in Lua scripts.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when writing Lua scripts for Redis, avoiding the use of potentially dangerous commands or constructs.
    *   Minimize the use of dynamic script generation or execution based on user input.
    *   If possible, restrict the permissions of the Lua scripts to the minimum necessary set of commands.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Redis Modules](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_redis_modules.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Redis modules, vulnerabilities within the module code itself could be exploited by attackers to compromise the Redis instance or the underlying server. This is a risk inherent in extending Redis functionality through external modules.
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability, but could range from data breaches and denial of service to remote code execution within the Redis process.
*   **Affected Component:** Redis Modules (Specific modules used)
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the module and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only use reputable and well-maintained Redis modules from trusted sources.
    *   Keep the Redis server and all installed modules up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Regularly review the security advisories and changelogs of the modules being used.
    *   If possible, limit the use of modules to only those that are strictly necessary.

## Threat: [Replication Data Poisoning](./threats/replication_data_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** In a Redis replication setup, if a master instance is compromised (due to a vulnerability in Redis or misconfiguration), an attacker could inject malicious data into the master, which would then be replicated to all slave instances. This is a risk inherent in Redis's replication mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Corruption of data across the entire Redis cluster, potentially leading to widespread application failures or data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** Redis Server (Replication Mechanism)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the master Redis instance as a primary concern.
    *   Use authentication for replication (`masterauth` and `requirepass`).
    *   Monitor the replication process for anomalies.
    *   Implement regular data integrity checks across master and slave instances.
