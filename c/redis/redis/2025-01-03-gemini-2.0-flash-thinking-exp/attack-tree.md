# Attack Tree Analysis for redis/redis

Objective: Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Redis instance it utilizes.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* **Compromise Application via Redis Exploitation**
    * **Gain Unauthorized Access to Redis**
        * Exploit Lack of Authentication
        * Exploit Weak Authentication
        * Network Exposure without Proper Firewalling
    * **Manipulate Data within Redis to Compromise Application Logic**
        * Corrupt Application Data
    * **Abuse Redis Commands for Malicious Purposes**
        * Abuse `CONFIG` Command
            * Modify `dir` and `dbfilename` to Write Arbitrary Files
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Path 1: Gain Unauthorized Access leading to Data Corruption](./attack_tree_paths/path_1_gain_unauthorized_access_leading_to_data_corruption.md)

**Attack Steps:**
1. Exploit Lack of Authentication OR Exploit Weak Authentication OR Network Exposure without Proper Firewalling (to gain unauthorized access).
2. Corrupt Application Data (by directly modifying critical data within Redis).
**Impact:**  Severe disruption of application functionality, potential data integrity issues, unauthorized access to features or data based on manipulated data.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always configure a strong password using `requirepass` in redis.conf.
* Use strong, randomly generated passwords for Redis authentication.
* Ensure the Redis port is only accessible from trusted application servers using firewalls.
* Carefully design data structures and access patterns in Redis.
* Implement input validation and sanitization on data retrieved from Redis before using it in critical application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 2: Gain Unauthorized Access leading to Arbitrary File Write via `CONFIG`](./attack_tree_paths/path_2_gain_unauthorized_access_leading_to_arbitrary_file_write_via__config_.md)

**Attack Steps:**
1. Exploit Lack of Authentication OR Exploit Weak Authentication OR Network Exposure without Proper Firewalling (to gain unauthorized access).
2. Abuse `CONFIG` Command (to change `dir` and `dbfilename`).
3. Modify `dir` and `dbfilename` to Write Arbitrary Files (placing malicious files on the server).
**Impact:** Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) by writing malicious scripts (e.g., web shells) to accessible locations on the server. Full compromise of the server hosting Redis.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always configure a strong password using `requirepass` in redis.conf.
* Use strong, randomly generated passwords for Redis authentication.
* Ensure the Redis port is only accessible from trusted application servers using firewalls.
* Restrict access to the `CONFIG` command using ACLs (if using Redis 6+) or by disabling it entirely if not needed.
* Ensure the Redis process has minimal write permissions.
