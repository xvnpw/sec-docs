# Attack Surface Analysis for redis/redis

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Communication](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_communication.md)

**Attack Surface: Unencrypted Communication**

- **Description:** Data transmitted between the application and Redis is not encrypted.
- **How Redis Contributes:** Redis, by default, does not enforce encryption for client connections.
- **Example:** An attacker on the same network can use a network sniffer (like Wireshark) to capture commands and data being exchanged between the application and Redis, including potentially sensitive information or authentication credentials.
- **Impact:** Confidential data leakage, potential for command injection by modifying intercepted packets.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Enable TLS/SSL encryption for Redis connections using `stunnel` or similar tools.
    - Utilize Redis 6+ built-in TLS support.
    - Deploy Redis on an isolated and trusted network.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Missing Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_missing_authentication.md)

**Attack Surface: Weak or Missing Authentication**

- **Description:** Redis is configured with a weak password, default password, or no password at all.
- **How Redis Contributes:** Redis relies on a simple password mechanism (`requirepass`) for authentication, which can be easily guessed if not set or set to a weak value. Older versions lack more robust authentication mechanisms like per-user accounts.
- **Example:** An attacker scans for open Redis ports on the network. Finding one without a password or with a default/weak password, they can connect and execute arbitrary Redis commands, potentially dumping all data or even executing Lua scripts.
- **Impact:** Complete compromise of Redis data, potential for data exfiltration, modification, deletion, and denial of service.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Configure a strong, randomly generated password using the `requirepass` directive in the Redis configuration file.
    - For Redis 6 and later, utilize Redis ACLs to create specific user accounts with limited permissions.
    - Regularly rotate the Redis password.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure to Untrusted Networks](./attack_surfaces/exposure_to_untrusted_networks.md)

**Attack Surface: Exposure to Untrusted Networks**

- **Description:** The Redis port (default 6379) is directly accessible from the public internet or untrusted networks.
- **How Redis Contributes:** Redis, by default, listens on all network interfaces. If not properly configured, it can be exposed beyond the intended internal network.
- **Example:** An attacker on the internet can directly connect to the exposed Redis instance and attempt to authenticate (if a password is set) or exploit vulnerabilities if no authentication is required.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service, potential for remote code execution if vulnerabilities exist.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Bind Redis to specific internal IP addresses using the `bind` directive in the configuration file.
    - Use a firewall to restrict access to the Redis port (6379) to only trusted IP addresses or networks.
    - Deploy Redis within a private network segment.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Dangerous Commands](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_dangerous_commands.md)

**Attack Surface: Abuse of Dangerous Commands**

- **Description:** Attackers with access to Redis can execute powerful and potentially destructive commands.
- **How Redis Contributes:** Redis provides commands like `CONFIG`, `FLUSHALL`, `SCRIPT`, `EVAL`, etc., which can be misused to reconfigure the server, delete all data, or execute arbitrary Lua scripts.
- **Example:** An attacker who has compromised the application or gained unauthorized access to Redis credentials uses the `FLUSHALL` command to delete all data stored in Redis, causing significant data loss and application disruption.
- **Impact:** Data loss, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution on the Redis server.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Utilize Redis ACLs (in Redis 6+) to restrict user permissions and disable dangerous commands for less privileged users.
    - Monitor Redis command execution for suspicious activity.
    - Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to Redis.

## Attack Surface: [Lua Scripting Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/lua_scripting_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Surface: Lua Scripting Vulnerabilities**

- **Description:** If Lua scripting is enabled, vulnerabilities in the scripts themselves or the interaction between the application and the scripts can be exploited.
- **How Redis Contributes:** Redis allows the execution of Lua scripts on the server, providing powerful functionality but also introducing a potential attack vector if scripts are not carefully written and managed.
- **Example:** A poorly written Lua script might have vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to escape the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the Redis server's operating system.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Redis server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully review and audit all Lua scripts used with Redis for potential vulnerabilities.
    - Apply the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to execute scripts.
    - Consider disabling Lua scripting if it's not strictly necessary.
    - Keep Redis and any related scripting environments up to date with security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Redis Modules Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/redis_modules_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Surface: Redis Modules Vulnerabilities**

- **Description:** If using Redis modules, vulnerabilities within those modules can introduce new attack vectors.
- **How Redis Contributes:** Redis's modular architecture allows extending its functionality, but these modules are third-party code and may contain security flaws.
- **Example:** A vulnerability in a specific Redis module could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service, crash the Redis server, or even execute arbitrary code.
- **Impact:** Varies depending on the module vulnerability, potentially ranging from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Only use trusted and well-maintained Redis modules.
    - Keep all Redis modules up to date with the latest security patches.
    - Regularly audit the security of used Redis modules.
    - Follow security best practices for the development and deployment of Redis modules if you are creating your own.
