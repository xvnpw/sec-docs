# Threat Model Analysis for redis/hiredis

## Threat: [Threat: Buffer Over-read in Response Parsing](./threats/threat_buffer_over-read_in_response_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in `hiredis`'s response parsing logic (e.g., when handling bulk strings or arrays) causes it to read beyond the allocated buffer when processing a response from a Redis server.  This is a *direct* vulnerability in `hiredis`'s code, triggered by a malformed or unexpectedly large response. This is *not* about the application failing to check response sizes; it's about `hiredis` itself having a bug that causes it to read out of bounds.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure (leakage of memory contents).  This could expose other data handled by `hiredis`, or potentially even data from other parts of the application's memory.
    *   Application crashes.
*   **Affected Hiredis Component:** The parsing functions within `hiredis` that handle different Redis reply types, particularly those dealing with bulk strings and arrays (within `redisReaderGetReply` and related functions).  Specific vulnerable functions would depend on the exact nature of the bug (which would need to be identified through code review, fuzzing, or a published CVE).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Primary Mitigation: Update `hiredis`:** Keep `hiredis` up-to-date to the *latest* version.  This is the most crucial step, as it incorporates security patches.  Monitor the `hiredis` release notes and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Perform rigorous fuzz testing of `hiredis`'s response parsing logic, specifically targeting bulk strings, arrays, and other complex reply types.  Use a fuzzer that can generate malformed and oversized inputs.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., Coverity, clang-analyzer) to scan the `hiredis` source code for potential buffer over-reads.
    *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Compile and run `hiredis` (and the application using it) with memory safety tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan) or Valgrind's Memcheck during development and testing.  These tools can detect memory errors at runtime.

## Threat: [Threat: Denial of Service via Malformed Response (Hiredis Crash)](./threats/threat_denial_of_service_via_malformed_response__hiredis_crash_.md)

*   **Description:** A crafted, malformed response from a compromised or malicious Redis server (or a man-in-the-middle attacker) triggers a bug in `hiredis`'s parsing logic.  This bug *directly* causes `hiredis` to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition for the application using `hiredis`. This is distinct from the application misusing `hiredis`; the vulnerability is *within* `hiredis`'s parsing code. The malformed response could exploit integer overflows, buffer overflows, or other logic errors within the parsing functions.
*   **Impact:** Application crash or unresponsiveness, leading to denial of service. The application using `hiredis` becomes unavailable.
*   **Affected Hiredis Component:** The parsing functions within `hiredis` that handle different Redis reply types (e.g., `redisReaderGetReply`, and the functions it calls internally). The specific vulnerable function would depend on the exact nature of the bug.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Primary Mitigation: Update `hiredis`:**  Keep `hiredis` meticulously up-to-date.  This is the most effective way to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Extensive fuzz testing of `hiredis`'s response parsing is crucial.  Focus on generating a wide variety of malformed responses, including those with invalid lengths, incorrect types, and unexpected characters.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the parsing code, such as integer overflows, buffer overflows, and uninitialized memory reads.
    *   **TLS Encryption:** Use TLS to encrypt the communication between the application and the Redis server.  This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks that could inject malformed responses.  While TLS doesn't directly fix a `hiredis` bug, it makes exploitation harder.
    * **Redis Server Security:** Ensure the Redis server is secured to prevent compromise.

## Threat: [Threat: Integer Overflow in Parsing (Leading to Crash/Vulnerability)](./threats/threat_integer_overflow_in_parsing__leading_to_crashvulnerability_.md)

* **Description:** `hiredis` receives a very large integer value from Redis (e.g., as part of a reply, or a bulk string length). The internal parsing logic within `hiredis` doesn't handle potential integer overflows correctly. While less likely to be directly exploitable than a buffer overflow, a severe integer overflow *could* lead to a crash or, in rare cases, a more complex vulnerability. This is a vulnerability *within* hiredis' parsing code.
* **Impact:**
    * Application crashes.
    * Potential for security vulnerabilities (though less likely and harder to exploit than buffer overflows). The overflow could lead to incorrect memory allocation or other logic errors.
* **Affected Hiredis Component:** The integer parsing functions within `hiredis` (e.g., functions that convert string representations of integers to numeric types). These are often internal functions called by `redisReaderGetReply`. The specific functions would depend on the exact vulnerability.
* **Risk Severity:** High (primarily due to the potential for crashes, even if direct exploitation is less likely)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Primary Mitigation: Update `hiredis`:** Keep `hiredis` up-to-date with the latest releases.
    * **Code Review and Static Analysis:** Review the `hiredis` source code (particularly the parsing functions) for potential integer overflow vulnerabilities. Use static analysis tools designed to detect integer overflows.
    * **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz test `hiredis` with very large integer values (both positive and negative) to try to trigger overflows. Focus on edge cases and boundary conditions.
