# Attack Tree Analysis for redis/hiredis

Objective: To achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server *or* to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) *or* to exfiltrate sensitive data stored in Redis, all by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the hiredis library or its interaction with the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve RCE (Remote Code Execution)](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_rce__remote_code_execution_.md)

*   **1.1 Buffer Overflow in hiredis Parsing:**

    *   **1.1.1 Crafted Oversized Reply:** [CRITICAL]
        *   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted, oversized response from a malicious or compromised Redis server that exceeds the buffer size allocated by hiredis for parsing replies.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **1.2 Format String Vulnerability:**

    *   ***1.2.1 Uncontrolled Format String in Logging (Application-Level):*** [CRITICAL]
        *   **Description:** The application uses a format string function (like `printf`) with user-controlled input (e.g., data from Redis) without proper sanitization, allowing the attacker to inject format string specifiers.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH**

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exfiltrate Data](./attack_tree_paths/3__exfiltrate_data.md)

*   **3.2 Exploit hiredis API Misuse (Application-Level):** [CRITICAL]

    *   ***3.2.1 Application Logic Flaws:*** [CRITICAL]
        *   **Description:** The application inadvertently exposes data through its use of hiredis due to flaws in its own logic, such as using user-supplied input to construct Redis keys without validation.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH**

    *   ***3.2.2 Insecure Deserialization (Application-Level):*** [CRITICAL]
        *   **Description:** The application deserializes data retrieved from Redis using an insecure deserialization library, allowing an attacker to inject malicious objects.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE or data exfiltration)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH**

    *   ***3.2.3 Command Injection (Application-Level):*** [CRITICAL]
        *   **Description:** The application allows user input to influence the Redis commands executed through hiredis without proper sanitization, enabling the attacker to inject arbitrary Redis commands.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH**
