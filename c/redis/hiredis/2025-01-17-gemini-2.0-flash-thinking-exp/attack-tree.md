# Attack Tree Analysis for redis/hiredis

Objective: Compromise application using hiredis by exploiting weaknesses within hiredis.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Attack: Compromise Application via Hiredis
    * AND Exploit Hiredis Vulnerabilities
        * OR Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities in Redis Responses
            * **[CRITICAL]** Buffer Overflow in String/Bulk String Parsing **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
                * Send crafted Redis response with oversized string/bulk string
                    * Result: Buffer overflow, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.
        * OR Exploit State Management Issues
            * **[CRITICAL]** Command Injection via Application Logic **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
                * Application constructs Redis commands using unsanitized user input
                    * Result: Execute arbitrary Redis commands, potentially leading to data manipulation or further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities -> Buffer Overflow in String/Bulk String Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities_-_buffer_overflow_in_stringbulk_string_parsing.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious Redis response containing an oversized string or bulk string.
* **Mechanism:** When the application using hiredis receives this response, the hiredis library attempts to parse the string or bulk string. Due to insufficient bounds checking in the hiredis parsing logic, the library writes data beyond the allocated buffer.
* **Impact:** This buffer overflow can lead to memory corruption. Depending on the overwritten memory, this can result in:
    * **Code Execution:** The attacker can overwrite critical parts of the application's memory, potentially injecting and executing arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Denial of Service:** The memory corruption can cause the application to crash or become unstable, leading to a denial of service.
* **Critical Node:** The "Buffer Overflow in String/Bulk String Parsing" is critical because it represents a direct vulnerability within the hiredis library that can be exploited to achieve code execution, the most severe form of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit State Management Issues -> Command Injection via Application Logic](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_state_management_issues_-_command_injection_via_application_logic.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application's code constructs Redis commands by directly incorporating unsanitized user input.
* **Mechanism:** An attacker provides malicious input that, when incorporated into the Redis command, injects unintended Redis commands. For example, if the application constructs a command like `SET user:<username> <user_data>`, an attacker could input a username like `test\r\nDEL another_key\r\n`. This would result in two Redis commands being executed: `SET user:test <user_data>` and `DEL another_key`.
* **Impact:** Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary Redis commands with the privileges of the application. This can lead to:
    * **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can read, modify, or delete any data stored in Redis that the application has access to.
    * **Further Compromise:** The attacker might be able to use Redis commands to gain further access to the application or the underlying system, depending on the application's logic and the Redis configuration. For example, they might be able to flush the database, access sensitive information, or even execute Lua scripts if scripting is enabled.
* **Critical Node:** The "Command Injection via Application Logic" is critical because it is a very common and often easily exploitable vulnerability in web applications that use Redis. Even if hiredis itself is secure, this application-level flaw can lead to significant compromise.
