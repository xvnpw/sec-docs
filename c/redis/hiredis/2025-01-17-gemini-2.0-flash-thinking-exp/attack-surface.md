# Attack Surface Analysis for redis/hiredis

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow in String/Bulk Reply Parsing](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflow_in_stringbulk_reply_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** When parsing string or bulk replies, `hiredis` allocates memory based on the length prefix provided in the Redis protocol. A manipulated Redis server could send a response with a large length prefix but a smaller amount of actual data. If `hiredis` doesn't handle this discrepancy correctly, it could lead to a buffer overflow when writing the received data into the allocated buffer.
*   **How hiredis Contributes:** `hiredis` is responsible for allocating the buffer based on the advertised length and then copying the received data into it. If the allocation or copying logic is flawed, it can lead to overflows.
*   **Example:** A malicious Redis server sends a bulk string reply with a length prefix of `1000`, but only sends `500` bytes of actual data. If `hiredis` attempts to write beyond the actual received data based on the initial length, it could lead to a buffer overflow. Conversely, a large length with a large amount of data could overflow the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact:** Potential for crashes, memory corruption, and in some cases, remote code execution if the overflow can be carefully controlled.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `hiredis` updated to the latest version, as buffer overflow vulnerabilities are often targeted by security patches.
    *   Ensure the application using `hiredis` is running with appropriate memory protection mechanisms (e.g., Address Space Layout Randomization - ASLR, Data Execution Prevention - DEP).
