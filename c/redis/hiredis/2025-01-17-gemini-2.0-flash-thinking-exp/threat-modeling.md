# Threat Model Analysis for redis/hiredis

## Threat: [Malicious Redis Server Response Exploiting Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/malicious_redis_server_response_exploiting_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker controlling the Redis server sends specially crafted responses containing oversized strings, malformed data types, or unexpected protocol elements. This could trigger buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues within `hiredis`'s parsing logic.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution on the application server.
*   **Affected Component:** `hiredis`'s response parsing functions (e.g., functions within `sds.c` for string handling, functions handling different Redis data types in `hiredis.c`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure connection to trusted and secured Redis servers.
    *   Keep `hiredis` updated to the latest version with security patches.
    *   Implement robust error handling to catch parsing failures and prevent crashes.
    *   Consider using memory-safe wrappers or higher-level clients if feasible.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in hiredis String Handling](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_hiredis_string_handling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages a vulnerability in `hiredis`'s string handling functions (likely within `sds.c`) by sending Redis responses with excessively long strings that exceed allocated buffer sizes.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** `hiredis`'s Simple Dynamic Strings (SDS) library (`sds.c`) and functions like `sdsMakeRoom`, `sdscats`, etc.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `hiredis` updated.
    *   Review security advisories for `hiredis`.
    *   Limit the maximum size of data expected from the Redis server within the application logic.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free Vulnerability in hiredis](./threats/use-after-free_vulnerability_in_hiredis.md)

*   **Description:** A flaw in `hiredis`'s memory management allows an attacker to trigger a scenario where memory is freed and then subsequently accessed, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior or exploitable conditions. This could involve race conditions or improper object lifecycle management within `hiredis`.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** Various parts of `hiredis`'s memory management, potentially involving connection contexts, reply objects, or string handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `hiredis` updated.
    *   Carefully review application code interacting with `hiredis` for potential double-free or use-after-free scenarios.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Unencrypted Connection](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_unencrypted_connection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the Redis server when the connection is not secured with TLS. The attacker can eavesdrop on commands and data, potentially stealing sensitive information or modifying commands before they reach the server.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to data, manipulation of application state.
*   **Affected Component:** `hiredis`'s network communication layer (`net.c`) when not configured for TLS.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use TLS encryption for connections to the Redis server.
    *   Configure `hiredis` to establish secure connections using `redisConnectTLS` or similar functions.
    *   Ensure proper certificate validation is enabled.
