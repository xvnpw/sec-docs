# Threat Model Analysis for redis/hiredis

## Threat: [Malicious Redis Server Response Exploitation](./threats/malicious_redis_server_response_exploitation.md)

**Description:** A compromised or malicious Redis server sends specially crafted responses that exploit vulnerabilities in `hiredis`'s parsing logic. This could involve malformed data structures, excessively large responses, or responses designed to trigger buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues within `hiredis` itself. The attacker aims to cause the application to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code due to the vulnerabilities in `hiredis`.

**Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential remote code execution on the application server due to vulnerabilities within `hiredis`.

**Affected hiredis Component:** `hiredis`'s response parsing logic (functions involved in parsing different Redis data types).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the application connects only to trusted and well-secured Redis servers.
* **Critically, regularly update `hiredis` to the latest version to patch known parsing vulnerabilities.**
* Consider using a sandboxed environment for the application to limit the impact of potential exploits within `hiredis`.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Response Parsing](./threats/integer_overflow_in_response_parsing.md)

**Description:** A malicious Redis server sends responses with lengths or sizes that cause integer overflows when processed by `hiredis`. This occurs within `hiredis`'s internal calculations during response parsing, leading to incorrect memory allocation or buffer overflows.

**Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential memory corruption within the application's memory space due to `hiredis`'s flawed memory handling.

**Affected hiredis Component:** `hiredis`'s memory allocation and size calculation logic within the response parsing functions.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Crucially, keep `hiredis` updated to benefit from fixes for integer overflow vulnerabilities.**
* Thoroughly test the application's handling of extremely large and unusual Redis responses in a controlled environment to identify potential issues arising from `hiredis`'s parsing.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack due to `hiredis` TLS Implementation Vulnerabilities](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_due_to__hiredis__tls_implementation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If `hiredis`'s implementation of TLS/SSL has vulnerabilities, an attacker positioned between the application and the Redis server could exploit these flaws to decrypt communication, inject malicious commands, or tamper with data in transit. This is a direct vulnerability within the `hiredis` library's secure communication handling.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to Redis data, manipulation of Redis data.

**Affected hiredis Component:** `hiredis`'s TLS/SSL implementation (if present and vulnerable).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Ensure you are using a version of `hiredis` with a robust and up-to-date TLS implementation.**
* If possible, rely on system-level TLS libraries that are regularly audited and patched, rather than `hiredis` implementing its own.
* Regularly update `hiredis` to patch any identified vulnerabilities in its TLS handling.
* Properly configure TLS/SSL with strong ciphers and certificate verification.
