## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Hiredis Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_hiredis_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on the Application Server [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_application_server__critical_.md)

*   **Execute Arbitrary Code on the Application Server [CRITICAL]:** The attacker's goal is to gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This represents the highest level of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerability in Hiredis (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_corruption_vulnerability_in_hiredis__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerability in Hiredis (HIGH RISK PATH):** This involves exploiting flaws in how `hiredis` manages memory, potentially overwriting critical data or code pointers to gain control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Buffer Overflow in Parsing Redis Responses (HIGH RISK PATH) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_buffer_overflow_in_parsing_redis_responses__high_risk_path___critical_.md)

    *   **Exploit Buffer Overflow in Parsing Redis Responses (HIGH RISK PATH) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker, potentially by compromising the Redis server or through a vulnerability in Redis itself, sends a specially crafted response to the application. This response contains a string or data structure that is larger than the buffer allocated by `hiredis` to store it.
        *   **Mechanism:** When `hiredis` attempts to parse and store this oversized data, it overflows the buffer, writing data into adjacent memory locations. This can overwrite critical program data or even code, potentially allowing the attacker to redirect program execution and execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerability (If Application Deserializes Data Received via Hiredis without Proper Sanitization) (HIGH RISK PATH if applicable) [CRITICAL if applicable]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerability__if_application_deserializes_data_received_via_hiredis_without_a6eee79f.md)

    *   **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerability (If Application Deserializes Data Received via Hiredis without Proper Sanitization) (HIGH RISK PATH if applicable) [CRITICAL if applicable]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the application deserializes data received from Redis (e.g., using libraries like `pickle` in Python or `serialize` in PHP) without proper validation, an attacker can inject malicious serialized objects into the Redis database.
        *   **Mechanism:** When the application retrieves and deserializes this malicious data, the deserialization process can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is because deserialization can instantiate objects and execute code defined within the serialized data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access/Manipulation of Application Data [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_accessmanipulation_of_application_data__critical_.md)

*   **Gain Unauthorized Access/Manipulation of Application Data [CRITICAL]:** The attacker aims to access sensitive application data they are not authorized to see or modify data in a way that benefits them or harms the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Command Injection via Hiredis (HIGH RISK PATH if application is vulnerable) [CRITICAL if application is vulnerable]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_command_injection_via_hiredis__high_risk_path_if_application_is_vulnerable___critical_if_app_ba17bf4d.md)

*   **Exploit Command Injection via Hiredis (HIGH RISK PATH if application is vulnerable) [CRITICAL if application is vulnerable]:** This involves injecting malicious commands into the Redis server through the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Command Construction in Application (HIGH RISK PATH if application is vulnerable) [CRITICAL if application is vulnerable]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_command_construction_in_application__high_risk_path_if_application_is_vulnerable____e8c55e3d.md)

    *   **Exploit Insecure Command Construction in Application (HIGH RISK PATH if application is vulnerable) [CRITICAL if application is vulnerable]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application constructs Redis commands by directly embedding user-provided input without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries.
        *   **Mechanism:** An attacker can manipulate this input to inject additional or modified Redis commands. For example, if the application uses user input to set a key's value, the attacker could inject a command like `; FLUSHALL` to delete all data in the Redis database or ``; GET secret_key` to retrieve sensitive information. `hiredis` will then send these injected commands to the Redis server.
