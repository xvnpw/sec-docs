# Attack Surface Analysis for redis/hiredis

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input.md)

*   **Description:** The application constructs Redis commands by directly embedding user-supplied input without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **How Hiredis Contributes:** `hiredis` executes the commands provided by the application. If the command is malicious due to unsanitized input, `hiredis` will transmit it to the Redis server.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a user-provided key and uses string concatenation to build a `GET` command: `redisCommand(context, "GET %s", user_input);`. A malicious user could input `; DEL dangerous_key; GET another_key` leading to the execution of multiple commands.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, denial of service (by deleting keys), or potentially executing arbitrary Redis functions depending on Redis configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Parameterized Commands: Employ `hiredis` functions like `redisCommandArgv` to pass arguments separately, preventing interpretation of user input as command structure.
        *   Input Validation and Sanitization:  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into Redis commands.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow in Command Construction](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflow_in_command_construction.md)

*   **Description:** The application dynamically constructs excessively long Redis commands, potentially exceeding buffer limits within the application or `hiredis` during formatting or transmission.
    *   **How Hiredis Contributes:** If `hiredis` or the application's usage of it doesn't have robust checks for the length of command components, constructing very long commands could lead to memory corruption.
    *   **Example:** An application builds a very large string to be stored in Redis using repeated concatenation and then uses `redisCommand` with the resulting long string. If the string exceeds internal buffer sizes, it could lead to a crash.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for code execution if the overflow can be controlled.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Limit Input Sizes: Implement limits on the size of user-provided data that contributes to Redis commands.
        *   Use Safe String Handling: Employ safe string manipulation techniques to avoid buffer overflows during command construction.
        *   Test with Large Inputs:  Thoroughly test the application with very large inputs to identify potential buffer overflows.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow in Response Handling](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflow_in_response_handling.md)

*   **Description:** The Redis server sends back responses with excessively large strings or data structures, and `hiredis` doesn't allocate sufficient buffer space to store them.
    *   **How Hiredis Contributes:** If `hiredis` uses fixed-size buffers for receiving and storing responses, a large response from the server can overflow these buffers.
    *   **Example:** A `GET` command on a very large value in Redis returns a string exceeding the buffer allocated by `hiredis` to receive it, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for code execution if the overflow can be controlled.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use `hiredis` Functions Designed for Large Responses: Utilize functions that handle potentially large responses gracefully, possibly involving dynamic memory allocation.
        *   Limit Response Sizes (Application Level): If possible, design the application logic to avoid retrieving excessively large data chunks from Redis.
