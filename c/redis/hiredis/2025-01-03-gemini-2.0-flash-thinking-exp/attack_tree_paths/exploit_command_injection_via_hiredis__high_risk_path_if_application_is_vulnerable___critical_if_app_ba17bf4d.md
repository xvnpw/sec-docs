## Deep Analysis: Exploit Command Injection via Hiredis

This analysis focuses on the attack tree path: **"Exploit Command Injection via Hiredis (HIGH RISK PATH if application is vulnerable) [CRITICAL if application is vulnerable]"**. We will break down the mechanics of this attack, potential vulnerabilities in the application, the impact, and mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Attack Path**

This attack path targets applications that use the `hiredis` library to interact with a Redis server. The core idea is to manipulate the data sent through `hiredis` in a way that the Redis server interprets it as unintended and potentially malicious commands. `hiredis` itself is a client library responsible for formatting and sending commands to Redis and parsing the responses. It doesn't inherently introduce the vulnerability, but it acts as the conduit for the injected commands.

**How the Attack Works**

The attack hinges on the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate input that is eventually used to construct Redis commands sent via `hiredis`. Here's a breakdown of the typical steps involved:

1. **Attacker Input:** The attacker provides malicious input through a vulnerable entry point in the application. This could be a web form, API parameter, command-line argument, or any other source of external data.

2. **Vulnerable Code:** The application processes this input and, without proper sanitization or validation, uses it to construct a Redis command string or array.

3. **Command Construction:** The vulnerable code might directly concatenate the attacker's input into a Redis command string or use it as part of the arguments for a `hiredis` function.

4. **`hiredis` Transmission:** The application uses `hiredis` functions (like `redisCommand`, `redisvCommand`, or specific command functions like `redisSet`) to send the constructed command to the Redis server.

5. **Redis Execution:** The Redis server receives the crafted command and, believing it to be legitimate, executes it. This is where the malicious impact occurs.

**Vulnerability Points in the Application**

The vulnerability lies within the application's code, specifically in how it handles external input and constructs Redis commands. Common scenarios include:

* **Direct String Concatenation:**  The most straightforward vulnerability is directly concatenating user input into a Redis command string. For example:
   ```c
   const char *key = "user_data";
   char buffer[256];
   snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "GET %s", untrusted_input); // Vulnerable!
   redisReply *reply = redisCommand(context, buffer);
   ```
   If `untrusted_input` is something like `"some_key\r\nDEL some_other_key\r\nGET user_data"`, Redis will execute multiple commands, including deleting data.

* **Improper Handling of Array Arguments:**  Even when using functions that take variable arguments, improper handling can lead to injection. For example:
   ```c
   redisReply *reply = redisCommand(context, "SET", "mykey", untrusted_input); // Potentially vulnerable
   ```
   If `untrusted_input` contains characters like newline (`\r\n`) that are used to delimit commands in the Redis protocol, an attacker might be able to inject additional commands.

* **Lack of Input Validation:** Failing to validate the format, length, or allowed characters in user input before using it in Redis commands is a major vulnerability.

* **Building Commands Dynamically Based on User Input:**  Any logic that constructs Redis commands based on user-controlled data without careful sanitization is a potential risk.

**Impact of Successful Command Injection**

A successful command injection attack can have severe consequences, depending on the permissions and configuration of the Redis server and the application's usage of Redis:

* **Data Breach:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive data stored in Redis using commands like `GET`, `HGETALL`, `SMEMBERS`, etc.
* **Data Manipulation/Corruption:**  Commands like `SET`, `DEL`, `SADD`, `SREM`, etc., can be used to modify or delete critical data, leading to application malfunction or data loss.
* **Service Disruption (Denial of Service):**  Commands like `FLUSHALL` or `FLUSHDB` can wipe out all data in Redis, causing significant downtime. Resource-intensive commands could also be injected to overload the Redis server.
* **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** In some configurations where Redis has Lua scripting enabled or external modules loaded, attackers might be able to execute arbitrary code on the Redis server itself, potentially leading to server takeover.
* **Lateral Movement:** If the Redis server has access to other systems or credentials, the attacker might be able to leverage the compromised Redis instance to move laterally within the network.

**Mitigation Strategies**

Preventing command injection vulnerabilities requires a multi-layered approach:

* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    * **Whitelisting:**  The most effective approach is to only allow explicitly defined, safe characters or patterns in user input.
    * **Blacklisting (Less Effective):**  Attempting to block specific malicious characters or patterns is less reliable as attackers can often find ways to bypass these filters.
    * **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that the input conforms to the expected data type (e.g., integer, string).
    * **Length Limits:**  Restrict the length of input fields to prevent overly long or crafted inputs.

* **Parameterized Queries (or Equivalent for Redis):** While Redis doesn't have direct parameterized queries like SQL, you can achieve a similar effect by treating user input as data rather than command components. For example, instead of constructing a command string, use separate arguments:
   ```c
   redisReply *reply = redisCommand(context, "GET %s", "fixed_key"); // Safer if "fixed_key" is hardcoded
   // Even better:
   redisReply *reply = redisCommand(context, "GET", user_provided_key); // Treat user input as a key
   ```
   However, even with this approach, ensure `user_provided_key` is still validated to prevent issues if it's intended to be a specific format.

* **Least Privilege:** Run the Redis server with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running it as root. Limit the commands the application needs to execute. Redis ACLs (Access Control Lists) can be used to restrict the commands a specific connection can execute.

* **Secure Configuration of Redis:**
    * **Disable Dangerous Commands:**  Consider disabling potentially dangerous commands like `EVAL` (Lua scripting), `SCRIPT`, `SAVE`, `BGSAVE`, `CONFIG`, `SHUTDOWN`, etc., if they are not required by the application.
    * **Authentication:**  Always enable the `requirepass` option in `redis.conf` to protect the Redis instance with a password.
    * **Network Security:**  Ensure the Redis server is not directly exposed to the internet. Use firewalls to restrict access to only authorized clients. Consider using TLS/SSL for encrypted communication.

* **Regular Updates:** Keep the `hiredis` library and the Redis server updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.

* **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential command injection vulnerabilities.

* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities.

* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**  A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests before they reach the application.

**Detection and Monitoring**

While prevention is key, implementing detection mechanisms is also crucial:

* **Redis Command Logging:** Enable the `logfile` and `loglevel` configuration options in `redis.conf` to log all executed commands. Monitor these logs for unusual or unexpected commands.
* **Anomaly Detection:**  Implement systems to detect unusual patterns in Redis usage, such as a sudden spike in specific commands or commands being executed from unexpected sources.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Redis logs and application logs into a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and analysis.

**Example Scenario**

Consider an online store application that uses Redis to store user shopping carts. A vulnerable endpoint might allow users to specify product IDs to add to their cart.

**Vulnerable Code (Illustrative):**

```c
// ... retrieving user input for product ID ...
const char *product_id = get_user_input("product_id");
char redis_command[100];
snprintf(redis_command, sizeof(redis_command), "SADD cart:%s %s", user_id, product_id);
redisReply *reply = redisCommand(context, redis_command);
```

**Attack:**

An attacker could provide a malicious `product_id` like: `"123\r\nCONFIG SET dir /tmp\r\nCONFIG SET dbfilename malicious.so\r\nSAVE\r\n"`

**Result:**

The constructed Redis command would be:

```
SADD cart:user_abc 123
CONFIG SET dir /tmp
CONFIG SET dbfilename malicious.so
SAVE
```

This could allow the attacker to write a malicious module to the Redis server's directory and potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Conclusion**

Exploiting command injection via `hiredis` is a serious threat that can have critical consequences. The vulnerability lies primarily in the application's handling of user input and construction of Redis commands. By implementing robust input validation, using secure coding practices, configuring Redis securely, and implementing monitoring mechanisms, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack. It's crucial to treat all external input as potentially malicious and avoid directly incorporating it into command strings without proper sanitization. Collaboration between security experts and development teams is essential to build secure applications that utilize Redis effectively.
