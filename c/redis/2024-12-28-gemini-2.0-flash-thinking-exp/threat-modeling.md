Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the Redis codebase:

*   **Threat:** Unauthenticated Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker connects to the Redis instance without providing any credentials. They might then execute arbitrary Redis commands to read, modify, or delete data, or even reconfigure the server. This is possible if the `requirepass` directive is not set within the Redis configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data breach (reading all data), data corruption or deletion, denial of service by flushing the database or exhausting resources, potential server takeover by using `CONFIG SET` to execute arbitrary commands or load modules.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration (`requirepass` directive), Network Interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Enable `requirepass` with a strong password in the `redis.conf` file. Restrict network access to the Redis port using firewalls. Avoid exposing the Redis port directly to the internet.

*   **Threat:** Weak Password for Authentication
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to brute-force or guess the Redis password set by the `requirepass` directive. If the password configured within `redis.conf` is weak or easily guessable, they can successfully authenticate.
    *   **Impact:** Same as Unauthenticated Access.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration (`requirepass` directive), Authentication mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Enforce strong password policies for the Redis password. Use a long, complex, and randomly generated password when setting `requirepass` in `redis.conf`. Regularly rotate the Redis password.

*   **Threat:** Data Exposure in Transit
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between clients and the Redis server. Since Redis communication is not encrypted by default, they can read sensitive data being transmitted over the network.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive application data, session tokens, or other confidential information stored in Redis.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network communication protocol.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Enable TLS encryption for Redis connections using the `tls-port` and related configuration options in `redis.conf`. Ensure proper certificate management.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerable Lua Scripts
    *   **Description:** If Lua scripting is enabled in the Redis configuration and the application uses custom Lua scripts, an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within these scripts to perform unauthorized actions directly within the Redis server, such as accessing sensitive data or executing arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, potential server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Lua scripting engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully review and audit all custom Lua scripts for security vulnerabilities. Apply secure coding practices when writing Lua scripts for Redis. Consider disabling Lua scripting in `redis.conf` if it's not strictly necessary.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Replication
    *   **Description:** An attacker configures a rogue Redis instance to act as a slave to the target Redis master without authorization. This allows them to receive a copy of the data stored in the master through the Redis replication protocol.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach.
    *   **Affected Component:** Replication protocol, Authentication mechanism for replication (`masterauth` in `redis.conf`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Configure the master instance to require authentication for slaves using the `masterauth` directive in `redis.conf`. Restrict network access to the master instance.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Configuration File
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Redis configuration file (`redis.conf`). This file may contain sensitive information such as the authentication password set by `requirepass`.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to authenticate to the Redis instance, potentially leading to full control.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration file handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Secure the Redis configuration file with appropriate file system permissions on the server. Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the configuration file if possible (consider environment variables or secrets management).

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Redis Modules
    *   **Description:** If the application uses Redis modules, vulnerabilities within the Redis module code itself could be exploited by an attacker to perform malicious actions directly within the Redis server process.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the module vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution within the Redis server, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Redis Modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, can be Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Keep Redis and its modules up-to-date with the latest security patches. Only use trusted and well-vetted modules. Regularly audit the modules used in the application.
