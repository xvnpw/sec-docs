## Threat Model: Compromising Application via OSSEC-HIDS Exploitation - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to the application's data, functionality, or underlying infrastructure by leveraging vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the OSSEC-HIDS deployment.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit OSSEC-HIDS Vulnerabilities:**
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Known OSSEC-HIDS CVEs:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify publicly disclosed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) affecting the deployed version of OSSEC-HIDS. They then leverage readily available exploit code or develop their own to target these vulnerabilities.
        * **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the OSSEC-HIDS instance and potentially the underlying server. This can be used to directly compromise the application, steal data, or pivot to other systems.

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Manipulate OSSEC-HIDS Configuration:**
    * **[CRITICAL NODE] Gain Access to OSSEC Configuration Files (ossec.conf, etc.):**
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application itself (e.g., Local File Inclusion) to read the configuration files.
            * Exploiting operating system vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the server's filesystem.
            * Using social engineering techniques to trick authorized personnel into revealing the configuration files.
        * **Potential Impact:** Access to configuration files reveals sensitive information about OSSEC-HIDS rules, active response configurations, and potentially internal network details. This information can be used to craft more targeted attacks or disable security measures.

    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Modify OSSEC Configuration to Disable Security Features:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Once access to the configuration files is gained, attackers modify the `ossec.conf` file or other relevant configuration files to disable critical security features. This might include disabling active response, specific rule sets, or decoders responsible for detecting malicious activity.
        * **Potential Impact:** Disabling security features creates blind spots, allowing malicious activity to go undetected by OSSEC-HIDS. This significantly weakens the overall security posture of the application.

    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Modify OSSEC Configuration to Generate False Negatives:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers modify or create new rules and decoders that specifically ignore patterns of malicious activity they intend to carry out. This effectively tells OSSEC-HIDS to ignore their attacks.
        * **Potential Impact:** This allows attackers to operate undetected, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious activities without triggering alerts.

    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Configuration:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious rules or decoders into the OSSEC-HIDS configuration. These malicious rules can be designed to execute arbitrary commands on the server when specific events occur, or to exfiltrate data.
        * **Potential Impact:** This can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to directly control the server. It can also be used to steal sensitive data by triggering data exfiltration when specific events are logged.

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Trigger Malicious Active Response Actions:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft specific log entries or events that intentionally trigger OSSEC-HIDS's active response mechanisms. If not carefully designed, these active responses could be abused to perform malicious actions, such as blocking legitimate users, shutting down services, or executing harmful commands.
    * **Potential Impact:** This can lead to denial of service for legitimate users, disruption of application functionality, or even further compromise if the active response actions involve executing commands.

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Compromise the Underlying System Hosting OSSEC-HIDS:**
    * **Attack Vectors:** Attackers employ various techniques to gain root or administrative access to the server hosting OSSEC-HIDS. This could involve exploiting operating system vulnerabilities, using stolen credentials, or social engineering.
    * **Potential Impact:** Gaining control of the underlying system effectively bypasses all security controls provided by OSSEC-HIDS. The attacker has full access to the OSSEC-HIDS installation, its data, and the ability to further compromise the application and other systems on the network.
