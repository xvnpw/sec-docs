    *   Deployed on each host requiring monitoring.
    *   Primary responsibility is the secure collection of security-relevant data:
        *   **System Logs:** Extracts and forwards logs from operating systems (e.g., syslog, Windows Event Logs).
        *   **Application Logs:** Collects logs from various applications running on the host.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitors specified files and directories for unauthorized changes, tracking modifications, additions, and deletions.
        *   **Rootkit Detection:** Performs checks for known and suspected rootkit signatures and behaviors.
        *   **Process Monitoring:** Tracks running processes, identifying suspicious or unauthorized activity.
        *   **Network Activity (Optional):** Can monitor network connections and traffic.
    *   Configuration can be managed:
        *   **Locally:** Configuration files reside on the agent host.
        *   **Server-Pushed:** The server centrally manages and distributes agent configurations.
    *   Communicates with the OSSEC server using an encrypted and authenticated channel, typically over TCP.
    *   Performs initial data filtering and normalization before transmission to reduce server load.

*   **OSSEC Server:**
    *   The central hub for receiving, processing, and analyzing data from all connected agents.
    *   Key functions include:
        *   **Log Analysis:** Employs a rule-based engine to analyze received logs, identifying patterns and anomalies indicative of security threats.
        *   **Event Correlation:** Correlates events from multiple agents to detect broader attack patterns.
        *   **Alert Generation:** Triggers alerts based on matched rules and detected security incidents.
        *   **Agent Management:** (Optional) Centrally manages agent configurations, updates, and status.
        *   **API:** Provides an interface for integrating with other security tools and systems (e.g., SIEM, ticketing systems).
        *   **Alert and Event Storage:** Stores generated alerts and raw events in a database or flat files for historical analysis and reporting.
        *   **Active Response:** Can initiate automated responses to detected threats (e.g., blocking an IP address using firewall rules).

*   **Web UI (Optional):**
    *   Provides a user-friendly graphical interface for interacting with the OSSEC server.
    *   Key features include:
        *   **Alert Visualization:** Displays generated alerts with details and context.

```

**Detailed Data Flow Steps:**

*   **Step 1: Security Event Generation:** Security-relevant events occur on the monitored host, such as log entries, file system modifications, process executions, etc.
*   **Step 2: Agent Collection and Pre-processing:** The OSSEC agent collects these events based on its configuration. It performs initial filtering (e.g., ignoring irrelevant logs) and normalization (e.g., standardizing log formats).
*   **Step 3: Secure Transmission:** The agent establishes a secure, encrypted channel (typically using TLS/SSL) with the OSSEC server.
*   **Step 4: Encrypted Data Transmission:** The collected and pre-processed data is transmitted securely to the OSSEC server.
*   **Step 5: Server Analysis and Correlation:** The OSSEC server receives the data and applies its rule-based analysis engine to identify potential security incidents. It can also correlate events from multiple agents.
*   **Step 6: Alert Generation:** When a rule is triggered, an alert is generated, containing details about the event and the matched rule. The original event may be enriched with additional information.
*   **Step 7: Alert and Event Storage:** Generated alerts and the corresponding (potentially enriched) events are stored in the configured database or log files.
*   **Step 8: Real-time Alert Display:** The Web UI (if deployed) can display alerts in real-time as they are generated by the server.
*   **Step 9: Server-Pushed Configuration:** The OSSEC server can push configuration updates to the agents, allowing for centralized management.
*   **Step 10: Active Response:** Upon detecting certain threats, the OSSEC server can trigger active responses, such as executing commands to block an IP address on a firewall or disable a user account.
