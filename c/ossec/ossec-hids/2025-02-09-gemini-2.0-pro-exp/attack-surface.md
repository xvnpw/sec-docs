# Attack Surface Analysis for ossec/ossec-hids

## Attack Surface: [1. Remote Agent Communication (ossec-remoted)](./attack_surfaces/1__remote_agent_communication__ossec-remoted_.md)

*   **Description:**  The `ossec-remoted` daemon on the OSSEC server handles communication with agents, typically over UDP port 1514.  This is the primary communication channel and a major attack vector.
*   **How OSSEC Contributes:** This is a core, *essential* component of OSSEC's agent/server architecture.  Its very existence creates this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted UDP packet to port 1514, exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in `ossec-remoted` to achieve remote code execution.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the OSSEC server, allowing the attacker to control all connected agents, modify rules, and access sensitive data.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Firewalling:**  Strictly limit access to UDP port 1514 to *only* authorized agent IP addresses using a host-based firewall (e.g., `iptables`, `firewalld`) and network firewalls.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep OSSEC HIDS updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities in `ossec-remoted`.  This is *crucial*.
    *   **Input Validation:** (For developers) Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization in `ossec-remoted` to prevent buffer overflows and other injection attacks.  This is a fundamental security practice.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Place OSSEC agents and the server on a dedicated, isolated network segment to limit the impact of a compromise.
    *   **VPN/Tunneling:**  Use a VPN or other secure tunnel for agent communication, especially if agents are on untrusted networks.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention:** Deploy network intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor for and block malicious traffic targeting `ossec-remoted`.

## Attack Surface: [2. Agent Authentication Weakness](./attack_surfaces/2__agent_authentication_weakness.md)

*   **Description:**  OSSEC agents authenticate to the server, typically using a pre-shared key or password. Weak or default credentials allow attackers to impersonate legitimate agents.
*   **How OSSEC Contributes:**  OSSEC's built-in agent authentication mechanism, if misconfigured, is the direct source of this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a brute-force attack to guess the agent authentication key, allowing them to register a malicious agent with the server.
*   **Impact:**  The attacker can inject false data into the OSSEC system, potentially masking real attacks or triggering false alerts.  They might also gain access to information reported by legitimate agents.
*   **Risk Severity:**  High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong, Unique Keys:**  Use strong, unique, and randomly generated pre-shared keys for *each* agent.  Avoid using default keys or easily guessable passwords.  This is non-negotiable.
    *   **Key Rotation:**  Implement a process for regularly rotating agent authentication keys.
    *   **`ossec-authd` Security:** If using `ossec-authd`, strictly limit network access to it (ideally, only allow connections from localhost). Disable it when not actively enrolling agents.  This component is often a point of weakness.
    *   **Centralized Key Management:**  Consider using a centralized key management system to securely store and manage agent keys.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor OSSEC logs for failed authentication attempts and unauthorized agent registrations.

## Attack Surface: [3. Log Analysis Vulnerabilities (ossec-analysisd)](./attack_surfaces/3__log_analysis_vulnerabilities__ossec-analysisd_.md)

*   **Description:**  The `ossec-analysisd` daemon processes logs and applies rules.  Vulnerabilities in the rule engine or log parsing logic can be exploited via crafted log entries.
*   **How OSSEC Contributes:**  This is the core log analysis engine *of* OSSEC, making it an inherent attack surface.  The complexity of rule processing introduces risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a log entry containing a malicious regular expression designed to cause a denial-of-service (ReDoS) attack against `ossec-analysisd`.
*   **Impact:**  Denial-of-service of the OSSEC server, preventing it from processing logs and generating alerts.  In rare cases, code execution *might* be possible, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:**  High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep OSSEC HIDS updated to the latest version.  This is the primary defense against known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Rule Review:**  Thoroughly review and test all custom OSSEC rules, especially those using regular expressions.  Avoid overly complex or nested regular expressions.  This is critical for preventing ReDoS.
    *   **Input Validation:** (For developers) Implement robust input validation and sanitization in `ossec-analysisd` to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Resource Limits:**  Configure resource limits (e.g., memory, CPU) for `ossec-analysisd` to mitigate the impact of denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Log Source Validation:** Whenever possible, validate the authenticity and integrity of log sources *before* they are processed by OSSEC.
    *   **Dedicated Testing Environment:** Use a separate, isolated environment to test new rules and decoders before deploying them to production.

## Attack Surface: [4. API Exposure (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/4__api_exposure__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:**  The OSSEC API, if enabled, provides programmatic access to the OSSEC server.  Without proper security, it's a direct path to compromise.
*   **How OSSEC Contributes:**  The API is a *built-in feature* of OSSEC, and its security is entirely dependent on proper configuration.  Its existence is the attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses the exposed OSSEC API without authentication and uses it to disable all alerts and add a malicious agent.
*   **Impact:**  Complete control over the OSSEC server, allowing the attacker to manipulate rules, agents, and data.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable if Unused:**  Disable the OSSEC API if it's not strictly required.  This is the most effective mitigation if the API is not needed.
    *   **Strong Authentication:**  Enable strong authentication for the API, using API keys or TLS client certificates.
    *   **Authorization:**  Implement granular authorization controls to restrict API access to specific users and actions.
    *   **Network Restrictions:**  Limit API access to specific IP addresses or networks using a firewall.
    *   **Reverse Proxy:**  Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) with authentication, rate limiting, and TLS termination in front of the API.
    *   **Auditing:**  Enable detailed API logging and regularly audit API usage.
