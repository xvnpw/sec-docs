# Threat Model Analysis for ossec/ossec-hids

## Threat: [Agent Compromise and Manipulation (Post-Installation)](./threats/agent_compromise_and_manipulation__post-installation_.md)

*   **Threat:** Agent Compromise and Manipulation (Post-Installation)

    *   **Description:** After OSSEC agent is installed, an attacker with existing root/administrator access *specifically targets* the OSSEC agent. The attacker disables the agent, modifies its configuration (`ossec.conf`, local rules), tampers with monitored files to avoid detection by OSSEC, or uses the agent's communication channel to send false data. This differs from a general host compromise; the attacker's goal is to subvert OSSEC.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of visibility on the compromised host; potential for the attacker to use the compromised agent as a pivot point to attack the OSSEC server; false negatives in security monitoring. OSSEC is rendered ineffective on the compromised host.
    *   **Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Agent (all components: `ossec-agentd`, `ossec-logcollector`, `ossec-syscheckd`, `ossec-rootcheck`, configuration files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Agent Configuration Protection:** Restrict file permissions on `ossec.conf` and local rules files to the absolute minimum. Use a configuration management system to enforce secure configurations and detect unauthorized changes.
        *   **Agent Integrity Monitoring:** Use a separate tool (or a *carefully* configured, separate OSSEC instance) to monitor the integrity of OSSEC agent binaries and configuration files. This detects tampering.
        *   **Agent Health Monitoring:** Continuously monitor agent connectivity and status from the OSSEC server. Alert on prolonged disconnections or unexpected status changes.
        *   **Dedicated Agent Network:** If feasible, use a dedicated, isolated network for agent-server communication, making it harder for an attacker to reach the agent.

## Threat: [Agent Spoofing](./threats/agent_spoofing.md)

*   **Threat:** Agent Spoofing

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts network packets that mimic legitimate OSSEC agent communications. The attacker sends fabricated log data or control messages to the OSSEC server, *without* having compromised a legitimate agent.
    *   **Impact:** False positives in security monitoring; potential denial-of-service (DoS) against the OSSEC server; potential for the attacker to trigger specific (misconfigured) active responses on the server.
    *   **Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Server (network communication handling, `ossec-remoted`), Agent Authentication mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Agent Authentication:** Ensure pre-shared keys are strong, unique per agent, and securely managed. Regularly rotate keys. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the OSSEC server and agent communication on a dedicated network segment, limiting the attacker's ability to reach the server.
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Restrict access to the OSSEC server's listening port (typically UDP 1514) to *only* authorized agent IP addresses.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the OSSEC server to prevent an overwhelming influx of messages from a single (potentially spoofed) source.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on the server to reject malformed or suspicious agent messages, even if they appear to authenticate.

## Threat: [OSSEC Server Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/ossec_server_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** OSSEC Server Denial of Service (DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large volume of *specifically crafted* OSSEC messages (legitimate or illegitimate, but designed to exploit OSSEC's processing) or exploits a vulnerability in the OSSEC *server software itself* to consume excessive server resources. This is distinct from a generic network DoS.
    *   **Impact:** The OSSEC server becomes unresponsive, preventing it from receiving and processing alerts from legitimate agents. Security monitoring is completely disabled.
    *   **Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Server (all components: `ossec-remoted`, `ossec-analysisd`, `ossec-monitord`, `ossec-logcollector`, database interaction if used). The specific component exploited depends on the attack.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limiting and connection limits on the server, specifically tailored to OSSEC message types.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) and alert on unusual spikes *correlated with OSSEC activity*.
        *   **Software Updates:** Keep the OSSEC server software *meticulously* up-to-date to patch any known vulnerabilities in OSSEC components.
        *   **Load Balancing:** Consider using a load balancer in front of multiple OSSEC servers for high availability and resilience *against OSSEC-specific attacks*.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received by the OSSEC server, even from authenticated agents.

## Threat: [OSSEC Server Unauthorized Access (Directly Targeting OSSEC)](./threats/ossec_server_unauthorized_access__directly_targeting_ossec_.md)

*   **Threat:** OSSEC Server Unauthorized Access (Directly Targeting OSSEC)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the OSSEC server, *specifically targeting OSSEC components or configurations*, rather than general OS access. This might involve exploiting an OSSEC vulnerability, misconfigured OSSEC access controls, or weak OSSEC-related credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the OSSEC system; access to all collected security logs; ability to modify server configurations, disable monitoring, or create backdoors *within OSSEC*; data exfiltration of OSSEC logs.
    *   **Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Server (all components), OSSEC configuration files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong OSSEC-Specific Authentication:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for all access to OSSEC management interfaces (if any) and configuration files.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the OSSEC server on a dedicated, highly restricted network segment, limiting access to *only* authorized systems.
        *   **Least Privilege (OSSEC Context):** Ensure that OSSEC processes run with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running OSSEC components as root.
        *   **Auditing (OSSEC Actions):** Enable and monitor audit logs *specifically for OSSEC actions* (configuration changes, rule modifications, etc.).
        *   **Regular Security Audits (OSSEC Focus):** Conduct regular security audits focused on the OSSEC server and its configuration, not just the underlying OS.

## Threat: [OSSEC Server Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/ossec_server_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** OSSEC Server Vulnerability Exploitation

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *in the OSSEC server software itself* (e.g., a buffer overflow in `ossec-remoted`, a code injection vulnerability in a decoder) to gain control of the server.
    *   **Impact:** Same as "OSSEC Server Unauthorized Access" (Critical).  Complete control over the OSSEC server and its data.
    *   **Affected OSSEC Component:** Specific vulnerable component within the OSSEC Server (e.g., `ossec-remoted`, `ossec-analysisd`, a specific decoder). The exact component depends on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Software Updates:** Keep the OSSEC server software *absolutely* up-to-date with the latest security patches. Subscribe to OSSEC security advisories and mailing lists. This is the *most critical* mitigation.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly perform vulnerability scans *specifically targeting the OSSEC server software*.
        *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Consider running the OSSEC server (or individual components) in a sandboxed or containerized environment to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
        *   **Input Validation:** Ensure robust input validation and sanitization is performed on all data received by the OSSEC server, even from authenticated agents. This can mitigate some classes of vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Rule Evasion (Targeting Specific OSSEC Rules)](./threats/rule_evasion__targeting_specific_ossec_rules_.md)

*   **Threat:** Rule Evasion (Targeting Specific OSSEC Rules)

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts their attacks to *specifically* avoid triggering *known* OSSEC rules. This requires knowledge of the deployed OSSEC rule set.
    *   **Impact:** Attacks go undetected by OSSEC, leading to successful compromise, despite OSSEC being deployed.
    *   **Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Server (`ossec-analysisd`, rules and decoders).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rule Updates:** Regularly update OSSEC rules to address new attack techniques and vulnerabilities. Use community-provided rule sets and threat intelligence feeds. Keep up-to-date with the latest attack methods.
        *   **Rule Testing:** Thoroughly test all custom rules (and updated rules) in a non-production environment before deploying them. Use a variety of attack simulations.
        *   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly-based detection rules in addition to signature-based rules. This helps detect attacks that evade known signatures.
        *   **Penetration Testing:** Perform regular penetration testing, *specifically attempting to evade OSSEC detection*.
        *   **Threat Modeling:** Continuously update the threat model to identify new potential attack vectors and evasion techniques.

## Threat: [Misconfigured or Disabled Rules (Impacting OSSEC Functionality)](./threats/misconfigured_or_disabled_rules__impacting_ossec_functionality_.md)

*   **Threat:** Misconfigured or Disabled Rules (Impacting OSSEC Functionality)

    *   **Description:** Critical OSSEC rules are accidentally or maliciously disabled, commented out, or misconfigured (e.g., incorrect regular expressions, thresholds set too high), *directly impacting OSSEC's ability to detect threats*.
    *   **Impact:** Malicious activity goes undetected, leading to successful compromise, because OSSEC is not functioning as intended.
    *   **Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Server (`ossec-analysisd`, rules and decoders, `ossec.conf`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configuration Management:** Use a configuration management system (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef) to enforce desired rule settings and prevent unauthorized modifications. This is crucial.
        *   **Version Control:** Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to rules and configurations, allowing for rollback and auditing.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit OSSEC rule configurations *specifically to ensure that critical rules are enabled and correctly configured*.
        *   **Change Control:** Implement strict change control procedures for *all* rule modifications, requiring review and approval.
        *   **Alerting on Configuration Changes:** Configure OSSEC to alert on changes to its *own* configuration files, including rule files.
