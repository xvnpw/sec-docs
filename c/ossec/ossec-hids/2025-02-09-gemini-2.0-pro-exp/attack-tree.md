# Attack Tree Analysis for ossec/ossec-hids

Objective: To gain unauthorized access to, or disrupt the operation of, the application protected by OSSEC, by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the OSSEC deployment. This includes gaining access to sensitive data monitored by OSSEC, bypassing OSSEC's detection capabilities, or disabling OSSEC itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via OSSEC [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_ossec__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching attacker goal and the root of the attack tree. It represents the ultimate objective of compromising the application by exploiting weaknesses in the OSSEC deployment.
*   **Likelihood:** (Not applicable to the root node - it's the *goal*, not a step)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete application compromise, data breach, service disruption.)
*   **Effort:** (Variable, depends on the specific attack path)
*   **Skill Level:** (Variable, depends on the specific attack path)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** (Variable, depends on the specific attack path)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OSSEC Agent Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ossec_agent_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow in Agent [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_in_agent__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in an agent component (e.g., syscheck, log analysis) that allows an attacker to send crafted input, overflowing a buffer and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary code execution, full system compromise.)
*   **Effort:** High (Requires finding and exploiting a specific vulnerability.)
*   **Skill Level:** High (Exploit development, vulnerability research.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (OSSEC might detect *resulting* malicious activity, but not necessarily the exploit itself. IDS/EDR may help.)

## Attack Tree Path: [RCE via Agent [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/rce_via_agent__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting a vulnerability in the agent's log analysis or other input processing to achieve remote code execution. This could involve crafted syslog messages or other manipulated input.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Remote code execution, full system compromise.)
*   **Effort:** Medium-High (Requires understanding the agent's processing logic and finding a vulnerability.)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High (Log analysis, vulnerability research, potentially exploit development.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High (Requires careful log analysis and potentially custom detection rules.)

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate OSSEC Configuration/Operation](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_ossec_configurationoperation.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Rules [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_rules__cn___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Modifying OSSEC rules to disable detection of specific malicious activities, create false negatives, or otherwise prevent OSSEC from functioning correctly. This requires gaining access to the OSSEC configuration files.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Requires gaining unauthorized access to configuration files.)
*   **Impact:** High (Allows attackers to bypass detection, making other attacks much easier.)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires access to config files and understanding of OSSEC rule syntax.)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (OSSEC configuration, basic scripting.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Requires external integrity monitoring of configuration files.)
