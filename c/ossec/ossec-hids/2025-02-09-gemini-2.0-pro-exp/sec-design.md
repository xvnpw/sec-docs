# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) that is open-source and freely available.
*   Offer a scalable solution suitable for monitoring a range of systems, from single servers to large deployments.
*   Enable early detection of security threats and policy violations on monitored systems.
*   Support compliance with various security standards and regulations.
*   Provide a flexible and customizable system that can be adapted to different environments and needs.
*   Maintain a strong community and ecosystem around the project.

Business Risks:

*   Failure to detect critical security threats, leading to data breaches or system compromise.
*   Inability to scale to meet the needs of growing organizations.
*   Complexity of configuration and management, hindering adoption and effective use.
*   Lack of support for emerging threats and technologies.
*   Vulnerabilities within OSSEC itself, potentially exposing monitored systems to attack.
*   Reputational damage due to security incidents related to OSSEC.
*   Competition from commercial HIDS solutions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: File integrity monitoring (FIM) to detect unauthorized changes to critical system files and configurations. (Implemented in syscheck component)
*   security control: Log analysis to identify suspicious activity and security events from various log sources. (Implemented in analysisd component)
*   security control: Rootkit detection to identify the presence of rootkits on monitored systems. (Implemented in rootcheck component)
*   security control: Active response to automatically take actions in response to detected threats, such as blocking IP addresses or running custom scripts. (Implemented in agent and server components)
*   security control: System inventory to collect information about the monitored systems, including installed software and hardware. (Implemented in agent component)
*   security control: Compliance auditing to check system configurations against security policies and standards. (Implemented via rules and CDB lists)
*   security control: Centralized management to manage and monitor multiple agents from a single server. (Implemented in server component)
*   security control: Encryption of communication between agents and server. (Implemented using pre-shared keys or certificates)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Potential for false positives, requiring tuning and customization of rules.
*   accepted risk: Performance overhead on monitored systems, especially during intensive file integrity checks.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on community support and contributions for ongoing development and maintenance.
*   accepted risk: Complexity of rule creation and management, requiring specialized knowledge.
*   accepted risk: Limited built-in reporting capabilities, requiring integration with external tools for advanced analysis and visualization.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement robust input validation on all user-supplied data, including configuration files and API requests.
*   security control: Regularly update OSSEC to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the OSSEC infrastructure.
*   security control: Implement a strong password policy for OSSEC management interfaces.
*   security control: Enable two-factor authentication for OSSEC management interfaces, if available.
*   security control: Monitor OSSEC's own logs for any signs of suspicious activity or errors.
*   security control: Integrate OSSEC with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized security monitoring and analysis.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Agents must authenticate to the server using pre-shared keys or certificates.
    *   Management interfaces (if any) should require strong authentication.
*   Authorization:
    *   Access to OSSEC management functions should be restricted based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Agents should only have access to the data and functionality necessary for their role.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All input from agents, configuration files, and API requests must be validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Communication between agents and the server must be encrypted using strong cryptographic protocols (e.g., TLS).
    *   Sensitive data, such as passwords and API keys, should be stored securely, preferably using encryption.
*   Auditing:
    *   All security-relevant events, including configuration changes, authentication attempts, and detected threats, should be logged.

## BUILD

The build process for OSSEC involves compiling the source code from the GitHub repository and creating installation packages or Docker images.

```mermaid
graph LR
    developer["Developer"] --> github["GitHub Repository"]
    github --> build_server["Build Server (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)"]
    build_server --> sast["SAST Scanner"]
    build_server --> linter["Code Linter"]
    build_server --> tests["Automated Tests"]
    sast --> build_server
    linter --> build_server
    tests --> build_server
    build_server --> packages["Installation Packages (e.g., .deb, .rpm)"]
    build_server --> docker_registry["Docker Registry"]

```

Build Process Steps:

1.  Developer commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  A build server (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) detects the changes and triggers a build.
3.  The build server checks out the code from the repository.
4.  Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools scan the code for vulnerabilities.
5.  Code linters check the code for style and potential errors.
6.  Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) are executed.
7.  If all checks and tests pass, the build server compiles the code and creates installation packages (e.g., .deb, .rpm).
8.  The build server builds Docker images and pushes them to a Docker registry.

Security Controls:

*   security control: Use of a dedicated build server to isolate the build process.
*   security control: Integration of SAST tools to identify vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
*   security control: Use of code linters to enforce coding standards and prevent common errors.
*   security control: Automated testing to ensure code quality and functionality.
*   security control: Secure storage of build artifacts (installation packages and Docker images).
*   security control: Use of signed packages and images to ensure authenticity and integrity.
*   security control: Regular updates of build tools and dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Intrusion detection and response.
*   Security monitoring and compliance.
*   Data protection.

Data Sensitivity:

*   System logs: Contain information about system activity, including user logins, program executions, and network connections. Sensitivity: Medium to High.
*   File integrity data: Contains hashes and metadata of monitored files. Sensitivity: Medium.
*   Alerts and events: Contain information about detected security threats and policy violations. Sensitivity: High.
*   Configuration files: Contain settings for OSSEC, including rules, policies, and API keys. Sensitivity: High.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) need to be addressed?
*   What are the expected performance requirements for OSSEC in terms of events per second (EPS) and number of agents?
*   What are the existing security tools and infrastructure that OSSEC needs to integrate with?
*   What is the level of expertise of the system administrators who will be managing OSSEC?
*   Are there any specific regulatory or legal requirements related to data retention and privacy?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The organization has a moderate risk appetite and prioritizes security, but also needs a cost-effective solution.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The organization has basic security controls in place, such as firewalls and antivirus software, but needs to improve its host-based intrusion detection capabilities.
*   DESIGN: OSSEC will be deployed in a containerized environment using Docker. The organization has the necessary infrastructure and expertise to manage Docker containers.
*   DESIGN: OSSEC will be integrated with a SIEM system for centralized security monitoring.
*   DESIGN: The organization will use pre-shared keys for agent-server authentication.
*   DESIGN: The organization will regularly update OSSEC to the latest version.
