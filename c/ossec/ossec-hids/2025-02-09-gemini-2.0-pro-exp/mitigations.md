# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ossec/ossec-hids

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Agent Authentication and Authorization (OSSEC-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_agent_authentication_and_authorization__ossec-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Key Generation:** Generate unique, strong (at least 256-bit) cryptographic keys for each OSSEC agent using OSSEC's `manage_agents` tool.  This tool is part of the OSSEC distribution and ensures proper key format.
2.  **Key Distribution:** Use the `manage_agents` tool on the *server* to extract the key for each agent.  Then, use the `manage_agents` tool on the *agent* to import the key. This is the OSSEC-recommended method.
3.  **Server Configuration:**  Ensure the OSSEC server (`ossec.conf`) is configured to *require* authentication.  Set `use_source_ip="yes"` (to restrict connections to known agent IPs) and `use_password="yes"` (to require key-based authentication) within the `<authentication>` section.
4.  **Agent Configuration:**  Ensure each OSSEC agent (`ossec.conf`) has its unique key configured (automatically done by `manage_agents`) and the correct server IP address.
5.  **Regular Key Rotation:** Use a script that leverages `manage_agents` to automate key rotation.  This script should:
    *   Generate new keys.
    *   Import the new keys on the agents.
    *   Update the server's authorized keys.
    *   Restart the OSSEC services (both agent and server).
6.  **Agent ID Validation:** Implement server-side checks (using custom OSSEC rules or external scripts called by OSSEC) to ensure agent IDs are unique and not easily spoofed. This might involve querying a database of registered agent IDs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Rogue Agent Connection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized agents from connecting.
    *   **Agent Impersonation (Severity: Critical):** Makes impersonation much harder.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack (Severity: High):**  When combined with TLS (which OSSEC can use), strong authentication prevents MITM.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Rogue Agent Connection:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **Agent Impersonation:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **MITM Attack:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with TLS).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Key-based authentication is enabled using `manage_agents`.
    *   `use_source_ip` and `use_password` are set to "yes".

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated key rotation script is not implemented.
    *   Agent ID validation (beyond basic OSSEC checks) is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Agent Integrity Monitoring (OSSEC-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/agent_integrity_monitoring__ossec-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Critical Files:**  Create a list of critical OSSEC *agent* files and directories (e.g., `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`, `/var/ossec/bin/*`, `/var/ossec/agentless/*` - adjust paths as needed).
2.  **Server-Side FIM Configuration:** On the OSSEC *server*, configure File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) within the server's `ossec.conf`. Use the `<syscheck>` section.  Crucially, this configuration targets the *agent* files on the *client* machines.
3.  **Baseline Creation:** After configuring FIM, run the OSSEC agent on each monitored host (or use `agent_control -r` on the server) to create a baseline.
4.  **Regular Scanning:** Configure the `<frequency>` within `<syscheck>` to control how often the agent checks for file changes.
5.  **Alerting:** Ensure that the FIM rules on the *server* are configured to generate alerts with appropriate levels (e.g., high severity for changes to agent binaries).
6.  **Whitelisting (Careful):** Use the `<ignore>` directive within `<syscheck>` *sparingly* and *precisely*.  Only whitelist files that are *expected* to change legitimately (e.g., during an authorized agent update).  Document all whitelisted files.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Agent Tampering (Severity: Critical):** Detects unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Malware Infection of Agent (Severity: Critical):** Detects agent compromise.
    *   **Unauthorized Agent Configuration Changes (Severity: High):** Detects configuration tampering.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Agent Tampering:** Risk reduced from Critical to Medium (detection).
    *   **Malware Infection of Agent:** Risk reduced from Critical to Medium (detection).
    *   **Unauthorized Agent Configuration Changes:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (detection).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic FIM configuration on the server monitors a *limited* set of agent files.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive monitoring of *all* critical agent files is incomplete.
    *   Automated baseline updates after legitimate agent updates are not implemented.
    *   Careful and documented whitelisting is not fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Resource Control (OSSEC-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_resource_control__ossec-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Agent Connection Limits:**  On the OSSEC *server*, use the `<client_buffer>` section in `ossec.conf` to limit the buffer size for agent data.  This can help prevent a single compromised agent from flooding the server.  Also, consider using the `<limits>` section to set hard limits on connections per source IP.
2.  **Alert Frequency Limiting:** Within the OSSEC *server's* `ossec.conf`, use the `frequency` and `timeframe` attributes within `<rule>` definitions.  This is crucial for preventing alert fatigue and DoS via alert flooding.  For example: `<rule id="100001" level="7" frequency="10" timeframe="3600">` would only trigger alert 100001 a maximum of 10 times within a 3600-second (1 hour) window.
3. **Log Rotation (OSSEC's Logs):** Configure OSSEC's *own* log rotation within `ossec.conf` using the `<log_rotate>` section. This prevents OSSEC's internal logs from consuming excessive disk space.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Limits the impact of flooding attacks.
    *   **Alert Flooding (Severity: Medium):** Prevents alert storms.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Prevents OSSEC's own logs from filling the disk.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Alert Flooding:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic OSSEC log rotation is configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `client_buffer` and `<limits>` configurations are not optimized to prevent agent flooding.
    *   `frequency` and `timeframe` attributes are not consistently used in all relevant rules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Log Tampering Prevention (OSSEC-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/log_tampering_prevention__ossec-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Near Real-time Forwarding:**  Optimize the `logcollector` settings in the *agent's* `ossec.conf` to minimize the delay between log generation and forwarding to the server.  Reduce the `flush_interval` and ensure `send_logs_on_startup` is enabled.
2. **OSSEC's Internal Integrity Checks:** OSSEC has built in checks. Ensure that `<syscheck>` is enabled and configured to monitor critical system logs. This is a core function of OSSEC.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Tampering (Severity: High):** Reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to modify logs before OSSEC processes them.
    *   **Circumvention of OSSEC Monitoring (Severity: High):** Makes it harder to bypass OSSEC by tampering with logs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Log Tampering:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (reduced window of opportunity).
    *   **Circumvention of OSSEC Monitoring:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Standard OSSEC log forwarding is configured.
    * `<syscheck>` is enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `logcollector` settings are not fully optimized for near real-time forwarding.
