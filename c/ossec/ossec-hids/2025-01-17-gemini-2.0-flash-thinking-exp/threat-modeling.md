# Threat Model Analysis for ossec/ossec-hids

## Threat: [Exploitation of OSSEC Server Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_ossec_server_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in the OSSEC server software. This could involve sending malicious requests, exploiting buffer overflows, or leveraging insecure API endpoints.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the OSSEC server, allowing the attacker to access all collected logs, configuration data, control agents, and potentially pivot to other systems. This can lead to data breaches, manipulation of security monitoring, and further attacks.

**Affected Component:** OSSEC Server (ossec-authd, ossec-analysisd, ossec-dbd, ossec-remoted, API if enabled)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the OSSEC server software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Implement strong access controls and network segmentation to limit access to the OSSEC server.
*   Regularly audit the OSSEC server configuration for security misconfigurations.
*   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) if the OSSEC server exposes a web interface.
*   Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor traffic to the OSSEC server.

## Threat: [Exploitation of OSSEC Agent Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_ossec_agent_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the OSSEC agent software running on a monitored host. This could be achieved through local access or by targeting network services exposed by the agent.

**Impact:** Compromise of the individual host where the vulnerable agent is running. The attacker could gain shell access, disable monitoring on that host, manipulate logs before they are sent, or use the compromised host as a stepping stone for further attacks.

**Affected Component:** OSSEC Agent (ossec-agentd)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep all OSSEC agents updated with the latest security patches.
*   Implement host-based firewalls to restrict network access to the OSSEC agent.
*   Regularly audit the security of the systems where OSSEC agents are installed.
*   Consider using endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions in conjunction with OSSEC.

## Threat: [Compromise of OSSEC Server Configuration](./threats/compromise_of_ossec_server_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the OSSEC server's configuration files (e.g., `ossec.conf`). This could be through exploiting server vulnerabilities, stolen credentials, or insider threats.

**Impact:** The attacker can modify the configuration to disable monitoring for specific threats, exclude critical systems, inject malicious rules, or alter active response actions. This effectively blinds the security monitoring system or turns it into a tool for attack.

**Affected Component:** OSSEC Server (configuration files, ossec-authd)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access controls on the OSSEC server and its configuration files.
*   Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit who can modify the OSSEC configuration.
*   Regularly review and audit the OSSEC configuration for any unauthorized changes.
*   Store OSSEC configuration securely and consider using configuration management tools.

## Threat: [Compromise of OSSEC Agent Configuration](./threats/compromise_of_ossec_agent_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to an OSSEC agent's configuration file (`ossec.conf` on the monitored host). This could be through exploiting local vulnerabilities or stolen credentials on the monitored host.

**Impact:** The attacker can disable monitoring on that specific host, exclude specific files or directories from monitoring, or prevent logs from being sent to the server. This allows malicious activity on that host to go undetected.

**Affected Component:** OSSEC Agent (configuration files, ossec-agentd)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access controls on the monitored hosts and their OSSEC agent configuration files.
*   Regularly audit the security of the systems where OSSEC agents are installed.
*   Consider using centralized configuration management for OSSEC agents.

## Threat: [Log Tampering on Monitored Hosts](./threats/log_tampering_on_monitored_hosts.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to a monitored host and directly modifies or deletes log files before they are collected by the OSSEC agent. This could involve using privileged access to edit log files or disabling the logging service temporarily.

**Impact:** Loss of critical audit trails and forensic evidence, making it difficult to understand the scope and nature of an attack. This can hinder incident response and recovery efforts.

**Affected Component:** OSSEC Agent (log collection module)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access controls on monitored hosts to prevent unauthorized access to log files.
*   Consider using immutable logging solutions where logs cannot be easily modified.
*   Enable file integrity monitoring on critical log files using OSSEC itself.

## Threat: [File Integrity Monitoring Bypass](./threats/file_integrity_monitoring_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker finds ways to modify files on a monitored system without triggering OSSEC's file integrity monitoring alerts. This could involve timing attacks, manipulating the monitoring configuration (if compromised), or exploiting vulnerabilities in the monitoring mechanism.

**Impact:**  Malicious changes to critical system files or application binaries can go undetected, potentially leading to persistent backdoors, malware infections, or data breaches.

**Affected Component:** OSSEC Agent (syscheck module)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure file integrity monitoring to include critical system files and directories.
*   Regularly review the file integrity monitoring configuration to ensure it is comprehensive.
*   Consider using additional security measures like host-based intrusion prevention systems (HIPS).
