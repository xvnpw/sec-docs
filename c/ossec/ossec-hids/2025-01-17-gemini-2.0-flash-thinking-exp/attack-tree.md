## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via OSSEC-HIDS Exploitation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_ossec-hids_exploitation__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of OSSEC-HIDS to compromise the protected application. It's critical because it signifies a complete failure of the security measures related to OSSEC.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise OSSEC Server [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_ossec_server__critical_.md)

This node is critical because gaining control of the OSSEC server allows the attacker to disable or manipulate the entire security monitoring system. This can lead to undetected attacks and further compromise of the application.

    * **Gain Unauthorized Access Through Weak Credentials:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to log in to the OSSEC server or its underlying operating system using default, weak, or compromised credentials. This could be through brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or obtaining credentials through phishing or other means.
        * **Risk:** This path is high-risk due to the potential for easy exploitation if weak credentials are in use, leading directly to full server compromise and the ability to manipulate OSSEC.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Manipulate OSSEC Configuration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__manipulate_ossec_configuration__critical_.md)

This node is critical because modifying the OSSEC configuration allows attackers to disable security rules, ignore their malicious activities, or even redirect alerts, effectively blinding the security team.

    * **Gain Access to OSSEC Configuration Files:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the OSSEC configuration files (e.g., `ossec.conf`, rule files) directly. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in the server's operating system, using stolen credentials, or through misconfigured file permissions.
        * **Risk:** This path is high-risk because direct access to configuration files allows for arbitrary modification of OSSEC's behavior, leading to a high impact on security monitoring.

    * **Inject Malicious Rules to Ignore Attacks:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The attacker, having gained access to the configuration, injects new rules or modifies existing ones to specifically ignore their malicious activities. This could involve adding exceptions for their IP addresses, specific attack patterns, or processes they are using.
        * **Risk:** This path is high-risk as it allows attackers to operate undetected by the very system designed to protect against them. The detection difficulty of such attacks is inherently high.

    * **Disable Critical Monitoring Rules:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The attacker disables existing OSSEC rules that would normally detect malicious activity. This could be done by commenting out rules, removing them entirely, or modifying their conditions to be ineffective.
        * **Risk:** This path is high-risk because it directly reduces the effectiveness of OSSEC, leaving the application vulnerable to attacks that would otherwise be detected.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Manipulate OSSEC Alerts and Logs](./attack_tree_paths/4__manipulate_ossec_alerts_and_logs.md)

This node represents a high-risk area because it allows attackers to either hide their malicious activities or create so much noise that real attacks are missed.

    * **Suppress Legitimate Alerts:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates the OSSEC system to prevent legitimate security alerts from being generated or delivered to administrators. This could involve modifying alert thresholds, silencing specific rules, or interfering with the alert delivery mechanism.
        * **Risk:** This path is high-risk because it directly hinders the ability of security teams to respond to actual threats, potentially leading to significant damage.

    * **Tamper with OSSEC Logs to Hide Malicious Activity:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The attacker modifies or deletes OSSEC logs to remove evidence of their malicious actions. This could involve directly editing log files (if access is gained) or exploiting vulnerabilities in the logging mechanism.
        * **Risk:** This path is high-risk because it can significantly impede incident response and forensic investigations, making it difficult to understand the scope and impact of an attack. The loss of evidence can have severe consequences.
