# Threat Model Analysis for ossec/ossec-hids

## Threat: [Malicious Agent Configuration Changes](./threats/malicious_agent_configuration_changes.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the OSSEC agent's configuration file (`ossec.conf`) on a monitored host. They might modify settings to disable monitoring for specific directories, processes, or users, lower alert thresholds to ignore malicious activity, or redirect logs to a server under their control.

**Impact:**  Critical security events on the compromised host may go undetected, allowing attackers to operate without triggering alerts. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, or further lateral movement within the network.

**Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Agent, Configuration File (`ossec.conf`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong file system permissions on the agent's configuration file, restricting access to only authorized users (e.g., root or a dedicated OSSEC user).
*   Use configuration management tools to enforce and monitor the integrity of the agent configuration.
*   Implement host-based intrusion detection on the agent itself to detect unauthorized modifications to the configuration file.
*   Consider using signed configurations if supported by the OSSEC version.

## Threat: [Agent Process Termination](./threats/agent_process_termination.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges on a monitored host terminates the OSSEC agent process. This can be done through commands like `kill` or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system.

**Impact:** The compromised host will no longer be monitored by OSSEC, leaving it vulnerable to attack without detection.

**Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Agent, Agent Process

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement process monitoring on the host to detect and alert on unexpected termination of the OSSEC agent.
*   Run the OSSEC agent with elevated privileges and configure it to resist termination attempts.
*   Utilize OSSEC's "remoted" functionality to monitor agent status from the server and trigger alerts if an agent becomes unresponsive.
*   Implement host hardening measures to restrict unauthorized process termination.

## Threat: [Agent Binary Replacement](./threats/agent_binary_replacement.md)

**Description:** A sophisticated attacker replaces the legitimate OSSEC agent binary with a malicious version. This malicious binary could disable monitoring, act as a backdoor, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious actions without being detected by the central OSSEC server.

**Impact:** Complete loss of trust in the monitoring data from the affected agent. The attacker gains a persistent presence on the system and can potentially use it as a foothold for further attacks.

**Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Agent, Agent Binary

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) on the OSSEC agent binary itself, using a trusted source for comparison.
*   Utilize secure boot mechanisms and integrity measurement architectures on the monitored hosts.
*   Regularly verify the checksum or digital signature of the OSSEC agent binary against a known good value.
*   Restrict write access to the directory containing the OSSEC agent binary.

## Threat: [Log Tampering at the Agent Level](./threats/log_tampering_at_the_agent_level.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the OSSEC agent and manipulates the logs before they are sent to the server. This could involve deleting evidence of their activity or injecting false log entries to mislead security analysts.

**Impact:** Inaccurate or incomplete security logs hinder incident response and forensic investigations, potentially allowing attackers to remain undetected.

**Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Agent, Log Collection Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong file system permissions on the log files before they are processed by the OSSEC agent.
*   Utilize OSSEC's internal integrity checks for log data transmission.
*   Consider forwarding logs to a separate, hardened logging server or SIEM system for an independent record.
*   Implement host-based intrusion detection to detect unauthorized modifications to log files.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Agent Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_agent_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the OSSEC agent software itself (e.g., buffer overflows, remote code execution flaws) to gain unauthorized access to the monitored system or disrupt the agent's operation.

**Impact:** Agent compromise, potential full system compromise, denial of service of the monitoring system.

**Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Agent, Various Modules

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the OSSEC agent software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Follow security best practices for system hardening on the monitored hosts.
*   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a compromised agent.
*   Consider using a vulnerability scanner to identify potential weaknesses in the OSSEC agent installation.

## Threat: [Compromised OSSEC Server](./threats/compromised_ossec_server.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the central OSSEC server. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in the server software, weak credentials, or social engineering.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the security monitoring infrastructure. Attackers can access logs from all agents, manipulate alerting rules, deploy malicious active responses, and potentially gain access to all monitored systems.

**Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Server, All Modules

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Harden the OSSEC server operating system and applications.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to the OSSEC server.
*   Regularly update the OSSEC server software with the latest security patches.
*   Segment the OSSEC server on a separate network and restrict access.
*   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor traffic to and from the OSSEC server.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Alerting Rules on the Server](./threats/manipulation_of_alerting_rules_on_the_server.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to the OSSEC server modifies or disables alerting rules. This could involve silencing alerts for specific types of attacks or raising thresholds to make detection less likely.

**Impact:** Critical security incidents may go unnoticed, leading to delayed response and potential data breaches or system compromise.

**Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Server, Rule Management Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access controls for modifying alerting rules on the OSSEC server.
*   Audit changes to alerting rules and configuration.
*   Store rule configurations in a version control system to track changes and allow for rollback.
*   Implement secondary alerting mechanisms or integrate with a SIEM for independent alert verification.

## Threat: [Malicious Active Response Triggering](./threats/malicious_active_response_triggering.md)

**Description:** An attacker with control over the OSSEC server or by manipulating log data can trigger malicious active responses on connected agents. This could involve blocking legitimate users, shutting down critical services, or executing arbitrary commands on monitored hosts.

**Impact:** Denial of service, disruption of business operations, potential further compromise of monitored systems.

**Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Server, Active Response Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully configure active responses and limit their scope and impact.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for managing active responses.
*   Implement safeguards to prevent the triggering of active responses based on easily spoofed or manipulated log data.
*   Thoroughly test active response configurations in a non-production environment.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration from the OSSEC Server](./threats/data_exfiltration_from_the_ossec_server.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the OSSEC server and exfiltrates sensitive security logs. These logs can contain valuable information about the application's architecture, vulnerabilities, and ongoing attacks.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive security information, potentially aiding further attacks or revealing confidential data.

**Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Server, Log Storage

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Encrypt the OSSEC server's log storage at rest.
*   Implement strong access controls to restrict access to the log data.
*   Monitor network traffic for unusual outbound data transfers from the OSSEC server.
*   Consider using data loss prevention (DLP) tools.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Agent-Server Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_agent-server_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between an OSSEC agent and the server. They could potentially read sensitive log data, inject malicious commands, or suppress alerts.

**Impact:** Data breach, manipulation of the monitoring system, undetected attacks.

**Affected OSSEC Component:** OSSEC Agent, OSSEC Server, Communication Channel

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that communication between the agent and server is encrypted using strong protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL).
*   Implement mutual authentication between the agent and server using certificates or shared secrets.
*   Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity related to OSSEC communication.
