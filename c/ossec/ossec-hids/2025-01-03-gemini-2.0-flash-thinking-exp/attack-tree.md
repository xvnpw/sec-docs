## Attack Tree Path: [1. Root: Compromise Application via OSSEC-HIDS Exploitation [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__root_compromise_application_via_ossec-hids_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker and is therefore the most critical node. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application by exploiting OSSEC-HIDS.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit OSSEC Agent Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_ossec_agent_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Exploit Agent Software Vulnerabilities [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__exploit_agent_software_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in the OSSEC agent software itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Leverage Known CVEs in OSSEC Agent [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__leverage_known_cves_in_ossec_agent__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers utilize publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the OSSEC agent software. This is a high-risk path because known vulnerabilities often have readily available exploits, making it easier for attackers with moderate skills to succeed.

**Critical Node: Gain Remote Code Execution on Agent Host [CRITICAL_NODE]**

**Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host where the OSSEC agent is running. This grants them significant control over the system, potentially allowing them to access application data, manipulate processes, or use the compromised host as a pivot point for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Exploit Agent Communication Channel Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__exploit_agent_communication_channel_vulnerabilities.md)

This path targets the communication between the OSSEC agent and server.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Agent-Server Communication](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_agent-server_communication.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1.1. Inject Malicious Commands to Agent (if supported by configuration) [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_1__inject_malicious_commands_to_agent__if_supported_by_configuration___high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the OSSEC configuration allows it, an attacker performing a MITM attack can inject malicious commands into the communication stream, instructing the agent to execute arbitrary commands. This is a high-risk path when such configurations are in place.

**Critical Node: Execute Arbitrary Commands on Agent Host [CRITICAL_NODE]**

**Impact:** Similar to exploiting software vulnerabilities, successful command injection grants the attacker significant control over the agent host.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit OSSEC Server Vulnerabilities [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_ossec_server_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Exploit Server Software Vulnerabilities [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__exploit_server_software_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in the central OSSEC server software.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Leverage Known CVEs in OSSEC Server [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__leverage_known_cves_in_ossec_server__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to agent exploitation, attackers utilize publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the OSSEC server software. This is a high-risk path due to the potential for readily available exploits and the critical nature of the server.

**Critical Node: Gain Remote Code Execution on Server Host [CRITICAL_NODE]**

**Impact:** Compromising the OSSEC server is a critical breach. It grants the attacker full control over the central monitoring system, allowing them to disable monitoring, manipulate alerts, and potentially gain access to logs and other sensitive information. This can have a catastrophic impact on the security of all monitored systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Exploit Weak Server Authentication/Authorization [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__exploit_weak_server_authenticationauthorization__high_risk_path_.md)

This path targets weaknesses in how the OSSEC server authenticates and authorizes users, particularly for the web UI or API.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1. Brute-force or Exploit Default Credentials for OSSEC Web UI/API [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1__brute-force_or_exploit_default_credentials_for_ossec_web_uiapi__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to the OSSEC web UI or API by brute-forcing credentials or exploiting default credentials that have not been changed. This is a high-risk path due to the often weak default configurations and the ease of attempting brute-force attacks.

**Impact:** Successful access allows the attacker to modify the OSSEC configuration, potentially disabling monitoring for critical application components or adding rules to ignore malicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Manipulate OSSEC Configuration [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__manipulate_ossec_configuration__high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [4.1. Gain Unauthorized Access to OSSEC Configuration Files [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1__gain_unauthorized_access_to_ossec_configuration_files__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or file system permissions to gain unauthorized read/write access to the OSSEC configuration files. This is a high-risk path because direct modification of configuration can completely undermine the security provided by OSSEC.

**Impact:** Successful modification allows attackers to disable monitoring for specific application components, add rules to ignore their malicious activities, or even alter response actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Abuse OSSEC Response Capabilities](./attack_tree_paths/5__abuse_ossec_response_capabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [5.1. Modify Response Scripts to Perform Malicious Actions [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5_1__modify_response_scripts_to_perform_malicious_actions__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on compromising the scripts that OSSEC uses to automatically respond to certain events.

## Attack Tree Path: [5.1.1. Gain Unauthorized Access to Response Script Files](./attack_tree_paths/5_1_1__gain_unauthorized_access_to_response_script_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in file permissions or the management of response scripts to gain write access.

**Critical Node: Execute Arbitrary Commands on Affected Hosts [CRITICAL_NODE]**

**Impact:** By modifying response scripts, attackers can cause OSSEC to execute arbitrary commands on monitored hosts when specific alerts are triggered. This can lead to widespread compromise, as the attacker can leverage OSSEC's own response mechanisms to carry out malicious actions.
