## High and Critical Git Specific Threats (Directly Involving git/git)

This table lists high and critical threats that directly involve the `git/git` project itself.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Git Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Exploiting Git Attributes for Malicious Filters/Converters** | An attacker with write access modifies `.gitattributes` to define malicious filters or converters (e.g., `clean`, `smudge`). When Git processes files based on these attributes (e.g., during checkout, staging), the attacker's malicious code is executed. | **High:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine or the server, depending on where the filtering/conversion occurs. | **Git Attributes Parsing, Filter/Converter Execution Mechanism** | **High** | - **Code Review for `.gitattributes`:**  Review changes to `.gitattributes` carefully, especially filter and converter definitions. <br> - **Restrict `.gitattributes` Modification:** Limit who can modify the `.gitattributes` file. <br> - **Avoid Complex Filters/Converters:**  Minimize the use of custom filters and converters if possible. If necessary, ensure they are thoroughly vetted and understand their execution context. <br> - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Git operations with the minimum necessary privileges. |
| **Denial of Service via Large Repository or Objects** | An attacker pushes extremely large files or a large number of objects to the repository, potentially overwhelming the Git server or client during clone, fetch, or other operations. | **Medium:** Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the availability of the Git repository and potentially impacting development workflows. | **Object Database, Transfer Protocols (HTTP/SSH), Indexing** | **Medium** | - **Repository Size Limits:** Implement limits on repository size and individual file sizes (e.g., using Git LFS for large binaries). <br> - **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for Git operations on the server to prevent abuse. <br> - **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor Git server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) for unusual activity. <br> - **Optimize Repository Structure:** Avoid unnecessary large files or excessive history. |
| **Exploiting Git's Handling of Filenames with Special Characters** | In certain edge cases, Git's handling of filenames with special characters (e.g., control characters, whitespace, Unicode exploits) might lead to unexpected behavior, security vulnerabilities in Git itself, or bypasses of security checks in tools processing Git repositories. This could lead to command injection or other issues. | **High:** Potential for command injection vulnerabilities within Git itself or in tools interacting with Git repositories, leading to RCE or other security breaches. | **Filename Handling within Core Git Commands (e.g., `checkout`, `add`, `ls-files`), Index** | **High** | - **Strict Filename Conventions:** Enforce strict filename conventions to avoid the use of special characters. <br> - **Sanitize Filenames:** Sanitize filenames when processing data from Git repositories in other applications or scripts. <br> - **Keep Git Updated:** Ensure the Git version is up-to-date to benefit from bug fixes related to filename handling and security vulnerabilities. |
| **Vulnerabilities in Git Transfer Protocols (HTTP/SSH)** |  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Git transfer protocols (HTTP or SSH) used for cloning, fetching, and pushing. This could involve man-in-the-middle attacks, authentication bypasses, or other protocol-level exploits. | **Critical:** Potential for unauthorized access to the repository, data breaches, or remote code execution if the Git client or server has vulnerabilities in its HTTP/SSH handling. | **`http-backend`, `git-upload-pack`, `git-receive-pack`, SSH client/server integration** | **Critical** | - **Use Secure Protocols:** Prefer SSH over HTTP/HTTPS where possible. <br> - **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for Git access (e.g., SSH keys, multi-factor authentication). <br> - **Keep Git Updated:** Ensure both the Git client and server are running the latest versions with security patches. <br> - **Secure Network Configuration:** Implement proper network security measures to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. <br> - **Verify Server Identity:** When using HTTPS, ensure proper certificate validation to prevent connecting to malicious servers. |
| **Object Database Corruption/Exploitation** |  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Git stores and retrieves objects in its database. This could potentially lead to data corruption, denial of service, or even code execution if vulnerabilities in object parsing or handling exist. | **High:** Data corruption within the repository, potential denial of service, and in extreme cases, possibility of code execution within the Git process. | **Object Database (packfiles, loose objects), Object Parsing and Handling** | **High** | - **Keep Git Updated:** Ensure the Git version is up-to-date to benefit from bug fixes related to object database handling. <br> - **Regular Repository Maintenance:** Run `git fsck` periodically to check for repository inconsistencies and corruption. <br> - **Secure Disk Storage:** Ensure the disk where the Git repository is stored is secure and protected from unauthorized access or corruption. |

**Note:** This list focuses on threats directly related to the `git/git` project. Threats arising from how applications *use* Git (e.g., Git command injection in a web application) are excluded as per the request.
