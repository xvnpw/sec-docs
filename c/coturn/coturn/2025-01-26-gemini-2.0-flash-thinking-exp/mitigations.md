# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for coturn/coturn

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strong Authentication (Longterm/OAuth)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strong_authentication__longtermoauth_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strong Authentication (Longterm/OAuth)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Authentication Mechanism in `turnserver.conf`:**  Set `auth-secret-lifetime` to enable `longterm` authentication or configure `oauth` related settings like `oauth-client-id`, `oauth-client-secret`, `oauth-token-endpoint`, `oauth-authorization-endpoint` in your `turnserver.conf`.
    2.  **Configure `longterm` Credentials (if chosen):**
        *   Use `lt-cred-mech` to enable `longterm` credentials.
        *   Configure `userdb` and `realm` settings in `turnserver.conf` to define where and how `longterm` usernames and passwords are stored and managed (e.g., using a database or file).
        *   Ensure strong, randomly generated usernames and passwords are used when adding users to the `longterm` credential store.
    3.  **Configure `oauth` Integration (if chosen):**
        *   Provide valid `oauth-client-id`, `oauth-client-secret`, `oauth-token-endpoint`, and `oauth-authorization-endpoint` values in `turnserver.conf` that correspond to your OAuth 2.0 provider.
        *   Ensure the OAuth 2.0 provider is correctly configured to authorize access to the coturn server.
    4.  **Disable `static` Authentication in `turnserver.conf`:** Remove or comment out `static-auth-secret` and `user` lines in `turnserver.conf` to disable less secure `static` authentication.
    5.  **Credential Rotation Policy (for `longterm`):**  Establish a process to regularly rotate `longterm` passwords by updating the user credentials in the configured `userdb`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing and utilizing the TURN server.
    *   **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of attackers gaining access through compromised or weak credentials, especially compared to `static` authentication.
*   **Impact:** High risk reduction for unauthorized access and credential-based attacks through coturn configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. OAuth 2.0 authentication is configured in `turnserver.conf` for the main application. `static` authentication is still enabled in development configurations.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  `static` authentication needs to be completely disabled in production `turnserver.conf`. `longterm` authentication is not yet configured as a fallback option in `turnserver.conf`.  Automated credential rotation for `longterm` is not implemented in coturn configuration management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Authorization (ACLs/Scope Limiting)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_authorization__aclsscope_limiting_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Robust Authorization (ACLs/Scope Limiting)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define ACL Rules in `turnserver.conf`:** Use `acl` directives in `turnserver.conf` to define access control rules based on various criteria.
    2.  **Configure ACL Authentication Method:** Set `acl-auth-method` in `turnserver.conf` to specify how ACLs are applied, such as `turn-rest-api` or `turn-admin-rest-api`, depending on your application's integration method.
    3.  **Implement Granular ACL Rules:** Create specific ACL rules to allow or deny actions (e.g., `allocate`, `create permission`) based on username, source IP (using `peer-address`), or other relevant attributes configurable within coturn ACLs.
    4.  **Configure Scope Limiting in `turnserver.conf` (if applicable):** Utilize coturn configuration options like `relay-ip-range` in `turnserver.conf` to restrict the IP address range for relaying traffic. Explore custom plugins for more advanced scope limitations if needed.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update ACLs in `turnserver.conf`:** Establish a process to periodically review and update ACL rules defined in `turnserver.conf` to maintain alignment with security policies.
    6.  **Enable ACL Logging:** Ensure logging is enabled in `turnserver.conf` to capture ACL decisions and access attempts for auditing purposes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Resource Usage (Medium Severity):** Prevents authorized but potentially malicious users from misusing the TURN server beyond their intended access.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Low to Medium Severity):**  Limits the potential for attackers with compromised accounts to gain broader access within the TURN server's capabilities.
*   **Impact:** Medium risk reduction for unauthorized resource usage and lateral movement through coturn's authorization features.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic ACLs are configured in `turnserver.conf` to restrict access based on authenticated users. More granular role-based ACLs and scope limiting are not yet implemented in `turnserver.conf`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implementation of role-based ACLs in `turnserver.conf` integrated with application user roles. Scope limiting beyond `relay-ip-range` is not configured in `turnserver.conf`. Regular ACL review process for `turnserver.conf` is not formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting (Allocation/Bandwidth/Session)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting__allocationbandwidthsession_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting (Allocation/Bandwidth/Session)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Allocation Rate Limiting in `turnserver.conf`:** Use `allocation-limit` and `allocation-burst` settings in `turnserver.conf` to control the rate of allocation requests.
    2.  **Configure Bandwidth Rate Limiting in `turnserver.conf`:** Utilize `max-bps` (global bandwidth limit) and `session-max-bps` (per-session bandwidth limit) settings in `turnserver.conf`.
    3.  **Configure Session Duration Limits in `turnserver.conf`:** Set `session-timeout` in `turnserver.conf` to define the maximum session duration.
    4.  **Monitor Rate Limiting Effectiveness via Coturn Metrics:** Monitor coturn's exposed metrics (e.g., via Prometheus integration if configured) to assess the impact of rate limiting and adjust `turnserver.conf` parameters as needed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Prevents overwhelming the TURN server with excessive requests or bandwidth usage.
    *   **Abuse of Service (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the potential for users to misuse the TURN server by consuming excessive resources.
*   **Impact:** High risk reduction for resource exhaustion and service abuse through coturn's built-in rate limiting features.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic `max-bps` is configured in `turnserver.conf`. Allocation rate limiting and session duration limits are not yet configured in `turnserver.conf`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implementation of `allocation-limit`, `allocation-burst`, and `session-timeout` in `turnserver.conf`. Per-session bandwidth limiting (`session-max-bps`) is not yet configured in `turnserver.conf`. Dynamic rate limiting based on coturn server load (if feasible within coturn configuration) is not explored.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Resource Usage and Logging (Coturn Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_resource_usage_and_logging__coturn_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Usage Monitoring and Logging (Coturn Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Detailed Logging in `turnserver.conf`:** Configure `log-file` to specify the log file path and `log-level` to set the desired logging verbosity in `turnserver.conf`. Use higher log levels (e.g., 4 or 5) for more detailed debugging and security-related information.
    2.  **Enable JSON Logging (Optional):** Consider using `log-json` in `turnserver.conf` to enable structured JSON logging for easier parsing and analysis by log management systems.
    3.  **Enable Prometheus Metrics (Optional):** Configure `prometheus-listening-port` in `turnserver.conf` to enable coturn's Prometheus metrics endpoint, allowing for monitoring of coturn server performance and resource usage.
    4.  **Regular Log Review and Analysis:** Establish a process to regularly review coturn logs generated as per `turnserver.conf` configuration for suspicious patterns, errors, or security events.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unidentified Security Incidents (Medium to High Severity):**  Improves detection of security breaches and attacks by providing log data for analysis.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):**  Enables identification of performance issues through log analysis and metrics monitoring.
    *   **Service Abuse (Medium Severity):**  Helps identify and track service abuse by analyzing log data for unusual activity patterns.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High risk reduction for unidentified security incidents and performance degradation through coturn's logging and metrics capabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic logging to a file is enabled via `turnserver.conf`. JSON logging and Prometheus metrics are not yet configured in `turnserver.conf`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enabling JSON logging (`log-json`) in `turnserver.conf`. Configuring Prometheus metrics (`prometheus-listening-port`) in `turnserver.conf`. Automated log analysis based on coturn logs is not implemented.
