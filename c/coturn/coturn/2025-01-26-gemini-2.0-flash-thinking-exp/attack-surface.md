# Attack Surface Analysis for coturn/coturn

## Attack Surface: [1. STUN/TURN Protocol Implementation Flaws](./attack_surfaces/1__stunturn_protocol_implementation_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within coturn's code that implements the STUN and TURN protocols. These flaws can be exploited by sending specially crafted network packets to the coturn server.
*   **Coturn Contribution:** Coturn's primary function is to implement STUN/TURN. Bugs in this implementation are direct vulnerabilities within coturn itself.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in coturn's STUN message parsing routine. An attacker sends a malformed STUN packet that triggers the overflow, leading to remote code execution on the coturn server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Server Compromise, Information Disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Coturn:**  Apply security patches and updates promptly by upgrading to the latest stable version of coturn. This is the most critical mitigation.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor vulnerability databases for coturn and related protocol vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Audits (Development):** For coturn developers and maintainers, conduct regular code audits and security reviews of the coturn codebase, especially focusing on protocol parsing and handling logic.
    *   **Fuzzing and Security Testing (Development):** Employ fuzzing techniques and penetration testing specifically targeting coturn's STUN/TURN protocol implementation to proactively identify vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [2. Weak Authentication Mechanisms](./attack_surfaces/2__weak_authentication_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities stemming from weak or improperly configured authentication methods used by coturn to secure access to TURN resources. This primarily concerns shared secret based authentication in coturn.
*   **Coturn Contribution:** Coturn's built-in authentication mechanisms, particularly the shared secret method, are directly part of its security architecture. Weaknesses in these mechanisms are coturn-specific.
*   **Example:** A coturn server is configured with easily guessable shared secrets or uses a default shared secret. An attacker can brute-force or guess the secret, gaining unauthorized access to relay traffic through the TURN server.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to TURN resources, abuse of the server for relaying malicious traffic, potential data interception or manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Shared Secrets:** Generate cryptographically strong, unique, and sufficiently long shared secrets for each user or application utilizing TURN. Avoid using default or predictable secrets.
    *   **Secure Secret Generation and Management:** Implement secure processes for generating, storing, and distributing shared secrets. Avoid storing secrets in plain text in configuration files or code.
    *   **Consider Alternative Authentication (If Applicable):** If feasible and supported by your application, explore more robust authentication methods beyond shared secrets that coturn might offer or integrate with, such as token-based authentication or integration with external identity providers.
    *   **Secret Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular rotation of shared secrets to limit the impact of potential secret compromise.

## Attack Surface: [3. Insecure Default Configuration Settings](./attack_surfaces/3__insecure_default_configuration_settings.md)

*   **Description:**  Coturn's default configuration, if not properly reviewed and hardened, can introduce security vulnerabilities due to overly permissive or insecure default settings.
*   **Coturn Contribution:** Coturn's default configuration files and initial settings directly determine the initial security posture of a deployment. Insecure defaults are a direct coturn-related risk.
*   **Example:** A coturn server is deployed using the default configuration without changing default administrative credentials (if any are enabled in default admin interfaces) or disabling unnecessary features. An attacker exploits default credentials or permissive settings to gain unauthorized access or control.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, configuration tampering, server compromise, information disclosure, potential for further exploitation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Configuration Review and Hardening:**  Carefully review the default coturn configuration file and settings. Follow security hardening guides and best practices specifically for coturn.
    *   **Change Default Credentials:** Immediately change any default usernames, passwords, or administrative credentials if they exist in the default configuration.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Features and Services:** Disable any coturn features, modules, or services that are not strictly required for the intended use case to minimize the attack surface.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege Configuration:** Configure coturn with the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions and access rights required for its intended operation.

## Attack Surface: [4. Protocol-Specific Denial of Service Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/4__protocol-specific_denial_of_service_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in coturn's handling of STUN/TURN protocols that can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) specifically by sending crafted protocol messages. This is distinct from general network flooding and focuses on exploiting coturn's protocol processing.
*   **Coturn Contribution:** Coturn's core function is protocol processing. Vulnerabilities in how it handles STUN/TURN messages are direct coturn implementation issues.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in coturn's handling of a specific STUN attribute allows an attacker to send a crafted STUN message that causes excessive CPU consumption or memory exhaustion on the coturn server, leading to a crash or service unavailability.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability for legitimate users, disruption of applications relying on coturn, potential server instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Coturn:**  Keep coturn updated to patch known protocol-specific DoS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Development):** For coturn developers, implement robust input validation and sanitization for all incoming STUN/TURN messages and attributes to prevent exploitation of parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Traffic Shaping:** Implement rate limiting and traffic shaping mechanisms within coturn or at the network level to mitigate the impact of potential DoS attacks, even if protocol-specific vulnerabilities are present.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement real-time monitoring of coturn server resources (CPU, memory, network) and set up alerts to detect unusual resource consumption patterns that might indicate a DoS attack.
