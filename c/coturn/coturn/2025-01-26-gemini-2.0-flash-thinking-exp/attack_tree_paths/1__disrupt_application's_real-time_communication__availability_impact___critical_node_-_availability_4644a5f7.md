### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Disrupt Application's Real-time Communication (Availability Impact)

This attack path focuses on disrupting the application's real-time communication, which is a critical functionality for many applications utilizing coturn.  The core impact is on **Availability**.  Let's delve into potential attack vectors:

#### 4.1. Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks

* **Description:** Overwhelm the coturn server with a flood of malicious requests, legitimate-looking requests, or by exploiting resource-intensive operations. This exhausts server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, network connections) and prevents it from processing legitimate user traffic, effectively disrupting real-time communication.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **UDP Flood:** Sending a large volume of UDP packets to the coturn server. Coturn, being a UDP-based server for media relay, is particularly susceptible to UDP floods.
    * **SYN Flood:**  Exploiting the TCP handshake process by sending a flood of SYN packets without completing the handshake. This can exhaust server connection resources. (Less relevant if TURN is primarily UDP, but still possible if TCP is used for control or TURN/TLS).
    * **HTTP Flood (if applicable):** If coturn exposes an HTTP management interface or if the application interacts with coturn via HTTP for certain functionalities, HTTP floods can be used.
    * **Application-Layer DoS:** Sending legitimate but resource-intensive requests to coturn, such as initiating a large number of TURN sessions, requesting excessive bandwidth allocation, or exploiting inefficient processing of certain request types.
    * **Amplification Attacks:** Exploiting publicly accessible coturn servers to amplify attack traffic towards a target. (e.g., sending small requests to coturn that trigger large responses directed at the victim).

* **Execution:**
    * **Tools:**  `hping3`, `nmap`, `flood tools`, botnets (for DDoS), custom scripts.
    * **Methods:** Direct attacks from a single source (DoS) or multiple distributed sources (DDoS). Exploiting open resolvers or reflectors for amplification.

* **Prerequisites:**
    * **Publicly Accessible Coturn Server:** The coturn server must be reachable from the internet or the attacker's network.
    * **Sufficient Bandwidth (for attacker):** The attacker needs enough bandwidth to generate a significant volume of traffic.
    * **Knowledge of Target IP Address and Ports:** The attacker needs to know the IP address and ports of the coturn server.
