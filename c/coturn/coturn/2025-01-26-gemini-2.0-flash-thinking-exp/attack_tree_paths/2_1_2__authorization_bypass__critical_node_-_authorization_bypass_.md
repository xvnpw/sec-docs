### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.2 Authorization Bypass

#### 4.1. Detailed Description

**Authorization Bypass** in coturn refers to the successful circumvention of the server's intended access control mechanisms. This means an attacker can perform actions or access resources that they are not explicitly permitted to according to coturn's configured authorization policies.  This could range from gaining unauthorized access to media streams relayed by the server to potentially manipulating server configurations or gaining administrative privileges (in severe cases).

The core issue is that the attacker manages to bypass the checks that are supposed to verify their identity and permissions before granting access to coturn's functionalities. This bypass could occur at various stages of the authorization process, such as:

* **Authentication Bypass:**  Completely skipping the authentication step or successfully authenticating as a legitimate user without possessing valid credentials.
* **Authorization Logic Flaws:** Exploiting weaknesses in the logic that determines user permissions after successful authentication. This could involve manipulating parameters, exploiting race conditions, or leveraging misconfigurations.
* **ACL Bypass:**  Circumventing or manipulating Access Control Lists (ACLs) to gain access beyond defined permissions.
* **Session Hijacking/Manipulation:**  Stealing or manipulating valid user sessions to impersonate authorized users.
* **Parameter Tampering:**  Modifying request parameters to bypass authorization checks, such as altering user IDs, resource identifiers, or permission levels.

#### 4.2. Potential Attack Vectors

Several potential attack vectors could lead to authorization bypass in coturn. These can be categorized based on the area of weakness exploited:

**4.2.1. Weak Authentication Mechanisms:**

* **Default Credentials:** If coturn is deployed with default or easily guessable credentials for administrative or user accounts, attackers could gain initial access.
* **Brute-Force Attacks:**  If coturn's authentication mechanism is vulnerable to brute-force attacks (e.g., weak password policies, lack of account lockout), attackers could guess valid credentials.
* **Credential Stuffing:**  Using compromised credentials obtained from other breaches to attempt login to coturn.
* **Insecure Credential Storage:** If coturn stores credentials insecurely (e.g., in plaintext or weakly hashed), attackers gaining access to the server could retrieve them.

**4.2.2. Flaws in Authorization Logic:**

* **Parameter Tampering:**  Manipulating request parameters (e.g., username, realm, permissions) in TURN/STUN requests to bypass authorization checks. For example, altering a username to impersonate another user or modifying requested permissions.
* **Inconsistent Authorization Checks:**  Inconsistencies in authorization checks across different coturn functionalities or APIs. An attacker might find a path where authorization is weaker or missing.
* **Race Conditions:** Exploiting race conditions in the authorization process to gain access before checks are fully enforced.
* **ACL Bypass/Manipulation:**
    * **ACL Misconfiguration:**  Exploiting poorly configured ACLs that grant overly broad permissions or have logical errors.
    * **ACL Injection:**  Injecting malicious entries into ACLs if they are dynamically generated based on user input without proper sanitization.
    * **ACL Bypass through Path Traversal:**  If ACLs are path-based, exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities to access resources outside the intended scope.
* **Session Management Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Session Fixation:**  Forcing a user to use a known session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the session later.
    * **Session Hijacking:**  Stealing valid session IDs through network sniffing, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other means.
    * **Session Prediction:**  If session IDs are predictable, attackers could generate valid session IDs to impersonate users.
    * **Insecure Session Storage:**  Storing session information insecurely, allowing attackers to retrieve and reuse valid sessions.
* **API Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Missing Authorization Checks in APIs:**  If coturn exposes APIs for management or other functionalities, these APIs might lack proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access.
    * **API Parameter Exploitation:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in API parameter handling to bypass authorization.

**4.2.3. Misconfigurations:**

* **Permissive Default Configurations:**  Default configurations that are overly permissive in terms of authorization, granting access to a wider range of users or resources than intended.
* **Disabled or Weak Authorization Features:**  Disabling or weakening essential authorization features for convenience or due to misconfiguration.
* **Incorrect ACL Definitions:**  Defining ACLs that do not accurately reflect the intended access control policies, leading to unintended access.

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment (Detailed)

A successful authorization bypass in coturn can have significant security impacts, including:

* **Unauthorized Access to Media Streams:**  Attackers could gain access to real-time audio and video streams being relayed by the coturn server. This could lead to:
    * **Eavesdropping on communications:**  Confidential conversations and video conferences could be intercepted.
    * **Data theft:**  Sensitive information transmitted via media streams could be stolen.
    * **Privacy violations:**  User privacy is severely compromised.
* **Unauthorized Resource Access:**  Beyond media streams, attackers could gain access to other resources managed by coturn, such as:
    * **Server configuration files:**  Potentially revealing sensitive information or allowing modification of server settings.
    * **User data:**  Accessing user accounts, profiles, or other stored data.
    * **Internal network resources:**  If coturn is poorly segmented, a bypass could provide a foothold for lateral movement within the network.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  In some scenarios, authorization bypass could lead to privilege escalation. An attacker might gain administrative privileges, allowing them to:
    * **Modify server configurations:**  Completely control coturn's behavior.
    * **Create or delete user accounts:**  Gain persistent access or disrupt service.
    * **Install malware or backdoors:**  Compromise the server and potentially the entire network.
* **Reputation Damage:**  A security breach due to authorization bypass can severely damage the reputation of the organization using coturn, leading to loss of trust and customer attrition.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the data handled by coturn and the applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), an authorization bypass could lead to compliance violations and legal penalties.
* **Service Disruption:**  While not the primary impact of *bypass*, attackers with unauthorized access could potentially disrupt coturn services, leading to denial of service for legitimate users.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of authorization bypass in coturn, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Strong Authentication Mechanisms:**
    * **Enforce strong password policies:**  Require complex passwords and regular password changes.
    * **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):**  Add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
    * **Avoid default credentials:**  Change all default credentials immediately upon deployment.
    * **Consider certificate-based authentication:**  For enhanced security, especially for server-to-server communication.
* **Robust Authorization Logic:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required for their roles.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs, especially those related to authorization parameters, to prevent parameter tampering and injection attacks.
    * **Consistent Authorization Checks:**  Ensure consistent and comprehensive authorization checks across all coturn functionalities and APIs.
