# Threat Model Analysis for coturn/coturn

## Threat: [Weak Default Credentials](./threats/weak_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** Attacker attempts to log in to coturn's administrative interface or user accounts using default or easily guessable credentials. Successful login grants unauthorized access.
**Impact:**  Complete compromise of coturn server, unauthorized access to relay services, potential data interception, denial of service, and ability to reconfigure coturn for malicious purposes.
**Affected Component:** Authentication Module, Configuration Files
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Change default usernames and passwords immediately upon deployment.
*   Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, rotation).
*   Disable or remove default accounts if not needed.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication for administrative access if possible.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerability](./threats/authentication_bypass_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** Attacker exploits a vulnerability in coturn's authentication logic to bypass authentication checks and gain unauthorized access to TURN relay services without valid credentials.
**Impact:** Unauthorized relay usage, potential data interception, denial of service, and circumvention of access controls.
**Affected Component:** Authentication Module, TURN Server Core
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep coturn software updated to the latest version with security patches.
*   Regularly review and audit coturn's authentication configuration.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
*   Conduct penetration testing to identify and remediate authentication vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Relay Usage (Open Relay)](./threats/unauthorized_relay_usage__open_relay_.md)

**Description:** Attacker exploits misconfiguration or vulnerabilities to use coturn as an open relay, forwarding their own malicious traffic through it without proper authorization. This could be for DDoS amplification, bypassing network restrictions, or other malicious activities.
**Impact:** Resource exhaustion on coturn server, potential legal liability for relayed malicious traffic, performance degradation for legitimate users, and reputational damage.
**Affected Component:** TURN Server Core, Authorization Module
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for TURN usage.
*   Configure coturn to only allow relaying for authorized users and sessions.
*   Rate limit relay requests to prevent abuse.
*   Monitor coturn usage for suspicious traffic patterns.
*   Regularly review and audit coturn configuration for open relay vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Data Interception (Eavesdropping)](./threats/data_interception__eavesdropping_.md)

**Description:** Attacker intercepts network traffic between clients and coturn or between coturn and other servers. If encryption is weak or absent, they can eavesdrop on media streams and other relayed data.
**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive communication content (audio, video, data), potential privacy violations.
**Affected Component:** TURN Server Core, Network Communication Modules
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong encryption for all communication channels (TLS/DTLS).
*   Use secure cipher suites and protocols.
*   Regularly review and update encryption configurations.
*   Consider end-to-end encryption for media streams beyond TURN relay if required.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Relay Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_relay_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** Attacker floods coturn with a large number of relay requests or sends excessively large media streams, consuming server resources (bandwidth, CPU, memory) and causing denial of service for legitimate users.
**Impact:** Service unavailability for legitimate users, disruption of real-time communication, potential financial losses due to service downtime.
**Affected Component:** TURN Server Core, Resource Management Modules
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting and traffic shaping to control incoming requests and outgoing traffic.
*   Configure resource limits (e.g., maximum bandwidth per session, maximum number of sessions).
*   Deploy coturn on infrastructure with sufficient resources to handle expected load and potential attacks.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting for resource utilization to detect DoS attacks early.
*   Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or load balancer to distribute traffic and mitigate DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Security Settings](./threats/misconfiguration_of_security_settings.md)

**Description:** Administrator incorrectly configures coturn, disabling security features, using weak encryption, or allowing insecure protocols, leading to various vulnerabilities.
**Impact:** Increased attack surface, exposure to various threats, potential compromise of coturn server and relayed data.
**Affected Component:** Configuration Files, All Modules
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow security best practices and coturn documentation for configuration.
*   Use configuration management tools to ensure consistent and secure configurations.
*   Regularly review and audit coturn configuration for security weaknesses.
*   Implement automated configuration checks and validation.
*   Use secure configuration templates and baseline configurations.

## Threat: [Software Vulnerabilities (Buffer Overflow, etc.)](./threats/software_vulnerabilities__buffer_overflow__etc__.md)

**Description:** Attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in coturn software (e.g., buffer overflows, memory corruption bugs, protocol implementation flaws) to cause crashes, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution.
**Impact:** Server compromise, denial of service, data breach, potential remote code execution and complete system takeover.
**Affected Component:** All Modules, Core Code
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep coturn software updated to the latest version with security patches.
*   Subscribe to security mailing lists and vulnerability databases to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
*   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block exploit attempts.
*   Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scanning of coturn infrastructure.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by coturn (e.g., OpenSSL, libevent).
**Impact:** Similar to software vulnerabilities in coturn itself, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.
**Affected Component:** Dependencies (OpenSSL, libevent, etc.)
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep coturn dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.
*   Monitor security advisories for coturn dependencies.
*   Consider using static analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities in dependencies.
