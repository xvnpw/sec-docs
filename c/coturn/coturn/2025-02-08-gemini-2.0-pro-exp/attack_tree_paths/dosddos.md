# Deep Analysis of DoS/DDoS Attack Path for coturn TURN/STUN Server

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors related to Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks targeting a coturn-based TURN/STUN server.  This understanding will inform the development of robust mitigation strategies and security best practices.  We aim to identify specific weaknesses in the coturn configuration and deployment that could be exploited to disrupt service availability.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `DoS/DDoS` attack path within a broader attack tree analysis of a coturn deployment.  The scope includes:

*   **coturn-specific vulnerabilities:**  Examining configuration options, known issues, and potential weaknesses within the coturn software itself that could be leveraged for DoS/DDoS attacks.
*   **Network-level attacks:**  Analyzing how network-layer attacks (e.g., UDP flood, SYN flood) can impact the coturn server.
*   **Application-level attacks:**  Investigating how attacks targeting the STUN/TURN protocols themselves (e.g., malformed requests, resource exhaustion) can lead to denial of service.
*   **Resource exhaustion:**  Identifying how attackers can exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, file descriptors) to render the service unavailable.
*   **Dependencies:** Considering the impact of vulnerabilities in underlying operating systems, libraries, and network infrastructure.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** How weak or absent authentication mechanisms can exacerbate DoS/DDoS attacks.

This analysis *excludes* attacks that are not directly related to DoS/DDoS, such as credential theft, data breaches, or code injection vulnerabilities (unless they directly contribute to a DoS/DDoS attack).

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examining the coturn source code (from the provided GitHub repository) for potential vulnerabilities related to resource handling, request processing, and error handling.
*   **Configuration Analysis:**  Reviewing the default and recommended coturn configuration files (`turnserver.conf`) to identify potentially risky settings.
*   **Literature Review:**  Researching known vulnerabilities and attack techniques against TURN/STUN servers in general, and coturn specifically.  This includes reviewing CVE databases, security advisories, and academic papers.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Developing threat models to systematically identify potential attack vectors and their impact.
*   **Testing (Conceptual):**  Describing potential testing scenarios (e.g., using traffic generators, fuzzing tools) to validate vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.  *Note: Actual penetration testing is outside the scope of this document but is strongly recommended.*
*   **Best Practices Review:** Comparing the coturn configuration and deployment against industry best practices for securing network services and mitigating DoS/DDoS attacks.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the DoS/DDoS Attack Path

This section breaks down the DoS/DDoS attack path into specific attack vectors and analyzes each one.

### 2.1. Network-Level Attacks

*   **2.1.1. UDP Flood:**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers send a large volume of UDP packets to the coturn server's listening ports (typically 3478 and 5349).  This overwhelms the server's network interface and processing capacity, preventing legitimate clients from connecting.  coturn, being primarily UDP-based for media relay, is particularly vulnerable.
    *   **coturn-Specific Considerations:**  coturn's performance under high UDP load depends on the underlying operating system's network stack and the server's hardware resources.  The `--max-bps` option can limit bandwidth, but a sufficiently large flood can still saturate the network interface.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting at the network firewall (e.g., using `iptables`, `nftables`, or a dedicated DDoS mitigation appliance) to restrict the number of UDP packets per second from a single source IP address.
        *   **Traffic Shaping:**  Prioritize legitimate traffic using Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms.
        *   **Anycast:**  Distribute the TURN/STUN service across multiple geographically diverse servers using Anycast routing.  This makes it harder for attackers to target a single point of failure.
        *   **UDP Connection Tracking (Careful Consideration):** While connection tracking can help, it can also be a target for exhaustion.  Careful tuning is required.
        *   **Infrastructure Scaling:** Ensure sufficient network bandwidth and server capacity to handle expected peak loads and absorb some level of attack traffic.

*   **2.1.2. SYN Flood (if TCP is used):**
    *   **Description:**  If coturn is configured to use TCP (e.g., for TURN over TCP), attackers can send a flood of SYN packets without completing the three-way handshake.  This consumes server resources allocated for half-open connections, eventually leading to exhaustion.
    *   **coturn-Specific Considerations:**  coturn's TCP handling is less critical than its UDP handling, but still important if TCP is enabled.  The `--tcp-relay` option controls TCP relay functionality.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **SYN Cookies:**  Enable SYN cookies in the operating system's TCP stack.  This allows the server to handle SYN floods without allocating resources for each half-open connection.
        *   **Connection Limits:**  Limit the number of concurrent TCP connections from a single IP address.
        *   **Firewall Configuration:**  Configure the firewall to drop invalid TCP packets and enforce connection limits.

*   **2.1.3. ICMP Flood (Ping Flood):**
    *   **Description:** Attackers send a large number of ICMP Echo Request (ping) packets to the server. While less effective than UDP or SYN floods, a sufficiently large ICMP flood can still consume network bandwidth and processing resources.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate of ICMP packets allowed by the firewall.
        *   **Disable ICMP (if possible):** If ICMP is not required for legitimate network operations, consider disabling it entirely.  *Be cautious, as this can impact network diagnostics.*

*   **2.1.4. Amplification Attacks (NTP, DNS, etc.):**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit misconfigured or vulnerable third-party servers (e.g., NTP servers, DNS servers) to amplify their attack traffic.  They send small requests to these servers, which then respond with much larger responses directed at the coturn server's IP address.
    *   **coturn-Specific Considerations:** coturn itself is not directly involved in the amplification, but it is the target.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Ingress Filtering:**  Configure the network firewall to block traffic from known amplification sources.
        *   **DDoS Mitigation Services:**  Utilize a cloud-based DDoS mitigation service that can detect and filter amplification attacks.
        *   **Ensure *your* services are not amplifiers:** Make absolutely sure your own infrastructure (including coturn) is not configured in a way that allows it to be used in an amplification attack.

### 2.2. Application-Level Attacks

*   **2.2.1. Malformed STUN/TURN Requests:**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers send specially crafted STUN or TURN requests that are malformed or violate the protocol specifications.  This can trigger bugs or vulnerabilities in coturn's request parsing logic, leading to crashes or resource exhaustion.
    *   **coturn-Specific Considerations:**  Review the coturn source code for robust input validation and error handling in the STUN/TURN message parsing routines.  Look for potential buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory corruption vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Implement strict input validation to ensure that all STUN/TURN requests conform to the protocol specifications.
        *   **Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing tools to test coturn's ability to handle malformed requests.
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep coturn up to date with the latest security patches.

*   **2.2.2. Resource Exhaustion (Allocations):**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers send a large number of legitimate-looking TURN allocation requests, consuming server resources (memory, file descriptors, relay ports) until the server can no longer handle new requests.
    *   **coturn-Specific Considerations:**
        *   `--max-allocations`:  Limits the total number of allocations.
        *   `--max-users`: Limits the number of users.
        *   `--max-port` and `--min-port`: Defines the range of relay ports.  A small range can be easily exhausted.
        *   `--lt-cred-mech`:  Using long-term credentials can make it easier for attackers to create many allocations.  Consider using short-term credentials.
        *   `--stale-nonce`:  Properly handling stale nonces is crucial to prevent replay attacks that could exhaust resources.
        *   `--realm`:  The realm value should be carefully chosen and not easily guessable.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Resource Limits:**  Configure appropriate limits on the number of allocations, users, and relay ports.
        *   **Authentication:**  Require strong authentication for all TURN allocation requests.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Per User/IP):**  Limit the rate at which users or IP addresses can create new allocations.
        *   **Monitoring:**  Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, file descriptors, relay ports) and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        *   **Short-Term Credentials:**  Prefer short-term credentials over long-term credentials to limit the impact of compromised credentials.

*   **2.2.3. Session Hijacking (related to DoS):**
    *   **Description:** While not strictly a DoS attack, if an attacker can hijack existing TURN sessions, they can consume allocated resources and potentially disrupt service for legitimate users.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Use strong, unique credentials.
        *   **TLS:** Use TLS for secure communication between the client and the TURN server.
        *   **IP Address Restrictions:** If possible, restrict TURN allocations to specific client IP addresses.

*   2.2.4. CPU Exhaustion via Complex Computations
    * **Description:** If TURN server is configured to use some cryptographic operations, attacker can try to force server to perform expensive cryptographic calculations.
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   **Limit Cryptographic Operations:** Carefully evaluate the need for computationally expensive cryptographic operations.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on requests that trigger cryptographic calculations.

### 2.3. Dependency-Related Vulnerabilities

*   **2.3.1. Operating System Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system (e.g., Linux kernel) can be exploited to launch DoS attacks against the coturn server.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep the operating system up to date with the latest security patches.
        *   **Hardening:**  Harden the operating system by disabling unnecessary services and features.

*   **2.3.2. Library Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in libraries used by coturn (e.g., OpenSSL, libevent) can be exploited to launch DoS attacks.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep all libraries up to date with the latest security patches.
        *   **Dependency Management:**  Use a dependency management system to track and update libraries.
