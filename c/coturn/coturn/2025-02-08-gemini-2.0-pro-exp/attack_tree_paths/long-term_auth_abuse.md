Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Long-Term Auth Abuse" attack tree path for a COTURN-based application, presented in Markdown format:

# Deep Analysis: Long-Term Auth Abuse in COTURN

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Long-Term Auth Abuse" attack path against a COTURN-based application.  This includes identifying the specific vulnerabilities, attack vectors, potential impacts, and effective mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the security posture of the application.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack scenario where an attacker abuses long-term credentials to exhaust resources within a COTURN server.  The scope includes:

*   **COTURN Configuration:**  We will consider the default COTURN configuration and common deployment scenarios, focusing on settings related to long-term authentication, resource allocation, and rate limiting.
*   **Credential Management:**  We will examine how long-term credentials are (or should be) managed within the application and how this management impacts the attack's feasibility.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** We will analyze the specific resources that can be exhausted by this attack (e.g., relay allocations, bandwidth, CPU, memory).
*   **Impact on Legitimate Users:** We will assess the consequences of resource exhaustion on legitimate users' ability to use the service.
*   **Detection and Mitigation:** We will explore methods for detecting and mitigating this attack, including both configuration changes and potential code-level modifications.

This analysis *excludes* other attack vectors against COTURN, such as those targeting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system, network infrastructure, or other unrelated software components.  It also excludes attacks that do not involve long-term credential abuse.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the provided attack tree path as a starting point and expand upon it to identify specific attack steps and preconditions.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will examine the COTURN codebase and documentation to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited in this attack scenario.  This includes reviewing relevant configuration options and their default values.
3.  **Impact Assessment:** We will quantify the potential impact of a successful attack, considering both direct resource consumption and the indirect effects on service availability.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:** We will propose concrete mitigation strategies, prioritizing those that are most effective and feasible to implement.  This will include configuration recommendations, code changes (if necessary), and monitoring strategies.
5.  **Documentation:**  The findings and recommendations will be documented in this report, providing a clear and actionable guide for the development team.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path: Long-Term Auth Abuse

### 2.1 Attack Scenario Breakdown

The attack proceeds as follows:

1.  **Credential Acquisition:** The attacker obtains valid long-term credentials for the COTURN server.  This could occur through various means:
    *   **Compromised Credentials:**  Stolen from a legitimate user or database.
    *   **Weak Credentials:**  Guessed or brute-forced due to weak password policies.
    *   **Misconfigured Access Control:**  Credentials unintentionally exposed or granted excessive privileges.
    *   **Social Engineering:**  Tricking a user into revealing their credentials.

2.  **Repeated Authentication and Allocation:** The attacker uses the acquired credentials to repeatedly authenticate with the COTURN server and request relay allocations.  This is done without releasing the allocated resources.  The attacker may use a script or automated tool to perform these actions rapidly.

3.  **Resource Exhaustion:**  Over time, the attacker's repeated allocations consume a significant portion of the COTURN server's resources.  This can include:
    *   **Relay Ports:**  Exhausting the available UDP/TCP ports for relaying traffic.
    *   **Bandwidth:**  Consuming the server's network bandwidth.
    *   **CPU:**  Overloading the server's processor with authentication and allocation requests.
    *   **Memory:**  Consuming memory used to track allocations and client sessions.
    *   **File Descriptors:**  Exhausting the number of open file descriptors (if applicable).

4.  **Denial of Service (DoS):**  As resources become depleted, legitimate users are unable to authenticate or allocate relays, effectively experiencing a denial of service.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis

The core vulnerability lies in the *unrestricted* or *poorly restricted* use of long-term credentials for resource allocation.  Several COTURN configuration options and potential application-level issues contribute to this:

*   **`lt-cred-mech` (Long-Term Credential Mechanism):**  COTURN supports long-term credentials.  If enabled without proper restrictions, it creates the foundation for this attack.
*   **`max-allocate`:** This option, *if not set or set too high*, allows a single user (identified by their long-term credentials) to allocate an excessive number of relays.  The default behavior (if the option is not set) might be unlimited, making the server highly vulnerable.
*   **`total-quota`:** This limits the total bandwidth a user can consume.  However, if set too high or not set, it won't prevent port exhaustion or CPU/memory overload.
*   **`user-quota`:** Similar to `total-quota`, but applies to individual users.  Again, insufficient limits are problematic.
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  COTURN might not have built-in rate limiting for authentication attempts or allocation requests *per credential*.  This allows an attacker to rapidly consume resources.
*   **Absence of Monitoring:**  Without proper monitoring of resource usage *per credential*, the attack can go unnoticed until significant damage is done.
*   **Application-Level Issues:**  The application using COTURN might not implement its own safeguards, such as:
    *   **Short-Lived Tokens:**  The application could issue short-lived tokens based on long-term credentials, limiting the window of abuse.
    *   **Resource Limits per User:**  The application could enforce its own limits on resource usage, independent of COTURN's configuration.
    *   **Session Management:**  The application might not properly manage sessions, allowing an attacker to maintain multiple active allocations simultaneously.

### 2.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful long-term auth abuse attack can be severe:

*   **Service Unavailability:** Legitimate users are unable to use the TURN/STUN service, disrupting real-time communication applications (e.g., video conferencing, VoIP).
*   **Financial Loss:**  If the service is a paid offering, downtime translates directly to lost revenue.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Service disruptions can damage the reputation of the application and its provider.
*   **Resource Costs:**  Even if the service is not directly monetized, the attacker consumes server resources (bandwidth, CPU, memory), leading to increased operational costs.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  A compromised COTURN server could be used as a launching point for other attacks.

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies

A multi-layered approach is necessary to effectively mitigate this attack:

1.  **Prioritize Short-Term Credentials:**
    *   **Strong Recommendation:** Implement a system where the application uses long-term credentials *only* to obtain short-lived, dynamically generated tokens (e.g., using a custom authentication mechanism or a separate authentication server).  These tokens should be used for actual TURN/STUN authentication.  This drastically reduces the attack window.
    *   **Token Expiration:**  Ensure tokens have a short lifespan (e.g., minutes or hours) and are automatically revoked after use or expiration.

2.  **Strict Resource Limits (COTURN Configuration):**
    *   **`max-allocate`:**  Set a *low* and reasonable limit on the number of simultaneous allocations per user.  This is crucial.  The specific value depends on the application's needs, but should be as low as possible.
    *   **`total-quota` and `user-quota`:**  Set appropriate bandwidth quotas to prevent excessive bandwidth consumption.
    *   **`denied-peer-ip` and `allowed-peer-ip`:** While not directly related to credential abuse, these options can help limit the scope of potential attacks by restricting which peers can connect.

3.  **Rate Limiting:**
    *   **COTURN Configuration (if available):**  Check if COTURN has built-in rate limiting options for authentication and allocation requests.  If so, enable and configure them appropriately.
    *   **Application-Level Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting *within the application* that uses COTURN.  This is essential if COTURN lacks built-in rate limiting.  Limit the number of authentication attempts and allocation requests per credential within a given time window.

4.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Resource Usage Monitoring:**  Implement robust monitoring of resource usage (relay allocations, bandwidth, CPU, memory) *per credential*.
    *   **Alerting Thresholds:**  Define thresholds for resource usage that trigger alerts.  These alerts should notify administrators of potential abuse.
    *   **Log Analysis:**  Regularly analyze COTURN logs for suspicious patterns, such as repeated authentication attempts from the same IP address or credential.

5.  **Account Lockout:**
    *   **Failed Authentication Attempts:** Implement an account lockout policy that temporarily disables an account after a certain number of failed authentication attempts.  This mitigates brute-force attacks on credentials.

6.  **Credential Management Best Practices:**
    *   **Strong Passwords:**  Enforce strong password policies for long-term credentials.
    *   **Secure Storage:**  Store credentials securely, using appropriate hashing and salting techniques.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly audit user accounts and permissions to identify and remove inactive or unnecessary accounts.

7.  **Consider `realm` option:**
     * Using different realms can help to isolate users and resources.

### 2.5 Conclusion

The "Long-Term Auth Abuse" attack path poses a significant threat to COTURN-based applications.  By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack and improve the overall security and reliability of the service.  The most crucial steps are prioritizing short-term credentials, implementing strict resource limits, and establishing robust monitoring and alerting.  Regular security reviews and updates are also essential to maintain a strong security posture.
