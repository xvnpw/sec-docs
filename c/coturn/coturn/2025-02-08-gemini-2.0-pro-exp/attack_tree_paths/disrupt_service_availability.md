# Deep Analysis: Disrupt Service Availability Attack on Coturn-based Application

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Disrupt Service Availability" attack path within the broader attack tree for our application leveraging the coturn TURN/STUN server.  We aim to:

*   Identify specific, actionable attack vectors that could lead to service disruption.
*   Assess the likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty of each identified vector.
*   Propose concrete mitigation strategies and security controls to reduce the risk of successful attacks.
*   Prioritize mitigation efforts based on a risk-based approach.
*   Provide clear recommendations for the development team to enhance the application's resilience against denial-of-service (DoS) and related attacks.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on attacks targeting the *availability* of the coturn server and, consequently, the application that depends on it.  We will consider attacks that:

*   Directly target the coturn server itself (e.g., resource exhaustion, vulnerability exploitation).
*   Target the network infrastructure supporting the coturn server (e.g., network-level DDoS).
*   Target the underlying operating system and dependencies of the coturn server.
*   Abuse legitimate coturn functionalities to cause disruption (e.g., excessive allocation requests).

We *will not* cover attacks that primarily target the application's logic *independent* of coturn (e.g., application-level vulnerabilities unrelated to WebRTC communication).  We also won't delve deeply into physical security, although we'll acknowledge its relevance.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of techniques:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will systematically decompose the "Disrupt Service Availability" attack path into more granular sub-paths and individual attack vectors.  This will involve brainstorming potential attack scenarios based on known coturn vulnerabilities, common DoS techniques, and the specific configuration of our deployment.

2.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities in coturn (using CVE databases, security advisories, and the coturn issue tracker) and its dependencies.  We will also consider generic OS-level and network-level vulnerabilities.

3.  **Risk Assessment:** For each identified attack vector, we will assess:
    *   **Likelihood:**  The probability of the attack being attempted and succeeding.
    *   **Impact:** The severity of the consequences if the attack succeeds (e.g., complete outage, degraded performance).
    *   **Effort:** The resources (time, tools, money) required for an attacker to execute the attack.
    *   **Skill Level:** The technical expertise needed by the attacker.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** How challenging it is to detect the attack in progress or after the fact.

4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  For each significant risk, we will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies.  These will include:
    *   **Preventive Controls:** Measures to prevent the attack from succeeding (e.g., rate limiting, firewalls).
    *   **Detective Controls:** Measures to detect the attack in progress (e.g., intrusion detection systems, monitoring).
    *   **Responsive Controls:** Measures to respond to and recover from a successful attack (e.g., failover mechanisms, incident response plans).

5.  **Documentation and Communication:**  The findings and recommendations will be clearly documented and communicated to the development team in a format that facilitates implementation.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the "Disrupt Service Availability" Attack Path

We'll break down the "Disrupt Service Availability" path into several sub-paths, analyzing each in detail:

### 2.1. Resource Exhaustion Attacks

**Description:**  These attacks aim to consume server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, file descriptors, etc.) to the point where coturn can no longer function.

*   **2.1.1.  Allocation Request Flooding:**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker sends a massive number of legitimate-looking allocation requests to the TURN server, consuming server resources and preventing legitimate clients from obtaining allocations.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Relatively easy to automate).
    *   **Impact:** High (Complete service outage).
    *   **Effort:** Low (Requires minimal resources for the attacker).
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic scripting knowledge).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring of allocation request rates).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limiting on allocation requests per IP address, user, or other identifier.  Coturn supports this via configuration (`--max-bps`, `--user-quota`, `--quota`).
        *   **Authentication:**  Require strong authentication for all allocation requests.  This makes it harder for attackers to spoof requests.  Use long-term credentials and consider TLS-SRP for enhanced security.
        *   **Resource Quotas:**  Configure resource quotas per user or IP address to limit the maximum resources a single entity can consume.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement monitoring to track allocation request rates and resource usage.  Set up alerts for anomalous behavior.
        *   **CAPTCHA:** In extreme cases, consider using CAPTCHAs for allocation requests to deter automated attacks (though this impacts user experience).

*   **2.1.2.  Connection Flooding:**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker establishes a large number of connections to the coturn server without completing the allocation process, exhausting connection limits or file descriptors.
    *   **Likelihood:** High.
    *   **Impact:** High (Service outage).
    *   **Effort:** Low.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring of open connections).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Connection Limits:** Configure strict limits on the number of concurrent connections per IP address and globally (`--max-connections`, `--max-users`).
        *   **TCP SYN Cookies:** Ensure TCP SYN cookies are enabled on the server's operating system to mitigate SYN flood attacks.
        *   **Firewall Rules:**  Use firewall rules to block connections from known malicious IP addresses or networks.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor the number of open connections and alert on unusual spikes.

*   **2.1.3.  Bandwidth Exhaustion (Data Flooding):**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker sends large amounts of data to the TURN server, saturating its network bandwidth and preventing legitimate traffic from flowing.  This can be done through legitimate relaying (if allowed) or by exploiting vulnerabilities.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires more attacker resources).
    *   **Impact:** High (Service outage or severe degradation).
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires significant bandwidth on the attacker's side).
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires network traffic monitoring).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Rate Limiting (Bandwidth):**  Use coturn's bandwidth limiting features (`--max-bps`) to restrict the amount of data that can be relayed per user or IP address.
        *   **Traffic Shaping:**  Implement traffic shaping at the network level to prioritize legitimate TURN/STUN traffic.
        *   **DDoS Protection Services:**  Consider using a DDoS protection service (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Shield) to mitigate large-scale bandwidth exhaustion attacks.
        *   **Network Monitoring:**  Monitor network traffic for unusual spikes and patterns.
