# Deep Analysis of UDP Amplification Attack on Coturn

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics, risks, and mitigation strategies associated with UDP amplification attacks targeting a coturn TURN/STUN server.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to harden the application against this specific threat.  This goes beyond simply listing mitigations; we want to understand *why* they work and how to implement them effectively.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the "UDP Amplification" attack path described in the provided attack tree.  It encompasses:

*   **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Identifying the specific configurations and conditions within coturn that make it susceptible to being used as an amplifier.
*   **Exploitation Techniques:**  Detailing how attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact Assessment:**  Quantifying the potential damage caused by a successful attack, considering both direct and indirect consequences.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Providing detailed, practical guidance on implementing the listed mitigations, including configuration examples and best practices.
*   **Detection Techniques:**  Exploring methods for identifying ongoing or attempted amplification attacks.
*   **Testing and Validation:** Recommending methods to test the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.

This analysis *does not* cover other potential attack vectors against coturn (e.g., credential stuffing, DoS attacks targeting TCP connections, etc.).  It is specifically limited to UDP amplification.

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Documentation Review:**  Thorough examination of the official coturn documentation, including configuration options, security recommendations, and known vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Review (Conceptual):**  While we don't have direct access to the application's specific codebase, we will conceptually analyze how coturn's internal mechanisms (as described in its documentation and open-source code) could be abused.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Applying threat modeling principles to understand the attacker's perspective and identify potential attack vectors.
*   **Best Practice Research:**  Consulting industry best practices for securing UDP-based services and mitigating amplification attacks.
*   **Vulnerability Database Research:** Checking for any known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to coturn and UDP amplification.
*   **Scenario Analysis:**  Developing realistic attack scenarios to illustrate the exploitation process and impact.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the UDP Amplification Attack Path

### 2.1 Vulnerability Analysis

Coturn, by its nature, handles UDP traffic.  The core vulnerability lies in the potential for an attacker to craft requests that elicit a disproportionately large response.  Several factors contribute to this:

*   **Default Configurations:**  Out-of-the-box, coturn might be configured to listen on all interfaces and respond to all valid STUN/TURN requests.  This "open" configuration is highly vulnerable.
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  Without rate limiting, an attacker can send a flood of small requests, each triggering a larger response.  This is the essence of amplification.
*   **Large STUN/TURN Messages:**  Certain STUN/TURN messages, particularly those involving relay allocation and data transmission, can be significantly larger than the initial request.  This size difference is the amplification factor.
*   **Spoofed Source IP Addresses:**  The attacker will spoof the source IP address of their requests, making them appear to originate from the intended victim.  Coturn, acting as a reflector, will then send the amplified responses to the victim.
* **Absence of `allowed-peer-ip`:** If the `allowed-peer-ip` configuration option is not used, or is overly permissive, coturn will respond to requests from any source IP address, making it a perfect amplifier.
* **Absence of `denied-peer-ip`:** Even if some rate-limiting is in place, known malicious IPs or ranges should be explicitly denied.

### 2.2 Exploitation Techniques

An attacker would typically follow these steps:

1.  **Reconnaissance:**  Identify publicly accessible coturn servers.  This can be done using tools like Shodan or by scanning common UDP ports (e.g., 3478, 5349).
2.  **Request Crafting:**  The attacker crafts STUN/TURN requests designed to maximize the response size.  This might involve requesting relay allocations or sending data through the relay.  Crucially, the source IP address in these requests is spoofed to be the victim's IP address.
3.  **Amplification:**  The attacker sends a large number of these crafted requests to the vulnerable coturn server.
4.  **DDoS:**  The coturn server, believing the requests came from the victim, sends the amplified responses to the victim's IP address, overwhelming their network and potentially causing a denial of service.
5.  **Botnet Usage (Optional but Common):**  Attackers often use botnets to distribute the attack, making it harder to trace and block.  Each bot sends a portion of the requests, further amplifying the attack.

### 2.3 Impact Assessment

*   **Direct Impact:**
    *   **Service Outage:**  The primary impact is a denial of service for the victim.  Their services become unavailable.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The victim's network bandwidth, CPU, and memory are consumed by the flood of traffic.
    *   **Financial Loss:**  Downtime can lead to significant financial losses due to lost business, service level agreement (SLA) penalties, and recovery costs.

*   **Indirect Impact:**
    *   **Reputational Damage:**  Service outages can damage the victim's reputation.
    *   **Collateral Damage:**  If the victim shares network infrastructure with other services, those services may also be affected.
    *   **Legal and Compliance Issues:**  Depending on the nature of the victim's services, there may be legal or compliance implications.
    * **Coturn Server Reputation:** The coturn server itself, if identified as a source of amplification, could be blacklisted, impacting legitimate users.

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The following mitigations, listed in the original attack tree, are expanded upon with practical implementation details:

*   **Disable unnecessary UDP listeners:**
    *   **Configuration:**  In the `turnserver.conf` file, explicitly specify the listening IP addresses using the `listening-ip` option.  *Do not* use the default behavior of listening on all interfaces.  If UDP is not strictly required, disable it entirely.
        ```
        listening-ip=192.0.2.1  # Replace with your server's public IP
        listening-port=3478
        #  ... other configurations ...
        #  Explicitly disable TLS/DTLS listeners if not needed:
        #  no-tls
        #  no-dtls
        ```
    *   **Rationale:**  Reduces the attack surface by limiting the interfaces that can receive requests.

*   **Implement strict rate limiting (requests per source IP):**
    *   **Configuration:**  Use the `user` and `lt-cred-mech` options in `turnserver.conf` to enable long-term credential mechanisms.  Then, use the `quota` and `userquota` settings to limit the number of requests per user/IP.
        ```
        lt-cred-mech
        user=username:password
        userquota=10  # Max 10 allocations per user
        total-quota=1000 # Max 1000 allocations total
        stale-nonce=600 # Nonce lifetime in seconds
        ```
        Also, consider using the `max-bps` setting per-user to limit bandwidth.
    *   **Rationale:**  Limits the number of requests an attacker can send from a single (spoofed) IP address, reducing the amplification potential.  Long-term credentials are required for quota enforcement.

*   **Configure response rate limiting (RRL):**
    *   **Configuration:** Coturn does *not* have built-in RRL in the same way that DNS servers do.  RRL is typically implemented at the firewall or network level.  You would use tools like `iptables` (Linux) or similar firewall rules on other operating systems to limit the *rate* of outgoing UDP responses to the same destination IP and port.
        ```bash
        # Example iptables rule (adjust values as needed):
        iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 3478 -m limit --limit 100/s --limit-burst 200 -j ACCEPT
        iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 3478 -j DROP
        ```
        This example limits outgoing UDP packets on port 3478 to 100 per second, with an initial burst of 200 allowed.  This is a *general* example and needs careful tuning to avoid blocking legitimate traffic.
    *   **Rationale:**  Limits the *size* of the response sent for each request, directly mitigating amplification.  This is a crucial defense.

*   **Monitor for unusual UDP traffic patterns:**
    *   **Tools:**  Use network monitoring tools like:
        *   **ntopng:**  Provides detailed traffic analysis and visualization.
        *   **Wireshark:**  For packet-level inspection.
        *   **tcpdump:**  For capturing network traffic.
        *   **Prometheus and Grafana:** For collecting and visualizing metrics over time.  Coturn can expose metrics compatible with Prometheus.
    *   **Metrics to Watch:**
        *   High volume of incoming UDP requests on the coturn ports.
        *   High volume of outgoing UDP responses.
        *   A large discrepancy between incoming request size and outgoing response size.
        *   A high number of requests from unusual or unexpected source IP addresses.
        *   Coturn's internal metrics (if exposed) related to allocation rates, bandwidth usage, and error counts.
    *   **Rationale:**  Early detection allows for faster response and mitigation.

*   **Use firewall rules to restrict traffic to expected sources/ports:**
    *   **Configuration:**  Use `iptables` (Linux), Windows Firewall, or your cloud provider's firewall (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Network Security Groups) to restrict incoming UDP traffic on ports 3478 and 5349 to only known and trusted IP addresses or ranges.  This is the most effective defense.
        ```bash
        # Example iptables rule to allow traffic only from specific IPs:
        iptables -A INPUT -p udp -s 192.0.2.10 --dport 3478 -j ACCEPT
        iptables -A INPUT -p udp -s 192.0.2.11 --dport 3478 -j ACCEPT
        iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 3478 -j DROP # Drop all other UDP traffic on 3478
        ```
        Replace `192.0.2.10` and `192.0.2.11` with the actual IP addresses of your clients or allowed networks.
    *   **Rationale:**  Prevents the coturn server from receiving requests from unexpected sources, completely eliminating the possibility of amplification attacks from those sources.  This is the *strongest* recommendation.  Use `allowed-peer-ip` in conjunction with firewall rules.

* **Use `allowed-peer-ip` and `denied-peer-ip`:**
    * **Configuration:** In `turnserver.conf`, use the `allowed-peer-ip` option to specify a list of IP addresses or CIDR ranges that are allowed to use the TURN server. If this option is used, *only* those IPs will be allowed. Use `denied-peer-ip` to explicitly block known bad actors.
    ```
    allowed-peer-ip=192.168.1.0/24
    allowed-peer-ip=10.0.0.1
    denied-peer-ip=203.0.113.0/24
    ```
    * **Rationale:** This provides an application-level control over which peers can use the TURN functionality, complementing firewall rules.

### 2.5 Detection Techniques

*   **Traffic Analysis:**  As mentioned above, monitor network traffic for unusual patterns.
*   **Log Analysis:**  Coturn logs can reveal suspicious activity, such as a high number of failed authentication attempts or allocation requests from unknown IPs.  Enable verbose logging and regularly review the logs.
*   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Configure an IDS (e.g., Snort, Suricata) to detect and alert on patterns associated with UDP amplification attacks.
*   **Honeypots:**  Deploy a decoy coturn server (honeypot) with minimal security to attract and identify attackers.  This can provide valuable intelligence about attack techniques and sources.

### 2.6 Testing and Validation

*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use vulnerability scanners to identify potential weaknesses in your coturn configuration.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration tests, simulating UDP amplification attacks, to assess the effectiveness of your mitigations.  This should be done in a controlled environment.
*   **Traffic Simulation:**  Use tools like `hping3` or custom scripts to generate simulated UDP traffic and test your rate limiting and firewall rules.
    ```bash
    # Example hping3 command to send spoofed UDP packets:
    hping3 -2 -s <victim_ip> -p 3478 -d 10 -S --flood <coturn_server_ip>
    ```
    **Warning:**  Use extreme caution with `hping3` and similar tools.  Only use them in controlled testing environments and *never* target systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
*   **Configuration Review:**  Regularly review your coturn configuration and firewall rules to ensure they are up-to-date and aligned with best practices.
