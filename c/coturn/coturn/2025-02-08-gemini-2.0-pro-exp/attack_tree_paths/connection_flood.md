Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Connection Flood" attack tree path for a system using coturn, structured as requested:

# Deep Analysis: coturn Connection Flood Attack

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Connection Flood" attack vector against a coturn TURN/STUN server, identify specific vulnerabilities within coturn's configuration and deployment that could exacerbate this attack, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level mitigations already listed.  We aim to move from general recommendations to specific configuration parameters and monitoring techniques.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Connection Flood" attack path within the larger attack tree.  It encompasses:

*   **coturn's configuration:**  We will examine relevant configuration options within `turnserver.conf` and their impact on connection flood resilience.
*   **Network infrastructure:** We will consider how the network environment surrounding the coturn server can contribute to or mitigate the attack.
*   **Operating system limitations:** We will analyze how the underlying operating system's resource limits (e.g., file descriptors, sockets) interact with coturn's connection handling.
*   **Monitoring and alerting:** We will define specific metrics and thresholds for detecting and responding to connection flood attempts.
*   **Attack variations:** We will consider different methods an attacker might use to initiate a connection flood, including both TCP and UDP-based approaches.

This analysis *excludes* other attack vectors against coturn (e.g., relay exploitation, credential stuffing) except where they directly relate to connection flooding.  It also assumes a basic understanding of TURN/STUN protocols and network security principles.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Configuration Review:**  We will analyze the `turnserver.conf` documentation and default settings to identify parameters related to connection limits, rate limiting, and resource allocation.
2.  **Code Inspection (Limited):**  While a full code audit is out of scope, we will refer to the coturn source code (available on GitHub) to understand the implementation details of connection handling where necessary to clarify configuration options.
3.  **Best Practice Research:** We will consult industry best practices for securing TURN/STUN servers and mitigating denial-of-service attacks.
4.  **Scenario Analysis:** We will consider different attack scenarios and how coturn's configuration would respond in each case.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:** We will provide specific, actionable recommendations for configuring coturn, the network, and monitoring systems to enhance resilience against connection floods.
6.  **Testing Considerations:** We will outline testing strategies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Connection Flood Attack Path

### 2.1 Attack Variations

A connection flood against coturn can manifest in several ways:

*   **TCP SYN Flood:**  The attacker sends a large number of TCP SYN packets to the coturn server's listening ports (typically 3478 and 5349) without completing the three-way handshake.  This consumes server resources as it maintains state for each half-open connection.
*   **UDP Flood:** The attacker sends a large volume of UDP packets to the coturn server's listening ports.  While UDP is stateless, the server still needs to process each incoming packet, potentially overwhelming its network interface or CPU.  This is particularly relevant for TURN allocations, which rely on UDP for media relay.
*   **STUN/TURN Request Flood:** The attacker sends a large number of valid STUN binding requests or TURN allocation requests.  Even if these requests are well-formed, the sheer volume can overwhelm the server's processing capacity.
*   **"Slowloris"-style Attack:**  The attacker establishes many TCP connections but sends data very slowly, keeping the connections open for an extended period.  This can exhaust the server's connection pool even if the total number of simultaneous connections is below a configured limit.
*   **Amplification/Reflection (Less Direct):** While not a direct connection flood *to* coturn, an attacker could potentially use *other* vulnerable UDP services to amplify traffic directed at the coturn server. This is less likely with STUN/TURN due to the authentication mechanisms, but it's worth considering in the broader network context.

### 2.2 coturn Configuration Analysis (`turnserver.conf`)

The following `turnserver.conf` parameters are crucial for mitigating connection floods:

*   **`listening-port` and `tls-listening-port`:**  These define the ports coturn listens on.  It's crucial to ensure these are correctly configured and that unnecessary ports are *not* exposed.
*   **`listening-ip` and `relay-ip`:**  Binding coturn to specific IP addresses (rather than `0.0.0.0`) can limit the attack surface.  Using separate listening and relay IPs can further improve security and performance.
*   **`min-port` and `max-port`:**  These define the range of UDP ports used for relay allocations.  A smaller range can limit the potential impact of a UDP flood targeting the relay ports, but it also limits the number of concurrent relay sessions.  A balance must be struck.
*   **`total-quota`:**  This sets a global limit on the number of allocations.  While not directly a connection limit, it indirectly limits the resources an attacker can consume.  A reasonable value should be set based on expected usage.
*   **`user-quota`:** This limits the number of allocations per user.  This is important for preventing a single compromised user account from launching a connection flood.
*   **`stale-nonce-lifetime`:**  A shorter lifetime for nonces helps mitigate replay attacks, which could contribute to a flood of allocation requests.
*   **`lt-cred-mech`:** Using long-term credentials (with a strong password policy) is generally recommended over short-term credentials for production deployments, as it reduces the overhead of credential exchange and the potential for related attacks.
*   **`max-connections-per-user`:** This is a *critical* parameter. It directly limits the number of simultaneous connections allowed from a single user (identified by username).  A low value (e.g., 5-10) is recommended to prevent a single user from exhausting connection resources.  This is *more effective* than a global connection limit, as it targets the source of the flood.
*   **`max-bps` and `max-bps-per-user`:** These limit the bandwidth usage, which is not directly related to connection flooding but can help mitigate other resource exhaustion attacks.
*   **`denied-peer-ip` and `allowed-peer-ip`:**  These options allow for explicit blacklisting and whitelisting of IP addresses.  While not a primary defense against connection floods, they can be used to block known malicious IPs or restrict access to trusted networks.
*   **`no-tcp` and `no-udp`:** If either TCP or UDP is not required, disabling it reduces the attack surface.
*   **`no-tcp-relay` and `no-udp-relay`:** If relay functionality is not needed for a particular protocol, disabling it further reduces the attack surface.
*   **`cli-password`:**  A strong CLI password is essential to prevent unauthorized access to the coturn server's administrative interface.
*   **`log-file`:** Proper logging is crucial for detecting and analyzing connection flood attempts.  The log file should be monitored for suspicious activity.
*   **`verbose`:**  While useful for debugging, excessive verbosity in production logs can consume disk space and potentially impact performance.  A balance should be struck.

### 2.3 Operating System and Network Considerations

*   **Firewall:** A properly configured firewall (e.g., `iptables`, `nftables`, `ufw`) is the *first line of defense*.  It should be configured to:
    *   **Rate-limit incoming connections:**  Limit the number of new connections per second from a single IP address.  This is crucial for mitigating SYN floods.  Example `iptables` rule (adjust values as needed):
        ```bash
        iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 3478 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 15 --connlimit-mask 32 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
        iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 3478 -m recent --set --name coturn_syn
        iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 3478 -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 --name coturn_syn -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
        ```
        These rules limit connections to 15 per IP and then rate-limit to 4 SYN packets per 60 seconds per IP.
    *   **Drop invalid packets:**  Ensure the firewall is configured to drop packets with invalid flags or checksums.
    *   **Block unauthorized traffic:**  Only allow traffic to the coturn server's listening ports from authorized sources, if possible.
*   **`sysctl` Tuning:**  The operating system's kernel parameters can be tuned to improve resilience to connection floods.  Key parameters include:
    *   **`net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1`:**  Enable SYN cookies to mitigate SYN floods.  This is generally recommended.
    *   **`net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog`:**  Increase the size of the SYN backlog queue.  This allows the server to handle more half-open connections before dropping them.  A reasonable value depends on available memory.
    *   **`net.core.somaxconn`:**  Increase the maximum number of pending connections.  This is related to the `listen()` system call's backlog parameter.
    *   **`net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1`:**  Allow reuse of TIME-WAIT sockets for new connections.  This can help free up resources more quickly.
    *   **`net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout`:**  Reduce the timeout for FIN-WAIT-2 connections.  This can help close connections faster.
    *   **`fs.file-max`:** Increase the maximum number of open files.  Each connection consumes a file descriptor, so this limit should be sufficiently high.  Use `ulimit -n` to check and adjust the per-process limit as well.
*   **Network Interface Card (NIC) Settings:**  Ensure the NIC is configured for optimal performance and has sufficient receive and transmit queues.  Consider using a NIC with hardware offloading capabilities to reduce CPU overhead.
*   **Load Balancer (Optional):**  A load balancer in front of multiple coturn instances can distribute traffic and improve resilience.  The load balancer itself should be configured to mitigate connection floods.

### 2.4 Monitoring and Alerting

Effective monitoring is crucial for detecting and responding to connection flood attempts.  Key metrics to monitor include:

*   **Number of active connections:**  Track the total number of active connections to the coturn server.  Set alerts for unusually high values.
*   **Connection rate:**  Monitor the rate of new connections per second.  Alert on sudden spikes.
*   **Number of half-open connections (SYN_RECV state):**  A high number of connections in the SYN_RECV state indicates a potential SYN flood.
*   **UDP packet rate:**  Monitor the rate of incoming UDP packets.  Alert on unusually high volumes.
*   **CPU and memory usage:**  High CPU or memory usage can indicate that the server is under stress.
*   **coturn log file:**  Regularly review the coturn log file for errors, warnings, and suspicious activity.  Look for messages related to connection limits, allocation failures, or denied peers.
*   **Firewall logs:**  Monitor firewall logs for dropped or rejected connections.  This can provide valuable information about attack attempts.

**Specific Tools and Techniques:**

*   **`netstat` or `ss`:**  Use these command-line tools to monitor active connections and their states.
*   **`tcpdump` or `Wireshark`:**  Use these packet capture tools to analyze network traffic and identify suspicious patterns.
*   **Monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios, Zabbix):**  Implement a dedicated monitoring system to collect and visualize metrics, set alerts, and provide historical data.  coturn provides metrics that can be scraped by Prometheus.
*   **Log analysis tools (e.g., ELK stack, Graylog):**  Use log analysis tools to aggregate and analyze coturn logs and firewall logs.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Consider deploying an IDS/IPS to automatically detect and block malicious traffic.

### 2.5 Testing Considerations

After implementing mitigations, it's crucial to test their effectiveness.  This should be done in a controlled environment, *not* on a production server.

*   **Load Testing Tools:**  Use tools like `hping3`, `nmap` (with scripting), or custom scripts to simulate connection flood attacks.
*   **Vary Attack Parameters:**  Test different attack variations (SYN flood, UDP flood, etc.) with varying rates and durations.
*   **Monitor Server Response:**  Carefully monitor the server's response during the tests, including connection counts, resource usage, and log files.
*   **Measure Performance Impact:**  Assess the impact of the mitigations on legitimate traffic.  Ensure that the mitigations do not unduly restrict legitimate users.
*   **Iterative Testing:**  Refine the configuration and mitigations based on the test results.

By combining careful coturn configuration, operating system tuning, network security measures, and robust monitoring, it's possible to significantly enhance resilience against this attack.  Regular testing and ongoing monitoring are essential to maintain a strong security posture.  The specific configuration values and thresholds should be tailored to the specific environment and expected usage patterns.
