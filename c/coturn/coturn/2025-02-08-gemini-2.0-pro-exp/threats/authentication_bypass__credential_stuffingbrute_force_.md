Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Authentication Bypass (Credential Stuffing/Brute Force)" threat for a coturn-based application, following the structure you outlined:

## Deep Analysis: Authentication Bypass (Credential Stuffing/Brute Force) in coturn

### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics, potential impact, and effective mitigation strategies for authentication bypass attacks (specifically credential stuffing and brute-force attacks) targeting a coturn TURN/STUN server.  This understanding will inform the development team's security hardening efforts and operational monitoring procedures.  We aim to identify specific configuration weaknesses, code vulnerabilities, and operational practices that could increase the risk of successful attacks.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following aspects of the coturn server:

*   **Authentication Mechanisms:**  We will examine both long-term credential and shared-secret authentication methods provided by coturn, including their configuration options and underlying code implementations.
*   **Credential Storage:**  We will analyze how coturn handles user credentials, whether stored in a database, configuration file, or other backend.  This includes evaluating the hashing algorithms and key derivation functions used.
*   **Rate Limiting and Lockout Mechanisms:** We will investigate coturn's built-in features for mitigating brute-force attacks, such as account lockout policies and request throttling.  We'll assess their effectiveness and identify potential bypasses.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:**  We will analyze coturn's logging capabilities related to authentication attempts, focusing on identifying log entries that can indicate credential stuffing or brute-force attacks.
*   **Interaction with External Components:** If coturn is integrated with external authentication systems (e.g., OAuth, LDAP, RADIUS), we will briefly consider how those integrations might affect the attack surface.  However, a deep dive into those external systems is outside the scope of *this* analysis.

### 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Code Review:**  We will examine the relevant sections of the coturn source code (primarily `turn_server_check_credentials`, `turn_server_check_oauth`, and related functions in `turnserver.c`, `dbdrivers.c`, and potentially other files) to identify potential vulnerabilities and understand the implementation details of authentication and rate limiting.
*   **Configuration Analysis:** We will review the `turnserver.conf` configuration file options related to authentication, credential storage, and rate limiting.  We will identify secure and insecure configurations.
*   **Penetration Testing (Simulated Attacks):**  We will conduct controlled, simulated credential stuffing and brute-force attacks against a test coturn instance to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented mitigations and identify potential weaknesses.  This will involve using tools like Hydra, Burp Suite Intruder, or custom scripts.
*   **Log Analysis:**  We will examine coturn's logs during and after simulated attacks to identify patterns and indicators of compromise (IOCs) that can be used for detection and response.
*   **Documentation Review:** We will consult the official coturn documentation and relevant RFCs (e.g., RFC 5389, RFC 5766, RFC 8656) to ensure our understanding of the intended behavior and security properties of the system.

### 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**4.1 Attack Vectors and Mechanics**

*   **Credential Stuffing:**  Attackers leverage lists of compromised username/password pairs obtained from data breaches of other services.  They automate the process of trying these combinations against the coturn server, hoping that users have reused credentials.  This attack relies on the prevalence of password reuse.

*   **Brute-Force Attack:**  Attackers systematically try all possible combinations of usernames and passwords within a defined character set and length.  This attack is less targeted than credential stuffing but can be effective against weak or short passwords.  The attacker might start with common usernames (e.g., "admin," "user") and then try various password combinations.

*   **Targeting Long-Term Credentials:**  This involves attacking the database or file where coturn stores user credentials.  If the attacker can compromise this storage, they gain access to all user accounts.

*   **Targeting Shared Secrets:**  This involves attempting to guess or brute-force the shared secret used for authentication.  Shared secrets are often used for temporary or programmatic access.

*   **Exploiting Weak Hashing:** While coturn uses HMAC-SHA1, which is generally considered secure *for its purpose as a keyed-hash message authentication code*, if an attacker gains access to the hashed credentials *and* the secret key, they could potentially use rainbow tables or other techniques to reverse the hash, *especially if the passwords themselves are weak*.  This is more of a concern if the database or configuration file is compromised.  It's crucial to understand that HMAC-SHA1 is *not* a password hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2; it's designed for message authentication, not password storage.  However, coturn uses it in a way that provides reasonable security *if configured correctly*.

*   **Bypassing Rate Limiting:**  Sophisticated attackers may attempt to circumvent rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms by:
    *   **Distributing the attack:** Using multiple IP addresses (e.g., through a botnet) to spread out the login attempts.
    *   **Slow and low attacks:**  Making login attempts very slowly, below the threshold that triggers rate limiting.
    *   **Exploiting flaws in the rate limiting implementation:**  If the rate limiting logic has bugs, attackers might find ways to bypass it.

**4.2 Affected Components (Detailed)**

*   **`turn_server_check_credentials` (in `turnserver.c`):** This function is the core of the long-term credential authentication process.  It handles retrieving user credentials from the configured backend (database, file, etc.) and verifying the provided password against the stored hash.  Vulnerabilities here could allow attackers to bypass authentication.

*   **`turn_server_check_oauth` (in `turnserver.c`):** This function handles OAuth-based authentication.  While the OAuth flow itself is handled by an external provider, vulnerabilities in how coturn interacts with the provider could lead to bypasses.

*   **Database Interaction Functions (e.g., in `dbdrivers.c`):**  If coturn is configured to use a database for credential storage, the functions that interact with the database are critical.  SQL injection vulnerabilities or other database-related flaws could allow attackers to extract or modify credentials.

*   **`rfc5769_hash` and related functions:** These functions implement the HMAC-SHA1 hashing used for authentication. While HMAC-SHA1 itself is not inherently vulnerable, incorrect usage or weak secret keys could compromise security.

*   **Rate Limiting and Lockout Logic (various locations):**  The code that implements rate limiting and account lockout is distributed throughout the codebase.  We need to identify all relevant sections and analyze them for potential bypasses.  This includes examining how failed login attempts are tracked and how lockout thresholds are enforced.

**4.3 Risk Severity: High**

The risk severity is classified as **High** because:

*   **Direct Access:** Successful authentication bypass grants the attacker direct access to the TURN server, allowing them to relay traffic and potentially consume resources.
*   **Data Breach Potential:** If the attacker compromises the credential database, they could gain access to a large number of user accounts.
*   **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack could damage the reputation of the service provider.
*   **Legal and Compliance Issues:**  Data breaches can lead to legal and regulatory penalties.

**4.4 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Prioritized)**

Here's a prioritized list of mitigation strategies, with detailed explanations:

1.  **Strong Password Policies (Essential):**
    *   **Enforce minimum password length:**  At least 12 characters, preferably 16 or more.
    *   **Require complexity:**  Mandate a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    *   **Disallow common passwords:**  Use a blacklist of commonly used passwords (e.g., "password," "123456").
    *   **Educate users:**  Provide guidance on creating strong, unique passwords.
    *   **Configuration:** This is primarily enforced *outside* of coturn itself, at the point where user accounts are created.  Coturn doesn't have built-in password policy enforcement.

2.  **Account Lockout (Essential):**
    *   **Implement account lockout after a small number of failed login attempts (e.g., 3-5 attempts).**
    *   **Set a reasonable lockout duration (e.g., 30 minutes, increasing with subsequent failed attempts).**
    *   **Use `lt-cred-mech`:** This option enables the long-term credential mechanism, which is necessary for account lockout to function.
    *   **Configure `user` option:** Define users and their passwords (or use a database).
    *   **Consider `denied-user-list`:**  This option can be used to permanently block specific usernames.
    *   **Configuration Example (`turnserver.conf`):**
        ```
        lt-cred-mech
        user=username:password
        # ... other configurations ...
        ```
        *Note: coturn's built-in account lockout is relatively basic. It relies on tracking failed attempts in memory, which means it's reset if the server restarts. For more robust lockout, consider using an external authentication backend that provides this functionality.*

3.  **Rate Limiting (Essential):**
    *   **Implement rate limiting on authentication attempts, even before account lockout is triggered.** This helps to slow down brute-force attacks and mitigate the impact of credential stuffing.
    *   **Use different rate limits for different IP addresses and usernames.**
    *   **Consider using a sliding window approach for rate limiting.**
    *   **Configuration:** Coturn has some built-in rate limiting, but it's primarily focused on overall traffic, not specifically authentication attempts.  You might need to supplement this with external tools (e.g., a firewall, a reverse proxy like Nginx with `limit_req`, or a Web Application Firewall (WAF)).

4.  **Secure Credential Storage (Essential):**
    *   **If using a database, ensure it is properly secured and protected from unauthorized access.**
    *   **Use strong database credentials.**
    *   **Regularly update the database software to patch security vulnerabilities.**
    *   **Consider using a dedicated database user with limited privileges for coturn.**
    *   **If storing credentials in a file, ensure the file has appropriate permissions (read-only for the coturn user).**

5.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (Highly Recommended):**
    *   **If possible, integrate coturn with an authentication backend that supports MFA (e.g., using RADIUS or OAuth).**  MFA adds a significant layer of security by requiring users to provide a second factor of authentication (e.g., a one-time code from an authenticator app).
    *   **Configuration:** This is typically handled *outside* of coturn, through integration with an external authentication system.

6.  **Monitoring and Alerting (Essential):**
    *   **Monitor coturn's logs for suspicious activity, such as a high number of failed login attempts from a single IP address or username.**
    *   **Configure alerts to notify administrators of potential attacks.**
    *   **Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to aggregate and analyze logs from multiple sources.**
    *   **Log Fields to Monitor:**
        *   `login attempt` messages
        *   `authentication failure` messages
        *   `user banned` messages (if using account lockout)
        *   `relay statistics` (to detect unusual traffic patterns)
    *   **Example Log Entry (Failed Login):**
        ```
        ... : session ...: realm <...>: user <...>: login attempt failed
        ```

7.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing (Recommended):**
    *   **Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities.**
    *   **Use automated vulnerability scanners to identify known weaknesses.**

8.  **Keep coturn Updated (Essential):**
    *   **Regularly update coturn to the latest version to patch security vulnerabilities.**
    *   **Subscribe to the coturn mailing list or follow the project on GitHub to stay informed about security updates.**

9. **Use of External Security Tools (Recommended):**
    * **Firewall:** Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the coturn server to only authorized IP addresses.
    * **Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx):** Use a reverse proxy to add an additional layer of security and implement more sophisticated rate limiting and request filtering.
    * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help to protect against a wide range of web-based attacks, including credential stuffing and brute-force attacks.

**4.5 Specific Code Review Focus Areas**

During the code review, pay close attention to the following:

*   **Error Handling:** Ensure that error handling in the authentication functions does not leak information that could be useful to an attacker (e.g., distinguishing between invalid usernames and invalid passwords).
*   **Timing Attacks:**  Check for potential timing attacks, where the time it takes to process an authentication request could reveal information about the validity of the credentials.  While HMAC-SHA1 is relatively resistant to timing attacks, the surrounding code should be examined.
*   **Input Validation:**  Ensure that all user-supplied input is properly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Lockout Implementation:**  Carefully review the logic that tracks failed login attempts and enforces account lockouts.  Look for potential race conditions or other flaws that could allow attackers to bypass the lockout mechanism.
*   **Randomness:** If any random numbers are used in the authentication process (e.g., for generating nonces), ensure that they are generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the authentication bypass threat to coturn. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies and conducting thorough code reviews and penetration testing, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and continuous monitoring and improvement are essential.
