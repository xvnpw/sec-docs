## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via coturn](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_coturn.md)

**Description:** The root node, representing the attacker's overall objective of compromising the application by exploiting coturn.
    *   **Likelihood:** N/A (Root Node)
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** N/A (Root Node)
    *   **Skill Level:** N/A (Root Node)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** N/A (Root Node)

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Service Availability](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_service_availability.md)

**Description:** Making the TURN/STUN server, and thus the application relying on it, unavailable. This is a primary attacker goal.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Varies (Depends on the specific attack)
    *   **Skill Level:** Varies (Depends on the specific attack)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies (Depends on the specific attack)

## Attack Tree Path: [DoS/DDoS](./attack_tree_paths/dosddos.md)

**Description:** Denial-of-Service or Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks aimed at overwhelming the coturn server.

## Attack Tree Path: [UDP Amplification](./attack_tree_paths/udp_amplification.md)

**Description:** Exploiting coturn's UDP-based nature to amplify traffic, using it as a reflector in a DDoS attack. Attackers send small requests to coturn, which responds with much larger responses directed at the victim.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (coturn is UDP-based and, if misconfigured, vulnerable)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Can completely disable the service and potentially affect other systems)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Readily available tools and botnets can be used)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Large traffic spikes are noticeable, but identifying the true source is difficult due to reflection)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Disable unnecessary UDP listeners.
        *   Implement strict rate limiting (requests per source IP).
        *   Configure response rate limiting (RRL).
        *   Monitor for unusual UDP traffic patterns.
        *   Use firewall rules to restrict traffic to expected sources/ports.

## Attack Tree Path: [Connection Flood](./attack_tree_paths/connection_flood.md)

**Description:** Exhausting the server's ability to handle new connections by opening a large number of connections simultaneously.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on coturn's connection handling and rate limiting configuration)
    *   **Impact:** High (Can prevent legitimate users from connecting)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Simple tools can generate many connection attempts)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Increased connection attempts are visible, but distinguishing malicious from legitimate can be difficult without further analysis)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Configure connection limits per IP address and globally.
        *   Implement connection rate limiting.
        *   Monitor connection counts and alert on anomalies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:**  Attacks that aim to consume server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) to the point of failure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Long-Term Auth Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/long-term_auth_abuse.md)

**Description:** Repeatedly authenticating and allocating resources using long-term credentials without releasing them, leading to resource exhaustion. This is particularly dangerous if long-term credentials are not properly managed (e.g., no limits on allocations per credential).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the use and management of long-term credentials)
    *   **Impact:** High (Can consume significant resources and block legitimate users)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Requires valid credentials, but can be easily automated)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring authentication and resource usage patterns associated with specific credentials)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Limit the number of allocations per long-term credential.
        *   Implement short-term credentials with automatic refresh mechanisms.
        *   Monitor resource usage per credential and alert on excessive usage.
        *   Implement account lockout policies after repeated failed authentication attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Allocation Rate Limit Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/allocation_rate_limit_bypass.md)

**Description:** Finding ways to circumvent any configured rate limits on allocation creation, allowing an attacker to create a large number of allocations and exhaust server resources.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires finding a flaw in the rate limiting implementation)
    *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to resource exhaustion)
    *   **Effort:** High (Requires understanding of coturn's rate limiting logic and finding a vulnerability)
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires detailed analysis of rate limiting behavior and potentially reverse engineering)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Thoroughly test and validate the rate limiting implementation.
        *   Use multiple layers of rate limiting (e.g., per IP, per user, global).
        *   Monitor for unusual allocation creation patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [Hijack User Sessions](./attack_tree_paths/hijack_user_sessions.md)

**Description:** Taking over legitimate user's connection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm_.md)

**Description:** Intercepting and potentially modifying traffic between clients and the TURN server, or between the TURN server and the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Relay Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/relay_hijacking.md)

**Description:**  An attacker compromises a relay allocation, allowing them to redirect traffic or inject data into the relayed connection. This gives the attacker control over the communication channel.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires compromising a relay allocation, which should be protected)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Allows complete control over relayed communication, potential data exfiltration and manipulation)
    *   **Effort:** Medium/High (Depends on the security of the relay configuration and authentication mechanisms)
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires monitoring relay traffic and identifying anomalies, potentially requiring deep packet inspection)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Strong authentication for relay allocations.
        *   Restrict relay usage to authorized users and applications.
        *   Use TLS for all relay connections.
        *   Implement integrity checks on relayed data.
        *   Monitor relay usage for suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expired Certs/Weak Crypto](./attack_tree_paths/expired_certsweak_crypto.md)

**Description:** If TLS certificates are expired, invalid, or use weak cryptographic algorithms, an attacker can perform a MITM attack, decrypting and potentially modifying traffic.
    * **Likelihood:** Low (If certificates are properly managed and strong crypto is used)
    * **Impact:** Very High (Allows MITM attacks, compromising confidentiality and integrity)
    * **Effort:** Medium (Requires exploiting weak cryptography or certificate validation flaws)
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Certificate warnings may be visible to clients, but users might ignore them; server-side detection requires monitoring certificate validity and crypto configurations)
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   Use strong, up-to-date TLS configurations.
        *   Use valid, non-expired certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
        *   Implement certificate pinning where appropriate.
        *   Regularly monitor certificate validity and expiration dates.
        *   Disable support for weak cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
