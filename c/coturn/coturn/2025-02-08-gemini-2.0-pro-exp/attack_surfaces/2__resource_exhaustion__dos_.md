# Deep Analysis: Resource Exhaustion (DoS) Attack Surface on coturn

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities related to resource exhaustion attacks targeting a coturn-based application.  We aim to identify specific attack vectors, assess their potential impact, and refine mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level overview.  This analysis will inform concrete configuration recommendations and monitoring strategies.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses *exclusively* on the resource exhaustion attack surface of a coturn deployment.  It considers:

*   **coturn's internal mechanisms:** How coturn handles connections, allocations, and resource management.
*   **Configuration parameters:**  The impact of various coturn settings on resource consumption.
*   **Network-level factors:**  How network conditions and attacker capabilities can exacerbate resource exhaustion.
*   **Integration with the application:** How the application's usage of coturn influences the attack surface.  (While we won't deeply analyze the application itself, we'll consider its interaction with coturn).
*   **Monitoring and alerting:** Strategies for detecting and responding to resource exhaustion attempts.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other attack surfaces (e.g., authentication bypass, data leakage).
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or network infrastructure (except where they directly impact coturn's resource usage).
*   Specific application logic vulnerabilities (unless they directly contribute to coturn resource exhaustion).

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Documentation Review:**  Thorough examination of the coturn documentation (including source code comments where necessary) to understand resource management mechanisms and configuration options.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Evaluation of the impact of various coturn configuration parameters on resource consumption, focusing on those identified in the initial attack surface analysis.
3.  **Attack Vector Enumeration:**  Identification of specific attack scenarios that could lead to resource exhaustion, considering different types of requests and network conditions.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Detailed evaluation of the potential consequences of successful resource exhaustion attacks, including service degradation, complete denial of service, and potential system instability.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Development of specific, actionable recommendations for mitigating resource exhaustion risks, including configuration settings, monitoring strategies, and potential architectural changes.
6.  **Testing Considerations:** Outline of testing approaches to validate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. coturn's Resource Management

coturn, by its nature, is a resource-intensive application.  It manages:

*   **TURN Allocations:**  Each TURN allocation consumes memory to store session state (client information, relay addresses, permissions, etc.).
*   **STUN/TURN Connections:**  Each active connection (even STUN requests) requires file descriptors (sockets) and some CPU time for processing.
*   **Data Relaying:**  Relaying data between clients consumes bandwidth and CPU cycles for packet processing.
*   **Timers and Event Handling:**  coturn uses timers for session timeouts and other events, which consume a small amount of CPU.

### 2.2. Attack Vector Enumeration

Several attack vectors can lead to resource exhaustion:

1.  **Massive Allocation Requests:**  An attacker sends a flood of TURN allocation requests, even if they don't intend to use the allocated resources.  This is the most direct attack on memory.
    *   **Variations:**
        *   Requests with long lifetimes.
        *   Requests with different usernames (to bypass per-user limits).
        *   Requests from multiple source IP addresses (to bypass per-IP limits).

2.  **Connection Flooding:**  An attacker establishes a large number of STUN/TURN connections without sending any data.  This primarily exhausts file descriptors and CPU time for connection handling.
    *   **Variations:**
        *   Using different source ports.
        *   Using different usernames.

3.  **Bandwidth Exhaustion:**  If the attacker *can* successfully obtain TURN allocations, they can attempt to saturate the server's network bandwidth by relaying large amounts of data.
    *   **Variations:**
        *   Using multiple allocated relays.
        *   Sending data in both directions.

4.  **Slowloris-Style Attacks:**  An attacker establishes connections but sends data very slowly, keeping the connections open for extended periods.  This ties up resources without requiring a high request rate.  This is less effective against coturn than against traditional web servers, but still a concern.

5.  **Amplification Attacks (if misconfigured):** If coturn is misconfigured to allow open relaying (without authentication), an attacker could potentially use it for amplification attacks, reflecting traffic to other targets. This would consume bandwidth and CPU.  This is a *configuration* vulnerability, but it leads to resource exhaustion.

### 2.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful resource exhaustion attack ranges from:

*   **Service Degradation:**  Legitimate users experience slow response times and connection failures.
*   **Complete Denial of Service (DoS):**  coturn becomes completely unresponsive, preventing any new allocations or connections.
*   **Server Instability:**  In extreme cases, resource exhaustion could lead to the coturn process crashing or even the entire server becoming unstable.
*   **Resource Costs:**  If running in a cloud environment, excessive resource consumption can lead to increased costs.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategy Refinement

The initial mitigation strategies were a good starting point.  Here's a more detailed and refined approach:

1.  **Resource Limits (Configuration):**

    *   `--max-bps`:  **Crucial.** Set this to a reasonable value based on your expected traffic and server capacity.  This limits the *total* bandwidth coturn can use.
    *   `--max-users`:  Limit the total number of users.  Less critical if per-user quotas are well-defined.
    *   `--total-quota`:  **Crucial.**  Limits the total number of *allocations*.  This is a primary defense against allocation flooding.  Set this based on your expected concurrent users and a safety margin.
    *   `--user-quota`:  **Crucial.**  Limits the number of allocations *per user*.  This prevents a single malicious user from consuming all resources.  Set this to a low value (e.g., 1-3) unless your application specifically requires more.
    *   `--max-port` and `--min-port`:  Define the range of ports coturn can use for relaying.  This doesn't directly prevent DoS, but it helps with firewall configuration and predictability.
    *   `--conn-per-ip-limit`: **Crucial.** Limit the number of connections from a single IP address. This mitigates connection flooding attacks. Start with a low value (e.g., 5-10) and adjust based on monitoring.
    *   `--lt-cred-mech`: Use long-term credential mechanism. This forces clients to authenticate, making it harder to launch anonymous attacks.
    *   `--denied-peer-ip`: Blacklist known malicious IP addresses.
    *   `--allowed-peer-ip`: Whitelist known good IP addresses (if feasible). This is a more restrictive approach.
    *   `--stale-nonce-lifetime`: Reduce the lifetime of nonces to prevent replay attacks that could consume resources.
    *   `--no-multicast-peers`: Disable multicast peer discovery unless absolutely necessary, as it could be abused.

2.  **Rate Limiting (Beyond `--conn-per-ip-limit`):**

    *   **Consider a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can provide more sophisticated rate limiting and traffic filtering capabilities, including:
        *   **Request rate limiting:**  Limit the number of requests per second from a single IP address or user.
        *   **Geographic blocking:**  Block requests from specific countries or regions.
        *   **Bot detection:**  Identify and block automated attacks.
    *   **Custom Rate Limiting (if necessary):**  If a WAF is not feasible, consider implementing custom rate limiting logic *in front of* coturn.  This could involve a reverse proxy or a custom script.

3.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**

    *   **Server Resource Usage:**  Monitor CPU usage, memory usage, network bandwidth, and file descriptor usage.  Set alerts for high utilization levels.
    *   **coturn Metrics:**  coturn provides various metrics (e.g., number of allocations, number of connections, bandwidth usage).  Use a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) to collect and visualize these metrics.  Set alerts for unusual patterns or exceeding thresholds.
    *   **Log Analysis:**  Regularly analyze coturn logs for suspicious activity, such as a high number of failed allocation requests or connections from unusual IP addresses.
    *   **Alerting System:**  Configure an alerting system (e.g., PagerDuty, OpsGenie) to notify administrators when alerts are triggered.

4.  **Horizontal Scaling:**

    *   **Multiple coturn Instances:**  Deploy multiple coturn instances behind a load balancer.  This distributes the load and increases overall capacity.
    *   **Load Balancer Configuration:**  Configure the load balancer to distribute traffic evenly and to handle health checks to ensure that only healthy coturn instances receive traffic.

5. **Network Segmentation:**
    * Isolate coturn server on separate network, to limit blast radius.

### 2.5 Testing Considerations
*   **Load Testing:** Use a load testing tool (e.g., `turnutils_uclient` that comes with coturn, or a more general-purpose tool like JMeter or Gatling) to simulate high load and verify that the resource limits are effective.
*   **DoS Simulation:** Carefully simulate DoS attacks (in a controlled environment!) to test the resilience of your coturn deployment.  This should be done with caution and only on test systems.
*   **Monitoring Validation:**  Ensure that your monitoring system is correctly collecting and reporting metrics, and that alerts are being triggered as expected.

## 3. Conclusion

Resource exhaustion is a significant threat to coturn deployments.  By implementing a combination of strict configuration limits, rate limiting, comprehensive monitoring, and potentially horizontal scaling, you can significantly reduce the risk of successful DoS attacks.  Regular testing and ongoing monitoring are essential to ensure the continued effectiveness of these mitigations. The refined strategies outlined above provide a much stronger defense than the initial high-level recommendations.
