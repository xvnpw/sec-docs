# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for coturn/coturn

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Connection Limiting (coturn-native)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_connection_limiting__coturn-native_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting and Connection Limiting (coturn-native)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Resources:** Determine the critical resources to protect within coturn: bandwidth (bps), connections per IP, and total allocations.
        2.  **Baseline Usage:** Analyze typical usage patterns using coturn's logs to establish reasonable baseline limits.
        3.  **Set Initial Limits (Aggressive):**  In `turnserver.conf`, set *very* low initial values for:
            *   `--max-bps`: Maximum bandwidth per user (bits per second).
            *   `--user-quota`:  Bandwidth quota per user (bytes).
            *   `--quota`: General bandwidth quota.
            *   `--max-connections-per-ip`: Maximum simultaneous connections from a single IP address.
            *   `--max-allocate-lifetime`: Maximum lifetime of a TURN allocation.
        4.  **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously monitor coturn's logs (`--log-file`, `--syslog`) for blocked requests due to rate limiting.  Gradually increase limits *only as needed*, based on legitimate user needs.
        5.  **Realm-Specific Limits:** If using multiple realms (`realm` option in `turnserver.conf`), configure different rate limits for each realm, reflecting varying trust levels and usage expectations.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **DoS/DDoS Amplification Attacks (UDP Reflection):** (Severity: High) - Limits the bandwidth and connection resources an attacker can exploit for amplification.
        *   **Unauthorized Relay Usage (Theft of Service):** (Severity: Medium) - Limits the resources a single unauthorized user can consume.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents users (legitimate or malicious) from exhausting server resources managed by coturn.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS/DDoS Amplification:** High reduction in risk.  Properly configured rate limiting within coturn is *essential*.
        *   **Unauthorized Relay Usage:** Medium reduction in risk.  Limits the damage, but authentication is the primary defense.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** High reduction in risk.  Prevents resource starvation within coturn.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `turnserver.conf`:  All mentioned rate limiting and connection limiting options (`max-bps`, `user-quota`, `quota`, `max-connections-per-ip`, `max-allocate-lifetime`) are directly configurable within coturn.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Dynamic Rate Limiting: coturn does not natively support dynamic adjustment of these limits based on real-time conditions. This would require external scripting and is *not* a direct coturn feature.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Authentication and Authorization (coturn-native)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_authentication_and_authorization__coturn-native_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strong Authentication and Authorization (coturn-native)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Disable Anonymous Access:** Ensure that the `--no-auth` option is *not* present or is explicitly set to disable anonymous relaying in `turnserver.conf`.
        2.  **Choose Authentication Method:**
            *   **Long-Term Credentials:** Use strong, unique passwords for each user, configured in the user database (e.g., `--userdb`).
            *   **Short-Lived Credentials:**  Enable short-lived credential mechanism using `--lt-cred-mech`. This requires an external mechanism (like a REST API) to *generate* the credentials, but coturn handles the *validation*.
        3.  **Realm Configuration:** Define realms using the `realm` option in `turnserver.conf` to segment users and apply different access policies (including different rate limits, as described above).
        4. Use `--user` option to run coturn as non-root user.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Relay Usage (Theft of Service):** (Severity: High) - Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the relay service.
        *   **Credential-Based Attacks (Partial):** (Severity: Medium) - While coturn doesn't directly handle account lockout or 2FA, strong passwords and short-lived credentials reduce the impact of credential stuffing and brute-force attacks.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Relay Usage:** High reduction in risk.  Authentication is the *primary* defense against unauthorized access within coturn.
        *   **Credential-Based Attacks:** Medium reduction in risk.  Reduces the effectiveness of attacks, but external systems are needed for full mitigation (e.g., account lockout).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `turnserver.conf`:  Supports authentication with long-term credentials (`--userdb`), short-lived credentials (`--lt-cred-mech`), and realm configuration (`realm`).
        * `--user`: Supports running as non-root user.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):  Not a native coturn feature.
        *   Account Lockout:  Not a native coturn feature.
        *   Automated Credential Rotation:  Not a native coturn feature (for long-term credentials).

## Mitigation Strategy: [IP Address Filtering (coturn-native)](./mitigation_strategies/ip_address_filtering__coturn-native_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  IP Address Filtering (coturn-native)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Trusted IPs:** Determine the IP addresses or ranges of legitimate clients that should be allowed to access the coturn server.
        2.  **Identify Untrusted IPs:** If possible, identify IP addresses or ranges known to be associated with malicious activity.
        3.  **Configure `turnserver.conf`:**
            *   `--allowed-peer-ip`:  Specify allowed IP addresses or ranges.
            *   `--denied-peer-ip`:  Specify denied IP addresses or ranges.
        4.  **Prioritize Allow Rules:**  Generally, it's more secure to use `--allowed-peer-ip` to explicitly whitelist trusted IPs, rather than relying solely on `--denied-peer-ip`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** (Severity: Medium to High) - Prevents access from untrusted IP addresses.  Effectiveness depends on the ability to accurately identify trusted IPs.
        *   **DoS/DDoS Attacks (Partial):** (Severity: Medium) - Can help block attacks from known malicious sources, but rate limiting is still essential.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Medium to High reduction in risk, depending on the feasibility of IP whitelisting.
        *   **DoS/DDoS Attacks:** Low to Medium reduction in risk.  Provides some protection, but is not a primary defense.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `turnserver.conf`:  `--allowed-peer-ip` and `--denied-peer-ip` options are directly supported.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Dynamic IP Filtering:  coturn does not natively support dynamic updates to these lists based on real-time threat intelligence.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure TLS Configuration (coturn-native)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_tls_configuration__coturn-native_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure TLS Configuration (coturn-native)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Obtain Valid Certificate:** (External step, but required for coturn's TLS) Obtain a valid TLS certificate from a trusted CA.
        2.  **Configure `turnserver.conf`:**
            *   `--cert`:  Specify the path to the TLS certificate file.
            *   `--pkey`:  Specify the path to the TLS private key file.
            *   `--tls-listening-port`:  Enable the TLS listening port (e.g., 5349).
            *   `--cipher-list`:  Specify a list of *strong* TLS cipher suites.  Disable weak or outdated ciphers. Consult current best practices for cipher suite selection (e.g., Mozilla's recommendations).
            *   `--no-tlsv1`, `--no-tlsv1_1`, etc.: Disable older, less secure TLS versions as appropriate.
        3. **Disable Unnecessary Features:** If you don't need TCP relaying, disable it (`--no-tcp-relay`).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (on TLS connections):** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from intercepting and decrypting TLS-encrypted traffic.
        *   **Eavesdropping (on TLS connections):** (Severity: High) - Protects the confidentiality of data.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **MITM Attacks:** High reduction in risk.  Proper TLS configuration within coturn is *essential*.
        *   **Eavesdropping:** High reduction in risk.  Ensures confidentiality.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `turnserver.conf`:  All mentioned TLS configuration options (`--cert`, `--pkey`, `--tls-listening-port`, `--cipher-list`, `--no-tlsv1*`) are directly supported.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automated Certificate Renewal:  Not a native coturn feature.
        *   OCSP Stapling Configuration:  While the underlying OpenSSL library *might* support it, coturn may not have explicit, dedicated configuration options.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Feature Disabling](./mitigation_strategies/feature_disabling.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Feature Disabling

    * **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Required Features:** Determine the minimum set of coturn features required for your use case.  For example, if you only need STUN, disable TURN. If you don't need TCP relaying, disable it.
        2.  **Configure `turnserver.conf`:**
            *   `--no-turn`: Disable TURN functionality.
            *   `--no-tcp`: Disable TCP listening.
            *   `--no-tcp-relay`: Disable TCP relaying.
            *   `--no-udp`: Disable UDP listening (use only if you *only* need TCP).
            *   `--no-dtls`: Disable DTLS.
            *   `--no-tls`: Disable TLS.
        3.  **Minimize Configuration:**  Remove any unnecessary configuration options from `turnserver.conf`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Unused Features:** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the attack surface by disabling features that could contain vulnerabilities.
        *   **Resource Consumption:** (Severity: Low) - Reduces the resources (CPU, memory) consumed by coturn.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Unused Features:** Medium reduction in risk.  The fewer features enabled, the smaller the attack surface.
        *   **Resource Consumption:** Low reduction in risk, but can improve performance.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `turnserver.conf`:  All mentioned feature disabling options (`--no-turn`, `--no-tcp`, `--no-tcp-relay`, `--no-udp`, `--no-dtls`, `--no-tls`) are directly supported.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   None. This strategy is fully implemented through existing configuration options.
