## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Audit coturn Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_audit_coturn_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Review and Audit coturn Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule Regular Reviews:** Establish a recurring schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly) to review the `turnserver.conf` file.
    2.  **Document Configuration Intent:** For each configuration parameter in `turnserver.conf`, add comments explaining its purpose and security implications.
    3.  **Version Control Configuration:** Store `turnserver.conf` in a version control system (like Git) alongside your application code.
    4.  **Automated Configuration Checks (Optional):**  Consider using configuration management tools to automate the deployment and validation of your coturn configuration.
    5.  **Security Audit Checklist:** Create a checklist of security-related configuration parameters to review during each audit.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfiguration (High Severity):** Incorrectly configured coturn can lead to vulnerabilities like open relays, unauthorized access, and denial of service.
    *   **Configuration Drift (Medium Severity):** Over time, configurations can drift from intended secure states, introducing vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfiguration:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring the configuration aligns with security best practices.
    *   **Configuration Drift:**  Significantly reduces the risk by proactively identifying and correcting configuration deviations.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Configuration is version controlled in Git.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Regular scheduled reviews and a security audit checklist are not formally implemented. Documentation of configuration intent within `turnserver.conf` is incomplete.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Principle of Least Privilege for User Permissions](./mitigation_strategies/implement_principle_of_least_privilege_for_user_permissions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Principle of Least Privilege for User Permissions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define User Roles (Coturn Users):** Identify different user roles that interact directly with coturn's user database (if used).
    2.  **Grant Minimal Permissions:** For each coturn user role, grant only the necessary permissions required. Avoid overly permissive configurations.
    3.  **Restrict User Database Access:** Limit access to the coturn server's user database file and management tools to authorized administrators only.
    4.  **Regularly Review User Permissions:** Periodically review coturn user permissions to ensure they remain aligned with the principle of least privilege.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):**  Overly permissive coturn user permissions can allow unauthorized users to access and abuse coturn resources.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):**  If a less privileged coturn user account is compromised, excessive permissions can allow attackers to escalate their privileges within coturn.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the scope of access for each coturn user.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Reduces the risk by limiting the potential damage from compromised coturn user accounts.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic user roles are considered, but fine-grained coturn user permissions are not fully utilized.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal definition of coturn user roles and granular permission management within coturn is missing. Regular reviews of coturn user permissions are not automated or scheduled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Features and Protocols](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_features_and_protocols.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unnecessary Features and Protocols
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Feature and Protocol Inventory (Coturn):** Create an inventory of all coturn features and protocols enabled in your configuration.
    2.  **Requirement Analysis (Coturn):** For each coturn feature and protocol, analyze if it is strictly required for your application's functionality *through coturn*.
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary Components in `turnserver.conf`:** In `turnserver.conf`, disable any features or protocols that are not required by commenting out or removing relevant configuration lines.
    4.  **Regular Review of Enabled Features (Coturn):** During configuration audits, re-evaluate the necessity of each enabled coturn feature and protocol.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface (Medium Severity):** Unnecessary coturn features and protocols increase the attack surface of the coturn server itself.
    *   **Misconfiguration Risks (Medium Severity):**  More coturn features mean more configuration options within `turnserver.conf`, increasing the chance of misconfiguration and vulnerabilities in coturn.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface:** Moderately reduces the risk by eliminating potential attack vectors from unused coturn features.
    *   **Misconfiguration Risks:** Moderately reduces the risk by simplifying the coturn configuration and reducing complexity.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. TCP is disabled as the application primarily uses UDP through coturn.
*   **Missing Implementation:** A formal inventory of coturn features and protocols and a systematic review to disable unused components within `turnserver.conf` are missing. TLS is still enabled even though DTLS is the primary secure transport for media relayed by coturn.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Listening Interfaces](./mitigation_strategies/secure_listening_interfaces.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Listening Interfaces
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Interfaces (Coturn):** Determine the specific network interfaces and IP addresses that coturn needs to listen on to serve your application.
    2.  **Bind to Specific Interfaces in `turnserver.conf`:** In `turnserver.conf`, configure the `listening-device` and `listening-port` parameters to bind coturn only to the identified interfaces and ports. Avoid binding to `0.0.0.0` unless absolutely necessary.
    3.  **Firewall Rules (for Coturn Ports):** Configure firewalls (host-based and network firewalls) to restrict access to coturn ports (3478, 5349, etc.) only from trusted networks or IP ranges.
    4.  **Network Segmentation (for Coturn Server):** If your infrastructure is segmented, deploy the coturn server within a network segment that is appropriately isolated and secured.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **External Exposure (High Severity):** Binding coturn to `0.0.0.0` or allowing unrestricted access through firewalls exposes coturn to the entire internet.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Medium Severity):**  Open listening interfaces can allow unauthorized clients or attackers to attempt to connect to coturn directly.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **External Exposure:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting coturn's visibility and accessibility from untrusted networks.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Moderately reduces the risk by controlling network access to coturn services.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Coturn is bound to a specific internal network interface. Host-based firewall is enabled on the coturn server.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Network firewall rules are not strictly defined to limit access to coturn ports to only necessary sources. Binding to `0.0.0.0` is still used for simplicity, needs to be reviewed and changed to specific IPs for coturn.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Authentication Mechanisms](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_authentication_mechanisms.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong Authentication Mechanisms
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Strong Authentication (Coturn):** Select a robust authentication method for TURN users within coturn's configuration. Options include:
        *   **Token-based Authentication (Coturn):** Utilize coturn's token-based authentication if supported and suitable.
        *   **Secure Password Generation and Storage (Coturn):** If using username/password authentication in coturn, configure strong password policies and ensure coturn uses secure password hashing.
    2.  **Disable Weak Authentication (Coturn):** If coturn offers weaker authentication methods, disable them in the `turnserver.conf` configuration.
    3.  **Regularly Rotate Credentials (Coturn):** For password-based authentication in coturn, enforce regular password rotation policies. For token-based authentication, ensure tokens have short expiry times as configured in coturn.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Compromise (High Severity):**  Weak or default coturn credentials are easily compromised, allowing unauthorized access to coturn and potential abuse.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Weak coturn passwords are vulnerable to brute-force attacks against coturn's authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Replay Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Long-lived or easily guessable coturn credentials can be replayed by attackers to access coturn.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Compromise:** Significantly reduces the risk by making coturn credentials harder to guess or compromise.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Moderately reduces the risk by increasing the difficulty of brute-force attempts against coturn.
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Moderately reduces the risk by limiting the lifespan of coturn credentials (tokens).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Username/password authentication is used with password complexity requirements enforced at the application level *before* interacting with coturn. Coturn itself is configured for basic username/password.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Token-based authentication within coturn is not implemented. Password rotation policies are not enforced for coturn users specifically *within coturn's configuration*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Authorization Policies](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_authorization_policies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Robust Authorization Policies
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Authorization Rules (Coturn):** Clearly define rules within your application and potentially coturn configuration (if possible) that determine which users or applications are authorized to allocate TURN relays *through coturn* and for what purposes.
    2.  **Enforce Authorization in Application (Pre-Coturn):** Implement authorization checks within your application *before* requesting TURN credentials from coturn.
    3.  **Coturn Configuration for Authorization (Limited):** Explore coturn configuration options that might offer some level of authorization control (e.g., user-based restrictions, though coturn's authorization is generally simpler).
    4.  **Regularly Review and Update Policies:** Periodically review and update authorization policies related to coturn usage.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Relay Allocation (High Severity):**  Lack of proper authorization can allow unauthorized users or applications to allocate TURN relays *through coturn*, potentially leading to abuse or resource exhaustion of the coturn server.
    *   **Open Relay Abuse (High Severity):** If authorization is not properly enforced, coturn can be misused as an open relay for malicious traffic *via unauthorized allocations*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Relay Allocation:** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing unauthorized allocation of coturn TURN resources.
    *   **Open Relay Abuse:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring that coturn is used only for intended and authorized purposes.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic authorization checks are performed within the application *before* interacting with coturn based on user roles.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Fine-grained authorization policies within coturn's configuration itself are not fully explored or implemented (coturn's authorization capabilities are simpler than application-level). Authorization policies related to coturn usage are not formally documented or regularly reviewed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Usage Quotas](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_usage_quotas.md)

    4.  **Coturn Configuration for Resource Limits:** Configure coturn with resource limits using parameters like `max-bps`, `total-quota`, `max-allocations`, etc. in `turnserver.conf`.
    5.  **Monitoring and Alerting (Coturn):** Monitor coturn resource usage and rate limiting metrics. Set up alerts to notify administrators when coturn rate limits or quotas are being approached or exceeded *at the coturn server level*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):**  Attackers can flood coturn with allocation requests, overwhelming the coturn server itself and causing denial of service.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Uncontrolled usage can lead to resource exhaustion (bandwidth, memory, CPU) *on the coturn server*, impacting coturn's performance and availability.
    *   **Abuse and Overspending (Medium Severity):**  Lack of quotas can lead to unintended or malicious overconsumption of coturn TURN resources, potentially increasing costs *associated with coturn operation*.
*   **Impact:**

*   **Missing Implementation:** Usage quotas are not fully implemented *in conjunction with coturn's capabilities*. Coturn's built-in resource limits like `max-bps` and `total-quota` are not configured. Monitoring and alerting for rate limiting and resource usage *at the coturn server level* are not fully set up.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Relay Domain Restrictions](./mitigation_strategies/implement_relay_domain_restrictions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Relay Domain Restrictions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Allowed Domains/IPs (for Coturn Relays):** Identify the specific domains or IP ranges that your application's users are expected to communicate with via TURN relays *through coturn*.
    2.  **Configure `relay-domain` (Coturn):** Use the `relay-domain` or similar parameters in `turnserver.conf` to restrict relay allocation to only the defined domains or IP ranges *as enforced by coturn*.
    3.  **Application-Level Enforcement (Complementary):** Implement checks in your application to ensure that users are only attempting to connect to allowed destinations via TURN, *complementing coturn's restrictions*.
    4.  **Network Firewall Rules (for Coturn Outbound):**  Use network firewall rules to further restrict outbound traffic *from coturn servers* to only the allowed destination domains or IP ranges.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Open Relay Abuse (High Severity):** Without domain restrictions *enforced by coturn*, coturn can be misused as an open relay for arbitrary traffic, including malicious activities.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Medium Severity):**  If not restricted *at the coturn level*, compromised accounts or malicious insiders could potentially use coturn to exfiltrate data to unauthorized destinations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Open Relay Abuse:** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing coturn from being used for unintended and potentially malicious purposes *by coturn itself enforcing restrictions*.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Moderately reduces the risk by limiting the destinations that can be reached through coturn *as enforced by coturn*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. No domain or IP restrictions are currently in place for TURN relays *at the coturn level*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** `relay-domain` configuration in `turnserver.conf` is not used. Application-level enforcement of destination restrictions is missing *in coordination with coturn's potential restrictions*. Network firewall rules are not configured to restrict outbound traffic *from coturn servers* based on destination domains.
