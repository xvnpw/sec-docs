## Project Design Document: coturn - Open Source TURN and STUN Server

**1. Introduction**

This document provides an in-depth design overview of the coturn project, a robust and widely-used open-source implementation of a TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) and STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) server. This detailed description of the system's architecture, core components, and data flow is essential for conducting thorough threat modeling and security assessments.

coturn plays a crucial role in enabling real-time communication (RTC) for applications operating behind Network Address Translation (NAT) firewalls. It facilitates NAT traversal by allowing clients to discover their public IP address and port (STUN) and, when direct peer-to-peer connections are not feasible, to relay media streams through the coturn server (TURN).

**2. Goals and Objectives**

*   To offer a highly reliable and performant implementation of the TURN and STUN protocols, adhering to relevant standards.
*   To provide comprehensive support for various transport protocols, including UDP, TCP, TLS (for secure TCP), and DTLS (for secure UDP).
*   To implement flexible and robust authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access and prevent unauthorized relaying.
*   To enable efficient allocation, management, and recycling of relay resources (IP addresses and ports).
*   To provide detailed and configurable logging and monitoring capabilities for operational insights and troubleshooting.
*   To maintain a secure, well-documented, and actively developed codebase, addressing security vulnerabilities promptly.

**3. Target Audience**

This document is specifically intended for:

*   Security engineers tasked with performing threat modeling, penetration testing, and security audits of systems incorporating coturn.
*   Software architects and developers responsible for integrating coturn into their communication platforms and applications.
*   System administrators and DevOps engineers who deploy, configure, manage, and monitor coturn server instances in production environments.

**4. Scope**

This document comprehensively covers the core functionalities and internal workings of the coturn server, including:

*   Implementation of the STUN protocol for NAT type discovery and endpoint mapping.
*   Implementation of the TURN protocol for allocating relay addresses and relaying media traffic.
*   Mechanisms for user authentication and authorization to control access to TURN relay services.
*   Management of relay resources, including allocation, deallocation, and tracking of active sessions.
*   Handling of network interfaces and processing of incoming and outgoing network packets.
*   Detailed logging of server activities, including authentication attempts, allocation requests, and error conditions.

This document explicitly excludes details related to:

*   Specific client-side implementations, libraries, or Software Development Kits (SDKs) that interact with coturn.
*   Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scripts or configuration management tools used for deploying and managing coturn.

**5. High-Level Architecture**

The coturn server acts as a crucial intermediary, situated on the public internet, facilitating communication between clients that are often located behind NAT firewalls. Clients initially utilize STUN to ascertain their externally visible IP address and port. When direct peer-to-peer connectivity is not possible due to NAT restrictions, clients request the coturn server to allocate relay resources, enabling media traffic to be routed through the server.

**7. Data Flow**

A typical data flow scenario for a client utilizing coturn involves the following sequence of interactions:

*   **STUN Binding Request:** A client behind a NAT sends a STUN Binding Request to the coturn server to determine its external IP address and port as seen by the public internet.
*   **STUN Binding Response:** The coturn server responds with a STUN Binding Response containing the client's mapped public IP address and port.
*   **TURN Allocate Request:** If a direct peer-to-peer connection is not possible, the client sends a TURN Allocate Request to the coturn server, requesting the allocation of a relay address. This request includes the client's authentication credentials.
*   **Authentication Process:** The coturn server's Authentication Module verifies the client's identity using the provided credentials against the configured authentication mechanism and the data stored in the Database.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Upon successful authentication, the Resource Manager allocates a relay address (an IP address and port) and associates it with the requesting client.
*   **TURN Allocate Response:** The coturn server sends a TURN Allocate Response back to the client, containing the details of the allocated relay address.
*   **Create Permission (Optional):** The client may send CreatePermission requests to authorize specific peer clients to send data to its allocated relay address. This adds a layer of security and control.
*   **Sending Media to Relay:** Clients send their media packets to the allocated relay address on the coturn server.
*   **Relaying Media:** The coturn server's Relay Engine receives the media packets and forwards them to the intended recipient(s) based on the established permissions associated with the relay allocation.

**8. Security Considerations (Detailed)**

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   Employing strong and well-vetted authentication mechanisms is paramount to prevent unauthorized access and relay usage.
    *   Proper authorization controls are necessary to ensure that only authenticated clients can allocate and use relay resources.
    *   Consideration should be given to protecting the credentials stored in the database against unauthorized access.
*   **Transport Security (TLS and DTLS):**
    *   Enforcing TLS for TCP-based communication and DTLS for UDP-based communication is crucial to protect the confidentiality and integrity of STUN and TURN control messages, as well as relayed media.
    *   Proper configuration of TLS/DTLS certificates and cipher suites is essential.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Protection:**
    *   Implementing rate limiting on incoming requests can help mitigate DoS attacks.
    *   Consideration should be given to strategies for handling large volumes of malicious traffic.
    *   Deployment behind a DDoS mitigation service can provide additional protection.
*   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:**
    *   While coturn primarily relays end-to-end encrypted media streams (e.g., using SRTP), the security of the TURN control channel itself is vital.
    *   Ensuring the integrity of relayed data is important, although typically handled by the end-to-end encryption.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Strict validation of all incoming data, including STUN and TURN messages, is necessary to prevent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string bugs, and other injection attacks.
*   **Secure Configuration Practices:**
    *   Default configurations should be secure, and administrators should be provided with clear guidance on hardening the server.
    *   Regular security audits of the configuration are recommended.
*   **Regular Updates and Patching:**
    *   Maintaining the coturn server and its dependencies with the latest security patches is crucial to address known vulnerabilities promptly.
    *   A robust vulnerability management process is essential.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**
    *   Mechanisms should be in place to prevent malicious actors from exhausting server resources (e.g., by allocating a large number of relays).
    *   Implementing resource quotas and limits per user or session can help mitigate this.

**9. Deployment Considerations**

*   coturn exhibits cross-platform compatibility and can be deployed on various operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.
*   Deployment options include running as a standalone system service or within containerized environments such as Docker and Kubernetes, facilitating scalability and management.
*   Extensive configuration options allow for customization of listening ports, authentication methods, database connection details, logging configurations, and resource limits.
*   Scalability can be achieved by deploying multiple coturn instances behind a load balancer, distributing traffic and ensuring high availability.
*   Monitoring tools and techniques should be implemented to track server performance, resource utilization, and identify potential issues.

**10. Assumptions and Constraints**

*   It is assumed that client implementations of the STUN and TURN protocols adhere strictly to the specifications outlined in the relevant RFC documents.
*   The underlying network infrastructure is assumed to permit UDP and TCP traffic on the configured ports, and that firewalls are configured appropriately to allow necessary communication.
*   The host operating system and hardware are assumed to provide sufficient resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to handle the anticipated load on the coturn server.
*   Best practices for system security are assumed to be followed during the deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance of the coturn server.
