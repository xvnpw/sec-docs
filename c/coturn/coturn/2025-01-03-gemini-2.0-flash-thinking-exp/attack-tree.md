## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_(cves).md)

**Attack Vector:**
- The attacker researches publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) affecting the specific version of Coturn used by the application.
- They identify a vulnerability that allows for remote code execution, privilege escalation, or denial of service.
- The attacker crafts a malicious request or payload that exploits this vulnerability.
- This payload is sent to the Coturn server.
- If successful, the attacker gains unauthorized control over the Coturn server or disrupts its operation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow.md)

**Attack Vector:**
- The attacker identifies an input field or function in Coturn that is susceptible to buffer overflows.
- They craft an input that exceeds the allocated buffer size for this field.
- This overflow overwrites adjacent memory locations, potentially including critical data or execution pointers.
- By carefully crafting the overflowing data, the attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code on the Coturn server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

**Attack Vector:**
- The attacker attempts to log in to Coturn using default credentials (e.g., admin/password) or commonly used weak passwords.
- This can be done through the administrative interface (if exposed) or through API calls if authentication is required.
- If successful, the attacker gains administrative access to the Coturn server, allowing them to reconfigure it, access sensitive information, or disrupt its operation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use of Weak Ciphers (within Insecure TLS/DTLS Configuration)](./attack_tree_paths/use_of_weak_ciphers_(within_insecure_tlsdtls_configuration).md)

**Attack Vector:**
- The Coturn server is configured to allow the use of weak or outdated cryptographic ciphers for TLS/DTLS encryption.
- The attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on the communication channel between clients and the Coturn server.
- Due to the weak ciphers, the attacker can break the encryption relatively easily using cryptanalysis techniques or readily available tools.
- This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on media streams, intercept credentials, or potentially modify communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Authentication Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_authentication_mechanisms.md)

**Attack Vector:**
- The authentication mechanism used by Coturn has inherent weaknesses (e.g., lack of nonce, susceptibility to replay attacks, predictable session tokens).
- **Replay Attack Scenario:** The attacker intercepts a valid authentication request or session token. They then resend this captured request or token to gain unauthorized access at a later time.
- **Lack of Nonce Scenario:**  The authentication process doesn't use a unique, unpredictable value for each request, making it vulnerable to replay attacks.
- By exploiting these weaknesses, the attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to Coturn's functionalities or media streams.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Session Credentials (within Unauthorized Access to Media Streams)](./attack_tree_paths/steal_session_credentials_(within_unauthorized_access_to_media_streams).md)

**Attack Vector:**
- The attacker employs various techniques to obtain valid session credentials used to access media streams facilitated by Coturn.
- **Phishing:** The attacker tricks legitimate users into revealing their credentials through fake login pages or emails.
- **Malware:** The attacker infects a user's device with malware that steals session credentials stored in memory or configuration files.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker manipulates users into revealing their credentials through deception.
- Once the attacker obtains valid session credentials, they can use them to connect to the Coturn server and access media streams without proper authorization.
