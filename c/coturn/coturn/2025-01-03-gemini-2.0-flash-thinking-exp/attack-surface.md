# Attack Surface Analysis for coturn/coturn

## Attack Surface: [Publicly Accessible Ports](./attack_surfaces/publicly_accessible_ports.md)

**How CoTURN Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CoTURN, by design, needs to listen on public network interfaces (typically UDP and TCP ports) to receive connection requests and relay media traffic. This makes it a direct target for network-based attacks.

**Example:** An attacker on the internet can directly send UDP packets to CoTURN's listening port (e.g., 3478) attempting to exploit potential vulnerabilities or cause a denial of service.

**Impact:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion, potential exploitation of underlying vulnerabilities in the network stack or CoTURN itself.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement network firewalls to restrict access to CoTURN ports from only necessary IP ranges or networks.
* Utilize intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor traffic for malicious patterns.
* Consider running CoTURN behind a load balancer or reverse proxy for added protection and traffic management.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Brute-forceable Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_brute-forceable_authentication.md)

**How CoTURN Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CoTURN relies on authentication mechanisms (e.g., shared secrets, username/password) to verify clients before allowing them to use its services. Weak or easily guessable credentials expose the server to unauthorized access.

**Example:** An attacker attempts to brute-force the shared secret used for TURN authentication, gaining unauthorized access to relay services and potentially intercepting or manipulating media streams.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to relay services, potential interception or manipulation of media streams, resource abuse.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies for username/password authentication.
* Use long and randomly generated shared secrets.
* Implement rate limiting on authentication attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
* Consider using more robust authentication methods like token-based authentication (if supported and integrated).

## Attack Surface: [Protocol-Specific Vulnerabilities (STUN/TURN)](./attack_surfaces/protocol-specific_vulnerabilities_(stunturn).md)

**How CoTURN Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CoTURN implements the STUN and TURN protocols. Vulnerabilities within the CoTURN implementation of these protocols can be exploited by attackers sending specially crafted requests.

**Example:** A vulnerability in CoTURN's handling of certain STUN attributes could be exploited to cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to remote code execution.

**Impact:** Service disruption, potential remote code execution on the CoTURN server, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if remote code execution is possible), High (for other exploitable vulnerabilities)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep CoTURN updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Regularly review CoTURN's changelogs and security advisories.
* Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the CoTURN deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/DTLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsdtls_configuration.md)

**How CoTURN Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CoTURN supports secure communication using TLS (for TCP) and DTLS (for UDP). Misconfigurations or the use of weak ciphers can weaken the encryption, making it susceptible to interception.

**Example:** CoTURN is configured to use an outdated TLS version or a weak cipher suite, allowing an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and decrypt the communication between clients and the server.

**Impact:** Exposure of authentication credentials, interception of media streams, potential manipulation of communication.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure CoTURN to use strong and up-to-date TLS/DTLS versions and cipher suites.
* Disable support for older, insecure protocols and ciphers.
* Ensure proper certificate management and validation.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_(dos)_through_resource_exhaustion.md)

**How CoTURN Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CoTURN consumes system resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) to handle client requests and relay media. Attackers can exploit this by sending a large number of requests, overwhelming the server.

**Example:** An attacker sends a flood of connection requests or allocates a large number of relay ports, exhausting CoTURN's resources and preventing legitimate users from connecting.

**Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting the application's functionality that relies on CoTURN.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on connection requests and relay allocations within CoTURN's configuration.
* Configure resource limits within the operating system and CoTURN.
* Deploy CoTURN behind a DDoS mitigation service.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration Leading to Open Relays](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_leading_to_open_relays.md)

**How CoTURN Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Incorrect CoTURN configuration might allow unauthorized users to utilize the server as an open relay, potentially for malicious purposes.

**Example:** CoTURN is configured without proper authentication or authorization, allowing any internet user to request relay allocations and potentially use the server to anonymize malicious traffic or launch attacks.

**Impact:** Abuse of server resources, potential involvement in malicious activities, reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure proper authentication and authorization are configured for all relay functionalities.
* Regularly review CoTURN's configuration to prevent unintended open relay scenarios.
* Monitor CoTURN's usage for any suspicious activity.
