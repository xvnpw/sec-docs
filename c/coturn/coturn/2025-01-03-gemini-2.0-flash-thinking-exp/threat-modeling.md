# Threat Model Analysis for coturn/coturn

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Weak or Default Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to the coturn server's administrative interface or authenticate as a TURN user using default or easily guessable credentials. This could be achieved through brute-force attacks or by exploiting known default credentials *within the coturn software itself if such defaults exist*.
    *   **Impact:** If successful, the attacker gains unauthorized administrative access to the coturn server, allowing them to reconfigure the server, monitor traffic, or disrupt services. Alternatively, gaining access as a TURN user allows them to relay arbitrary traffic.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication module, potentially the administrative interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all administrative and user accounts.
        *   Change default administrative credentials immediately after installation.
        *   Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts.
        *   Consider multi-factor authentication for administrative access.

## Threat: [Insecure Secret Management](./threats/insecure_secret_management.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Secret Management
    *   **Description:** The shared secret used for TURN authentication (e.g., for `lt-cred-mech`) is stored insecurely *due to coturn's default behavior or insecure configuration options*. An attacker who gains access to these secrets can impersonate legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can authenticate as valid users and abuse the TURN server to relay malicious traffic or exhaust resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication module, configuration loading mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store shared secrets securely using environment variables, secrets management systems (like HashiCorp Vault), or encrypted configuration files.
        *   Avoid hardcoding secrets directly in the application code.
        *   Implement proper access controls on configuration files.

## Threat: [Relay Resource Exhaustion](./threats/relay_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Relay Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits the way coturn manages relay resources to establish a large number of relay sessions, consuming available ports, bandwidth, and other resources on the coturn server. This could be due to insufficient resource limits or vulnerabilities in the resource allocation logic *within coturn*.
    *   **Impact:** Legitimate users are unable to establish new relay sessions, leading to a denial of service. The coturn server's performance may degrade significantly.
    *   **Affected Component:** TURN relay functionality, resource management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on relay requests per user or IP address.
        *   Configure maximum limits on the number of relay sessions.
        *   Monitor resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        *   Implement mechanisms to identify and terminate abusive sessions.

## Threat: [Software Vulnerabilities in coturn](./threats/software_vulnerabilities_in_coturn.md)

*   **Threat:** Software Vulnerabilities in coturn
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the coturn server software itself. This could include buffer overflows, remote code execution flaws, or other security weaknesses *within the coturn codebase*.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain complete control of the coturn server, potentially compromising sensitive data, disrupting services, or using the server as a launchpad for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various modules and functions depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep coturn updated to the latest stable version, which includes security patches.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories related to coturn.
        *   Implement a robust patch management process.
        *   Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) or intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) to detect and block known exploits.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the underlying libraries or operating system components that coturn relies on. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the coturn server. *While not strictly *within* coturn's code, it's a direct dependency impacting its security.*
    *   **Impact:** Similar to software vulnerabilities in coturn itself, this could lead to server compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Underlying libraries and operating system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the operating system and all dependent libraries.
        *   Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify and address potential issues in dependencies.
        *   Follow security best practices for the underlying operating system.

## Threat: [Configuration Errors Leading to Exposure](./threats/configuration_errors_leading_to_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** Configuration Errors Leading to Exposure
    *   **Description:** Misconfiguration of the coturn server *due to unclear documentation or insecure default settings within coturn* exposes it to unintended risks. This could involve open ports, insecure listening interfaces, or incorrect security settings.
    *   **Impact:** An incorrectly configured server might be more vulnerable to various attacks, such as unauthorized access, relay abuse, or information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration loading and processing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the specific misconfiguration).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and understand all configuration options.
        *   Follow security best practices for coturn configuration.
        *   Use configuration management tools to ensure consistent and secure configurations.
        *   Regularly audit the coturn configuration.
