# Threat Model Analysis for coturn/coturn

## Threat: [Weak or Default Shared Secrets](./threats/weak_or_default_shared_secrets.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to guess or obtain the shared secret used for authentication between the application and the coturn server. This could be done through brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, or by exploiting insecure storage of the secret. If successful, the attacker can impersonate the application or legitimate users when communicating with coturn.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to coturn resources, ability to relay malicious traffic, potential for denial of service by exhausting resources, and eavesdropping on or manipulation of media streams.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module (specifically the shared secret verification process).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use strong, randomly generated shared secrets with sufficient length and complexity.
* Implement secure storage mechanisms for shared secrets, avoiding hardcoding or storing in plain text.
* Regularly rotate shared secrets.

## Threat: [TURN Server Impersonation](./threats/turn_server_impersonation.md)

**Description:** An attacker sets up a rogue TURN server that mimics the legitimate coturn server. The application, due to misconfiguration or a compromised configuration, connects to this malicious server instead. The attacker can then intercept media streams and potentially manipulate them.

**Impact:** Interception and potential manipulation of sensitive media streams (audio/video), information disclosure, and potential for further attacks by controlling the communication path.

**Affected Component:** Client Communication Module (how the application discovers and connects to the TURN server).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust mechanisms for verifying the identity of the TURN server, such as using TLS certificates and verifying the server's hostname or IP address.
* Securely configure the application with the correct TURN server address and credentials.
* Employ mutual authentication where both the client and server verify each other's identities.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Media Streams](./threats/unencrypted_media_streams.md)

**Description:** While the control channel between the application and coturn might be encrypted (e.g., using TLS), the actual media streams relayed through coturn might not be end-to-end encrypted. An attacker on the network path can intercept and eavesdrop on these unencrypted media streams.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive audio and video communication.

**Affected Component:** Relay Module (specifically the handling of media packets).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that end-to-end encryption is implemented for media streams, independent of the TURN server. Technologies like SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) should be used.
* Configure coturn to enforce the use of secure transport protocols for media relaying if possible.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Media Streams via TURN Server](./threats/manipulation_of_media_streams_via_turn_server.md)

**Description:** An attacker who has gained unauthorized access to the coturn server or is positioned on the network path could potentially intercept and modify the media packets being relayed. This could involve altering audio or video content.

**Impact:** Integrity compromise of media streams, potentially leading to misinformation, disruption of communication, or malicious content injection.

**Affected Component:** Relay Module (specifically the handling and forwarding of media packets).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement end-to-end integrity protection for media streams, such as using secure protocols with built-in integrity checks.
* Secure the coturn server itself to prevent unauthorized access.
* Monitor network traffic for anomalies that might indicate media stream manipulation.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the coturn server with a large number of connection requests or media relay requests, consuming its resources (bandwidth, CPU, memory) and making it unavailable for legitimate users.

**Impact:** Inability for legitimate users to establish connections or relay media, leading to service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Connection Handling Module, Relay Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on connection requests and media relay requests.
* Configure resource limits on the coturn server to prevent excessive consumption.
* Deploy coturn in an environment with sufficient resources to handle expected traffic and potential spikes.
* Utilize techniques like SYN cookies to mitigate SYN flood attacks.

## Threat: [Insecure Management Interface](./threats/insecure_management_interface.md)

**Description:** If coturn's management interface (if enabled) is not properly secured with strong authentication, authorization, and encryption (e.g., HTTPS), an attacker could gain unauthorized access and potentially reconfigure the server, leading to a complete compromise.

**Impact:** Full control over the coturn server, allowing the attacker to disrupt service, intercept traffic, or use the server for malicious purposes.

**Affected Component:** Management Interface Module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Disable the management interface if it's not required.
* If the management interface is necessary, ensure it is only accessible over HTTPS with strong TLS configuration.
* Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the management interface, avoiding default credentials.
* Restrict access to the management interface to authorized IP addresses or networks.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in coturn Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_coturn_dependencies.md)

**Description:** coturn relies on various underlying libraries and dependencies (e.g., OpenSSL). If vulnerabilities exist in these dependencies, they could be exploited to compromise the coturn server.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or other forms of compromise.

**Affected Component:** Various modules depending on the vulnerable dependency.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep coturn and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Regularly monitor security advisories for coturn and its dependencies.
* Implement a vulnerability management process to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
