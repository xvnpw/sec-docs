# Attack Surface Analysis for coturn/coturn

## Attack Surface: [Publicly Accessible STUN/TURN Ports](./attack_surfaces/publicly_accessible_stunturn_ports.md)

*   **Description:** Coturn requires opening UDP and TCP ports (typically 3478 and 5349) to the internet to facilitate media relay and NAT traversal. These open ports are potential entry points for malicious actors to directly interact with the Coturn service.
    *   **How Coturn Contributes:** This is fundamental to Coturn's core functionality. It *must* listen on these ports to receive and forward media traffic.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans the internet for open Coturn ports and attempts to send malformed STUN/TURN packets directly to the Coturn server to crash it or exploit a protocol vulnerability within Coturn's code.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service of the Coturn service, potential for exploiting protocol vulnerabilities *within Coturn* leading to information disclosure or remote code execution *on the Coturn server*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to these ports using firewalls to only known and trusted client IP addresses or networks that *need* to communicate with the Coturn server.
        *   Implement network segmentation to isolate the Coturn server from other less critical infrastructure.
        *   Regularly monitor network traffic directly to and from these Coturn ports for suspicious activity targeting the Coturn service.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Shared Secrets](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_shared_secrets.md)

*   **Description:** Coturn's authentication mechanism often relies on shared secrets between clients and the server. Weak or default secrets configured *within Coturn* can be easily compromised, granting unauthorized access to the Coturn service.
    *   **How Coturn Contributes:** Coturn's configuration directly manages these shared secrets. The security of these secrets is a direct responsibility of the Coturn deployment.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers the default shared secret configured in Coturn and uses it to authenticate directly with the Coturn server, gaining unauthorized access to relay resources and potentially eavesdropping on media streams handled by Coturn.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Coturn's relay resources, potential for eavesdropping on media streams relayed by Coturn, manipulation of media streams handled by Coturn, and resource abuse of the Coturn server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Generate strong, unique, and unpredictable shared secrets specifically for the Coturn server.
        *   Implement a secure mechanism for managing and rotating these secrets *within the Coturn configuration*.
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in Coturn configuration files; use environment variables or secure vault solutions that Coturn can access.

## Attack Surface: [STUN/TURN Protocol Exploits](./attack_surfaces/stunturn_protocol_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities might exist in Coturn's implementation of the STUN and TURN protocols. These are flaws *within the Coturn codebase* that handle these protocols.
    *   **How Coturn Contributes:** Coturn *implements* these protocols. Any flaws or bugs in its code for handling STUN/TURN messages create a direct vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a specific STUN message that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in *Coturn's* parsing logic, leading to a crash or remote code execution *on the Coturn server*.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service of the Coturn service, information disclosure from the Coturn server's memory, remote code execution *on the Coturn server*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Coturn updated to the latest stable version to patch known protocol vulnerabilities *in Coturn's code*.
        *   Monitor security advisories specifically related to Coturn and the STUN/TURN protocols.
        *   Consider using intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block malicious STUN/TURN traffic specifically targeting known Coturn vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Coturn relies on various libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in *these specific dependencies used by Coturn* can introduce security risks directly affecting the Coturn service.
    *   **How Coturn Contributes:** Coturn's functionality is built upon these libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries become vulnerabilities *within the Coturn application*.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of OpenSSL used by Coturn. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or execute code directly on the Coturn server.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for various attacks, including remote code execution *on the Coturn server*, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Coturn and its dependencies to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities *in the libraries Coturn uses*.
        *   Implement a process for tracking and addressing security advisories specifically related to Coturn's dependencies.
        *   Consider using tools that scan for known vulnerabilities in the software dependencies of the Coturn installation.
