# Attack Tree Analysis for coturn/coturn

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to application resources, manipulate application data, or disrupt application functionality by leveraging vulnerabilities in the Coturn server.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   **Attack: Compromise Application via Coturn Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   **AND: Exploit Coturn Weakness (CRITICAL NODE)**
        *   **OR: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            *   **Exploit Weak Shared Secret (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**
                *   AND: Obtain Shared Secret
                    *   Compromise Application Server (Retrieve secret from configuration) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)
        *   **OR: Exploit Configuration and Deployment Issues (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            *   **Leverage Default Credentials (If not changed) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            *   **Exploit Exposed Management Interface (If not properly secured) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**
    *   **AND: Impact Application (CRITICAL NODE)**
        *   **OR: Gain Unauthorized Access to Application Resources (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        *   **OR: Disrupt Application Functionality (HIGH-RISK PATH)**

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Attack: Compromise Application via Coturn Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__attack_compromise_application_via_coturn_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete breach of the application's security through the Coturn server.
*   Success in this node means the attacker has achieved one or more of the sub-goals: gaining unauthorized access, manipulating data, or disrupting functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. AND: Exploit Coturn Weakness (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2__and_exploit_coturn_weakness__critical_node_.md)

*   This node represents the necessary step for the attacker to compromise the application. It signifies that the attacker has successfully identified and leveraged a vulnerability or weakness within the Coturn server itself.
*   This can involve exploiting flaws in authentication, data handling, configuration, or dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. OR: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/3__or_exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on weaknesses in how Coturn verifies and authorizes users or peers.
*   Successful exploitation here grants the attacker illegitimate access to Coturn's functionalities.
    *   **Exploit Weak Shared Secret (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        *   This attack vector relies on the shared secret used for authentication between the application and Coturn being easily guessable or discoverable.
        *   **AND: Obtain Shared Secret**
            *   **Compromise Application Server (Retrieve secret from configuration) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**
                *   This is a significant risk where the attacker targets the application server itself to extract the shared secret from configuration files, environment variables, or other storage locations. This highlights the importance of securing the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. OR: Exploit Configuration and Deployment Issues (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/4__or_exploit_configuration_and_deployment_issues__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from improper setup or management of the Coturn server.
*   These are often easier to exploit as they rely on oversights rather than complex software vulnerabilities.
    *   **Leverage Default Credentials (If not changed) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        *   If the default username and password for Coturn's management interface (if enabled) are not changed, an attacker can easily gain administrative access.
    *   **Exploit Exposed Management Interface (If not properly secured) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        *   If the Coturn management interface is accessible from the public internet without proper authentication or with weak credentials, attackers can directly control the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. AND: Impact Application (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/5__and_impact_application__critical_node_.md)

*   This node represents the successful realization of the attacker's goal, where the compromise of Coturn has directly led to a negative impact on the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. OR: Gain Unauthorized Access to Application Resources (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/6__or_gain_unauthorized_access_to_application_resources__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path describes the scenario where the attacker, having compromised Coturn, uses this access to gain unauthorized access to resources within the application itself.
*   This could involve intercepting sensitive data being relayed through Coturn or impersonating legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. OR: Disrupt Application Functionality (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/7__or_disrupt_application_functionality__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on attacks that aim to make the application unusable or unreliable.
*   This is often achieved through Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting Coturn, which in turn disrupts the application's real-time communication features.
