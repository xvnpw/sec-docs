### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving coturn

This list contains high and critical severity threats that directly involve the coturn TURN/STUN server.

*   **Threat:** Weak Shared Secret for TURNS
    *   **Description:** An attacker could brute-force or guess the shared secret used for authenticating TURN over TLS (TURNS) connections between clients and the coturn server. This allows them to impersonate legitimate clients.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to TURN resources, potentially allowing attackers to relay their own traffic through the server, consume resources, or disrupt legitimate media streams.
    *   **Affected Component:** `turnserver` (authentication module)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, randomly generated shared secrets with sufficient length and complexity.
        *   Regularly rotate shared secrets.
        *   Consider using more robust authentication mechanisms if supported and feasible.

*   **Threat:** TURN Server Overload via Excessive Allocation Requests
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of allocation requests to the coturn server, exhausting its resources (memory, CPU, network bandwidth) and preventing legitimate clients from obtaining relay allocations.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for legitimate users, preventing them from establishing media connections.
    *   **Affected Component:** `turnserver` (allocation module)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on allocation requests per client or IP address.
        *   Set appropriate limits on the maximum number of allocated relays.
        *   Monitor server resource usage and implement alerts for unusual activity.

*   **Threat:** TURN Server Overload via Excessive Relay Traffic
    *   **Description:** An attacker establishes a large number of relays and sends excessive traffic through them, overwhelming the coturn server's network bandwidth and processing capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for legitimate users, impacting the performance and availability of media streams.
    *   **Affected Component:** `turnserver` (relay module)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement traffic shaping or quality of service (QoS) mechanisms.
        *   Monitor network traffic and identify unusual patterns.
        *   Implement mechanisms to limit the bandwidth usage per relay or client.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in coturn Software
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the coturn software itself (e.g., buffer overflows, remote code execution flaws) to gain unauthorized access to the server or disrupt its operation.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the coturn server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or the server being used for malicious purposes.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various components depending on the vulnerability (e.g., parsing modules, network handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep coturn updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Regularly monitor security advisories and apply updates promptly.
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to detect and block exploitation attempts.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Configuration
    *   **Description:** The coturn server is deployed with insecure default settings, such as weak default passwords for administrative interfaces (if enabled) or overly permissive access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the coturn server's configuration and management interfaces, potentially allowing attackers to reconfigure the server, disable security features, or gain complete control.
    *   **Affected Component:** `turnserver` (configuration parsing, management interface if enabled)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review and harden the default configuration settings before deployment.
        *   Change default passwords for any administrative interfaces.
        *   Restrict access to management interfaces to authorized personnel and networks.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** The coturn server's configuration files, which may contain sensitive information like shared secrets or database credentials, are not properly protected and can be accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the coturn server or other related systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** File system, `turnserver` (configuration loading)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the file system permissions for coturn's configuration files, restricting access to the `turnserver` process and authorized administrators.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information in plain text within configuration files. Consider using environment variables or secrets management tools.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Authentication Plugins
    *   **Description:** If a custom authentication plugin is used with coturn, vulnerabilities in that plugin's code could be exploited to bypass authentication or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to TURN resources, potentially leading to resource consumption, disruption of services, or relaying of malicious traffic.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom authentication plugin
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test any custom authentication plugins for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices during the development of custom plugins.
        *   Keep custom plugins updated with security patches.
