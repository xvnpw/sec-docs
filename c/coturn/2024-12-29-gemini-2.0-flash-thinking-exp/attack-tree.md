**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Send Large Number of Binding Requests (Critical Node):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker floods the Coturn server with a large volume of binding requests. These requests, while seemingly legitimate, are designed to overwhelm the server's processing capacity and network bandwidth.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Disruption of service)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (can be detected by monitoring request rates)

*   **Gain Unauthorized Access/Information (Critical Node):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** This represents the successful outcome of exploiting authentication or authorization weaknesses, leading to the attacker gaining access to the Coturn server or the media streams it manages. This access can be used for further malicious activities.
    *   **Likelihood:** Varies depending on the specific weakness exploited
    *   **Impact:** High (Potential data breach, control over media streams)
    *   **Effort:** Varies depending on the specific weakness exploited
    *   **Skill Level:** Varies depending on the specific weakness exploited
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies depending on the method of gaining access

*   **Exploit Default Credentials (Critical Node):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to log in to the Coturn server using well-known default usernames and passwords that have not been changed by the administrator.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if default credentials are not changed)
    *   **Impact:** High (Full control over the Coturn server)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (can be detected by monitoring failed login attempts, but successful login with default credentials might be missed if not specifically monitored)

*   **Use Known Default Credentials for Coturn:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** This is the specific action of attempting to log in with default credentials.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if default credentials are not changed)
    *   **Impact:** High (If successful, leads to full control)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low

*   **Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker leverages misconfigurations or insecure default settings in the Coturn server to gain unauthorized access, disrupt functionality, or extract sensitive information.
    *   **Likelihood:** Varies depending on the specific misconfiguration
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Depending on the complexity of the vulnerability)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Depending on the complexity of the vulnerability)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies depending on the vulnerability

*   **Leverage Weak Default Settings (Critical Node):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits insecure default settings in Coturn's configuration, such as weak authentication mechanisms, open ports, or enabled debugging features.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depending on the setting)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (can be detected with security scans)

*   **Send Malicious Data via TURN Relay (Critical Node):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends crafted or malicious data packets through the Coturn server's relay functionality, targeting vulnerabilities in the application or other clients receiving the relayed data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Potential for application-level exploits or data corruption)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires inspection of relayed data)
