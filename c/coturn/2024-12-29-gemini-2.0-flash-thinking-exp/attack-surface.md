*   **Attack Surface:** Weak or Default Authentication Credentials
    *   **Description:** Coturn relies on authentication mechanisms (shared secret, username/password) which, if weak or left at default values, can be easily compromised.
    *   **How Coturn Contributes:** Coturn's configuration allows for setting these credentials, and if not done securely, it becomes a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** Using the default shared secret or a simple, easily guessable password for user authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the coturn server, allowing malicious actors to relay traffic, potentially masking their origin or launching further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies and complexity requirements for user accounts.
        *   Generate strong, random shared secrets for peer authentication.
        *   Regularly rotate authentication credentials.
        *   Avoid using default credentials provided in the coturn documentation or examples in production environments.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Coturn Protocol Implementation
    *   **Description:**  Bugs or flaws in the implementation of the STUN and TURN protocols within the coturn codebase.
    *   **How Coturn Contributes:** Coturn's primary function is to implement these protocols, and any vulnerabilities within this implementation are direct attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the parsing of a specific STUN attribute, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the coturn server updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to coturn.
        *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to detect and block malicious traffic.
