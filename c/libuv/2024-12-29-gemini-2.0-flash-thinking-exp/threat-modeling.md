* Threat: DNS Spoofing/Poisoning during DNS Resolution
    * Description: An attacker intercepts DNS requests made by the application using `uv_getaddrinfo` and provides a forged DNS response, redirecting the application to a malicious server.
    * Impact: Man-in-the-middle attacks, redirection to phishing sites, data interception.
    * Affected Component: `uv_getaddrinfo` function within the DNS resolution module.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Implement DNSSEC validation if possible.
        * Use trusted DNS resolvers.
        * Be aware of the inherent risks of relying on DNS for security-critical operations.
        * Consider validating the server's identity using TLS/SSL certificates.

* Threat: Event Loop Starvation
    * Description: An attacker sends a large number of requests or events that overwhelm the `libuv` event loop, preventing it from processing legitimate tasks and leading to a denial of service.
    * Impact: Application unresponsiveness, denial of service for legitimate users.
    * Affected Component: The main event loop (`uv_run`).
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Implement rate limiting on incoming requests.
        * Set connection limits.
        * Implement timeouts for operations.
        * Offload heavy processing tasks to worker threads or processes.

* Threat: File Descriptor Exhaustion
    * Description: An attacker triggers the application to open a large number of file descriptors (including sockets, pipes, and files) without closing them properly, eventually exhausting the system's resources and causing the application to crash or become unusable.
    * Impact: Application crash, denial of service.
    * Affected Component: All modules that handle I/O operations (`uv_fs`, `uv_tcp`, `uv_udp`, `uv_pipe`).
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Ensure proper resource management by always closing handles when they are no longer needed.
        * Use techniques like connection pooling to reuse connections.
        * Set limits on the number of open file descriptors.

* Threat: Injection through Pipe/TTY Operations
    * Description: When using `libuv`'s pipe or TTY handling functions (`uv_pipe_write`, `uv_tty_write`), if data written to these streams is not properly sanitized, attackers could inject commands or escape sequences that are interpreted by the receiving end (e.g., a shell or terminal).
    * Impact: Command execution on the receiving end, manipulation of the terminal display.
    * Affected Component: `uv_pipe` and `uv_tty` modules (specifically write functions).
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Sanitize data written to pipes and TTYs, especially if the receiving end is not fully trusted.
        * Avoid executing commands directly based on data received from pipes or TTYs.
        * Use structured data formats instead of plain text for inter-process communication.

* Threat: Memory Corruption due to Improper Buffer Handling
    * Description: While `libuv` itself is generally memory-safe, improper usage by the application (e.g., allocating buffers without bounds checking in callbacks or using incorrect buffer sizes with `uv_buf_t`) could lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.
    * Impact: Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    * Affected Component: Various modules where buffer management is involved (e.g., `uv_fs`, `uv_tcp`, `uv_udp`).
    * Risk Severity: High (if exploitable for code execution)
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Implement careful memory management practices within the application's code that interacts with `libuv`.
        * Always check buffer sizes and boundaries.
        * Use safe string manipulation functions.

* Threat: Use of Outdated libuv Version
    * Description: Using an outdated version of `libuv` exposes the application to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions.
    * Impact: Exposure to known security vulnerabilities, potential for exploitation.
    * Affected Component: The entire `libuv` library.
    * Risk Severity: Varies depending on the specific vulnerabilities present in the outdated version (can range from low to critical).
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Regularly update `libuv` to the latest stable version to benefit from security fixes.
        * Monitor security advisories for `libuv`.
