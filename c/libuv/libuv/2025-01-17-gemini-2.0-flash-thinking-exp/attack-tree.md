## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using libuv Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_libuv_weaknesses.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Achieving this means successfully exploiting one or more vulnerabilities within the application's use of libuv.
    *   Attack vectors are detailed in the sub-nodes below.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit I/O Operation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_io_operation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node represents a broad category of attacks targeting how the application interacts with the file system and network using libuv.
    *   Attack vectors include:
        *   **Path Traversal:** Injecting malicious file paths to access unauthorized files or directories.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (File Descriptors):** Opening a large number of files to exhaust the application's file descriptor limit, leading to denial of service.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Sockets):** Opening a large number of network connections to exhaust the application's socket limit, leading to denial of service.
        *   **Exploiting `uv_pipe_t`:** Gaining unauthorized access to named pipes or Unix domain sockets to inject commands or eavesdrop on communication.
    *   Mitigation focuses on robust input validation, secure file handling practices, and resource management.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Child Process Handling](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_child_process_handling.md)

*   This node represents attacks targeting how the application spawns and manages child processes using libuv.
    *   Attack vectors include:
        *   **Command Injection via `uv_spawn`:** Injecting malicious commands into the arguments passed to `uv_spawn`, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
        *   **Exploiting Child Process Communication (Pipes):** Injecting malicious data into the pipes used for communication between the parent and child processes, potentially leading to command injection or data corruption.
    *   Mitigation focuses on avoiding direct user input in `uv_spawn` commands, sanitizing data exchanged via pipes, and carefully managing child process environments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via `uv_spawn`](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via__uv_spawn_.md)

*   This is a critical node and a high-risk path due to the severe impact of arbitrary code execution.
    *   Attack vector: Manipulating the arguments passed to the `uv_spawn` function to execute arbitrary system commands. This often involves injecting shell metacharacters or commands into user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized before being used in the `uv_spawn` call.
    *   Mitigation involves never directly incorporating user input into command strings, using parameterized commands, and strictly validating any necessary input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit I/O Operation Vulnerabilities -> Exploit File System Operations -> Path Traversal Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_io_operation_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_file_system_operations_-_path_traversal_vulnerabiliti_cc1b2602.md)

*   Attack vector: An attacker provides specially crafted file paths (e.g., containing "..", absolute paths, or other escape sequences) to libuv's file system functions (like `uv_fs_open`, `uv_fs_mkdir`). If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize these paths, the attacker can bypass intended access restrictions and access or manipulate files and directories outside of the application's intended scope.
    *   Mitigation involves rigorous input validation, using absolute paths where possible, and sandboxing file system operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit I/O Operation Vulnerabilities -> Exploit File System Operations -> Resource Exhaustion (File Descriptors)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_io_operation_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_file_system_operations_-_resource_exhaustion__file_de_21bb3339.md)

*   Attack vector: An attacker repeatedly requests file operations (opening files, creating files, etc.) without properly closing the file descriptors. This can exhaust the operating system's limit on the number of open file descriptors for the application's process, leading to a denial of service where the application can no longer perform file operations.
    *   Mitigation involves setting appropriate file descriptor limits, implementing proper resource management (ensuring files are closed), and potentially rate-limiting file operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit I/O Operation Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Network Operations -> Resource Exhaustion (Sockets)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_io_operation_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_network_operations_-_resource_exhaustion__sockets_.md)

*   Attack vector: An attacker initiates a large number of network connections to the application's server without properly closing them or by rapidly opening and closing connections. This can exhaust the operating system's limit on the number of open sockets for the application, preventing it from accepting new connections and leading to a denial of service.
    *   Mitigation involves setting socket limits, implementing connection timeouts, and potentially using techniques like SYN cookies to mitigate SYN flood attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit I/O Operation Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Network Operations -> Exploiting `uv_pipe_t` (Named Pipes/Unix Domain Sockets)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_io_operation_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_network_operations_-_exploiting__uv_pipe_t___named_pi_fbe67c27.md)

*   Attack vector: If the application uses named pipes or Unix domain sockets for inter-process communication, an attacker who gains access to the file system location of the pipe/socket can potentially connect to it. This allows them to send arbitrary data to the application, potentially leading to command injection if the application doesn't properly validate the data received from the pipe/socket, or to eavesdrop on communication.
    *   Mitigation involves setting strict permissions on the pipe/socket files, authenticating connections, and validating data received through pipes/sockets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Child Process Handling -> Command Injection via `uv_spawn`](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_child_process_handling_-_command_injection_via__uv_spawn_.md)

*   Attack vector: Manipulating the arguments passed to the `uv_spawn` function to execute arbitrary system commands. This often involves injecting shell metacharacters or commands into user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized before being used in the `uv_spawn` call.
    *   Mitigation involves never directly incorporating user input into command strings, using parameterized commands, and strictly validating any necessary input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Child Process Handling -> Exploiting Child Process Communication (Pipes)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_child_process_handling_-_exploiting_child_process_communication__pipes_.md)

*   Attack vector: When an application uses pipes to communicate with child processes spawned by `uv_spawn`, an attacker might be able to inject malicious data into these pipes. If the parent or child process doesn't properly validate the data received from the pipe, this can lead to command injection (if the data is interpreted as a command) or other vulnerabilities.
    *   Mitigation involves strictly validating and sanitizing all data exchanged between parent and child processes via pipes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate the Event Loop -> Event Queue Overload](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_the_event_loop_-_event_queue_overload.md)

*   Attack vector: An attacker triggers a large number of events that are added to libuv's event loop queue. If the application cannot process these events quickly enough, the event loop becomes overloaded, leading to performance degradation and potentially a denial of service. This can be achieved by sending a large number of network requests, triggering numerous file system events, or exploiting other application-specific event triggers.
    *   Mitigation involves implementing rate limiting, backpressure mechanisms, and optimizing event processing logic.
