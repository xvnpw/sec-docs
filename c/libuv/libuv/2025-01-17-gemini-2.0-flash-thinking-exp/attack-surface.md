# Attack Surface Analysis for libuv/libuv

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Network Input](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_network_input.md)

**Description:** The application receives data from a network connection (TCP, UDP, pipes) and processes it without proper validation. This can lead to buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or logic errors.

**How libuv Contributes:** `libuv` provides the asynchronous I/O mechanisms (`uv_read_start`, `uv_read_cb`) to receive network data. It's the application's responsibility to validate this data *after* `libuv` delivers it. `libuv` itself doesn't perform input validation.

**Example:** A TCP server using `libuv` receives a message indicating the length of subsequent data. If the application doesn't verify this length against available buffer size, a malicious client could send a length exceeding the buffer, causing a buffer overflow when `uv_read_cb` processes the data.

**Impact:** Code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement robust input validation on all data received through `uv_read_cb`.
- Use safe string handling functions and avoid fixed-size buffers.
- Define and enforce strict data formats and protocols.
- Consider using libraries that provide built-in input validation for specific protocols.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (Network Connections)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__network_connections_.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the server with connection requests, exhausting available resources (memory, file descriptors), leading to denial of service.

**How libuv Contributes:** `libuv` manages the event loop and handles incoming connection requests through functions like `uv_listen` and `uv_accept`. While `libuv` can handle many connections efficiently, the application needs to implement limits and proper connection management.

**Example:** A malicious client repeatedly connects to a TCP server using `libuv` without sending data or closing the connection. The server allocates resources for each connection, eventually running out of available file descriptors or memory.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application crash.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement connection limits and rate limiting.
- Set appropriate timeouts for idle connections.
- Use techniques like connection pooling or connection recycling.
- Monitor resource usage and implement alerts for excessive connection attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe File System Operations with User-Controlled Paths](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_file_system_operations_with_user-controlled_paths.md)

**Description:** The application uses user-provided input to construct file paths for operations like reading, writing, or deleting files, without proper sanitization. This can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.

**How libuv Contributes:** `libuv` provides asynchronous file system operations (`uv_fs_*`). If the application uses user input directly in the path argument of these functions, it becomes vulnerable. `libuv` executes the file system operations as instructed.

**Example:** An application allows users to download files by specifying a filename. If the application uses the user-provided filename directly in `uv_fs_open` without checking for ".." sequences, an attacker could request a file like "../../etc/passwd".

**Impact:** Information disclosure, arbitrary file access, data modification, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Never directly use user-provided input to construct file paths.
- Implement strict path sanitization and validation.
- Use whitelisting of allowed paths or filenames.
- Operate within a restricted directory and avoid allowing access to parent directories.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Child Process Spawning](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_child_process_spawning.md)

**Description:** The application uses user-provided input to construct commands executed through `libuv`'s process spawning functions, without proper sanitization.

**How libuv Contributes:** `libuv` provides the `uv_spawn` function to create and manage child processes. If the arguments or the command itself are constructed using unsanitized user input, it can lead to command injection.

**Example:** An application allows users to convert files using an external tool. If the application uses user-provided filename directly in the command string passed to `uv_spawn`, an attacker could inject malicious commands by providing a filename like "; rm -rf /".

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid using user input directly in commands passed to `uv_spawn`.
- If necessary, use parameterized commands or escape user input properly for the shell.
- Consider using safer alternatives to shell execution if possible.
- Implement strict input validation on any data used to construct commands.
