# Threat Model Analysis for libuv/libuv

## Threat: [Path Traversal via File System Operations](./threats/path_traversal_via_file_system_operations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could provide crafted file paths to `libuv`'s file system functions, such as `uv_fs_open`, allowing them to read, write, or even delete files outside of the application's intended working directory. This directly uses `libuv`'s file system API.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, modification or deletion of critical data, potentially leading to application compromise or data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** `libuv`'s File System Module (`uv_fs`), specifically functions like `uv_fs_open`, `uv_fs_read`, `uv_fs_write`, `uv_fs_unlink`, etc.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-supplied file paths before using them with `libuv`'s file system functions.
    *   Use absolute paths whenever possible and avoid constructing paths based on user input.
    *   Employ path canonicalization techniques to resolve symbolic links and relative paths.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for file system access.

## Threat: [Command Injection through Process Spawning](./threats/command_injection_through_process_spawning.md)

*   **Description:** If an application uses `libuv`'s process spawning functions (`uv_spawn`) and incorporates unsanitized user input into the command or its arguments, an attacker could inject malicious commands that will be executed by the system. This directly uses `libuv`'s process spawning API.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server or system running the application, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
*   **Affected Component:** `libuv`'s Process Handling Module (`uv_spawn`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using user input directly in `uv_spawn`.
    *   If user input is absolutely necessary, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization, escaping shell metacharacters.
    *   Consider using safer alternatives for process execution if possible, or restrict the allowed commands and arguments.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Handle Leaks](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_handle_leaks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could trigger scenarios where the application fails to properly close `libuv` handles (e.g., `uv_tcp_t`, `uv_fs_t`, `uv_timer_t`). Repeatedly triggering these scenarios can lead to the exhaustion of system resources (file descriptors, memory, etc.), causing a denial of service. This directly relates to the management of `libuv`'s handles.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, leading to service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** `libuv`'s Handle Management, affecting all handle types (e.g., `uv_handle_t` and its subtypes).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure proper resource management by always closing `libuv` handles when they are no longer needed, especially in error handling paths and asynchronous operations.
    *   Use tools like Valgrind or AddressSanitizer during development to detect handle leaks.
    *   Implement timeouts and resource limits to prevent runaway resource consumption.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `libuv` Itself](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_`libuv`_itself.md)

*   **Description:**  `libuv`, like any software, might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. This directly targets weaknesses within the `libuv` library.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:** Any part of the `libuv` codebase containing the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay up-to-date with the latest stable releases of `libuv` and apply security patches promptly.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `libuv`.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in your application's use of `libuv`.
