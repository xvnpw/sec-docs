## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Buffer Overflow in libuv's Internal Buffers (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_buffer_overflow_in_libuv's_internal_buffers_(high-risk_path_&_critical_node).md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input to a libuv function (e.g., `uv_fs_read`, `uv_write`, or others that handle data) that exceeds the allocated buffer size. This overwrites adjacent memory regions.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Buffer overflows are a well-understood vulnerability, but modern systems and careful coding practices can reduce their occurrence. However, they remain a risk in C libraries.
* **Impact:** High (Code Execution) - Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to overwrite critical data or inject and execute arbitrary code, gaining full control of the application or the underlying system.
* **Effort:** Medium - Exploiting buffer overflows often requires understanding memory layout and crafting specific payloads, but there are existing tools and techniques that can simplify the process.
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires a good understanding of memory management and exploitation techniques.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring for crashes, segmentation faults, or unexpected memory access patterns. Static analysis and dynamic analysis tools can also help identify potential buffer overflows.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion Attacks (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_attacks_(high-risk_path).md)

* **Exhaust File Descriptors (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker makes repeated requests or takes actions that cause the application to open file descriptors (e.g., opening files, network sockets) without properly closing them. Eventually, the system's limit for open file descriptors is reached, preventing the application from functioning correctly and potentially impacting other processes.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Relatively easy to execute, especially if the application handles many connections or file operations.
    * **Impact:** Medium (Denial of Service) - Prevents the application from accepting new connections or performing essential file operations, leading to unavailability.
    * **Effort:** Low - Can be achieved with simple scripts or by exploiting application features that involve opening resources.
    * **Skill Level:** Basic - Requires minimal technical expertise.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring system-level resource usage (e.g., `ulimit`) and application logs for errors related to opening files or sockets.

* **Exhaust Memory Resources (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker triggers actions within the application that cause it to allocate large amounts of memory using libuv functions (e.g., allocating buffers for reading data) without releasing it. This can lead to memory exhaustion, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on how the application manages memory and whether there are features that allow for large or unbounded memory allocations.
    * **Impact:** Medium (Denial of Service) - Leads to application crashes or severe performance degradation.
    * **Effort:** Low - Can be achieved by exploiting features that handle large data inputs or by repeatedly triggering memory allocation routines.
    * **Skill Level:** Basic - Requires minimal technical expertise.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring application memory usage.

* **Flood the Event Loop (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends a large number of requests or triggers events that are added to the libuv event loop faster than the application can process them. This overwhelms the event loop, causing delays and potentially leading to a denial of service.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the application's architecture and how it handles incoming events.
    * **Impact:** Medium (Denial of Service) - Leads to slow response times and eventual unresponsiveness of the application.
    * **Effort:** Medium - Might require understanding the application's event handling logic to craft effective flooding attacks.
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires some understanding of asynchronous programming and event loops.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring event loop latency, CPU usage, and response times.

## Attack Tree Path: [File System Manipulation Attacks - Path Traversal Exploits (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/file_system_manipulation_attacks_-_path_traversal_exploits_(high-risk_path_&_critical_node).md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker provides manipulated file paths to libuv file system functions (e.g., `uv_fs_open`, `uv_fs_unlink`, `uv_fs_stat`) that allow them to access or modify files and directories outside of the intended scope. This is often achieved using sequences like `../`.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - A common web application vulnerability, and if the application doesn't properly sanitize file paths before passing them to libuv, it's a significant risk.
* **Impact:** High (Data Breach, Data Modification) - Attackers can read sensitive files, modify configuration files, or even execute arbitrary code if they can overwrite executable files.
* **Effort:** Low - Relatively easy to execute, often requiring simple manipulation of URL parameters or input fields.
* **Skill Level:** Basic - Can be performed by individuals with basic knowledge of web application security.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring file system access patterns for suspicious paths and by implementing input validation and sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Process Manipulation Attacks - Command Injection via Process Spawning (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/process_manipulation_attacks_-_command_injection_via_process_spawning_(high-risk_path_&_critical_node).md)

* **Attack Vector:** If the application uses the `uv_spawn` function to create new processes and incorporates user-controlled input into the arguments passed to the spawned process without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands. These commands will be executed with the privileges of the application.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on whether the application uses `uv_spawn` with user-controlled input and the effectiveness of any input sanitization measures.
* **Impact:** High (Code Execution) - Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
* **Effort:** Low - Often involves simply injecting shell commands into input fields or URL parameters.
* **Skill Level:** Basic - Can be performed by individuals with basic knowledge of command-line syntax.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring process creation for unusual commands or arguments and by implementing strict input validation on data used in `uv_spawn`.
