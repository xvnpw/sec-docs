# Attack Surface Analysis for libuv/libuv

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can access files or directories outside of the intended application's scope by manipulating file paths provided as input.
    *   **How libuv Contributes:** `libuv` provides functions like `uv_fs_open`, `uv_fs_read`, `uv_fs_write`, etc., which operate on file paths. If the application uses these functions with unsanitized user-supplied input, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An application uses `uv_fs_open` to read a file specified by a user. An attacker provides the path `../../../../etc/passwd`, potentially allowing them to read sensitive system files.
    *   **Impact:** Reading sensitive files, modifying critical application data, or even achieving remote code execution in some scenarios.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided file paths.
        *   **Path Canonicalization:** Use functions to resolve symbolic links and relative paths to their absolute canonical form to prevent traversal.
        *   **Chroot Jails/Sandboxing:** Restrict the application's access to a specific directory tree.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary file system permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system by injecting malicious commands into parameters passed to system execution functions.
    *   **How libuv Contributes:** `libuv` provides the `uv_spawn` function to create and manage child processes. If the arguments passed to `uv_spawn` include unsanitized user input, it can lead to command injection.
    *   **Example:** An application uses `uv_spawn` to execute a system command based on user input. An attacker provides input like `; rm -rf /`, which, if not properly sanitized, could lead to the deletion of critical system files.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data loss, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `uv_spawn` with User Input:** If possible, avoid using `uv_spawn` with any data derived from user input.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** If `uv_spawn` is necessary, rigorously sanitize all input parameters to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
        *   **Use Safe Alternatives:** Explore safer alternatives to system commands or use libraries that provide specific functionalities without relying on shell execution.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimal necessary system privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Socket Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/socket_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Issues arising from improper handling of network sockets, leading to potential crashes, denial of service, or information disclosure.
    *   **How libuv Contributes:** `libuv` provides the foundation for network programming with functions like `uv_tcp_bind`, `uv_tcp_connect`, `uv_read_start`, `uv_write`, etc. Incorrect usage or lack of proper error handling can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An application using `uv_tcp_read` doesn't properly check the return value or buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow when receiving a large amount of data. Another example is not handling socket errors gracefully, causing the application to crash and potentially be used in a denial-of-service attack.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure, potential for remote code execution in buffer overflow scenarios.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Error Handling:** Always check return values of `libuv` socket functions and handle errors appropriately.
        *   **Buffer Overflow Protection:** Implement strict bounds checking when reading data from sockets. Use fixed-size buffers or dynamically allocate memory based on the expected data size.
        *   **Secure Socket Options:**  Configure socket options using `uv_setsockopt` to enhance security (e.g., disabling Nagle's algorithm if not needed, setting timeouts).
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement mechanisms to limit the number of open connections or the amount of data processed to prevent resource exhaustion.
