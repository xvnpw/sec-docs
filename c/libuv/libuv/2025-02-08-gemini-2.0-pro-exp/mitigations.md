# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for libuv/libuv

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe and Controlled File System Access with `uv_fs_*`](./mitigation_strategies/safe_and_controlled_file_system_access_with__uv_fs__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Canonicalization with `libuv` (if available):** If `libuv` provides a safe, cross-platform function for canonicalizing paths (resolving symbolic links and obtaining the absolute path), *use it*. This is preferable to relying on platform-specific functions like `realpath()`. Check the `libuv` documentation for your version. If a direct `libuv` function isn't available, consider creating a wrapper around platform-specific functions that handles errors and edge cases consistently.
2.  **Asynchronous Operations:** Utilize `libuv`'s asynchronous file system functions (`uv_fs_*` with callbacks) instead of synchronous alternatives whenever possible. This prevents blocking the event loop.
3.  **Error Handling in Callbacks:** In the callbacks for `uv_fs_*` functions, *always* check the `result` field of the `uv_fs_t` request. A negative value indicates an error. Use `uv_strerror(req->result)` to get a descriptive error message. Handle errors appropriately (e.g., close handles, free resources, log the error).
4.  **Proper Cleanup:** After a file system operation is complete (in the callback), ensure that any opened file handles are closed using `uv_fs_close` (in its own callback). Use the `uv_fs_t` request structure to track the file descriptor.
5. **Use `uv_fs_mkdtemp` instead of `uv_fs_mkstemp`:**
    * If possible, avoid using `uv_fs_mkstemp` and use `uv_fs_mkdtemp` instead.
    * If you must use `uv_fs_mkstemp`, make sure to `uv_fs_unlink` the file as soon as possible.
6. **Avoid deprecated functions:**
    * Avoid using deprecated functions, such as `uv_fs_sendfile`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Directory Traversal (High Severity):** (Indirectly, through proper use of canonicalization and base directory checks *before* calling `libuv`).
*   **Symbolic Link Attacks (High Severity):** (Indirectly, through proper use of canonicalization).
*   **Resource Leaks (Medium Severity):** Prevents file descriptor leaks due to unclosed handles.
*   **Application Crashes (High Severity):** Prevents crashes due to unhandled errors in file system operations.

**Impact:**
*   **Directory Traversal/Symbolic Link Attacks:** `libuv` itself doesn't *prevent* these, but correct usage of its functions, combined with pre-`libuv` validation, is crucial.
*   **Resource Leaks:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Application Crashes:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Asynchronous `uv_fs_*` functions are used in `src/file_handler.c`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent error checking and handling in `uv_fs_*` callbacks are missing.
*   `uv_fs_close` is not always used correctly (missing callbacks).
*   No `libuv`-based canonicalization is used (relies on a potentially flawed custom implementation).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Network Operations with `uv_tcp_*`, `uv_udp_*`, `uv_pipe_*`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_network_operations_with__uv_tcp_____uv_udp_____uv_pipe__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Asynchronous Operations:** Use `libuv`'s asynchronous network functions (e.g., `uv_tcp_connect`, `uv_read_start`, `uv_write`) with callbacks. Avoid synchronous alternatives.
2.  **Error Handling in Callbacks:** In *all* network-related callbacks (e.g., `uv_connection_cb`, `uv_read_cb`, `uv_write_cb`), check for error conditions. For example, in `uv_read_cb`, check the `nread` parameter. A negative value indicates an error (use `uv_strerror(nread)`).
3.  **Handle Management:** Use `uv_close` with a callback (`uv_close_cb`) to properly close network handles (e.g., `uv_tcp_t`, `uv_udp_t`, `uv_pipe_t`) when they are no longer needed or when an error occurs.  This prevents resource leaks.
4.  **`uv_listen` Backlog:** Use the `backlog` parameter of `uv_listen` appropriately to control the queue of pending connections.  This helps mitigate some forms of DoS attacks.
5.  **Timers for Timeouts:** Use `uv_timer_t` handles to implement timeouts for network operations:
    *   `uv_timer_start`: Start a timer before initiating a connection (`uv_tcp_connect`), reading (`uv_read_start`), or writing (`uv_write`).
    *   In the timer callback, check if the operation has completed. If not, close the associated network handle using `uv_close`.
6.  **Buffer Allocation (`uv_alloc_cb`):** In the `uv_alloc_cb` (called before reading data), allocate buffers of a reasonable, *predefined maximum size*.  Do *not* allocate buffers based on untrusted input.
7.  **Read Callback (`uv_read_cb`):** Carefully handle the `nread` parameter:
    *   `nread > 0`: Process the received data.
    *   `nread == UV_EOF`: The remote end closed the connection. Close your end.
    *   `nread < 0`: An error occurred (use `uv_strerror(nread)`). Close the handle.
8. **Avoid deprecated functions:**
    * Avoid using deprecated functions, such as `uv_tcp_connect2`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (High Severity):** (Indirectly, through timeouts and connection limits implemented *using* `libuv` timers and counters).
*   **Slowloris Attacks (Medium Severity):** (Indirectly, through timeouts).
*   **Resource Leaks (Medium Severity):** Prevents leaks of sockets and other network resources.
*   **Application Crashes (High Severity):** Prevents crashes due to unhandled network errors.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS/Slowloris:** `libuv` provides the *tools* to mitigate these, but the application logic is responsible for using them correctly.
*   **Resource Leaks:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Application Crashes:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Asynchronous network functions are used in `src/network.c`.
*   `uv_listen` is used with a hardcoded `backlog` value.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent error handling in all network callbacks is missing.
*   `uv_close` is not always used with a callback.
*   Timeouts using `uv_timer_t` are not implemented for all operations.
*   The `uv_alloc_cb` does not enforce a maximum buffer size.
*   The `backlog` value is not configurable.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Correct Asynchronous Operation and Handle Management](./mitigation_strategies/correct_asynchronous_operation_and_handle_management.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Error Handling:** Check the return value of *every* `libuv` function call.  A negative return value usually indicates an error. Use `uv_strerror` to get a description.
2.  **Handle Closing:** Use `uv_close` with a callback (`uv_close_cb`) on *all* `libuv` handles when they are no longer needed.  This is crucial for releasing resources and preventing leaks.  The callback ensures the handle is fully closed before you free associated memory.
3.  **`uv_is_active` and `uv_is_closing`:** Before operating on a handle, use `uv_is_active` to check if it's still active and `uv_is_closing` to check if it's in the process of being closed.
4.  **Non-Blocking Operations:** Avoid performing any long-running or blocking operations directly within `libuv` callbacks.  This will block the event loop.  Use `uv_queue_work` to offload such operations to a thread pool:
    *   Define a `uv_work_t` request.
    *   Provide a worker function (to be executed in a separate thread).
    *   Provide an after-work callback (to be executed in the main event loop after the worker function completes).
    *   Call `uv_queue_work` with the request and callbacks.
5. **Thread Safety with `uv_async_t`:** If you need to interact with the `libuv` event loop from another thread, use `uv_async_t` handles:
    *   Initialize a `uv_async_t` handle with `uv_async_init`.
    *   From the other thread, call `uv_async_send` to signal the event loop. This will trigger the `uv_async_t`'s callback in the main event loop.
    *   *Never* directly manipulate `libuv` handles from threads other than the one that owns the event loop.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Resource Leaks (Medium Severity):** Prevents leaks of various `libuv` resources.
*   **Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Prevents accessing handles that have been closed.
*   **Race Conditions (High Severity):** (When used with `uv_async_t` and proper synchronization for shared resources *outside* of `libuv`).
*   **Application Crashes (High Severity):** Prevents crashes due to unhandled errors or incorrect handle management.
*   **Deadlocks (High Severity):** Prevents deadlocks caused by blocking the event loop or improper thread synchronization.

**Impact:**
*   **Resource Leaks:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Use-After-Free:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Race Conditions:** Risk significantly reduced (with proper thread safety).
*   **Application Crashes:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Deadlocks:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Some basic error checking is present.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent use of `uv_close` with callbacks is missing.
*   `uv_is_active` and `uv_is_closing` are not used.
*   `uv_queue_work` is not used for blocking operations.
*   `uv_async_t` is not used for inter-thread communication with the event loop.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Reentrant and Minimal Signal Handlers with `uv_async_t`](./mitigation_strategies/reentrant_and_minimal_signal_handlers_with__uv_async_t_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`uv_signal_init` and `uv_signal_start`:** Use `uv_signal_init` to initialize a `uv_signal_t` handle for each signal you want to handle. Use `uv_signal_start` to start listening for the signal and associate it with a callback (the signal handler).
2.  **Minimal Signal Handler:** The signal handler callback should *only* do one of the following:
    *   Set a global flag (declared `volatile sig_atomic_t`).
    *   Call `uv_async_send` on a pre-initialized `uv_async_t` handle.
3.  **`uv_async_init` and `uv_async_send`:** Before starting the signal handler, initialize a `uv_async_t` handle using `uv_async_init`. Associate a callback with this handle. The signal handler will call `uv_async_send` on this handle.
4.  **Deferred Processing:** The `uv_async_t` callback (which runs in the main event loop) will be triggered by `uv_async_send`. This callback should perform the *actual* signal processing (e.g., graceful shutdown).
5. **Signal unregistration:** Use `uv_signal_stop` to stop signal handling and `uv_close` for cleanup.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Deadlocks in Signal Handlers (High Severity):** Prevents deadlocks.
*   **Race Conditions (High Severity):** Prevents race conditions.
*   **Application Crashes (High Severity):** Prevents crashes.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** (Indirectly, by ensuring proper application behavior in response to signals).

**Impact:**
*   **Deadlocks/Race Conditions/Crashes:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic signal handling is present, but not using the safe approach.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `uv_async_t` is not used. The signal handlers are not reentrant.
