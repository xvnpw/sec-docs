# Attack Surface Analysis for libuv/libuv

## Attack Surface: [File System Access (Path Traversal & Symlink Attacks)](./attack_surfaces/file_system_access__path_traversal_&_symlink_attacks_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of vulnerabilities related to file system operations where `libuv`'s APIs are used to access files or directories based on attacker-controlled paths, leading to unauthorized access or manipulation.
*   **How libuv Contributes:** `libuv` provides the core file system APIs (e.g., `uv_fs_open`, `uv_fs_read`, `uv_fs_write`, `uv_fs_readdir`, `uv_fs_lstat`).  Misuse of these APIs, particularly with insufficient path sanitization or improper handling of symbolic links, directly enables these attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` to a function that uses `uv_fs_open` without proper sanitization, allowing them to read the system's password file.  Or, an attacker creates a symlink that points to a sensitive file, and the application, using `libuv` functions, follows the symlink without checking.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive files, data modification, potential code execution (if configuration files are overwritten).
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical (if sensitive files are accessible) to High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Path Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of all user-supplied file paths *before* passing them to `libuv` functions. Use a whitelist approach, allowing access only to explicitly permitted directories and files.
    *   **Avoid Relative Paths:** Prefer absolute paths and avoid constructing paths based on user input.
    *   **Symlink Handling:** Use `uv_fs_lstat` to check for symbolic links and handle them appropriately. Consider using `O_NOFOLLOW` with `uv_fs_open` (where available) to prevent following symbolic links.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary file system permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Network Input Handling (Buffer Overflows)](./attack_surfaces/network_input_handling__buffer_overflows_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from processing network data where `libuv`'s networking APIs are used, and incorrect buffer management in callbacks leads to buffer overflows.
*   **How libuv Contributes:** `libuv` provides the core networking APIs (e.g., `uv_tcp_bind`, `uv_tcp_connect`, `uv_read_start`, `uv_write`).  The vulnerability arises from how the application uses these APIs, specifically in the `uv_read_cb` and `uv_write_cb` callbacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a large, malformed packet to a server using `libuv`. The `uv_read_cb` callback doesn't properly check the `nread` parameter and copies data beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE), denial-of-service, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE) to High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Buffer Management:** Carefully check buffer sizes in `uv_read_cb` and `uv_write_cb`. Ensure `nread` is within the bounds of the allocated buffer. Use appropriate buffer allocation and deallocation techniques.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all incoming network data according to the expected protocol *before* processing it within the `libuv` callbacks.

## Attack Surface: [Process Spawning (Command Injection)](./attack_surfaces/process_spawning__command_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to executing external processes via `libuv`'s `uv_spawn` function, where attacker-controlled input is used to construct the command or arguments, leading to arbitrary command execution.
*   **How libuv Contributes:** `libuv` provides the `uv_spawn` function. The vulnerability is a direct result of how the application uses this function, specifically the insecure construction of commands.
*   **Example:** An application uses `uv_spawn` to run a system utility. The command is constructed by concatenating a string with user input: `system("my_utility " + user_input)`. An attacker provides input like `"; rm -rf /"`, leading to the execution of a destructive command.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution, complete system compromise, data loss, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Shell Interpretation:** *Never* construct commands directly from user input. Use the `args` array in `uv_process_options_t` to pass arguments separately, preventing shell interpretation.
    *   **Whitelist Commands:** If possible, use a whitelist of allowed commands and arguments.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Rigorously sanitize and validate all user input *before* passing it to `uv_spawn`, even when using the `args` array.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application and spawned processes with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [libuv Internal Bugs (Zero-Days - High Impact)](./attack_surfaces/libuv_internal_bugs__zero-days_-_high_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered vulnerabilities within the `libuv` library itself that could lead to high-impact exploits.
*   **How libuv Contributes:** This is inherent to using any third-party library, including `libuv`.  The vulnerability exists *within* `libuv`'s code.
*   **Example:** A zero-day vulnerability is discovered in `libuv`'s handling of TCP connections, allowing for remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Varies, but focused on high-impact scenarios like remote code execution or complete denial-of-service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay Updated:** Keep `libuv` updated to the latest stable version, applying security patches promptly.
    *   **Monitor Advisories:** Monitor security advisories and mailing lists related to `libuv`.
    *   **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security so that a single vulnerability in `libuv` doesn't lead to a complete compromise.  This includes strong input validation, least privilege, and network segmentation.
    *   **Rapid Patching Plan:** Have a well-defined process for rapidly deploying updates in response to newly discovered vulnerabilities.
