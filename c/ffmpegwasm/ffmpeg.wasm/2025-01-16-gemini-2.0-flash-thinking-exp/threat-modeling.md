# Threat Model Analysis for ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise](./threats/supply_chain_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the `ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm` repository, build pipeline, or distribution mechanism to inject malicious code into the library. When the application includes this compromised version, the malicious code executes within the user's browser.
*   **Impact:**  The attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser, steal sensitive data (cookies, local storage), redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Affected Component:**  The entire `ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm` library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Verify the integrity of the downloaded `ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm` library using checksums or signatures provided by the official repository.
    *   Pin specific versions of the library in your project dependencies to avoid automatically pulling in compromised updates.
    *   Monitor the `ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm` repository for any suspicious activity or security advisories.
    *   Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known ffmpeg Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_known_ffmpeg_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The underlying ffmpeg library has a history of security vulnerabilities. Even when compiled to WebAssembly, some of these vulnerabilities related to parsing and processing media formats might still be exploitable. An attacker could craft a malicious media file that, when processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`, triggers a vulnerability leading to unexpected behavior or code execution.
*   **Impact:**  This could lead to denial of service (browser crash), memory corruption within the WASM environment (potentially leading to sandbox escape in theoretical scenarios), or unexpected application behavior.
*   **Affected Component:**  Various modules within the `ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm` library responsible for parsing and decoding specific media formats (e.g., demuxers, decoders).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with the latest versions of `ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm`, as updates may include patches for known ffmpeg vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement robust input validation on media files before passing them to `ffmpeg.wasm`. Sanitize or reject files with suspicious characteristics.
    *   Consider using a sandboxed environment or worker threads to isolate the execution of `ffmpeg.wasm` and limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
