# Attack Surface Analysis for ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Media Files](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_media_files.md)

* **Description:**  Providing `ffmpeg.wasm` with specially crafted media files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in its parsing or processing logic.
    * **How ffmpeg.wasm Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  `ffmpeg.wasm`'s core function is to decode and process various media formats. This inherently exposes the application to the vast and complex codebase of FFmpeg, which has a history of vulnerabilities in its demuxers, decoders, and filters.
    * **Example:**  A user uploads a specially crafted MP4 file that triggers a buffer overflow in the H.264 decoder within `ffmpeg.wasm`.
    * **Impact:**  Potential for denial of service (application crash), unexpected behavior, or in more severe cases, potential for code execution within the WASM sandbox (and theoretically beyond if WASM runtime vulnerabilities exist).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the client-side (JavaScript) before passing data to `ffmpeg.wasm`.
        * Consider server-side validation if media files are uploaded.
        * Limit the supported media formats and codecs to reduce the attack surface.
        * Keep `ffmpeg.wasm` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Inherited Vulnerabilities from Upstream FFmpeg](./attack_surfaces/inherited_vulnerabilities_from_upstream_ffmpeg.md)

* **Description:**  `ffmpeg.wasm` is a port of the native FFmpeg library. Any existing vulnerabilities in the specific version of FFmpeg used to build `ffmpeg.wasm` are inherently present.
    * **How ffmpeg.wasm Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  By using `ffmpeg.wasm`, the application directly inherits the security risks associated with the underlying FFmpeg codebase.
    * **Example:**  A known vulnerability in the libavformat library (part of FFmpeg) allows for remote code execution when processing a specific type of media container. This vulnerability would also be present in `ffmpeg.wasm` if the underlying FFmpeg version is affected.
    * **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability inherited, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution (within the WASM sandbox).
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical, High, or Medium depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Stay informed about security advisories for FFmpeg.
        * Regularly update `ffmpeg.wasm` to versions that incorporate the latest security patches from the upstream FFmpeg project.
        * Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track the specific version of FFmpeg used in `ffmpeg.wasm`.
