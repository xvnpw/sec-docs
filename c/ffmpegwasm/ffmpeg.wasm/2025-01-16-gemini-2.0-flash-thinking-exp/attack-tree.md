## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Compromise Application via ffmpeg.wasm [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__compromise_application_via_ffmpeg_wasm__critical_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through vulnerabilities related to `ffmpeg.wasm`.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploiting ffmpeg.wasm Internals [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploiting_ffmpeg_wasm_internals__critical_.md)

This category focuses on directly targeting vulnerabilities within the compiled `ffmpeg` library itself. Success here means the attacker has found a flaw in the core media processing logic of `ffmpeg.wasm`.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Triggering Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (AND) HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_triggering_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities__and__high_risk_path.md)

This path describes the scenario where an attacker leverages memory corruption bugs within `ffmpeg.wasm`. This typically involves providing specific input that causes the library to write to or read from incorrect memory locations. The "AND" signifies that both providing the malicious input and the existence of the memory corruption vulnerability are necessary for this attack to succeed.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Providing Maliciously Crafted Media Input [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__providing_maliciously_crafted_media_input__critical_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's action of supplying specially designed media files to the application. These files are crafted to exploit known or unknown vulnerabilities within `ffmpeg.wasm`, particularly memory corruption bugs. The malicious input can contain:
    * Format strings that, when processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`, allow the attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.
    * Buffer overflows where the input data exceeds the allocated buffer size, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions and leading to code execution.
    * Heap overflows, similar to buffer overflows but targeting memory allocated on the heap.
    * Use-after-free conditions where the attacker triggers the use of memory that has already been freed, potentially leading to crashes or code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploiting Application Integration with ffmpeg.wasm [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploiting_application_integration_with_ffmpeg_wasm__critical_.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application interacts with and utilizes `ffmpeg.wasm`. Even if `ffmpeg.wasm` itself is secure, flaws in its integration can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Insecure Input Handling (AND) HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_insecure_input_handling__and__high_risk_path.md)

This path highlights the risk of the application directly using untrusted user-provided data as input for `ffmpeg.wasm` without proper sanitization or validation. The "AND" signifies that both the application's insecure handling of input and the attacker providing malicious input are required for this attack to succeed.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Passing Untrusted User Input Directly to ffmpeg.wasm [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__passing_untrusted_user_input_directly_to_ffmpeg_wasm__critical_.md)

This critical node describes the dangerous practice of directly feeding user-controlled data to `ffmpeg.wasm` without any checks or modifications. This allows attackers to inject malicious data that can trigger vulnerabilities within `ffmpeg.wasm`. Examples include:
    * Directly using uploaded video files without validating their format or content for malicious payloads.
    * Allowing users to specify encoding parameters or command-line arguments for `ffmpeg.wasm`, which can be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands or trigger vulnerabilities.
    * Passing user-provided metadata or other data directly to `ffmpeg.wasm` without sanitizing it for potentially harmful characters or sequences.
