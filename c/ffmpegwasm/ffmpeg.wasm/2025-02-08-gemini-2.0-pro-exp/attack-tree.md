## Attack Tree Path: [1. Execute Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/1__execute_arbitrary_code.md)

*   **1.1.2 Leverage ffmpeg.wasm Bug to Escape WASM Sandbox [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** This involves finding a vulnerability *within* the ffmpeg.wasm code itself that allows an attacker to break out of the WebAssembly sandbox and execute arbitrary code in the browser's main execution context. This is a very serious vulnerability, as it bypasses the security guarantees of WebAssembly.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow in the C code compiled to WASM, combined with a flaw in how memory is handled between the JavaScript wrapper and the WASM module, could allow overwriting critical data structures and hijacking control flow.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Rigorous code auditing of ffmpeg.wasm, especially the interface between JavaScript and the compiled C code.
        *   Use of memory-safe languages (e.g., Rust) for new code or critical components.
        *   Extensive fuzzing targeting the WASM interface.
        *   Sandboxing techniques beyond the standard WASM sandbox, if possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Input Validation Bypass (to achieve code execution) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_input_validation_bypass__to_achieve_code_execution___high_risk_.md)

    *   **1.2.1 Fuzzing ffmpeg.wasm with Malformed Media Files (various codecs) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** This involves systematically providing ffmpeg.wasm with a wide range of malformed, invalid, or unexpected media files (using various codecs) to trigger vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory corruption issues.
        *   **Example:** Crafting a specially designed MP4 file with an invalid header or corrupted data chunks that causes a buffer overflow in the H.264 decoder within ffmpeg.wasm.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Integrate comprehensive fuzzing into the development and testing pipeline.
            *   Use multiple fuzzing tools (e.g., AFL, libFuzzer, specialized media fuzzers).
            *   Target a wide variety of codecs and file formats.
            *   Implement robust input validation before passing data to ffmpeg.wasm.

    *   **1.2.2 Exploit Codec-Specific Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** This involves leveraging publicly known vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - CVEs) in specific codecs used by FFmpeg. Attackers can use publicly available exploit code or create their own based on the CVE details.
        *   **Example:** A known buffer overflow vulnerability in a specific version of the libvpx library (used for VP8/VP9 encoding) could be exploited by providing a crafted WebM file.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Stay up-to-date on CVEs related to FFmpeg and the codecs it uses.
            *   Disable or carefully restrict the use of codecs known to be problematic or have a history of vulnerabilities.
            *   Regularly update the underlying FFmpeg library used to build ffmpeg.wasm.
            *   Implement input validation to reject files that attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities.

    *   **1.2.4 Integer/Buffer Overflow in ffmpeg.wasm's C code [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** These are classic memory corruption vulnerabilities that can occur in C/C++ code due to incorrect handling of integer values or buffer sizes.  If these vulnerabilities exist in the FFmpeg code compiled to WASM, they can be exploited.
        *   **Example:** An integer overflow in a calculation related to frame size could lead to allocating an insufficient buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow when data is written to it.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Employ static analysis tools to detect potential integer and buffer overflows.
            *   Use memory-safe languages or techniques (bounds checking, safe integer libraries, etc.).
            *   Thorough code review focusing on memory management and arithmetic operations.
            *   Fuzzing specifically designed to trigger integer and buffer overflows.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **2.1 Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **2.1.1 Memory Exhaustion (Large/Complex Files) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** This involves providing ffmpeg.wasm with very large or complex media files that consume all available memory, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
        *   **Example:** Uploading a multi-gigabyte video file or a file with an extremely high resolution or bit rate.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement strict limits on input file size and complexity (resolution, bit rate, frame rate, etc.).
            *   Use streaming processing where possible to avoid loading the entire file into memory at once.
            *   Monitor memory usage and gracefully handle out-of-memory conditions (e.g., return an error, terminate the process).
            *   Consider using Web Workers to isolate ffmpeg.wasm processing and prevent it from blocking the main thread.

    *   **2.1.2 CPU Exhaustion (Complex Encoding/Decoding Operations) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** This involves using complex encoding or decoding operations that consume excessive CPU cycles, making the application unresponsive.
        *   **Example:** Requesting a computationally expensive video transcoding operation with very high quality settings or using a complex codec with many features enabled.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Limit the complexity of allowed encoding/decoding operations (e.g., restrict certain codecs, limit quality settings).
            *   Implement timeouts to prevent long-running processes from blocking the application.
            *   Use Web Workers to offload processing to separate threads.
            *   Monitor CPU usage and throttle or terminate processes that consume excessive resources.

*   **2.2.4 Trigger Pathological Case in ffmpeg's Algorithms [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  This involves crafting input that, while not necessarily malformed in a traditional sense, triggers a worst-case scenario in one of FFmpeg's algorithms, leading to excessive resource consumption or an infinite loop.
    *   **Example:**  A video file designed to exploit a specific weakness in a motion estimation algorithm, causing it to take an exceptionally long time to process.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Thorough testing with a wide variety of inputs, including edge cases and "stress tests."
        *   Code review and analysis of FFmpeg's algorithms to identify potential pathological cases.
        *   Timeouts and resource limits to prevent runaway processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Data Exfiltration](./attack_tree_paths/3__data_exfiltration.md)

*   **3.2.2 Leverage ffmpeg.wasm Bug to Read Arbitrary Memory within WASM [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** This involves finding a vulnerability within ffmpeg.wasm that allows reading memory outside of intended bounds, but *still within the confines of the WebAssembly sandbox*. This could expose sensitive data being processed by ffmpeg.wasm.
    *   **Example:** A buffer over-read vulnerability in a codec's parsing logic could allow reading adjacent memory within the WASM module, potentially revealing parts of other video frames or internal data structures.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Rigorous code auditing and fuzzing, focusing on memory access patterns and array bounds checking.
        *   Use of memory-safe languages or techniques to prevent out-of-bounds reads.
        *   Careful management of sensitive data within the WASM module, avoiding storing it in predictable locations.
