Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Output Sanitization" mitigation strategy for an application using `ffmpeg.wasm`.

```markdown
# Deep Analysis: Output Sanitization for ffmpeg.wasm

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the "Output Sanitization" mitigation strategy for an application leveraging `ffmpeg.wasm`.  This includes:

*   Understanding the specific security risks associated with *using the output* of `ffmpeg.wasm` without proper sanitization.
*   Defining the precise steps required to implement effective output sanitization.
*   Identifying potential implementation challenges and edge cases.
*   Assessing the impact of this mitigation on the overall security posture of the application.
*   Providing actionable recommendations for the development team.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the **output** generated by `ffmpeg.wasm` and how that output is subsequently used within the application.  It does *not* cover:

*   Input validation (which is a separate, crucial mitigation).
*   Vulnerabilities within the `ffmpeg.wasm` library itself (we assume the library is kept up-to-date).
*   Other attack vectors unrelated to `ffmpeg.wasm`'s output.
*   The security of the underlying WebAssembly runtime.

The scope includes all points within the application where data *returned by* `ffmpeg.wasm` is:

*   Displayed to the user (e.g., video metadata, error messages).
*   Used to construct URLs.
*   Stored in a database.
*   Passed to other functions or components.
*   Used in any other way that could potentially introduce a security vulnerability.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Revisit the application's threat model to confirm the relevance of XSS and information disclosure threats related to `ffmpeg.wasm` output.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  Since we don't have the actual application code, we'll construct hypothetical code examples to illustrate vulnerable and secure implementations.  This will simulate a code review process.
3.  **Contextual Analysis:**  Analyze the different contexts in which `ffmpeg.wasm` output is used and tailor the sanitization recommendations accordingly.
4.  **Library Selection:**  Recommend specific, well-regarded sanitization libraries suitable for each context.
5.  **Edge Case Identification:**  Identify potential edge cases and corner cases that might bypass naive sanitization attempts.
6.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the impact of implementing (and *not* implementing) this mitigation on the application's security.
7.  **Recommendations:**  Provide clear, actionable recommendations for the development team.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Output Sanitization

### 2.1. Threat Modeling Review (Confirmation)

The initial threat model identified XSS and information disclosure as significant risks.  Output sanitization directly addresses these:

*   **XSS:**  If `ffmpeg.wasm` returns data containing malicious JavaScript (e.g., embedded in metadata or even crafted error messages), displaying this unsanitized output directly in the DOM could lead to an XSS attack.  The attacker could then steal cookies, redirect the user, or deface the page.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  `ffmpeg.wasm` might inadvertently leak sensitive information in its output, such as:
    *   Internal file paths within the WebAssembly environment (especially in error messages).
    *   Fragments of memory contents if there's a bug in `ffmpeg` or the WASM bindings.
    *   Metadata from the input video that the user didn't intend to expose.

### 2.2. Contextual Analysis and Sanitization Recommendations

Let's examine the different contexts and provide tailored recommendations:

**2.2.1. Displaying Textual Output (Metadata, Error Messages)**

*   **Vulnerable (Hypothetical) Code:**

    ```javascript
    ffmpeg.run(...).then(result => {
        document.getElementById("metadata").innerHTML = result.metadata; // VULNERABLE!
        document.getElementById("error").innerHTML = result.error; // VULNERABLE!
    });
    ```

*   **Mitigation:** Use a robust HTML sanitization library like **DOMPurify**.

*   **Secure (Hypothetical) Code:**

    ```javascript
    import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

    ffmpeg.run(...).then(result => {
        document.getElementById("metadata").innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(result.metadata);
        document.getElementById("error").innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(result.error);
    });
    ```

*   **Library Recommendation:**  **DOMPurify** is a widely used and well-maintained library specifically designed for HTML sanitization.  It's fast, reliable, and configurable.  It's crucial to use a dedicated library rather than attempting to roll your own sanitization logic, as this is notoriously error-prone.

*   **Error Message Sanitization:**  In addition to DOMPurify, consider a custom sanitization function for error messages to remove potentially sensitive information *before* passing it to DOMPurify:

    ```javascript
    function sanitizeErrorMessage(error) {
        // Remove potential file paths (very basic example - needs to be robust)
        let sanitizedError = error.replace(/\/.*\/ffmpeg\.wasm/g, '[REDACTED]');
        // ... other sanitization steps ...
        return sanitizedError;
    }

    ffmpeg.run(...).then(result => {
        // ...
    }).catch(error => {
        const sanitizedError = sanitizeErrorMessage(error.message);
        document.getElementById("error").innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(sanitizedError);
    });
    ```

**2.2.2. Using Output as a URL**

*   **Vulnerable (Hypothetical) Code:**

    ```javascript
    ffmpeg.run(...).then(result => {
        const videoUrl = result.outputFilePath; // Assume this comes from ffmpeg.wasm
        window.location.href = videoUrl; // VULNERABLE!
    });
    ```

*   **Mitigation:** Use the built-in `URL` object for parsing and validation.  Check the origin, protocol, and other components.

*   **Secure (Hypothetical) Code:**

    ```javascript
    ffmpeg.run(...).then(result => {
        const videoUrlString = result.outputFilePath;
        try {
            const videoUrl = new URL(videoUrlString);

            // Validate the URL
            if (videoUrl.origin !== window.location.origin) {
                throw new Error("Invalid URL origin");
            }
            if (videoUrl.protocol !== "https:" && videoUrl.protocol !== "http:") {
                throw new Error("Invalid URL protocol");
            }
            // ... other checks ...

            // Now it's (relatively) safe to use the URL
            window.location.href = videoUrl.href;

        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Invalid URL:", error);
            // Handle the error appropriately (don't display the raw URL!)
        }
    });
    ```

*   **Library Recommendation:**  The built-in `URL` object in modern browsers is generally sufficient.  Avoid using regular expressions for URL validation, as they are often complex and can be bypassed.

**2.2.3. Using Output as Data**

*   **Vulnerable (Hypothetical) Code:**

    ```javascript
    ffmpeg.run(...).then(result => {
        const videoData = result.videoData; // Assume this is raw video data
        myApplication.processVideoData(videoData); // VULNERABLE! (if processVideoData doesn't validate)
    });
    ```

*   **Mitigation:**  Implement strict schema validation or whitelisting.  The specifics depend heavily on the data format.

*   **Secure (Hypothetical) Code:**

    ```javascript
    ffmpeg.run(...).then(result => {
        const videoData = result.videoData;

        // Example: Whitelist allowed video data lengths
        const allowedLengths = [1024, 2048, 4096];
        if (!allowedLengths.includes(videoData.length)) {
            throw new Error("Invalid video data length");
        }

        // Example: Schema validation (using a hypothetical library)
        const isValid = mySchemaValidator.validate(videoData, "VideoDataSchema");
        if (!isValid) {
            throw new Error("Invalid video data format");
        }

        myApplication.processVideoData(videoData); // Now safer
    });
    ```

*   **Library Recommendation:**  This depends entirely on the data format.  For JSON data, consider libraries like `ajv` or `jsonschema`.  For other formats, you might need custom validation logic.

### 2.3. Edge Case Identification

*   **Complex HTML Structures:**  Even with DOMPurify, attackers might try to craft extremely complex or nested HTML structures to try to bypass the sanitization.  Regularly update DOMPurify to benefit from the latest security fixes.
*   **Unicode and Encoding Issues:**  Ensure that the sanitization library handles Unicode characters and different character encodings correctly.  Attackers might use obscure Unicode characters to try to bypass filters.
*   **Mutation XSS (mXSS):**  This is a more advanced form of XSS where the attacker exploits subtle differences in how browsers parse and modify HTML.  DOMPurify is designed to protect against mXSS, but staying up-to-date is crucial.
*   **Timing Attacks:** While less likely with output sanitization, be aware of potential timing attacks if the sanitization process takes a significantly different amount of time depending on the input.
*   **`ffmpeg.wasm` Bugs:**  If there's a bug in `ffmpeg.wasm` itself that allows it to generate malicious output *despite* correct input, output sanitization might not be sufficient.  Keep `ffmpeg.wasm` updated.
*   **Indirect Output Usage:** Consider cases where the output is not directly used, but influences other parts of the application. For example, if the output is used to generate a filename, and that filename is later used in a system command, this could lead to a command injection vulnerability.

### 2.4. Impact Assessment

*   **Without Output Sanitization:**  The application is highly vulnerable to XSS and information disclosure attacks.  This could lead to account compromise, data breaches, and reputational damage.
*   **With Output Sanitization:**  The risk of XSS and information disclosure from `ffmpeg.wasm` output is significantly reduced.  The application's overall security posture is greatly improved.  The performance impact of using libraries like DOMPurify is generally minimal, especially compared to the security benefits.

### 2.5. Recommendations

1.  **Implement Output Sanitization Immediately:**  This is a critical mitigation that should be prioritized.
2.  **Use DOMPurify for HTML:**  Use DOMPurify to sanitize any output from `ffmpeg.wasm` that is displayed in the DOM.
3.  **Validate URLs:**  Use the built-in `URL` object to parse and validate any URLs generated from `ffmpeg.wasm` output.
4.  **Validate Data:**  Implement strict schema validation or whitelisting for any data extracted from `ffmpeg.wasm` output.
5.  **Sanitize Error Messages:**  Create a custom sanitization function to remove sensitive information from error messages before displaying them.
6.  **Regularly Update Libraries:**  Keep DOMPurify and `ffmpeg.wasm` updated to the latest versions.
7.  **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure that output sanitization is implemented correctly in all relevant parts of the application.
8.  **Security Testing:**  Include penetration testing and security audits to identify any potential bypasses or vulnerabilities.
9. **Consider Input Sanitization:** While this deep dive focused on output, remember that input sanitization is *also* crucial for a secure application using `ffmpeg.wasm`.
10. **Monitor for ffmpeg.wasm vulnerabilities:** Subscribe to security advisories related to ffmpeg and ffmpeg.wasm.
