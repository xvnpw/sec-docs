# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a JavaScript port of FFmpeg, enabling browser-based video and audio processing.
*   Minimize the need for server-side video processing, reducing infrastructure costs and latency.
*   Offer a user-friendly API for developers to integrate video/audio manipulation into web applications.
*   Maintain a high level of performance and compatibility across different browsers.
*   Foster a community-driven, open-source project.

Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the compiled WebAssembly code could expose user data or allow malicious code execution.
*   Performance bottlenecks could lead to poor user experience, especially on low-powered devices.
*   Cross-browser compatibility issues could limit the reach and usability of the library.
*   Lack of proper input validation could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.
*   Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies could compromise the integrity of the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project is open-source, allowing for community review and auditing of the codebase (implied, not explicitly stated in the repository).
*   security control: Uses Emscripten to compile C/C++ code to WebAssembly, which provides some level of sandboxing and memory safety (implied, based on Emscripten's nature).
*   security control: The project uses GitHub for version control and issue tracking, which provides some level of access control and auditability (implied).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The inherent complexity of FFmpeg's codebase increases the risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries (FFmpeg, Emscripten) introduces potential supply chain risks.
*   accepted risk: WebAssembly's sandboxing, while generally strong, may have limitations or undiscovered vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS and other code injection attacks.
*   security control: Regularly update dependencies (FFmpeg, Emscripten) to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the compiled WebAssembly code.
*   security control: Implement fuzz testing to identify potential vulnerabilities related to input handling.
*   security control: Use a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all dependencies and their versions.
*   security control: Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for any externally loaded scripts or resources.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as ffmpeg.wasm is a library, not a service requiring authentication. Authentication would be the responsibility of the application using the library.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable, as ffmpeg.wasm does not manage user roles or permissions. Authorization would be the responsibility of the application using the library.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strictly validate all input data, including file types, sizes, and media parameters.
    *   Sanitize input to prevent command injection or other code injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement checks to prevent buffer overflows or other memory-related issues.
*   Cryptography:
    *   If handling sensitive data (which is not the primary use case), use appropriate cryptographic libraries for encryption and decryption. This would be the responsibility of the application using the library, not the library itself.
    *   Ensure that any cryptographic keys are securely managed (again, the responsibility of the application).

    GitHubActions -- "Publishes" --> NPMPackage["NPM Package"]
    NPMPackage -- "Deploys to" --> NPMRegistry["NPM Registry"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Code Development:** Developers write and modify the source code, primarily JavaScript and configuration files for building the WebAssembly module.
2.  **Version Control:** Code is committed and pushed to a GitHub repository.
3.  **Continuous Integration (CI):** GitHub Actions (or a similar CI/CD system) is triggered by pushes to the repository.
4.  **Build Environment:** The CI environment clones the repository and sets up the necessary build tools, including Emscripten.
5.  **Compilation:** Emscripten compiles the FFmpeg C/C++ code into WebAssembly (ffmpeg.wasm).  This process also generates the necessary JavaScript glue code (ffmpeg.wasm.js) for interacting with the WebAssembly module.
6.  **Testing:**  Automated tests (if present) are executed to verify the functionality of the compiled code.
7.  **Packaging:** The compiled WebAssembly module, JavaScript glue code, and any other necessary files are packaged into an npm package.
8.  **Publishing:** The npm package is published to the npm registry, making it available for developers to install.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: **Version Control (GitHub):** Provides an audit trail of code changes and access control.
*   security control: **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):** Automates the build process, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   security control: **Emscripten:** Provides a secure compilation process from C/C++ to WebAssembly, including sandboxing.
*   security control: **Automated Testing (if implemented):** Helps identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities before release.
*   security control: **NPM Registry:** Provides security features like two-factor authentication and package signing (if enabled).
*   security control: **Dependency Management:** Regularly updating dependencies (FFmpeg, Emscripten, and other libraries) to patch known vulnerabilities is crucial. Tools like Dependabot (on GitHub) can help automate this process.
*   security control: **Static Analysis (if implemented):** Using linters and static analysis tools can help identify potential code quality and security issues.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Providing in-browser video and audio processing capabilities.
*   Maintaining a positive user experience with good performance and reliability.
*   Protecting the reputation of the project and its maintainers.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   **User-provided video/audio data:** This data may contain personal information, copyrighted material, or other sensitive content. Sensitivity: **High**. While ffmpeg.wasm itself doesn't store this data persistently, it processes it in memory.  A vulnerability could potentially expose this data.
*   **Source code and build artifacts:**  Compromise of the source code or build process could lead to the distribution of malicious code. Sensitivity: **High**.
*   **No user accounts or credentials:** ffmpeg.wasm is a library and does not manage user accounts.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific types of video/audio processing are most commonly used with ffmpeg.wasm? This can help prioritize security testing efforts.
*   Are there any plans to add features that might handle sensitive data more directly (e.g., encryption/decryption)?
*   What level of browser compatibility is required? This can impact the choice of security features (e.g., older browsers may not support newer CSP directives).
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by the community?
*   Is there a dedicated security contact or team for the project?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a functional and performant library, with security being a high priority but not necessarily the absolute top priority. The project is likely willing to accept some level of risk in exchange for ease of use and development speed.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project relies heavily on the inherent security of WebAssembly and Emscripten, as well as the security practices of the FFmpeg project. There is an implicit trust in these underlying technologies.
*   DESIGN: The design is relatively simple and straightforward, with a clear separation between the JavaScript API and the WebAssembly module. The primary attack surface is the input data provided to the library. The deployment model is assumed to be primarily through npm.
