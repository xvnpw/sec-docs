# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Limits (Memory, CPU, Filesystem)

**Description:**
1.  **Memory Limits:**
    *   When initializing the `ffmpeg.wasm` WebAssembly module, specify a maximum memory limit using the `memory` option in the configuration passed to `createFFmpeg`.  Start with a conservative value (e.g., 256MB) and increase it only if necessary based on testing with representative input files.  This directly controls the memory allocated to the `ffmpeg.wasm` instance.
    *   Implement a monitoring mechanism (e.g., using `performance.memory` in JavaScript, if available, or by periodically checking the WebAssembly instance's memory usage) to track the memory consumption of the `ffmpeg.wasm` module.
    *   If the memory usage exceeds the predefined limit, terminate the WebAssembly instance using `ffmpeg.exit()` or by destroying the Web Worker (if `ffmpeg.wasm` is running in a worker).  Provide a user-friendly error message.
2.  **CPU Time Limits:**
    *   Wrap calls to `ffmpeg.run()` (or any other `ffmpeg.wasm` functions that perform processing) in a `Promise` with a timeout.  Use `Promise.race()` to combine the `ffmpeg.run()` promise with a timeout promise (created using `setTimeout`).
    *   If the timeout promise resolves first, it indicates that the `ffmpeg.wasm` operation has exceeded the allowed time.  Terminate the WebAssembly instance using `ffmpeg.exit()` or worker termination.
    *   Adjust the timeout value based on testing with representative input files.  Consider different timeouts for different operations (e.g., shorter timeouts for thumbnail generation, longer timeouts for full video transcoding).
3.  **Filesystem Access Limits (if using virtual filesystem):**
    *   Before running `ffmpeg.wasm`, calculate the maximum expected size of the input and output files that will be stored in the *virtual filesystem*.
    *   Use the `FS.mkdir()` and `FS.writeFile()` functions (from the `ffmpeg.wasm` virtual filesystem API) to create the necessary directories and files *within the virtual filesystem*.
    *   Monitor the size of the virtual filesystem during processing.  If the size exceeds the calculated maximum, terminate the WebAssembly instance using `ffmpeg.exit()`.
    *   Consider using a separate, temporary directory within the virtual filesystem for each `ffmpeg.wasm` operation to further isolate files.  Use `FS.rmdir()` to clean up.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High Severity:** Prevents attackers from crafting malicious inputs that cause excessive memory allocation or CPU consumption within the `ffmpeg.wasm` instance, crashing the browser tab or making the application unresponsive.
*   **Resource Exhaustion - High Severity:** Protects against scenarios where legitimate, but large or complex, input files could lead to resource exhaustion within the `ffmpeg.wasm` environment.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk of successful DoS attacks targeting `ffmpeg.wasm`.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Reduces the risk of performance degradation or application crashes due to legitimate, but resource-intensive, input files processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: Memory limits are set in `src/workers/ffmpegWorker.js`. CPU timeouts are implemented in `src/components/VideoProcessor.js`. Filesystem limits are *not* currently implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Filesystem limits are missing.  They should be implemented in `src/workers/ffmpegWorker.js`, similar to the memory limit implementation.  Monitoring of the `ffmpeg.wasm` virtual filesystem size needs to be added.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation (FFmpeg-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation__ffmpeg-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation (Format Whitelisting, Parameter Restrictions, Duration Limits)

**Description:**
1.  **Format Whitelisting:**
    *   Create a constant array or configuration file that explicitly lists the allowed input and output formats (e.g., `['mp4', 'webm']` for containers, `['h264', 'vp9', 'aac']` for codecs). This directly restricts the formats *passed to* `ffmpeg.wasm`.
    *   Before passing any input to `ffmpeg.wasm`, validate the input file's format against the whitelist.
    *   Reject any input that does not match an allowed format.
    *   Similarly, validate the desired *output* format against the whitelist before constructing the arguments for `ffmpeg.run()`.
2.  **Parameter Restrictions:**
    *   Create a configuration object that defines the allowed FFmpeg options and their permissible values.  This directly controls the command-line arguments passed to `ffmpeg.wasm`. For example:
        ```javascript
        const allowedOptions = {
          '-vf': ['scale=w=1280:h=720:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease'], // Example: Limit resolution
          '-b:v': ['2M'], // Example: Limit video bitrate
          '-b:a': ['128k'], //Example: Limit audio bitrate
          '-r' : ['30'] //Example: Limit framerate
        };
        ```
    *   Before constructing the arguments for `ffmpeg.run()`, validate each option and its value against the `allowedOptions` object.
    *   Reject any input that attempts to use disallowed options or values with `ffmpeg.wasm`.
3.  **Duration Limits:**
    *   If possible, obtain the duration of the input file *before* passing it to `ffmpeg.wasm`.
    *   Compare the duration to a predefined maximum duration.
    *   Reject any input that exceeds the maximum duration, preventing it from being processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium Severity:** Reduces the attack surface by limiting the number of code paths within FFmpeg (inside `ffmpeg.wasm`) that can be reached by an attacker.
*   **Code Execution (within WebAssembly sandbox) - Low Severity:** Limiting options and formats reduces the likelihood of triggering a vulnerability within `ffmpeg.wasm` that could lead to code execution.
*   **Resource Exhaustion - Medium Severity:** Duration limits prevent processing of excessively long files by `ffmpeg.wasm`.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:**  Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks by limiting the attack surface exposed by `ffmpeg.wasm`.
*   **Code Execution:**  Reduces the risk, but does not eliminate it.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Effectively prevents resource exhaustion caused by excessively long input files processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Format whitelisting is partially implemented in `src/utils/validation.js`, but only checks file extensions.  Parameter restrictions and duration limits are not implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `src/utils/validation.js` needs to use a more robust format detection method.
*   Parameter restrictions need to be implemented, likely in `src/workers/ffmpegWorker.js` or a dedicated validation module, directly controlling the arguments passed to `ffmpeg.run()`.
*   Duration limits need to be implemented before calling `ffmpeg.wasm` functions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/output_sanitization.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Output Sanitization (of `ffmpeg.wasm` results)

**Description:**
1.  **Treat Output as Untrusted:** Assume that the output *returned by* `ffmpeg.wasm` could contain malicious data, even if the processing itself was successful.
2.  **Context-Specific Sanitization:** The specific sanitization steps depend on how the output data from `ffmpeg.wasm` is used.
    *   **If the output is displayed as text:** Use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) to remove any potentially harmful HTML tags or attributes *before displaying the output*.
    *   **If the output is used as a URL:** Validate the URL using a URL parsing library and ensure it conforms to expected patterns.
    *   **If the output is used as data in your application:** Validate the data against a strict schema or whitelist of allowed values.
3.  **Error Handling:** Ensure that error messages *returned by* `ffmpeg.wasm` are sanitized before being displayed to the user. Remove any potentially sensitive information, such as internal file paths from the WebAssembly environment.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure - Medium Severity:** Prevents attackers from embedding sensitive information (e.g., memory contents from the `ffmpeg.wasm` instance) in the output.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity (if output is displayed):** Prevents XSS attacks if the output of `ffmpeg.wasm` is displayed without sanitization.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **XSS:** Effectively prevents XSS attacks originating from `ffmpeg.wasm` output.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No output sanitization is currently implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Output sanitization needs to be implemented wherever the output of `ffmpeg.wasm` is used. This includes components that display the processed video, metadata, or error messages.
*   Error message sanitization needs to be implemented where `ffmpeg.wasm` errors are handled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Updates (`ffmpeg.wasm` itself)

**Description:**
1.  **`ffmpeg.wasm` Updates:**
    *   Subscribe to release notifications for the `ffmpeg.wasm` project on GitHub.
    *   Regularly check for new releases (e.g., weekly).
    *   When a new release is available, update the `ffmpeg.wasm` dependency in your project's `package.json` file.
    *   Run `npm install` (or equivalent) to install the updated version.
    *   Thoroughly test your application after updating `ffmpeg.wasm`.
2. **FFmpeg Updates (Indirect):**
     * Monitor security advisories for FFmpeg. Be aware of reported vulnerabilities, as these will eventually be addressed in `ffmpeg.wasm` updates.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Execution (within WebAssembly sandbox) - High Severity:** Addresses known vulnerabilities in the underlying FFmpeg codebase within `ffmpeg.wasm`.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High Severity:** Addresses known DoS vulnerabilities within `ffmpeg.wasm`.
*   **Information Disclosure - Medium Severity:** Addresses known information disclosure vulnerabilities within `ffmpeg.wasm`.

**Impact:**
*   **All Threats:** Significantly reduces the risk by patching known vulnerabilities in `ffmpeg.wasm`.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No automated update process is in place.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Implement a process for regularly checking for and applying updates to `ffmpeg.wasm`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [WebAssembly Instance Isolation](./mitigation_strategies/webassembly_instance_isolation.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** WebAssembly Instance Isolation (Multiple `ffmpeg.wasm` instances)

**Description:**
1.  If your application processes multiple media files, create a new `ffmpeg.wasm` WebAssembly instance for *each* file.  This isolates the processing of each file.
2.  This can be achieved by:
    a.  Creating a new Web Worker for each file and initializing `ffmpeg.wasm` (using `createFFmpeg`) within that worker.  This is the recommended approach.
    b.  Or, if using `ffmpeg.wasm` on the main thread, calling `ffmpeg.createFFmpeg()` to create a *new* instance each time, and ensuring you call `ffmpeg.exit()` on the *previous* instance when finished.
3.  Ensure that no data is shared between instances (e.g., through shared memory or global variables).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Execution (within WebAssembly sandbox) - Medium Severity:** Limits the impact of a successful exploit within a single `ffmpeg.wasm` instance.
*   **Information Disclosure - Medium Severity:** Prevents a vulnerability in one `ffmpeg.wasm` instance from leaking information about other files.
*   **Denial of Service - Low Severity:** If one `ffmpeg.wasm` instance crashes, others remain operational.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Execution/Information Disclosure:** Reduces the blast radius of a successful attack against a single `ffmpeg.wasm` instance.
*   **DoS:** Provides some resilience.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   A single `ffmpeg.wasm` instance is used for all processing.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Modify the code (e.g., `src/workers/ffmpegWorker.js`) to create a new `ffmpeg.wasm` instance (via `createFFmpeg`) for each file processing request. Ensure proper cleanup of each instance after processing is complete using `ffmpeg.exit()`.
