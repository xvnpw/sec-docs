# Deep Analysis: ffmpeg.wasm Sandbox Escape (Attack Tree Path 1.1.2)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the potential for, and implications of, an attacker successfully escaping the WebAssembly (WASM) sandbox provided by the browser when using `ffmpeg.wasm`.  We aim to identify specific vulnerability types, exploitation techniques, and effective mitigation strategies related to this critical attack vector.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to harden the application against this threat.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on attack path **1.1.2: Leverage ffmpeg.wasm Bug to Escape WASM Sandbox**.  This includes:

*   **Vulnerabilities within `ffmpeg.wasm` itself:**  We will *not* analyze vulnerabilities in the browser's WASM implementation (those are the responsibility of the browser vendor).  Instead, we focus on flaws in the compiled C/C++ code of FFmpeg that could be triggered *through* the `ffmpeg.wasm` API.
*   **The JavaScript/WASM interface:**  The interaction between the JavaScript wrapper code provided by `ffmpeg.wasm` and the compiled WASM module is a critical area of focus.  This is where memory management issues and type confusion vulnerabilities are most likely to arise.
*   **Exploitation techniques specific to WASM:** We will consider how standard vulnerability classes (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) manifest in the WASM context and how they can be leveraged to achieve sandbox escape.
*   **Post-escape impact:** While the primary focus is on *achieving* the escape, we will briefly consider the potential consequences once the attacker has control in the browser's main execution context.

We will *not* cover:

*   Attacks that rely on social engineering or user interaction (e.g., tricking the user into loading a malicious file).
*   Denial-of-service attacks that do not lead to code execution.
*   Vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that are unrelated to `ffmpeg.wasm`.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Static Code Analysis (SAST):**  We will review the source code of both the relevant parts of FFmpeg (the C/C++ code that gets compiled to WASM) and the `ffmpeg.wasm` JavaScript wrapper.  This will involve:
    *   Manual code review by security experts, focusing on known vulnerability patterns.
    *   Automated SAST tools to identify potential buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, integer overflows, and other common C/C++ vulnerabilities.  Tools like Clang Static Analyzer, Coverity, and others may be used.
    *   Specific attention to the functions exposed through the `ffmpeg.wasm` API and the data flow between JavaScript and WASM.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (DAST) / Fuzzing:**  We will use fuzzing techniques to test the `ffmpeg.wasm` API with a wide range of inputs, including malformed and unexpected data.  This will help us discover vulnerabilities that might be missed by static analysis.
    *   We will use a combination of black-box fuzzing (without knowledge of the internal structure) and grey-box fuzzing (using code coverage information to guide the fuzzer).
    *   Fuzzers like AFL++, libFuzzer, and Honggfuzz will be considered.
    *   We will develop custom fuzzing harnesses that specifically target the `ffmpeg.wasm` API and the data types it handles.
    *   We will monitor for crashes, hangs, and unexpected behavior that could indicate a vulnerability.

3.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities in FFmpeg and related libraries to determine if any of them are applicable to `ffmpeg.wasm`.  This includes monitoring CVE databases, security advisories, and research publications.

4.  **Exploitability Assessment:** For any identified vulnerabilities, we will assess their exploitability in the context of `ffmpeg.wasm` and the browser's WASM sandbox.  This will involve:
    *   Developing proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits to demonstrate how a vulnerability could be used to escape the sandbox.
    *   Analyzing the memory layout and control flow of the WASM module to identify potential exploitation techniques.
    *   Considering the limitations imposed by the WASM sandbox and how they might affect exploit development.

5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:** Based on the findings of the analysis, we will provide specific and actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.2

This section delves into the specifics of the attack, building upon the methodologies outlined above.

### 2.1 Potential Vulnerability Classes

Several vulnerability classes within FFmpeg's C/C++ codebase could be leveraged to escape the `ffmpeg.wasm` sandbox:

*   **Buffer Overflows (Stack, Heap, Global):**  FFmpeg processes complex multimedia data, making it susceptible to buffer overflows.  If an attacker can provide crafted input that overwrites a buffer, they might be able to overwrite adjacent data, including function pointers or return addresses.  In the WASM context, this could allow them to redirect control flow *within* the WASM module.  The key to escaping the sandbox is to then leverage this control to manipulate the interface with JavaScript.

*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):**  If FFmpeg incorrectly frees a memory region and then later attempts to use it, an attacker might be able to control the contents of that memory region.  This could lead to similar consequences as a buffer overflow, allowing the attacker to hijack control flow.

*   **Integer Overflows/Underflows:**  Arithmetic operations on integers that result in values outside the representable range can lead to unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows or incorrect memory allocations.

*   **Type Confusion:**  If FFmpeg treats a memory region as one type of data when it actually contains data of a different type, this can lead to vulnerabilities.  This is particularly relevant at the JavaScript/WASM interface, where data is marshaled between the two environments.  For example, if JavaScript passes a number where a pointer is expected, the WASM code might interpret that number as a memory address and attempt to access it, potentially leading to a crash or, if carefully crafted, controlled memory access.

*   **Format String Vulnerabilities:** Although less common in modern code, format string vulnerabilities in logging or error handling functions could allow an attacker to read or write arbitrary memory locations.

### 2.2 Exploitation Techniques (Escaping the Sandbox)

Escaping the WASM sandbox is the crucial step.  Simply gaining control *within* the WASM module is not enough.  The attacker needs to interact with the JavaScript environment to break out.  Here are some potential techniques:

1.  **Manipulating the JavaScript/WASM Interface:**  The most likely path to escape involves corrupting the data structures or functions used to communicate between the WASM module and the JavaScript wrapper.  This could involve:
    *   **Overwriting Function Pointers:**  If the JavaScript wrapper calls WASM functions through function pointers stored in WASM memory, an attacker who can overwrite those pointers can redirect the calls to arbitrary WASM code.  If they can then craft a WASM function that calls a JavaScript function (via the import object) with attacker-controlled arguments, they can potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   **Corrupting Memory Management Functions:**  `ffmpeg.wasm` likely uses custom memory management functions to allocate and free memory shared between JavaScript and WASM.  If an attacker can corrupt these functions (e.g., by triggering a double-free or use-after-free), they might be able to gain control over memory regions used by the JavaScript wrapper, potentially leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution.
    *   **Type Confusion at the Interface:**  As mentioned earlier, if the attacker can cause a type mismatch between the data expected by the WASM module and the data provided by JavaScript, they might be able to trick the WASM code into accessing arbitrary memory locations or calling functions with incorrect arguments. This could be used to call imported JavaScript functions with controlled parameters.

2.  **Leveraging WASM Imports:**  WASM modules can import functions from the JavaScript environment.  `ffmpeg.wasm` likely imports functions for logging, memory management, and interacting with the browser.  An attacker who can control the arguments passed to these imported functions might be able to:
    *   **Call `eval()` (Indirectly):**  While `ffmpeg.wasm` itself likely wouldn't directly import `eval()`, it might import functions that, under certain conditions, could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.  For example, a function that sets the `innerHTML` of a DOM element could be used to inject a `<script>` tag.
    *   **Manipulate the DOM:**  If the attacker can control the arguments to DOM manipulation functions, they could potentially modify the page content in a way that leads to JavaScript execution (e.g., by adding an event handler that executes malicious code).
    *   **Access Browser APIs:**  If `ffmpeg.wasm` imports functions that provide access to browser APIs (e.g., `fetch()`, `WebSockets`), the attacker might be able to use these APIs to communicate with a remote server or exfiltrate data.

3.  **Return Value Manipulation:** If a WASM function returns a value to JavaScript, and the attacker can control that return value, they might be able to influence the behavior of the JavaScript code. For example, if the return value is used as an index into an array, a carefully crafted return value could cause an out-of-bounds access in the JavaScript code, potentially leading to further exploitation.

### 2.3 Post-Escape Impact

Once the attacker has escaped the WASM sandbox and gained control in the browser's main execution context, they have effectively achieved the same level of access as a traditional cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.  This means they can:

*   Steal cookies and session tokens.
*   Redirect the user to malicious websites.
*   Modify the content of the page.
*   Access browser APIs (e.g., microphone, camera, geolocation) if the user has granted permission.
*   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   Potentially install malware or browser extensions.

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies (Reinforced)

The mitigation strategies outlined in the original attack tree are a good starting point, but we can expand on them:

*   **Rigorous Code Auditing (Enhanced):**
    *   **Focus on the Interface:**  Pay *extreme* attention to the code that handles data transfer between JavaScript and WASM.  This is the most likely attack surface.  Look for any assumptions about data types, sizes, or validity.
    *   **Memory Safety Audits:**  Specifically look for potential buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, and integer overflows.  Use tools that are designed to detect these types of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Code auditing should be an ongoing process, not a one-time event.  Any changes to the FFmpeg codebase or the `ffmpeg.wasm` wrapper should be reviewed.

*   **Use of Memory-Safe Languages (Strong Recommendation):**
    *   **Rust for New Code:**  Strongly consider using Rust for any new code or for rewriting critical components of `ffmpeg.wasm`.  Rust's ownership and borrowing system prevents many common memory safety errors at compile time.
    *   **Gradual Migration:**  If a complete rewrite is not feasible, consider a gradual migration to Rust, starting with the most security-sensitive components.

*   **Extensive Fuzzing (Targeted):**
    *   **Custom Fuzzing Harnesses:**  Develop fuzzing harnesses that are specifically designed for `ffmpeg.wasm`.  These harnesses should understand the API and the data types it expects.
    *   **Coverage-Guided Fuzzing:**  Use coverage-guided fuzzers to ensure that the fuzzer is exploring as much of the codebase as possible.
    *   **Long-Running Fuzzing Campaigns:**  Fuzzing should be run continuously, not just for short periods.  Some vulnerabilities may only be triggered after millions or billions of iterations.
    *   **Fuzz the JavaScript Wrapper:** Don't just fuzz the WASM module; also fuzz the JavaScript wrapper code to find vulnerabilities in how it interacts with WASM.

*   **Sandboxing Techniques (Beyond WASM):**
    *   **Web Workers:**  Consider running `ffmpeg.wasm` in a separate Web Worker.  This provides an additional layer of isolation, even if the WASM sandbox is compromised.  Communication between the main thread and the worker can be restricted using `postMessage()`.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Use a strict CSP to limit the capabilities of the JavaScript code, even if an attacker gains control.  This can prevent the attacker from loading external scripts, making network requests, or accessing certain browser APIs.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI to ensure that the `ffmpeg.wasm` file has not been tampered with.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Validate all input to `ffmpeg.wasm` as strictly as possible.  Reject any input that does not conform to the expected format or size.
    *   **Sanitize Untrusted Data:**  If you must handle untrusted data, sanitize it before passing it to `ffmpeg.wasm`.  This might involve escaping special characters or removing potentially dangerous content.

*   **Regular Updates:**
    *   **Monitor for FFmpeg Updates:**  Keep `ffmpeg.wasm` up-to-date with the latest version of FFmpeg.  Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched in FFmpeg, and these patches should be applied promptly.
    *   **Automated Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management system to automatically track and update dependencies, including `ffmpeg.wasm`.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * Ensure that the ffmpeg.wasm module is only granted the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid granting unnecessary access to browser APIs or system resources.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of an attacker successfully escaping the `ffmpeg.wasm` sandbox and compromising the application. The combination of static analysis, dynamic analysis, and proactive security measures is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture.
