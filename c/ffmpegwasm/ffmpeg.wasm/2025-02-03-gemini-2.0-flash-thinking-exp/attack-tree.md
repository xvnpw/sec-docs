## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit ffmpeg.wasm Vulnerabilities - Critical Node, High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_ffmpeg_wasm_vulnerabilities_-_critical_node__high-risk_path.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting inherent vulnerabilities within the compiled ffmpeg.wasm code itself.
* **How:** Attackers aim to find and trigger bugs in the WASM code originating from the ffmpeg C/C++ codebase. These vulnerabilities can be memory corruption issues, logic errors, or other flaws that were not fully mitigated during compilation to WASM.
* **Why High-Risk:**  Successful exploitation can lead to code execution within the browser's WASM sandbox, potentially bypassing security measures and gaining control over the application's client-side environment.
* **Potential Consequences:** Code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service, unexpected application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (WASM) - Critical Node, High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities__wasm__-_critical_node__high-risk_path.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Triggering memory corruption bugs within the ffmpeg.wasm code.
* **How:** By providing specially crafted inputs (media files, API parameters) that cause ffmpeg.wasm to write to or read from memory in an unintended or unsafe manner. Common types include buffer overflows, use-after-free, and integer overflows.
* **Why High-Risk:** Memory corruption vulnerabilities are a classic and potent class of bugs in C/C++ code. Even in a WASM environment, they can be exploited to achieve code execution or other malicious outcomes.
* **Potential Consequences:** Code execution in the browser, data corruption, denial of service, information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Buffer Overflow in WASM Code - Critical Node, High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_buffer_overflow_in_wasm_code_-_critical_node__high-risk_path.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Overwriting memory buffers in WASM code by providing excessive input data.
* **How:**
    * **1.1.1.1.1 Triggered by Malicious Media File:**  Crafting media files with specific structures or metadata that cause ffmpeg.wasm to write beyond the allocated buffer size while parsing or processing the file.
    * **1.1.1.1.2 Triggered by Crafted API Calls:**  Providing API parameters that, when processed by ffmpeg.wasm, lead to buffer overflows during internal operations.
* **Why High-Risk:** Buffer overflows are a well-known and frequently exploited vulnerability. They can allow attackers to overwrite critical data or inject malicious code into memory.
* **Potential Consequences:** Code execution in the browser, denial of service, data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2 Use-After-Free in WASM Code - Critical Node, High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_use-after-free_in_wasm_code_-_critical_node__high-risk_path.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Accessing memory that has already been freed by ffmpeg.wasm.
* **How:**
    * **1.1.1.2.1 Triggered by Specific Processing Sequence:**  Triggering a specific sequence of API calls or media processing steps that causes ffmpeg.wasm to free memory and then attempt to access it again later. This often involves race conditions or incorrect memory management logic.
* **Why High-Risk:** Use-after-free vulnerabilities can lead to unpredictable behavior and are often exploitable for code execution.
* **Potential Consequences:** Code execution in the browser, denial of service, unexpected application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.3 Integer Overflow/Underflow in WASM Code - Critical Node, High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_3_integer_overflowunderflow_in_wasm_code_-_critical_node__high-risk_path.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Causing integer arithmetic errors (overflow or underflow) within ffmpeg.wasm.
* **How:**
    * **1.1.1.3.1 Triggered by Large or специально crafted media dimensions/parameters:** Providing media files with extremely large dimensions or other parameters that cause integer overflows or underflows during calculations within ffmpeg.wasm. This can lead to incorrect memory allocation sizes or other unexpected behavior.
* **Why High-Risk:** Integer overflows/underflows can lead to memory corruption, logic errors, and potentially code execution if they are not handled correctly.
* **Potential Consequences:** Memory corruption, denial of service, unexpected application behavior, potentially code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Abuse ffmpeg.wasm API and Functionality - Critical Node, High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_abuse_ffmpeg_wasm_api_and_functionality_-_critical_node__high-risk_path.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Misusing the intended API and functionality of ffmpeg.wasm to achieve malicious goals.
* **How:** Attackers exploit the application's interface to ffmpeg.wasm, sending crafted API calls or parameters that lead to unintended or harmful outcomes.
* **Why High-Risk:** API abuse is often easier to exploit than finding deep vulnerabilities in the WASM code itself, as it targets the application's intended interaction with ffmpeg.wasm.
* **Potential Consequences:** Denial of service, resource exhaustion, unexpected application behavior, potentially limited sandbox escape if combined with other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Parameter Injection via API - Critical Node, High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_parameter_injection_via_api_-_critical_node__high-risk_path.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious data through the API parameters passed to ffmpeg.wasm.
* **How:**
    * **1.2.1.1 Injecting Malicious ffmpeg Options - Critical Node, High-Risk Path:**  If the application allows user-controlled input to be passed directly as ffmpeg command-line options, attackers can inject malicious options.
        * **1.2.1.1.1 Leading to Command Execution (within WASM sandbox) - High-Risk Path:**  While direct system command execution is limited within the WASM sandbox, malicious ffmpeg options can still cause harm. They might lead to resource exhaustion, denial of service, or unexpected behavior within ffmpeg.wasm itself, potentially triggering vulnerabilities or revealing information.
* **Why High-Risk:** Parameter injection is a common and often easily exploitable vulnerability in web applications. Naive handling of user input in API calls can directly expose ffmpeg.wasm to malicious commands.
* **Potential Consequences:** Denial of service, resource consumption within the browser, unexpected application behavior, potentially triggering vulnerabilities within ffmpeg.wasm.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Supply Chain Compromise - Critical Node, High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_supply_chain_compromise_-_critical_node__high-risk_path.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Compromising the distribution or build process of ffmpeg.wasm to inject malicious code.
* **How:**
    * **1.3.1 Compromised ffmpeg.wasm Distribution - Critical Node, High-Risk Path:**  Attackers compromise the official distribution channels (e.g., CDN, npm repository) where ffmpeg.wasm is hosted and replace the legitimate file with a malicious version.
        * **1.3.1.1 Malicious ffmpeg.wasm Version Distributed - Critical Node, High-Risk Path:** Users unknowingly download and use a compromised ffmpeg.wasm file.
            * **1.3.1.1.1 If the source or distribution channel is compromised, a malicious version could be served - High-Risk Path:**  This is the point of attack - compromising the distribution to serve a malicious file.
* **Why High-Risk:** Supply chain attacks can have a wide-reaching impact, as they can compromise many users who rely on the affected component.  Even though the likelihood might be low, the potential impact is critical.
* **Potential Consequences:** Full application compromise for all users, malware distribution, data theft, widespread disruption.
