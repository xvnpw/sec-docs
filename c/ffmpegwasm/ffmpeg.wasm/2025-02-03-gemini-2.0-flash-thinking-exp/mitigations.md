# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm

## Mitigation Strategy: [Subresource Integrity (SRI) for `ffmpeg.wasm`](./mitigation_strategies/subresource_integrity__sri__for__ffmpeg_wasm_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Generate the SRI hash for the specific `ffmpeg.wasm` file version being used. This can be done using command-line tools or online generators.
    2.  In the HTML, when loading `ffmpeg.wasm` via a `<script>` tag, add the `integrity` attribute with the generated hash.
    3.  Include `crossorigin="anonymous"` if loading from a CDN to enable SRI for cross-origin requests.
        ```html
        <script src="https://cdn.example.com/ffmpeg.wasm" integrity="sha384-YOUR_SRI_HASH_HERE" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        ```
        This ensures the browser verifies the integrity of the `ffmpeg.wasm` file before execution.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Compromised `ffmpeg.wasm` Delivery (High Severity) - Mitigates risks if the CDN or delivery mechanism serving `ffmpeg.wasm` is compromised and serves a malicious version.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on `ffmpeg.wasm` (Medium Severity) - Prevents execution if an attacker intercepts and modifies the `ffmpeg.wasm` file during transit.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromised `ffmpeg.wasm` Delivery: High reduction - Prevents execution of a malicious `ffmpeg.wasm` file.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on `ffmpeg.wasm`: High reduction - Prevents execution of a tampered `ffmpeg.wasm` file.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented in the `index.html` file where `ffmpeg.wasm` is loaded from CDN, using `integrity` and `crossorigin` attributes.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Not applicable, SRI is implemented for initial `ffmpeg.wasm` loading.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Version Pinning of `ffmpeg.wasm`](./mitigation_strategies/version_pinning_of__ffmpeg_wasm_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Explicitly specify a fixed, tested version of `ffmpeg.wasm` in your project's dependencies or CDN URL. Avoid using `latest` or dynamic tags. Example: `https://cdn.example.com/ffmpeg-core.js@4.4.1/ffmpeg-core.js`.
    2.  Document the pinned version in project documentation.
    3.  Establish a process to review and update to newer versions after testing and security checks in a staging environment.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unexpected `ffmpeg.wasm` Behavior from New Versions (Medium Severity) - Prevents automatic updates to potentially buggy or incompatible `ffmpeg.wasm` versions.
        *   Exposure to Unpatched Vulnerabilities in Older `ffmpeg.wasm` (Medium Severity) - While pinning prevents unexpected updates, neglecting updates can lead to using vulnerable versions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unexpected `ffmpeg.wasm` Behavior from New Versions: High reduction - Prevents instability from automatic updates.
        *   Exposure to Unpatched Vulnerabilities in Older `ffmpeg.wasm`: Medium reduction - Requires active version management to update eventually.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, version `4.4.1` is pinned in the CDN URL for `ffmpeg.wasm` loading, documented in `README.md`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  A formal, documented, and ideally automated process for regular version review and update of `ffmpeg.wasm` is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Host `ffmpeg.wasm` Locally](./mitigation_strategies/host__ffmpeg_wasm__locally.md)

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs implementation in build process to include `ffmpeg.wasm` in static assets and update HTML to load it locally.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input File Validation Before `ffmpeg.wasm` Processing](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_file_validation_before__ffmpeg_wasm__processing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement client-side JavaScript validation *before* files are processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`.
        *   Check MIME type against a whitelist (e.g., `video/mp4`, `audio/mpeg`).
        *   Check file extension against a whitelist (e.g., `mp4`, `mp3`, `wav`).
        *   Check file size against a maximum limit.
    2.  (Optional, if server-side component exists) Implement server-side re-validation of MIME type, extension, size, and potentially magic numbers.
    3.  Reject invalid files and provide clear error messages to the user.
        This ensures only expected media types are processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Malicious File Processing by `ffmpeg.wasm` (High Severity) - Prevents `ffmpeg.wasm` from processing files that are not expected media types and might contain exploits.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Files to `ffmpeg.wasm` (Medium Severity) - Limits processing of excessively large files by `ffmpeg.wasm`, preventing resource exhaustion.
    *   **Impact:**

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Server-side validation (even if server-side ffmpeg is not used) and magic number validation are not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Filenames and Paths for `ffmpeg.wasm` Commands](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_filenames_and_paths_for__ffmpeg_wasm__commands.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When using user-provided filenames or constructing paths for `ffmpeg.wasm` commands, sanitize these inputs.
    2.  If constructing command strings manually (less recommended), escape special characters. Prefer using the `ffmpeg.wasm` API's options objects.
    3.  For file operations within `ffmpeg.wasm`'s virtual file system, sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal.
        This prevents command injection and path traversal vulnerabilities when interacting with `ffmpeg.wasm`.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Command Injection in `ffmpeg.wasm` Operations (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious commands if filenames are used unsafely in `ffmpeg.wasm` command construction.
        *   Path Traversal within `ffmpeg.wasm` Virtual File System (Medium Severity) - Reduces risk of accessing files outside intended areas in `ffmpeg.wasm`'s virtual file system.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Command Injection in `ffmpeg.wasm` Operations: High reduction - Prevents command injection attacks against `ffmpeg.wasm`.
        *   Path Traversal within `ffmpeg.wasm` Virtual File System: Medium reduction - Reduces risk of unintended file access within `ffmpeg.wasm`.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic filename sanitization (replacing spaces and special chars with underscores) is implemented before using filenames in `ffmpeg.wasm` commands.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** More robust sanitization using whitelists or dedicated libraries could be implemented. Current sanitization is basic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Allowed FFmpeg Operations (Command Whitelisting for `ffmpeg.wasm`)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_allowed_ffmpeg_operations__command_whitelisting_for__ffmpeg_wasm__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify necessary `ffmpeg` functionalities for your application.
