# BUSINESS POSTURE

The ffmpegwasm project aims to provide a WebAssembly build of FFmpeg, enabling client-side media processing within web browsers.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable client-side media manipulation: Reduce reliance on server-side processing for media tasks, leading to lower server costs and improved user experience by offloading processing to the client's browser.
  - Offline media applications: Allow web applications to function offline for media processing tasks, enhancing accessibility and usability in environments with limited or no internet connectivity.
  - Broader accessibility of FFmpeg: Make FFmpeg functionalities available to web developers without requiring server-side infrastructure or complex backend setups.
  - Performance and efficiency: Provide a performant WebAssembly implementation of FFmpeg that can handle common media processing tasks efficiently within the browser environment.

- Business Risks:
  - Performance limitations: WebAssembly performance might be lower than native server-side FFmpeg, especially for complex or resource-intensive tasks. This could limit the scope of client-side processing.
  - Browser compatibility and consistency:  Reliance on web browser capabilities and WebAssembly support introduces risks related to browser compatibility issues and inconsistencies across different browsers and versions.
  - Security risks of client-side processing: Processing sensitive media data client-side introduces potential security risks if not handled properly, including data exposure within the browser environment or through insecure application implementations using ffmpegwasm.
  - Dependency on upstream FFmpeg project: The project's success and maintenance are dependent on the upstream FFmpeg project. Changes or vulnerabilities in FFmpeg could directly impact ffmpegwasm.
  - Supply chain risks:  Compromise of the build or distribution pipeline could lead to the distribution of malicious versions of ffmpegwasm, impacting users of the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Browser Security Model: Web browsers enforce a security model that isolates web pages and limits access to system resources, providing a baseline level of security for client-side WebAssembly execution. Implemented by web browser vendors.
  - security control: Subresource Integrity (SRI):  SRI can be used to ensure that the ffmpegwasm library loaded from a CDN or other external source has not been tampered with. Described in web application security best practices.
  - security control: HTTPS for distribution: Serving ffmpegwasm over HTTPS ensures the integrity and confidentiality of the library during download. Implemented by CDN and web server configurations.
  - security control: Regular updates from upstream FFmpeg:  Keeping ffmpegwasm synchronized with the latest FFmpeg releases helps incorporate security patches and address known vulnerabilities in the underlying FFmpeg codebase. Implemented in project's development and release process.
  - security control: Code review process: Reviewing code changes before merging can help identify potential security vulnerabilities or coding errors. Implemented in project's development process, likely using GitHub pull requests.
  - security control: Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST): Utilizing SAST tools during the build process to automatically scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities. Might be implemented in CI/CD pipelines.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Client-side data exposure: Data processed client-side within the browser is inherently more exposed than server-side processing. While browsers provide isolation, vulnerabilities in the browser or in the application using ffmpegwasm could lead to data exposure. Mitigation relies on secure application development practices and browser security.
  - accepted risk: Performance limitations impacting security features:  Performance overhead of certain security features (like extensive input validation or cryptography) in WebAssembly might lead developers to reduce or omit these features to maintain application performance. Mitigation requires careful performance optimization and balancing security with usability.
  - accepted risk: Browser vulnerabilities:  Vulnerabilities in the web browser itself could potentially be exploited to bypass security controls and compromise applications using ffmpegwasm. Mitigation relies on browser vendors' security updates and patching processes.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Input validation and sanitization: Implement robust input validation and sanitization within ffmpegwasm's JavaScript API and potentially within the WASM module itself to prevent injection attacks and buffer overflows when processing user-provided media data.
  - security control: Memory safety checks:  Enable memory safety checks during the compilation of FFmpeg to WebAssembly to mitigate memory-related vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.
  - security control: Dependency scanning: Regularly scan dependencies (both JavaScript and C/C++ libraries used in the build process) for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
  - security control: Build process hardening: Secure the build environment and pipeline to prevent supply chain attacks. This includes using hardened build agents, verifying dependencies, and signing build artifacts.
  - security control: Security testing: Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, of applications using ffmpegwasm to identify and address potential security weaknesses in real-world usage scenarios.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to ffmpegwasm library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of the web application using ffmpegwasm to control access to its features and data.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to ffmpegwasm library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the web application using ffmpegwasm to control what operations users are allowed to perform and on what data.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All input data passed to ffmpegwasm's JavaScript API and processed by the WASM module must be strictly validated to prevent injection attacks, buffer overflows, and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Input validation should include checks for data type, format, range, and allowed characters, based on the expected input for each function.
    - Requirement: Error handling for invalid input should be robust and prevent further processing of potentially malicious data.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If ffmpegwasm is used to handle sensitive media data that requires confidentiality or integrity, appropriate cryptographic mechanisms should be considered.
    - Requirement:  If encryption is needed, utilize established browser-based cryptographic APIs (Web Crypto API) within the JavaScript wrapper around ffmpegwasm, rather than implementing custom cryptography within the WASM module itself unless absolutely necessary and after expert review.
    - Requirement: Ensure proper key management practices if cryptographic keys are used client-side. Consider the risks of client-side key storage and explore secure alternatives if necessary.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Client-side media processing: The core business process enabled by ffmpegwasm is the ability to perform media manipulation tasks directly within the user's web browser, reducing server load and enabling offline capabilities. Protecting this process means ensuring the integrity and security of the ffmpegwasm library and its usage in web applications.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Media Data: The primary data being processed by ffmpegwasm is media files (audio, video, images). The sensitivity of this data depends heavily on the application context.
    - Low Sensitivity: Publicly available media files, non-sensitive user-generated content.
    - Medium Sensitivity: User-generated content that is not intended for public sharing but does not contain highly confidential information.
    - High Sensitivity:  Proprietary media content, personal and private media files, media containing sensitive personal information (e.g., medical images, financial recordings).

  - Sensitivity Level Impact:
    - Low Sensitivity: Data breaches or integrity issues might have minimal impact. Focus on availability and basic integrity.
    - Medium Sensitivity: Data breaches could lead to privacy concerns and reputational damage. Require stronger confidentiality and integrity controls.
    - High Sensitivity: Data breaches could result in significant financial loss, legal repercussions, and severe reputational damage. Demand robust security controls, including encryption, strict access control, and comprehensive monitoring.
