### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.2: Abuse ffmpeg.wasm API and Functionality

#### 4.1 Detailed Explanation of the Attack Vector: Misusing the Intended API

This attack vector focuses on exploiting the *intended* functionality of `ffmpeg.wasm` through its JavaScript API in ways that were not anticipated or properly secured by the application developers.  Instead of finding bugs in the WASM code itself, attackers leverage the flexibility and power of ffmpeg's features via the API to cause harm.

**Key aspects of API abuse in this context:**

*   **Parameter Manipulation:**  Attackers can manipulate parameters passed to `ffmpeg.wasm` API functions (like `ffmpeg.run()`, `FS.writeFile()`, `FS.readFile()`) to alter the behavior of ffmpeg in unexpected and potentially harmful ways. This includes:
    *   **Crafted Input Files:** Providing malicious or oversized input files via `FS.writeFile()` that can trigger resource exhaustion or unexpected behavior in ffmpeg processing.
    *   **Malicious Command Arguments:** Injecting or modifying command-line arguments passed to `ffmpeg.run()` to execute unintended ffmpeg functionalities or bypass intended limitations.
    *   **Path Traversal:**  Attempting to access or manipulate files outside the intended scope within the WASM virtual file system using manipulated file paths in API calls.
*   **Functionality Chaining:**  Abusing the sequence of API calls to achieve a malicious outcome. For example, writing a malicious file and then instructing ffmpeg to process it in a way that leads to denial of service or unexpected application state.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Intentionally triggering resource-intensive ffmpeg operations through the API to cause denial of service by consuming excessive CPU, memory, or browser resources.

#### 4.2 Step-by-Step Attack Scenario: Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion

Let's consider a scenario where the application allows users to upload media files and process them using `ffmpeg.wasm` for format conversion.

1.  **Attacker Goal:**  Deny service to legitimate users by overloading the application or the user's browser.
2.  **Attack Vector:** API abuse through resource exhaustion.
3.  **Steps:**
    *   **Upload Malicious Input:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted media file (e.g., a highly complex video with many streams or a file designed to trigger inefficient processing in ffmpeg).
    *   **API Call Manipulation:** The attacker crafts an API call to `ffmpeg.run()` through the application's interface. This call might:
        *   Use ffmpeg commands that are known to be resource-intensive (e.g., complex filters, high-resolution scaling, multiple encoding passes).
        *   Specify overly large output dimensions or bitrates, further increasing processing demands.
        *   Instruct ffmpeg to process the malicious input file repeatedly or in a loop (if the application's API allows for such control).
    *   **Execution:** The application executes the `ffmpeg.run()` call with the attacker-controlled parameters and malicious input.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** `ffmpeg.wasm` starts processing the malicious input according to the attacker's instructions. Due to the crafted input and resource-intensive commands, it consumes excessive CPU and memory in the user's browser.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The user's browser becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion, effectively denying them access to the application and potentially other browser functionalities. If the application is server-side rendered or heavily relies on client-side processing, the server might also experience increased load due to repeated attacks.

#### 4.3 Technical Details and Potential Exploits

*   **Command Injection via `ffmpeg.run()`:**  If the application naively constructs ffmpeg command arguments based on user input without proper sanitization, it could be vulnerable to command injection. An attacker could inject arbitrary ffmpeg commands or options, potentially leading to:
    *   **Arbitrary File System Access (within WASM sandbox):**  While limited to the WASM virtual file system, attackers might be able to read or write files they shouldn't have access to within the sandbox using ffmpeg's file manipulation options.
    *   **Unexpected Functionality Execution:**  Executing ffmpeg functionalities beyond the intended scope of the application, potentially revealing internal information or causing unintended side effects.
*   **Input File Manipulation via `FS.writeFile()`:**  If the application allows users to upload files that are directly passed to `FS.writeFile()` without proper validation, attackers could upload files that:
    *   **Overwrite critical files (within WASM sandbox):**  Although sandboxed, overwriting files within the WASM virtual file system could disrupt the application's functionality if it relies on specific files.
    *   **Exhaust storage (within WASM sandbox):**  Uploading extremely large files could fill up the WASM virtual file system storage, potentially causing errors or denial of service.
    *   **Trigger ffmpeg vulnerabilities (less likely but possible):**  Crafted media files could potentially trigger vulnerabilities within ffmpeg's parsing or processing logic, although this is less directly related to API abuse and more to underlying ffmpeg bugs.
*   **Uncontrolled Processing Time/Resources:**  Lack of limits on processing time or resource consumption for `ffmpeg.wasm` operations can be exploited for denial of service. If the application doesn't implement timeouts or resource quotas, attackers can initiate long-running, resource-intensive tasks that degrade performance or crash the browser.

#### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risks associated with API abuse of `ffmpeg.wasm`, the development team should implement the following strategies:

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strictly validate all user inputs:**  Validate all parameters passed to `ffmpeg.wasm` API functions, including file names, command arguments, and options.
    *   **Sanitize command arguments:**  If constructing ffmpeg commands dynamically, carefully sanitize user inputs to prevent command injection. Use allow-lists for allowed options and arguments instead of blacklists. Consider using a command builder library if available to avoid manual string construction.
    *   **Validate input file types and sizes:**  Enforce limits on the size and type of uploaded files to prevent oversized or malicious files from being processed.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources, reducing the risk of loading malicious scripts that could manipulate the API.

2.  **Resource Management and Limits:**
    *   **Implement timeouts:**  Set reasonable timeouts for `ffmpeg.run()` operations to prevent long-running processes from consuming resources indefinitely.
    *   **Resource Quotas (if possible):** Explore if browser APIs or `ffmpeg.wasm` itself provides mechanisms to limit resource consumption (CPU, memory) for ffmpeg operations.
    *   **Throttling and Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on API calls to prevent attackers from overwhelming the application with excessive requests.

3.  **Secure API Usage Practices:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Only expose the necessary `ffmpeg.wasm` functionalities through the application's API. Avoid exposing overly powerful or unnecessary features that could be abused.
    *   **Abstraction and Encapsulation:**  Create an abstraction layer between the application and `ffmpeg.wasm` API. This layer should handle input validation, sanitization, and resource management, preventing direct manipulation of the `ffmpeg.wasm` API from untrusted sources.
    *   **Secure Defaults:**  Use secure default settings for ffmpeg commands and options. Avoid using insecure or potentially dangerous options unless absolutely necessary and properly secured.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the application's API integration with `ffmpeg.wasm` to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

4.  **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for `ffmpeg.wasm` operations. Prevent error messages from revealing sensitive information that could aid attackers.
    *   **Detailed Logging:** Log API calls, input parameters, and ffmpeg execution details for monitoring and incident response. This can help detect and investigate suspicious activity.

#### 4.5 Risk Assessment (Revisited)

The "Abuse ffmpeg.wasm API and Functionality" path remains a **High-Risk Path**. While not directly exploiting vulnerabilities within the WASM code itself, it leverages the intended functionality in unintended and harmful ways. The ease of exploitation (often requiring only crafted API calls) and the potential consequences (DoS, resource exhaustion, unexpected behavior) justify this high-risk classification.

However, by implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of successful API abuse attacks.

#### 4.6 Conclusion

Abusing the `ffmpeg.wasm` API and functionality is a significant security concern for applications utilizing this library. Attackers can exploit the flexibility of ffmpeg's features through the API to cause denial of service, resource exhaustion, and potentially other unintended consequences.

This deep analysis highlights the importance of secure API design and implementation when integrating powerful libraries like `ffmpeg.wasm`. By focusing on input validation, resource management, secure API usage practices, and robust error handling, the development team can effectively mitigate the risks associated with this attack path and build a more secure application. Continuous monitoring and regular security audits are crucial to maintain a strong security posture against API abuse and evolving attack techniques.
