### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Path 1.2.1.1 Injecting Malicious ffmpeg Options

#### 4.1 Threat Description

The core threat is that an attacker can manipulate the behavior of `ffmpeg.wasm` by injecting malicious or unexpected options into the command-line arguments passed to it. This occurs when a web application, through its API, allows user-controlled data to be directly or indirectly used as `ffmpeg` command-line options without proper validation or sanitization.

While `ffmpeg.wasm` operates within the WebAssembly sandbox environment of a web browser, limiting direct system-level access, attackers can still exploit this vulnerability to cause significant harm within the application's context and potentially beyond.

#### 4.2 Technical Details

* **Mechanism:**  Web applications often expose APIs to users for media processing tasks using `ffmpeg.wasm`. These APIs might accept parameters to control aspects of the media conversion, such as input file formats, output formats, codecs, bitrates, and filters. If these API parameters are directly concatenated or incorporated into the `ffmpeg` command string without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject their own `ffmpeg` options.

* **`ffmpeg.wasm` Command Structure:**  `ffmpeg.wasm` is invoked with a command-line style interface, similar to the native `ffmpeg` tool.  The application constructs a command string (or array of arguments) and passes it to `ffmpeg.wasm`.  For example:

   ```javascript
   const ffmpeg = createFFmpeg();
   await ffmpeg.load();
   ffmpeg.run('-i', inputFile, '-codec:v', 'libx264', 'output.mp4');
   ```

   In a vulnerable application, the `inputFile`, `'libx264'`, or `'output.mp4'` could be derived from user input.

* **Injection Point:** The vulnerability lies in the application's code where user-provided data is integrated into the `ffmpeg.run()` command arguments. If the application naively trusts user input and doesn't validate or sanitize it, malicious options can be injected.

* **WASM Sandbox Context:**  `ffmpeg.wasm` executes within the browser's WebAssembly sandbox. This sandbox restricts direct access to the host operating system's file system, network, and other system resources. However, within this sandbox, `ffmpeg.wasm` can still perform operations that are harmful in the application context:
    * **Resource Exhaustion:**  Malicious options can be used to trigger computationally intensive operations within `ffmpeg.wasm`, leading to excessive CPU and memory usage in the browser, potentially causing denial of service for the user or other users of the same application instance.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting options that cause `ffmpeg.wasm` to hang, crash, or consume excessive resources, attackers can effectively deny service to legitimate users.
    * **Unexpected Behavior:**  Malicious options can alter the intended behavior of `ffmpeg.wasm`, leading to incorrect media processing, data corruption, or application malfunctions.
    * **Information Disclosure (Potentially):** While less direct than traditional command injection, carefully crafted options might, in specific scenarios, lead to information leakage through error messages, altered output, or timing differences.  This is less likely in a typical WASM sandbox but should not be entirely dismissed depending on the application's handling of `ffmpeg.wasm` outputs and errors.
    * **Triggering ffmpeg.wasm Vulnerabilities:**  Malicious options could potentially trigger underlying vulnerabilities within `ffmpeg.wasm` itself (if any exist), although this is a less direct consequence of parameter injection and more related to the robustness of `ffmpeg.wasm`.

#### 4.3 Attack Scenario Examples

1. **Resource Exhaustion via `-loop 0` (Image to Video Loop):**

   * **Vulnerable Code (Example):**
     ```javascript
     app.post('/convert', async (req, res) => {
         const inputFile = req.body.inputFile;
         const outputFormat = req.body.outputFormat;
         const ffmpegCommand = ['-i', inputFile, outputFormat]; // Naive command construction
         await ffmpeg.run(...ffmpegCommand);
         // ...
     });
     ```
   * **Malicious Request:**
     ```json
     {
         "inputFile": "image.jpg -loop 0", // Injecting '-loop 0' option
         "outputFormat": "output.mp4"
     }
     ```
   * **Impact:** The `-loop 0` option in `ffmpeg` instructs it to loop the input image indefinitely. This can lead to `ffmpeg.wasm` consuming excessive resources trying to encode an infinitely long video, causing browser slowdown or crash.

2. **Denial of Service via `-re` (Realtime Input):**

   * **Vulnerable Code (Example - Simplified):**
     ```javascript
     function processMedia(input, options) {
         const command = ['-i', input, ...options, 'output.mp4']; // Options directly from user
         ffmpeg.run(...command);
     }
     ```
   * **Malicious Input:**
     ```javascript
     processMedia('input.mp4', ['-re', '-stream_loop', '-1']); // Injecting '-re' and '-stream_loop -1'
     ```
   * **Impact:** The `-re` option tells `ffmpeg` to read input at native frame rate. Combined with `-stream_loop -1` (loop input indefinitely), this can cause `ffmpeg.wasm` to get stuck in a loop, potentially hanging the browser tab or consuming excessive resources.

3. **Altering Output Format/Codec (Unexpected Behavior):**

   * **Vulnerable Code (Example):**
     ```javascript
     app.post('/convert', async (req, res) => {
         const inputFile = req.body.inputFile;
         const codec = req.body.codec;
         const ffmpegCommand = ['-i', inputFile, '-codec:v', codec, 'output.mp4'];
         await ffmpeg.run(...ffmpegCommand);
     });
     ```
   * **Malicious Request:**
     ```json
     {
         "inputFile": "input.mp4",
         "codec": "libvpx -vf scale=1920:1080" // Injecting codec and filter options
     }
     ```
   * **Impact:** While potentially less severe, the attacker can control the output codec and even inject filters (`-vf scale=1920:1080`). This might not be a direct security vulnerability in all cases, but it deviates from the intended application behavior and could be used for malicious purposes depending on the application's context (e.g., bypassing intended output restrictions).

#### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization (Strict Whitelisting):**
   * **Principle:**  Never directly use user-provided input as `ffmpeg` options without strict validation.
   * **Implementation:**
      * **Whitelist Allowed Options:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed `ffmpeg` options that the application will support.
      * **Validate Input Against Whitelist:**  Before constructing the `ffmpeg` command, validate user-provided parameters against this whitelist. Reject any input that doesn't conform to the allowed options or formats.
      * **Sanitize Input Values:** Even for whitelisted options, sanitize the *values* of the options to prevent injection within values (though this is less of a concern for `ffmpeg` options themselves compared to, say, SQL injection, but still good practice).

2. **Abstraction and Parameterization:**
   * **Principle:**  Abstract away direct `ffmpeg` command construction from user input.
   * **Implementation:**
      * **Predefined Configurations:** Offer users a limited set of predefined conversion profiles or configurations instead of allowing them to specify arbitrary `ffmpeg` options.
      * **API Parameter Mapping:** Map user-friendly API parameters to a controlled set of `ffmpeg` options internally.  For example, instead of allowing users to directly specify `-codec:v`, offer options like "quality levels" (low, medium, high) which internally map to specific, safe codec and bitrate settings.

3. **Command Construction Best Practices:**
   * **Use Argument Arrays:** When using `ffmpeg.run()`, pass arguments as an array instead of a single string. This can help prevent some forms of simple injection.
   * **Avoid String Concatenation:**  Minimize string concatenation when building the `ffmpeg` command. Construct the command programmatically using arrays and validated parameters.

4. **Rate Limiting and Resource Monitoring:**
   * **Principle:**  Limit the rate at which users can make requests to the media processing API. Monitor resource usage to detect and mitigate potential DoS attacks.
   * **Implementation:**
      * **Implement Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of requests per user within a given time frame.
      * **Monitor Browser Resource Usage:**  Consider monitoring browser resource usage (though this is limited from the server-side) or implement client-side monitoring to detect and potentially mitigate resource exhaustion attacks.

5. **Security Audits and Testing:**
   * **Principle:** Regularly audit the application's code and APIs to identify potential parameter injection vulnerabilities. Conduct penetration testing to simulate attacks and verify the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

#### 4.5 Detection Methods

* **Code Review:**  Manually review the application's code, specifically focusing on the API endpoints that handle media processing and how user input is used to construct `ffmpeg` commands. Look for instances where user input is directly incorporated into `ffmpeg.run()` without validation.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct penetration testing by attempting to inject various malicious `ffmpeg` options through the API. Monitor the application's behavior and resource usage to identify vulnerabilities.
* **Input Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing techniques to automatically generate a wide range of inputs, including potentially malicious `ffmpeg` options, and test the application's response.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**  While WAFs are primarily designed for server-side attacks, some advanced WAFs might be able to detect patterns of malicious `ffmpeg` options in API requests, especially if combined with custom rules. However, relying solely on WAFs is not sufficient; proper input validation in the application code is crucial.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Log API requests and `ffmpeg.wasm` execution details. Monitor for unusual patterns in `ffmpeg` commands or resource consumption that might indicate an ongoing attack.

#### 4.6 Impact Assessment

* **Denial of Service (High):**  Resource exhaustion and application slowdown leading to DoS is a highly likely and significant impact.
* **Unexpected Application Behavior (Medium):**  Altering output formats, codecs, or triggering unexpected `ffmpeg` behavior can disrupt the intended functionality of the application.
* **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium):**  While less direct, there's a potential for information leakage depending on the application's error handling and output processing.
* **Triggering ffmpeg.wasm Vulnerabilities (Low):**  Less likely, but malicious options could potentially trigger underlying vulnerabilities in `ffmpeg.wasm` itself.
* **Data Corruption (Low to Medium):**  Depending on the injected options, there's a possibility of corrupting output media files.

#### 4.7 Likelihood Assessment

* **High:** Parameter injection vulnerabilities are common in web applications, especially when developers are not fully aware of the risks of directly using user input in command execution contexts (even within WASM).  The ease of exploitation and the potential for significant impact make this a high-likelihood vulnerability if proper mitigation is not implemented.

#### 4.8 Risk Level

* **Critical Node, High-Risk Path:**  As indicated in the attack tree, this path is correctly identified as critical and high-risk. The potential for denial of service and unexpected application behavior, combined with the relatively high likelihood of exploitation, warrants serious attention and robust mitigation measures.

#### 4.9 Conclusion

The "Injecting Malicious ffmpeg Options" attack path represents a significant security risk for web applications using `ffmpeg.wasm`.  While the WASM sandbox provides a degree of isolation, it does not eliminate the potential for harm.  Developers must prioritize secure coding practices, particularly strict input validation and sanitization, to prevent parameter injection vulnerabilities. Implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, such as input whitelisting, abstraction, and robust command construction, is crucial to protect applications and users from the potential consequences of this attack. Regular security audits and testing are essential to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of these security measures.
