# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm

## Mitigation Strategy: [Subresource Integrity (SRI) for `ffmpeg.wasm`](./mitigation_strategies/subresource_integrity__sri__for__ffmpeg_wasm_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Generate the SRI hash for the `ffmpeg.wasm` file you intend to use. This can be done using online SRI hash generators or command-line tools like `openssl dgst -sha384 -binary ffmpeg.wasm | openssl base64 -no-newlines`.
    2.  When including `ffmpeg.wasm` in your HTML using a `<script>` tag, add the `integrity` attribute with the generated hash and the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute.
    3.  Example: `<script src="https://cdn.example.com/ffmpeg.wasm" integrity="sha384-YOUR_GENERATED_HASH" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`
    4.  Ensure the hash is updated whenever you update the `ffmpeg.wasm` version.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **CDN Compromise/Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):**  An attacker compromises the CDN or intercepts the network request to replace `ffmpeg.wasm` with a malicious version, leading to execution of untrusted code within the browser via `ffmpeg.wasm`.
    *   **File Tampering (High Severity):**  If self-hosting, an attacker gains access to your server and modifies the `ffmpeg.wasm` file, again leading to execution of a compromised `ffmpeg.wasm` in the browser.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CDN Compromise/Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High reduction. SRI ensures the browser verifies the integrity of the fetched `ffmpeg.wasm` file, preventing execution of a compromised script.
    *   **File Tampering:** High reduction.  SRI, if implemented correctly and the hash is securely managed, prevents execution of a tampered `ffmpeg.wasm` file.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in the project's `index.html` file when loading `ffmpeg.wasm` from a CDN. The SRI hash is generated during the build process and automatically injected into the HTML.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Not applicable as SRI is implemented for CDN loading. If the project were to switch to self-hosting `ffmpeg.wasm`, SRI should also be implemented for the self-hosted file.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular `ffmpeg.wasm` Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular__ffmpeg_wasm__updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Subscribe to the `ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm` GitHub repository's release notifications or security advisories.
    2.  Periodically check for new releases of `ffmpeg.wasm` on the official repository or npm (if using npm package).
    3.  Review release notes and security advisories for each new version to understand the changes and security patches included in `ffmpeg.wasm` itself or its underlying FFmpeg version.
    4.  Update the `ffmpeg.wasm` dependency in your project to the latest stable version.
    5.  Thoroughly test your application after updating `ffmpeg.wasm` to ensure compatibility and no regressions are introduced in your application's interaction with the updated `ffmpeg.wasm`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in FFmpeg/WASM (High Severity):** Older versions of `ffmpeg.wasm` may contain known security vulnerabilities inherited from underlying FFmpeg or introduced during the WASM compilation process. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities if present in the `ffmpeg.wasm` version used by the application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in FFmpeg/WASM:** High reduction. Updating to the latest `ffmpeg.wasm` version patches known vulnerabilities within `ffmpeg.wasm` and its core FFmpeg, significantly reducing the attack surface.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. The development team has a reminder to check for updates monthly, but the process is manual and not consistently followed for `ffmpeg.wasm` specifically.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automate the update process for `ffmpeg.wasm` by integrating dependency vulnerability scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline that specifically monitor `ffmpeg.wasm` and its dependencies.
    *   Implement automated testing to run after `ffmpeg.wasm` updates to quickly identify regressions in application functionality related to `ffmpeg.wasm`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input File Type Whitelisting for `ffmpeg.wasm` Processing](./mitigation_strategies/input_file_type_whitelisting_for__ffmpeg_wasm__processing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define a strict whitelist of allowed input file types (e.g., `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mov`) that your application will process *using `ffmpeg.wasm`*.
    2.  Implement client-side validation (JavaScript) to check the file extension of uploaded files against the whitelist *before passing them to `ffmpeg.wasm`*.
    3.  Implement server-side validation (if files are uploaded to a server before `ffmpeg.wasm` processing) to re-verify the file type and potentially use file magic number checks for more robust validation *before allowing `ffmpeg.wasm` to process them*.
    4.  Reject files that do not match the allowed file types and provide informative error messages to the user, preventing them from being processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Processing of Malicious Files by `ffmpeg.wasm` (Medium to High Severity):**  Users might upload files specifically crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in FFmpeg's processing of certain file formats or container formats when handled by `ffmpeg.wasm`.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion in `ffmpeg.wasm` (Medium Severity):** Processing unexpected or malformed file types by `ffmpeg.wasm` could lead to excessive resource consumption within the browser, causing application slowdown or crashes due to `ffmpeg.wasm` operations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Processing of Malicious Files by `ffmpeg.wasm`:** Medium to High reduction. Whitelisting reduces the attack surface for `ffmpeg.wasm` by limiting the types of files it processes, making it harder to exploit format-specific vulnerabilities within `ffmpeg.wasm`/FFmpeg.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion in `ffmpeg.wasm`:** Medium reduction.  Restricting file types can prevent `ffmpeg.wasm` from processing file formats known to be resource-intensive or problematic for FFmpeg, mitigating DoS risks related to `ffmpeg.wasm` usage.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Client-side validation is implemented in JavaScript to check file extensions against a basic whitelist (`.mp4`, `.webm`) before files are processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Server-side validation is missing. Files are directly passed to `ffmpeg.wasm` in the browser after client-side validation, without server-side re-verification before `ffmpeg.wasm` processing.
    *   File magic number validation is not implemented for more robust file type verification before `ffmpeg.wasm` processing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input File Size Limits for `ffmpeg.wasm` Processing](./mitigation_strategies/input_file_size_limits_for__ffmpeg_wasm__processing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Determine reasonable maximum file size limits for input files *that will be processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`*, based on your application's use case and available browser resources for `ffmpeg.wasm` operations.
    2.  Implement client-side validation (JavaScript) to check the file size of uploaded files before *passing them to `ffmpeg.wasm` for processing*.
    3.  Implement server-side validation (if applicable) to re-verify file size limits *before allowing `ffmpeg.wasm` to process the files*.
    4.  Reject files exceeding the size limits and provide informative error messages to the user, preventing `ffmpeg.wasm` from attempting to process them.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion in `ffmpeg.wasm` (High Severity):**  Users might upload extremely large files that, when processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`, consume excessive browser memory and CPU, leading to application crashes or browser freezes specifically due to `ffmpeg.wasm` operations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion in `ffmpeg.wasm`:** High reduction. Limiting file sizes directly prevents `ffmpeg.wasm` from processing excessively large files, mitigating resource exhaustion attacks specifically targeting `ffmpeg.wasm` operations.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Client-side file size limit of 100MB is implemented in JavaScript, preventing files larger than this from being processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Server-side file size validation is missing, meaning if client-side validation is bypassed, there's no server-side check before `ffmpeg.wasm` processing (if files are uploaded to a server first).
    *   The file size limit for `ffmpeg.wasm` processing is a fixed value and not configurable based on user roles or application load related to `ffmpeg.wasm` usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Command Argument Sanitization for `ffmpeg.wasm`](./mitigation_strategies/command_argument_sanitization_for__ffmpeg_wasm_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all user-controlled inputs that are used to construct `ffmpeg.wasm` commands (e.g., filenames, format options, filters *passed to `ffmpeg.wasm`*).
    2.  Implement robust sanitization and escaping of these inputs before *passing them as arguments to `ffmpeg.wasm` commands*.
    3.  Use parameterized commands or command-line argument parsing libraries if available in `ffmpeg.wasm` (though direct parameterization might be limited in `ffmpeg.wasm`).
    4.  Specifically, escape shell-sensitive characters (e.g., `;`, `&`, `|`, `$`, `` ` ``, `\`, `*`, `?`, `~`, `!`, `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, `<`, `>`, `^`, `"`, `'`, `[`, `]`, `#`, ` `, `\t`, `\n`, `\r`, `\f`) to prevent command injection vulnerabilities *within the `ffmpeg.wasm` command execution context*.
    5.  Consider using whitelisting for allowed command options and values *passed to `ffmpeg.wasm`* instead of blacklisting dangerous characters.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection in `ffmpeg.wasm` Commands (High Severity):**  Attackers might manipulate user inputs to inject malicious commands into the `ffmpeg.wasm` command line. While the browser sandbox limits the impact, command injection could still lead to unexpected behavior, data manipulation within the `ffmpeg.wasm` context, or potentially sandbox escapes in vulnerable browser versions (though less likely with WASM).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection in `ffmpeg.wasm` Commands:** High reduction. Proper sanitization and escaping of command arguments effectively prevents command injection attacks within `ffmpeg.wasm` command execution by neutralizing malicious characters.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic sanitization is implemented by replacing spaces in filenames with underscores before passing them to `ffmpeg.wasm` commands.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive escaping of all shell-sensitive characters is not implemented for arguments passed to `ffmpeg.wasm`.
    *   Whitelisting of allowed command options for `ffmpeg.wasm` is not implemented.
    *   No dedicated command-line argument parsing library is used for constructing `ffmpeg.wasm` commands.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout for `ffmpeg.wasm` Operations](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_for__ffmpeg_wasm__operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement a timeout mechanism for all `ffmpeg.wasm` operations.
    2.  Set a reasonable timeout duration based on the expected processing time for typical `ffmpeg.wasm` operations and the application's performance requirements related to `ffmpeg.wasm` usage.
    3.  Use `Promise.race` with a timeout promise and the `ffmpeg.wasm` operation promise to enforce the timeout for `ffmpeg.wasm` commands.
    4.  If the timeout is reached, terminate the `ffmpeg.wasm` operation gracefully, display an error message to the user indicating a timeout in `ffmpeg.wasm` processing, and prevent further resource consumption by the timed-out `ffmpeg.wasm` command.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion from `ffmpeg.wasm` (Medium Severity):**  Malicious or unexpected inputs could cause `ffmpeg.wasm` operations to run indefinitely, consuming browser resources and leading to DoS specifically due to prolonged `ffmpeg.wasm` execution.
    *   **Runaway `ffmpeg.wasm` Processes (Medium Severity):**  Bugs or unexpected behavior in `ffmpeg.wasm` itself or the application logic could lead to `ffmpeg.wasm` operations that never complete, tying up browser resources allocated to `ffmpeg.wasm`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion from `ffmpeg.wasm`:** Medium reduction. Timeouts prevent `ffmpeg.wasm` operations from running indefinitely, limiting resource consumption in DoS scenarios caused by `ffmpeg.wasm`.
    *   **Runaway `ffmpeg.wasm` Processes:** Medium reduction. Timeouts act as a safety net to terminate `ffmpeg.wasm` operations that get stuck due to bugs or unexpected conditions within `ffmpeg.wasm` or its interaction with the application.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No timeout mechanism is currently implemented for `ffmpeg.wasm` operations.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Timeout needs to be implemented for all `ffmpeg.wasm` command executions.
    *   The timeout duration for `ffmpeg.wasm` operations should be configurable and potentially adjustable based on the type of `ffmpeg.wasm` operation being performed.
