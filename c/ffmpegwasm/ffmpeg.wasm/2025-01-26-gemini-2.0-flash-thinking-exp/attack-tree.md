## Attack Tree Path: [1. Attack Goal: Compromise Application via ffmpeg.wasm [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__attack_goal_compromise_application_via_ffmpeg_wasm__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized control or access through vulnerabilities related to ffmpeg.wasm.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit ffmpeg.wasm Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_ffmpeg_wasm_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Focuses on directly exploiting weaknesses within the ffmpeg.wasm library itself. This is a primary avenue for attack.
*   **Sub-Paths:** Includes Input Manipulation Attacks and Supply Chain Attacks (both High-Risk Paths).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Input Manipulation Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__input_manipulation_attacks__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities by providing malicious or unexpected input to ffmpeg.wasm.
*   **High-Risk Attack Vector:**
    *   **Malformed Media File Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Mechanism:**  Providing crafted media files (images, videos, audio) as input to ffmpeg.wasm.
        *   **Vulnerability:** Exploiting parsing vulnerabilities in ffmpeg decoders (buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string bugs) triggered by these malformed inputs.
        *   **Impact:**
            *   Client-Side Code Execution: Arbitrary code execution within the browser.
            *   Denial of Service (DoS): Crashing or hanging ffmpeg.wasm or the browser tab.
            *   Information Disclosure: Leaking sensitive data from browser memory.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
        *   **Effort:** Medium-High
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium-Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Input Validation & Sanitization: Strict validation of media file formats, codecs, and metadata.
            *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Restrict script execution and resource loading.
            *   Regular Updates: Keep ffmpeg.wasm updated.
            *   Sandboxing & Isolation: Leverage browser's WASM sandboxing.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Supply Chain Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__supply_chain_attacks__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Compromising the supply chain of ffmpeg.wasm to inject malicious code.
*   **High-Risk Attack Vector:**
    *   **Compromised npm Package (ffmpeg.wasm Dependency) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Mechanism:** Attacker compromises the npm package repository or the ffmpeg.wasm package itself.
        *   **Vulnerability:** Malicious code injected into the ffmpeg.wasm package or its dependencies during build or release.
        *   **Impact:**
            *   Backdoor Installation: Injecting malicious code into the application.
            *   Data Theft: Stealing application data, user credentials.
            *   Application Takeover: Gaining full control over the application.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
        *   **Effort:** Medium-High
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium-High
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Dependency Verification: Use package integrity checks (`npm audit`, `yarn audit`, `--integrity`).
            *   Secure Dependency Management: Use dependency lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`).
            *   Source Code Review: Review source code (if feasible).
            *   Monitor Security Advisories: Subscribe to security advisories.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Application Integration Weaknesses (Amplifying ffmpeg.wasm Risks) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5__application_integration_weaknesses__amplifying_ffmpeg_wasm_risks___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Weaknesses in how the application integrates with ffmpeg.wasm, which can amplify the risks from ffmpeg.wasm vulnerabilities.
*   **Sub-Paths:** Includes Insecure Input Handling and Insecure Output Handling (both High-Risk Paths).

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Insecure Input Handling (Application Side) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6__insecure_input_handling__application_side___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Application failing to properly validate or sanitize user input before passing it to ffmpeg.wasm.
*   **Mechanism:** Lack of input validation on the application side.
*   **Vulnerability:** Allows injection of malformed media files or malicious options that can exploit ffmpeg.wasm vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Amplifies the impact of Input Manipulation Attacks on ffmpeg.wasm (Code Execution, DoS, Information Disclosure).
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy-Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Input Validation & Sanitization (Application): Robust input validation *before* interacting with ffmpeg.wasm.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Only pass necessary and validated data to ffmpeg.wasm.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Insecure Output Handling (Application Side) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/7__insecure_output_handling__application_side___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Application improperly handling the output from ffmpeg.wasm (e.g., displaying raw output without sanitization).
*   **Mechanism:**  Displaying raw ffmpeg.wasm output without sanitization.
*   **Vulnerability:** If ffmpeg.wasm output contains malicious content, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts into the application's frontend.
    *   Content Spoofing: Displaying misleading or malicious content.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Output Sanitization: Sanitize and encode ffmpeg.wasm output before displaying it.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Mitigate XSS impact.
    *   Context-Aware Output Handling: Handle different output types securely.
