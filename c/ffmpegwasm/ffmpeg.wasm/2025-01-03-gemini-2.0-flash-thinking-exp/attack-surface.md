# Attack Surface Analysis for ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Media Files](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_media_files.md)

**Description:**  `ffmpeg.wasm` processes potentially untrusted media files. These files can be engineered to exploit vulnerabilities within FFmpeg's parsing and decoding logic.

**How ffmpeg.wasm Contributes:**  By using `ffmpeg.wasm`, the application directly exposes itself to the wide range of media formats and codecs that FFmpeg handles, inheriting the associated parsing complexity and potential vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A user uploads a specially crafted MP4 file that triggers a buffer overflow in the H.264 decoder within `ffmpeg.wasm`.

**Impact:**  Could lead to denial of service (browser tab crash), unexpected behavior, or potentially, though less likely due to WASM's sandboxing, memory corruption within the WASM module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Validation:**  Implement checks on the file type and basic structure before passing it to `ffmpeg.wasm`. This can help filter out obviously malicious or unexpected files.
* **Regular Updates:** Ensure the application uses the latest version of `ffmpeg.wasm`, which incorporates security patches from upstream FFmpeg.
* **Sandboxing:** Rely on the browser's WASM sandbox to limit the damage from potential exploits within `ffmpeg.wasm`.
* **Resource Limits:**  Implement timeouts or resource limits on `ffmpeg.wasm` processing to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the ffmpeg.wasm Build and Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_ffmpeg.wasm_build_and_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The `ffmpeg.wasm` library is a compiled version of FFmpeg. Vulnerabilities can exist in the specific FFmpeg version used for the build or in the build process itself.

**How ffmpeg.wasm Contributes:** The application directly depends on the security of the `ffmpeg.wasm` build. If the build is compromised or uses a vulnerable FFmpeg version, the application is vulnerable.

**Example:** The `ffmpeg.wasm` library is built using an older version of FFmpeg that has a known critical vulnerability in its MP3 decoder.

**Impact:**  The application inherits the vulnerabilities present in the underlying FFmpeg version, potentially leading to the same impacts as maliciously crafted media files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Verify Source:**  Obtain `ffmpeg.wasm` from trusted and reputable sources (e.g., the official `ffmpegwasm` repository or verified npm packages).
* **Dependency Scanning:**  Use tools to scan the `ffmpeg.wasm` library and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Updates:**  Keep the `ffmpeg.wasm` library updated to benefit from security patches in the underlying FFmpeg codebase.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks on ffmpegwasm Distribution](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_on_ffmpegwasm_distribution.md)

**Description:** The `ffmpeg.wasm` library is typically obtained from a package manager or CDN. This opens the possibility of supply chain attacks where the distribution is compromised.

**How ffmpeg.wasm Contributes:**  The application relies on the integrity of the `ffmpeg.wasm` package it downloads. A compromised package directly injects malicious code into the application.

**Example:** An attacker compromises the npm package for `ffmpeg.wasm` and injects malicious code that steals user data when the library is loaded.

**Impact:**  Potentially full compromise of the application's frontend, leading to data theft, malicious actions on behalf of the user, or redirection to phishing sites.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Verify Package Integrity:** Use checksums or other verification methods to ensure the downloaded `ffmpeg.wasm` package is authentic.
* **Use Trusted Repositories:** Obtain `ffmpeg.wasm` from well-established and trusted repositories.
* **Dependency Pinning:**  Pin the specific version of `ffmpeg.wasm` used in the application to prevent unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.
* **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** If loading `ffmpeg.wasm` from a CDN, use SRI to ensure the integrity of the fetched file.
