## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Trigger Memory Corruption](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_trigger_memory_corruption.md)

**Attack Vector:** Providing malformed media files to `ffmpeg.wasm`.

**Description:** An attacker crafts or modifies media files in a way that exploits parsing vulnerabilities within the `ffmpeg.wasm` library. This can lead to buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or other memory corruption issues during the decoding or processing of the file.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  If the memory corruption allows the attacker to read arbitrary memory locations, they might be able to extract sensitive data being processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`.
*   **Denial of Service:** The memory corruption can cause `ffmpeg.wasm` to crash, leading to a denial of service for the user attempting to use the media processing functionality.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** In some scenarios, controlled memory corruption might be leveraged to execute arbitrary code within the WASM sandbox, although this is generally more complex.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Expose Sensitive Information through Processing](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_expose_sensitive_information_through_processing.md)

**Attack Vector:** Processing sensitive data with `ffmpeg.wasm` without proper sanitization.

**Description:** If the application uses `ffmpeg.wasm` to process sensitive information (e.g., redacting parts of a video, converting audio with private conversations) and does not adequately sanitize the output or intermediate files, an attacker can potentially access this information. This could involve intercepting network traffic, examining browser storage, or accessing temporary files created by `ffmpeg.wasm`.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Data Breach:**  Direct exposure of sensitive user data, leading to privacy violations, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** Compromise of proprietary information or trade secrets if processed by `ffmpeg.wasm`.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Influence Application State through ffmpeg.wasm Output](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_influence_application_state_through_ffmpeg.wasm_output.md)

**Attack Vector:** Manipulating the output of `ffmpeg.wasm` to influence the application's state.

**Description:** An attacker crafts input that causes `ffmpeg.wasm` to produce specific output (e.g., manipulated metadata, altered stream information, crafted error messages). The application, trusting this output, uses it to update its internal state or make decisions. This can lead to the application entering an unintended or vulnerable state.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Functional Errors:** The application might start behaving incorrectly due to the manipulated state.
*   **Circumvention of Security Checks:**  The altered state could bypass security checks or authorization mechanisms within the application.
*   **Further Exploitation:** The compromised state might create opportunities for other attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node & High-Risk Path: Client-Side Manipulation of ffmpeg.wasm Execution](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high-risk_path_client-side_manipulation_of_ffmpeg.wasm_execution.md)

**Attack Vector:** Modifying client-side JavaScript to execute `ffmpeg.wasm` with malicious parameters or on arbitrary files.

**Description:** If the application relies solely on client-side JavaScript to control how `ffmpeg.wasm` is used, an attacker can easily modify this JavaScript code (e.g., through browser developer tools or by compromising other parts of the client-side application). This allows them to execute `ffmpeg.wasm` with any desired parameters and on any files accessible to the browser.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker could use `ffmpeg.wasm` to process local files and send the output to a remote server.
*   **Local Denial of Service:**  Executing `ffmpeg.wasm` with resource-intensive parameters or on large files can freeze the user's browser or consume excessive resources.
*   **Abuse of Application Functionality:** The attacker could trigger unintended actions within the application by manipulating how `ffmpeg.wasm` is used.
