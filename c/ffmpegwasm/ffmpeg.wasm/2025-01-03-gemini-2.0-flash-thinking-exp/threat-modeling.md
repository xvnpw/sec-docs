# Threat Model Analysis for ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm

## Threat: [Compromised `ffmpeg.wasm` Package](./threats/compromised_`ffmpeg.wasm`_package.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise the `ffmpeg.wasm` package on npm or other distribution channels by injecting malicious code during the build or release process. This could involve replacing the legitimate package with a backdoored version.

**Impact:**  If the application uses the compromised package, the attacker could execute arbitrary code within the user's browser, potentially leading to data exfiltration, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** The entire `ffmpeg.wasm` package as distributed.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Verify the integrity of the `ffmpeg.wasm` package using checksums or signatures provided by the official repository.
*   Monitor the official `ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm` GitHub repository for any unusual activity or security advisories.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in the `ffmpeg.wasm` package and its dependencies.
*   Consider using a private or internal registry for dependencies to control the supply chain.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies within `ffmpeg.wasm`](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies_within_`ffmpeg.wasm`.md)

**Description:** The underlying native `ffmpeg` library has its own dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies, even if seemingly mitigated during the WebAssembly compilation, could potentially be exploitable in the WASM environment or through the JavaScript API. An attacker might leverage these vulnerabilities by crafting specific inputs or interactions.

**Impact:**  Memory corruption, denial-of-service, or potentially even remote code execution within the WASM sandbox (though less likely to escape the browser's sandbox).

**Affected Component:**  Underlying native libraries used by `ffmpeg`, exposed through `ffmpeg.wasm`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `ffmpeg.wasm` updated to the latest version, as updates often include security patches for underlying dependencies.
*   Review the release notes and changelogs of `ffmpeg.wasm` for information on addressed vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories related to the native `ffmpeg` project.

## Threat: [Malicious Media Files Exploiting Codec Vulnerabilities](./threats/malicious_media_files_exploiting_codec_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Users could upload or provide specially crafted media files designed to exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the specific media codecs used by `ffmpeg.wasm`. The attacker manipulates the file structure or data to trigger a flaw in the decoding process.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Causing `ffmpeg.wasm` to crash or consume excessive resources, making the application unresponsive.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Triggering buffer overflows or other memory safety issues within `ffmpeg.wasm`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or even arbitrary code execution within the WASM sandbox.

**Affected Component:** Specific media codecs implemented within `ffmpeg.wasm` (e.g., H.264 decoder, MP3 decoder).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on media files before passing them to `ffmpeg.wasm`.
*   Limit the size and type of media files accepted by the application.
*   Consider using a separate, sandboxed environment (if feasible) for processing untrusted media files.
*   Keep `ffmpeg.wasm` updated to benefit from patches for known codec vulnerabilities.
