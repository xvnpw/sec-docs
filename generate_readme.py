SPONSORSHIP = """## Support **sec-docs**  

**sec-docs** is an ambitious project that enhances open-source software security through AI-powered documentation. We analyze major OSS projects to provide comprehensive security insights that help developers build more secure applications.

### Why This Project Matters  

Open-source software powers much of today's digital infrastructure, but security documentation is often incomplete, inconsistent, or outdated. This can leave projects vulnerable to attacks, misconfigurations, and other security risks.  

**sec-docs** solves this problem by leveraging advanced AI models to:  
- Automatically analyze OSS projects to create comprehensive, tailored security documentation.  
- Simplify complex security concepts, making them accessible to a wider audience of developers.  
- Update documentation dynamically as codebases evolve.  

This effort empowers developers to secure their projects more effectively and enhances trust in open-source software.  

### Why We Need Your Support  

Using large language models like **o1** and **o1-pro** incurs high costs. To generate meaningful documentation for just one project, the process consumes over **over dozens of thousands of tokens**, leading to substantial expenses. About **~15$** per project.  

Here's what your support will help fund:  
1. **AI Model Access**: Covering the costs of API calls and subscriptions to premium LLM services.  

### How You Can Help  

Your contributions will enable **sec-docs** to expand its reach and deliver critical security documentation to more OSS projects. Together, we can make open-source software safer for everyone.  

Consider sponsoring the project through:  
- **GitHub Sponsors** (https://github.com/sponsors/xvnpw)   

### Thank You  

Your support means the world to us and the broader open-source community. Let's work together to make open-source software more secure, one project at a time.
