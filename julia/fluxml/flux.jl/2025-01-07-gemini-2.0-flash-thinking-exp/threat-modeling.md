# Threat Model Analysis for fluxml/flux.jl

## Threat: [Model Tampering (Backdooring)](./threats/model_tampering__backdooring_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the trained model parameters (weights and biases) and modifies them. This could occur through compromised storage locations or insecure transfer protocols after the model has been trained using Flux. The attacker might introduce subtle biases that are difficult to detect but trigger specific malicious behavior under certain conditions.
*   **Impact:** The model behaves in a way that benefits the attacker, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or manipulation of application outcomes. The backdoor might be designed to be triggered by specific inputs or conditions, making it hard to detect through standard testing.
*   **Affected Flux Component:** Affects the saved model representation (e.g., after using `BSON.@save`), and the loading process (`BSON.@load`). Impacts all model layers and parameters managed by Flux.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access controls and encryption for model storage and transfer.
    *   Use integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic hashes) to verify the authenticity and integrity of saved models.
    *   Regularly audit model storage and access logs.
    *   Consider techniques like model watermarking to detect unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized representation of a Flux model or related objects managed by Flux. When the application attempts to deserialize this data (e.g., using `Serialization.deserialize` or potentially custom serialization methods used in conjunction with Flux objects), it triggers the execution of arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, steal sensitive data, or launch further attacks.
*   **Affected Flux Component:**  Relevant if the application uses Julia's built-in `Serialization` or other unsafe deserialization techniques for saving and loading Flux models or related data structures like optimizers or custom layers.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using insecure deserialization methods like `Serialization.deserialize` on untrusted data related to Flux models.
    *   Prefer safer serialization formats like JSON or BSON where code execution is less likely, and ensure their usage doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities.
    *   If custom serialization is necessary for Flux objects, carefully sanitize and validate the data being deserialized.
    *   Implement sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of potential code execution.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion / Denial of Service (DoS) via Input Manipulation](./threats/resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service__dos__via_input_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted input data directly to the deployed Flux model during inference. This input is designed to exploit computational bottlenecks within the model architecture defined in Flux or its processing pipeline, causing excessive consumption of CPU, memory, or GPU resources managed by Flux.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, denying service to legitimate users. This can lead to business disruption and financial losses.
*   **Affected Flux Component:** Primarily affects the model's forward pass (`model(input)`), and potentially custom layers or operations defined within the Flux model. The architecture and complexity of the model defined using Flux components play a crucial role.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization to reject abnormally large or complex inputs before they reach the Flux model.
    *   Set resource limits (e.g., memory limits, timeouts) for inference requests involving Flux models.
    *   Employ rate limiting to prevent attackers from sending a large volume of malicious requests to the Flux model.
    *   Monitor resource usage during inference involving Flux models and implement alerts for unusual spikes.
    *   Consider techniques like input shaping or model optimization to reduce the computational cost of processing inputs within the Flux model.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Model Definition (if dynamically constructed using Flux)](./threats/code_injection_via_model_definition__if_dynamically_constructed_using_flux_.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to provide or influence the definition of the Flux model itself (e.g., through a configuration file, API input, or user-provided code snippets that are directly used to define Flux layers or architectures), a malicious actor could inject arbitrary Julia code into the model definition. This code would then be executed when the model is created or during training initiated by Flux.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, steal sensitive data, or launch further attacks.
*   **Affected Flux Component:** Affects any code that dynamically constructs Flux models using Flux's API based on external input, such as using `eval` or metaprogramming techniques with untrusted data to define layers, optimizers, or training loops within the Flux ecosystem.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid dynamically constructing Flux models based on untrusted input.
    *   Use a predefined and vetted set of allowed model architectures and parameters within Flux.
    *   If dynamic model construction using Flux is absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict validation and sanitization of all user-provided input before it is used to define Flux components.
    *   Employ sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of potential code execution during Flux model creation or training.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flux.jl relies on other Julia packages for its functionality. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities through the application that uses Flux. This could involve malicious data processing within a vulnerable dependency utilized by Flux or even remote code execution within the Flux environment.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It can range from denial of service or unexpected behavior within Flux to remote code execution affecting the entire application.
*   **Affected Flux Component:**  Indirectly affects the entire Flux library as its functionality depends on its dependencies. This includes core modules like `Flux.NNlib`, `Zygote`, and others that Flux relies upon.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability in the dependency)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Flux.jl and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the dependency tree of Flux.
    *   Pin dependency versions in the `Project.toml` file to ensure consistent and tested versions are used with Flux.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Flux.jl and its direct and indirect dependencies.
