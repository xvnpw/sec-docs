## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Flux.jl (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_flux_jl__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Any successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities listed below will lead to the compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Model Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_model_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target weaknesses in the machine learning model itself to manipulate its behavior or gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Model Replacement (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/model_replacement__critical_node_.md)

The attacker's goal is to substitute the legitimate machine learning model with a malicious one under their control. This allows them to dictate the application's behavior related to the model.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Model Loading (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_model_loading__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

The application loads machine learning models from untrusted sources without proper verification of their integrity or origin.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Maliciously Crafted Model File](./attack_tree_paths/provide_maliciously_crafted_model_file.md)

The attacker provides a model file that has been intentionally designed to cause harm, such as executing arbitrary code when loaded or producing biased/incorrect outputs for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Flux.jl or its Dependencies (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_execution_vulnerabilities_in_flux_jl_or_its_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

Attackers aim to execute arbitrary code within the application's environment by exploiting flaws in the Flux.jl library or its underlying dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Flux.jl Core (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_flux_jl_core__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target inherent bugs or security flaws within the core Flux.jl library code itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Bugs Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution (Less Likely but Possible) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_bugs_leading_to_arbitrary_code_execution__less_likely_but_possible___critical_node_.md)

By crafting specific inputs or triggering certain conditions, an attacker can exploit a bug in Flux.jl that allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Flux.jl relies on other Julia packages. Attackers target known security vulnerabilities in these third-party dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/identify_outdated_or_vulnerable_dependencies.md)

The attacker identifies which dependencies Flux.jl uses and checks for known security flaws in those specific versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Known Exploits in those Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_exploits_in_those_dependencies.md)

Once a vulnerable dependency is identified, the attacker uses publicly available exploits or crafts their own to take advantage of the flaw, potentially leading to code execution or other compromises.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Misuse or Vulnerabilities in Application's Flux.jl Integration (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_misuse_or_vulnerabilities_in_application's_flux_jl_integration__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit flaws in how the application's code interacts with the Flux.jl library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Model Loading (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_model_loading__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

The application's code directly loads models from untrusted sources without proper validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Load Models from Untrusted Sources Without Validation](./attack_tree_paths/load_models_from_untrusted_sources_without_validation.md)

The application fetches and loads model files from locations that are not controlled or verified, allowing an attacker to substitute a malicious model.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Input Validation (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_input_validation__high_risk_path_.md)

The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided data before feeding it into Flux.jl functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data Directly into Flux Functions](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_directly_into_flux_functions.md)

Attackers provide crafted input data that exploits vulnerabilities in Flux.jl or causes unexpected behavior, potentially leading to errors, crashes, or even code execution in some scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

The application uses serialization (e.g., to save and load models) and is vulnerable to attacks during the deserialization process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Serialized Model Objects (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_serialized_model_objects__critical_node_.md)

Attackers craft malicious serialized model objects that, when deserialized by the application, execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft a Serialized Model Containing Executable Code](./attack_tree_paths/craft_a_serialized_model_containing_executable_code.md)

The attacker creates a specially crafted serialized data stream that, when the application attempts to reconstruct the model, executes malicious code within the application's environment.
