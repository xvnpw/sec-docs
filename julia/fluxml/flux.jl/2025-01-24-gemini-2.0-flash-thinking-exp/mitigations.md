## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Dependency Audits (for Flux.jl and its dependencies)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dependency_audits__for_flux_jl_and_its_dependencies_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Schedule:** Define a recurring schedule for dependency audits (e.g., monthly, quarterly) focusing on Flux.jl and packages it depends on.
    2.  **Tooling:** Utilize Julia's built-in `Pkg` commands (`Pkg.status --outdated`) to identify outdated packages within your Flux.jl project environment.
    3.  **Execution:**  Run `Pkg.status --outdated` and manually review `Manifest.toml` and `Project.toml` for Flux.jl and its related packages.
    4.  **Vulnerability Research:** For outdated Flux.jl or its dependencies, check for known security vulnerabilities using resources like general vulnerability databases by searching for the package name and version.
    5.  **Remediation:** If vulnerabilities are found in Flux.jl or its dependencies, prioritize updates using `Pkg.update <package_name>`.
    6.  **Documentation:** Document the audit process, findings, and remediation steps specifically related to Flux.jl and its ecosystem.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Flux.jl Dependencies (High Severity):** Exploits in outdated dependencies of Flux.jl can indirectly compromise the application's machine learning functionality.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation through known vulnerabilities in Flux.jl's dependency chain.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No. Dependency updates for Flux.jl and related packages are performed reactively, not proactively on a schedule.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs to be implemented as a scheduled task within the development workflow and CI/CD pipeline, specifically targeting Flux.jl and its dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Serialization Formats (for Flux.jl Models)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_serialization_formats__for_flux_jl_models_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Default to Binary for Flux Models:**  Always use Julia's built-in `Serialization.serialize` and `Serialization.deserialize` for saving and loading Flux.jl models, as they use a binary format.
    2.  **Avoid Text-Based Formats for Flux Models:**  Strictly avoid using text-based formats like JSON or YAML for direct serialization of Flux.jl model objects.
    3.  **Format Documentation:** Document that binary serialization using Julia's `Serialization` is the standard and enforced method for persisting Flux.jl models.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Flux.jl Model Tampering (Medium Severity):** Binary formats make manual editing of serialized Flux.jl models significantly harder compared to text-based formats, reducing the risk of unauthorized modification.
    *   **Injection Attacks (Low to Medium Severity):** Binary formats are generally less susceptible to injection attacks when deserializing Flux.jl models compared to text-based formats.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces the risk of Flux.jl model tampering and potential injection attacks by using a less human-readable and harder-to-manipulate format.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes. Julia's built-in `Serialization` is generally used for Flux.jl model persistence in most parts of the project.

    2.  **Structural Checks Post-Flux.jl Deserialization:** After deserializing a Flux.jl model using `Serialization.deserialize`, programmatically inspect its structure using Flux.jl's introspection capabilities (e.g., accessing `model.layers`, checking `size(param)` for parameters).
    3.  **Verification Against Expected Structure:** Compare the actual structure of the deserialized Flux.jl model with the pre-defined expected structure.
    4.  **Error Handling for Structural Mismatches:** If the deserialized Flux.jl model's structure deviates from the expected structure, raise an error and prevent the application from using this potentially compromised model. Log the structural discrepancy.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Flux.jl Model Substitution/Tampering (Medium Severity):** Detects basic forms of malicious replacement or modification of Flux.jl models that alter their fundamental architecture.
*   **Impact:** Minimally to Moderately reduces the risk of simple Flux.jl model substitution or tampering by verifying the basic structural integrity of deserialized models. It is not a comprehensive defense against sophisticated attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No. Deserialized Flux.jl models are currently loaded and used without explicit structural validation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs to be implemented in the model loading functions to include structural checks after deserializing Flux.jl models, using Flux.jl's API for model introspection.
