# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a high-performance and flexible deep learning library for the Julia programming language.
  - Enable researchers and practitioners to efficiently develop, train, and deploy machine learning models.
  - Foster innovation and adoption of Julia in the machine learning community.
  - Maintain a user-friendly and well-documented library to lower the barrier to entry for deep learning.
- Business Risks:
  - Competition from established deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could lead to data breaches or model manipulation in user applications.
  - Lack of community adoption and contribution could hinder the library's growth and sustainability.
  - Performance bottlenecks or instability could discourage users and limit real-world applicability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Public code repository on GitHub, facilitating community review and issue reporting. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Issue tracking system for bug reports and feature requests. Implemented in: GitHub Issues.
  - security control: Version control system (Git) for managing code changes and releases. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Open source licensing, allowing for broad scrutiny and community contributions to security. Implemented in: LICENSE file in repository.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies that are not immediately identified and patched.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and remediation.
  - accepted risk: Limited resources for dedicated security testing and code audits.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to detect potential code vulnerabilities.
  - recommended security control: Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning to identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - recommended security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - recommended security control: Encourage and facilitate security code reviews by experienced developers and security experts.
  - recommended security control: Implement fuzz testing to identify potential crash-causing inputs and edge cases.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the library itself, as it is a software library and not a service requiring user authentication. However, authentication might be relevant in systems built using Flux.jl for model serving or data access.
  - Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is not a primary concern for the library itself. Authorization controls would be implemented in applications or services that utilize Flux.jl to manage access to models, data, or functionalities.
  - Input Validation: Critical for the library to handle various input data types and shapes robustly and securely. Input validation should be implemented in core functions to prevent unexpected behavior, crashes, or potential vulnerabilities when processing user-provided data or model inputs. This is especially important in the context of adversarial machine learning attacks.
  - Cryptography: Cryptographic functionalities might be relevant for:
    - Securely storing and loading trained models, especially if they contain sensitive information or intellectual property.
    - Implementing privacy-preserving machine learning techniques like federated learning or differential privacy within the library.
    - Ensuring secure communication channels if the library interacts with external services or systems for data retrieval or model deployment.

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer commits code changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
  - A Continuous Integration (CI) environment (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered upon code changes (e.g., push, pull request).
  - The CI environment performs the following steps:
    - Checkout code from the Git repository.
    - Build the Flux.jl library and related packages using Julia's build tools.
    - Run automated tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - Perform Static Application Security Testing (SAST) using tools to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
    - Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using dependency scanning tools.
    - Package the build artifacts (Julia packages) for distribution.
  - Security scan results are collected and analyzed. Failures in security checks or tests can halt the build process.
  - If the build and security checks are successful, the build artifacts (Julia packages) are published to a package registry (e.g., Julia Pkg Registry, GitHub Releases) for distribution to users.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development, maintenance, and distribution of the Flux.jl library.
  - Community adoption and usage of Flux.jl for machine learning research and applications.
  - Maintaining the reputation and trustworthiness of Flux.jl as a reliable deep learning framework.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The Flux.jl library itself does not directly handle sensitive data. However, models built with Flux.jl can process various types of data, including potentially sensitive data depending on the application.
  - The sensitivity of data processed by models built with Flux.jl is determined by the users and applications of the library, not the library itself.
  - The integrity and security of the Flux.jl library are crucial to ensure the trustworthiness and security of models built using it, especially when those models process sensitive data. A vulnerability in Flux.jl could potentially be exploited to compromise models or data in downstream applications.
