# Threat Model Analysis for fluxml/flux.jl

## Threat: [Code Injection via Malicious Model Definition](./threats/code_injection_via_malicious_model_definition.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in how the application handles user-provided model definitions. They might inject malicious Julia code within a configuration file or through an API endpoint that is then executed during the model construction process by functions within `Flux.Chain` or custom layer definitions.
- **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the server or within the application's environment. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
- **Affected Flux.jl Component:** Model Definition (potentially involving modules like `Flux.Chain`, `Flux.Dense`, or user-defined layers).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid allowing users to directly define model architectures through raw code.
    - If user input is necessary for model configuration, use a safe and restricted schema or configuration language (e.g., JSON Schema with whitelisted values).
    - Sanitize and validate any user-provided input used in model definitions. Escape special characters and validate data types.
    - Implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized modification of model definition code.

## Threat: [Exploiting Unsafe Deserialization of Model Files](./threats/exploiting_unsafe_deserialization_of_model_files.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious saved model file (e.g., using `BSON.@save` in conjunction with Flux.jl's model saving mechanisms) containing embedded code or objects that, when deserialized by the application using `BSON.@load`, could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the server or within the application's environment when the malicious model is loaded. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
- **Affected Flux.jl Component:** Model Persistence (specifically functions related to saving and loading models, potentially involving interactions with `BSON`).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Only load model files from trusted and verified sources.
    - Implement integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic signatures or checksums) to verify the authenticity of model files before loading.
    - Consider sandboxing or isolating the environment where model loading occurs.
    - Regularly review and update the BSON.jl package, as vulnerabilities in the serialization library can impact Flux.jl.

## Threat: [Data Poisoning through Manipulated Training Data](./threats/data_poisoning_through_manipulated_training_data.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious or subtly altered data into the training dataset used by the Flux.jl model. This manipulated data could cause the model to learn incorrect patterns, leading to biased or incorrect predictions during inference.
- **Impact:**  Compromised model integrity, leading to unreliable or biased predictions. This could have significant consequences depending on the application's purpose (e.g., incorrect classifications, flawed recommendations).
- **Affected Flux.jl Component:** Training Process (data loading and processing pipelines used directly with Flux.jl for training).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all training data before it's used by Flux.jl.
    - Verify the integrity and authenticity of data sources.
    - Monitor training metrics for anomalies that might indicate data poisoning.
    - Consider using techniques like anomaly detection on the training data itself.
    - Implement data provenance tracking to understand the origin and transformations of the data used in Flux.jl.

## Threat: [Adversarial Attacks on Model Inference](./threats/adversarial_attacks_on_model_inference.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could craft adversarial examples â€“ carefully designed inputs that are subtly different from legitimate inputs but cause the Flux.jl model to make incorrect predictions. This could be used to bypass security measures or manipulate the application's behavior.
- **Impact:**  Incorrect or manipulated outputs from the model, potentially leading to security breaches, financial losses, or other undesirable outcomes depending on the application.
- **Affected Flux.jl Component:** Inference/Prediction (the process of feeding input data to a trained Flux.jl model to obtain predictions).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement input validation and sanitization even for inference data before it's processed by the Flux.jl model.
    - Consider using adversarial training techniques to make the model more robust against adversarial examples within Flux.jl.
    - Implement input monitoring and anomaly detection to identify potentially adversarial inputs before they reach the Flux.jl model.
    - Limit the information revealed by the model's confidence scores or internal states.
