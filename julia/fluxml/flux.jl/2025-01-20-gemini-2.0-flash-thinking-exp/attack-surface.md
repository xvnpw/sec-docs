# Attack Surface Analysis for fluxml/flux.jl

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Models](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_models.md)

- **Description:** An application loads a serialized Flux.jl model from an untrusted source (e.g., user upload, external network). The deserialization process can execute arbitrary code embedded within the malicious model file.
- **How Flux.jl Contributes:** Flux.jl provides functionalities to save and load models, often using formats like BSON. This functionality, while necessary, becomes an attack vector when the source of the model is not trusted.
- **Example:** A user uploads a seemingly legitimate model file to a web application. This file, however, contains serialized Julia code within the model definition that, upon loading by the application using `Flux.loadmodel`, executes a reverse shell, granting the attacker access to the server.
- **Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. Attackers can gain complete control, steal data, or disrupt operations.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Only load models from trusted sources: Restrict model loading to internal, verified sources or use secure channels with strong authentication and integrity checks.
    - Input validation on model paths/sources: Sanitize and validate any user-provided input related to model loading to prevent path traversal or access to malicious files.
    - Implement integrity checks: Use cryptographic signatures or checksums to verify the integrity of model files before loading.
    - Sandboxing/Isolation: Load and process models in isolated environments (e.g., containers, virtual machines) with limited privileges to contain potential damage.
    - Regularly audit model sources: If relying on external model repositories, regularly audit their security and trustworthiness.

## Attack Surface: [Execution of Arbitrary Code via Custom Layers/Functions](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_arbitrary_code_via_custom_layersfunctions.md)

- **Description:** An application allows users or external sources to provide custom layers or loss functions that are then used within the Flux.jl model. Maliciously crafted custom components can contain arbitrary Julia code that gets executed.
- **How Flux.jl Contributes:** Flux.jl's flexibility allows for the definition and integration of custom layers and functions, which is a powerful feature but introduces the risk of executing untrusted code.
- **Example:** A plugin system for a machine learning application allows users to upload custom layers. An attacker uploads a layer definition that, when instantiated by Flux.jl during model construction or training, executes system commands to exfiltrate data.
- **Impact:** High. Potential for arbitrary code execution within the application's context, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Strictly control the source of custom components: Only allow custom layers/functions from trusted developers or internal teams.
    - Code review and static analysis: Thoroughly review the code of any custom layers or functions before integration. Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    - Sandboxing/Isolation: Execute custom layers and functions in isolated environments with restricted permissions.
    - Input validation on custom component definitions: Validate the structure and content of custom layer/function definitions to prevent malicious code injection.
    - Consider a restricted API for custom components: If possible, provide a more restricted API for defining custom logic that limits the ability to execute arbitrary code.
