## Mitigation Strategy: [Adversarial Training (Flux.jl Integration)](./mitigation_strategies/adversarial_training__flux_jl_integration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Adversarial Example Generation (within Flux.jl):**  Use Flux.jl's automatic differentiation capabilities (`gradient` function) to calculate the gradients needed for adversarial attack methods (FGSM, PGD, etc.).  This is done *within* the training loop.  Example (FGSM):
        ```julia
        using Flux

        function fgsm_attack(model, x, y, ϵ)
          gs = gradient(params(model)) do
            loss(model(x), y) # Assuming a loss function 'loss'
          end
          δ = ϵ .* sign.(gs[x]) # Perturbation
          return x + δ
        end
        ```
    2.  **Modified Training Loop (Flux.jl):** Integrate the adversarial example generation into the Flux.jl training loop.  This typically involves:
        *   Fetching a batch of data (`x`, `y`).
        *   Generating adversarial examples (`x_adv = fgsm_attack(model, x, y, ϵ)`).
        *   Optionally, combining clean and adversarial examples.
        *   Calculating the loss on both clean and/or adversarial examples.
        *   Updating the model parameters using Flux.jl's optimizers (`update!(opt, params(model), grads)`).
    3.  **Hyperparameter Control (Flux.jl):**  Expose hyperparameters (e.g., `ϵ`, number of PGD iterations) as configurable parameters within the Flux.jl training script or configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Model Poisoning (Adversarial Examples):** (Severity: High) - Directly addresses the vulnerability to crafted inputs.
    *   **Model Stealing (Partial Mitigation):** (Severity: Medium) - Makes the model slightly more robust, hindering black-box extraction.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Model Poisoning:** Significant reduction in vulnerability to adversarial attacks.
    *   **Model Stealing:** Minor reduction; other methods are more effective.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* "FGSM is implemented within the `train.jl` file, directly using Flux.jl's `gradient` function.  The training loop is modified to include adversarial examples."
    *   *Example:* "Not implemented."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:* "PGD implementation is missing.  A separate module for adversarial attacks would improve code organization.  Hyperparameter tuning is currently manual."
    *   *Example:* "Requires full implementation: creating functions for adversarial attacks using Flux.jl's AD, modifying the training loop, and adding hyperparameter controls."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (Flux.jl Integration)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__flux_jl_integration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Preprocessing Pipeline (Flux.jl Compatible):**  Implement input validation checks *within* the data preprocessing pipeline that feeds data to the Flux.jl model.  This ensures checks are applied *before* the model sees the data.
    2.  **Range Checks (Flux.jl):** Use Julia's standard comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) within the preprocessing functions to enforce range constraints.  Example:
        ```julia
        function preprocess(x)
          # ... other preprocessing ...
          @assert all(0 .<= x .<= 1) "Input values out of range [0, 1]" # Example for normalized data
          return x
        end
        ```
    3.  **Norm Constraints (Flux.jl):** Use Flux.jl's `norm` function (or Julia's `LinearAlgebra.norm`) to calculate input norms and enforce limits.  Example:
        ```julia
        using Flux: norm # Or using LinearAlgebra: norm

        function preprocess(x)
          # ... other preprocessing ...
          @assert norm(x, Inf) <= max_norm "Input L-infinity norm exceeds limit"
          return x
        end
        ```
    4. **Distribution Checks (Pre-Model):** While the core statistical tests might not *directly* use Flux, the data preparation and triggering of alerts based on the test results should be integrated into the preprocessing or model serving code that interacts with Flux.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Model Poisoning (Adversarial Examples):** (Severity: Medium) - Helps filter out-of-distribution or excessively perturbed inputs.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents large or malformed inputs from reaching the model.
    *   **Data Poisoning (Partial):** (Severity: Low) - Can detect some anomalous training data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Model Poisoning:** Moderate risk reduction; complements adversarial training.
    *   **DoS:** Significant risk reduction by preventing resource exhaustion at the model level.
    *   **Data Poisoning:** Limited impact; primarily for outlier detection.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* "Range checks are implemented in the `preprocess` function using standard Julia comparisons.  Norm constraints are not yet implemented."
    *   *Example:* "Not implemented."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:* "Norm constraints need to be added using Flux.jl's `norm` function.  Integration with distribution checks (results handling) is also needed."
    *   *Example:* "Full implementation required: integrating range checks and norm constraints into the preprocessing functions using Flux.jl-compatible operations."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Model Serialization Security (Flux.jl-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/model_serialization_security__flux_jl-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `JLD2.jl` (with Flux.jl):**  When saving and loading Flux.jl models, *always* use the `JLD2.jl` package.  Example:
        ```julia
        using Flux, JLD2

        # Saving
        model = Chain(...) # Your Flux model
        JLD2.save("model.jld2", "model", model)

        # Loading
        model = JLD2.load("model.jld2", "model")
        ```
    2.  **Schema Validation (Pre-Loading):**
        *   **Define Schema:** Create a Julia data structure (e.g., a `Dict` or a custom type) that represents the expected model architecture.
        *   **Load Architecture Separately:**  `JLD2.jl` allows loading specific parts of a file.  Load *only* the model architecture information *first*.
        *   **Compare with Schema:** Compare the loaded architecture with the predefined schema.  Use Julia's comparison operators and data structure manipulation to check for discrepancies.
        *   **Load Weights (Conditionally):**  *Only* if the architecture matches the schema, proceed to load the model weights.
        * This requires careful structuring of how you save the model (separating architecture and weights).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Code Execution):** (Severity: High) - Prevents loading and executing malicious code embedded in a compromised model file.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk of arbitrary code execution.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* "`JLD2.jl` is used for saving and loading models.  Schema validation is not yet implemented."
    *   *Example:* "Not implemented."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:* "Schema validation needs to be implemented.  This requires defining a schema, modifying the model saving/loading code to separate architecture and weights, and adding comparison logic."
    *   *Example:* "Full implementation required: using `JLD2.jl`, implementing schema validation by loading architecture separately and comparing it to a predefined schema before loading weights."
