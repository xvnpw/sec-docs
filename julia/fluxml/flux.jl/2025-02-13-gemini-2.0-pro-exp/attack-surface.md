# Attack Surface Analysis for fluxml/flux.jl

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_code_execution_via_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code into serialized model files, which is executed when the model is loaded.
    *   **How Flux.jl Contributes:** Flux.jl's common practice of saving and loading models using serialization (BSON.jl, JLD2.jl, etc.) creates this vulnerability.  The *way* Flux models are typically used makes this a direct and significant risk.  While the serialization libraries themselves are the ultimate source of the vulnerability, the *pattern of use* within the Flux ecosystem makes this a Flux-related attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a malicious "model.bson" file that, when loaded with `BSON.load("model.bson")`, executes arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Load Untrusted Models:**  Strictly avoid loading models from unverified sources. This is the most important mitigation.
        *   **Input Validation & Integrity Checks:** If external models are *unavoidable*, implement rigorous checks: digital signatures, checksums, and source verification.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate the model loading process in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container with limited privileges) to limit the impact of potential exploits.
        *   **Safe Deserialization Libraries:**  Use serialization libraries with a strong security record and actively patched against known vulnerabilities.  Continuously research the security posture of BSON.jl, JLD2.jl, or any other library used for model persistence. Consider alternatives if available and suitable.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the model loading and execution with the *absolute minimum* necessary permissions. This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve code execution.

## Attack Surface: [Model Poisoning (Data Poisoning) - *Conditional Inclusion*](./attack_surfaces/model_poisoning__data_poisoning__-_conditional_inclusion.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers manipulate the training data to subtly alter the model's behavior.
    *   **How Flux.jl Contributes:**  This is a *conditional* inclusion.  While data poisoning is a general ML risk, Flux.jl's *training APIs* are the direct mechanism through which a poisoned model is created *using Flux*.  If the attacker is using Flux's training loop (`train!`, custom training loops, etc.), then this is a *direct* Flux-related attack surface. If the attacker is using a completely separate training pipeline and only *loading* the resulting model into Flux, it's less direct.  I'm including it because the training process is often tightly integrated with Flux.
    *   **Example:** An attacker adds subtly modified images to a training dataset, causing a Flux.jl-trained image classification model to misclassify specific objects.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect model predictions, leading to security breaches, financial losses, or other negative consequences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Provenance & Integrity:** Maintain *absolute* control over the training data pipeline.  Verify the source and integrity of *all* training data.  This is paramount.
        *   **Data Validation & Anomaly Detection:** Implement robust data validation and anomaly detection techniques to identify and remove potentially poisoned data *before* it reaches the Flux training process.
        *   **Adversarial Training:** Train the model (using Flux's training capabilities) on adversarial examples to improve its robustness to poisoned data. This is a proactive defense.
        *   **Model Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the model's performance in production for unexpected behavior, which could indicate poisoning.
