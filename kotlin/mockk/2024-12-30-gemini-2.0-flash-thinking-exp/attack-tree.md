**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Influence Application Behavior via Mock Manipulation:**
    *   This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has managed to manipulate the application's behavior through exploiting weaknesses related to MockK. This could lead to various negative outcomes depending on the specific manipulation.

*   **Compromise Mock Definitions:**
    *   Attackers aim to gain control over the code that defines how mocked dependencies behave during testing.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Direct Code Injection:**  Involves directly modifying the test files where mock definitions are located.
            *   **Exploit vulnerabilities in development environment access controls:** This includes exploiting weaknesses in systems like Git repositories, development servers, or developer workstations to gain unauthorized access and modify files.

*   **Compromise the Test Environment:**
    *   Attackers target the infrastructure where tests are executed, such as CI/CD pipelines or dedicated test servers.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Gain Access to Test Environment Infrastructure:**
            *   **Exploit vulnerabilities in the test environment's infrastructure (e.g., Jenkins, CI/CD pipelines):** This involves exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the software and systems used to manage and execute tests.
            *   **Use compromised credentials of developers or testers:**  Attackers obtain valid usernames and passwords through phishing, social engineering, or data breaches, allowing them to log in and control the test environment.

*   **Exploit Developer Misuse of MockK:**
    *   This focuses on how developers might unintentionally introduce vulnerabilities through improper use of the MockK library.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Overly Permissive Mocking of Security-Critical Components:**
            *   **Mock authentication or authorization services to always return success:** Developers might create mocks that bypass authentication or authorization checks, leading to tests passing even when these critical security measures are not properly implemented in the real application.
            *   **Mock input validation logic to allow malicious input:** Mocks might be configured to accept any input, even those that should be rejected by validation logic, masking potential input validation vulnerabilities.

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Compromise Mock Definitions via Direct Code Injection by Exploiting Development Environment Access Controls:**
    *   This path involves an attacker exploiting security weaknesses in the development environment to gain access and directly modify test files containing mock definitions. This allows them to inject malicious logic into the mocks, potentially masking real vulnerabilities or introducing backdoors.

*   **Compromise Test Environment via Infrastructure Exploitation:**
    *   Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the software and systems that make up the test environment infrastructure (e.g., CI/CD tools). Successful exploitation grants them control over the test execution process, allowing them to inject malicious mocks or bypass critical tests.

*   **Compromise Test Environment via Credential Compromise:**
    *   Attackers obtain legitimate credentials of developers or testers and use them to gain unauthorized access to the test environment. This access allows them to manipulate tests, mock definitions, and the overall testing process.

*   **Exploit Developer Misuse - Overly Permissive Mocking of Security-Critical Components (Mocking Authentication/Authorization or Input Validation):**
    *   Developers create overly permissive mocks for security-sensitive parts of the application. This leads to a false sense of security during testing, as vulnerabilities related to authentication, authorization, or input validation are not properly exercised and can slip into production.
