* **Compromised Developer Machine Leading to Malicious Test Code**
    * **Description:** An attacker gains control of a developer's machine and modifies test code that utilizes MockK for malicious purposes.
    * **How MockK Contributes:** MockK's powerful mocking capabilities can be leveraged in malicious test code to interact with various parts of the application or external systems during test runs.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies a test to use MockK to bypass authentication checks or inject malicious data into a mocked service interaction.
    * **Impact:**  Introduction of vulnerabilities into the codebase, exfiltration of sensitive data from the development environment, manipulation of build artifacts.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce strong security practices on developer machines (endpoint security, disk encryption).
        * Implement code review processes for test code changes.
        * Use version control systems and track changes to test files.
        * Restrict access to sensitive development resources.

* **Overly Permissive Mocking Masking Underlying Issues**
    * **Description:** Developers create mocks using MockK that are too lenient and accept a wide range of inputs or return generic values, failing to properly validate interactions.
    * **How MockK Contributes:** MockK's flexibility allows developers to create mocks that accept a wide range of inputs or return generic values. If not carefully designed, these overly permissive mocks can mask underlying issues or vulnerabilities in the code being tested, as the tests might pass even with incorrect behavior.
    * **Example:** A mock for an authentication service always returns "success" regardless of the provided credentials, hiding a potential authentication bypass vulnerability.
    * **Impact:**  Failure to detect security vulnerabilities during testing, leading to vulnerable code in production.
    * **Risk Severity:** Medium  *(Note: While previously categorized as Medium, the impact of failing to detect vulnerabilities can be critical. Re-evaluating based on the potential consequence)*
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Emphasize the importance of creating specific and realistic mocks.
        * Encourage the use of argument matchers in MockK to enforce specific input validation.
        * Promote thorough testing practices beyond just mocking, including integration and end-to-end tests.
