# Threat Model Analysis for mockk/mockk

## Threat: [Threat: Masking of Authentication Bypass (Critical)](./threats/threat_masking_of_authentication_bypass__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application's authentication logic. The developer has *incorrectly* mocked the authentication service (`AuthService`) using an overly permissive configuration like `every { authService.authenticate(any()) } returns true`.  This mock *always* grants access, regardless of the input. The attacker can bypass authentication because the real `AuthService` has a flaw, but the mock hides it.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application and its data. The attacker can impersonate any user, potentially gaining full control.
*   **Affected MockK Component:** `every` (function mocking), `returns` (return value stubbing), `any()` (argument matcher). The critical issue is the *combination* of these, creating an "always allow" mock.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Test Negative Cases:** Create tests that *specifically* attempt to bypass authentication with invalid credentials. The mock *must* be configured to return `false` or throw an appropriate exception in these negative test cases.
    *   **Use `verify` with Specific Matchers:** Verify that the `authenticate` method is called with the *expected* parameters (e.g., using `eq()` with valid and invalid credentials). This ensures the authentication logic is exercised, even with a mock.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Include integration tests that use a real authentication service (or a very close test double) to catch bypass vulnerabilities that mocks might miss.  This is crucial for authentication.

## Threat: [Threat: Data Leakage via Mocked API Responses (High)](./threats/threat_data_leakage_via_mocked_api_responses__high_.md)

*   **Description:** A developer *hardcodes sensitive data* (API keys, passwords, PII) directly into a mock's return value using `every { externalService.getData() } returns "{\"apiKey\": \"SECRET_KEY\", ...}"`. An attacker gains access to the codebase, test reports, or build artifacts and extracts this sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential information. This can lead to account compromise, data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
*   **Affected MockK Component:** `every` (function mocking), `returns` (return value stubbing). The core problem is the *inclusion of secrets* within the mock configuration itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Hardcode Secrets:** This is the most important mitigation.  Secrets should *never* be directly in the code, including mock configurations.
    *   **Use Environment Variables:** Load sensitive data from environment variables or configuration files, even in test environments. The mock can then return values read from these sources.
    *   **Secrets Management Systems:** Employ a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and retrieve sensitive data securely, even during testing.
    *   **Data Masking/Anonymization:** If the *exact* value isn't crucial for the test, use placeholder or anonymized data in the mock response.

## Threat: [Threat: Denial of Service (DoS) due to Unhandled Exceptions in Mocked Dependencies (High)](./threats/threat_denial_of_service__dos__due_to_unhandled_exceptions_in_mocked_dependencies__high_.md)

*   **Description:** A developer mocks a dependency (e.g., a database or external API) but *fails to simulate error conditions*. The mock is configured to *always* return success, even when the real dependency would throw exceptions (network errors, timeouts, etc.).  `every { database.query(any()) } returns listOf(...)` *without* any `throws` configurations. An attacker triggers these error conditions in production, causing the application to crash because the error handling logic was never properly tested.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime and loss of service availability.  This can disrupt users and potentially lead to financial losses.
*   **Affected MockK Component:** `every` (function mocking), `returns` (return value stubbing), *lack of use of* `throws` (exception stubbing). The critical issue is the *incomplete simulation of the dependency's behavior*, specifically its failure modes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Test Error Handling Explicitly:** Create dedicated tests that *specifically* simulate error conditions. Use `every { ... } throws ...` to configure the mock to throw the appropriate exceptions (e.g., `IOException`, `TimeoutException`, custom exceptions).
    *   **Resilience Testing:** Incorporate chaos engineering principles into testing.  Deliberately inject failures (using mocks or other techniques) to test the application's ability to handle unexpected errors.
    *   **Integration Tests (for critical dependencies):** While unit tests with mocks are valuable, integration tests that interact with real (or realistic test doubles of) dependencies are essential for verifying error handling in a more realistic environment.
