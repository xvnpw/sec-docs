## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulate Mock Behavior to Influence Application Logic [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulate_mock_behavior_to_influence_application_logic__high_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a high-risk path because attackers can directly control the behavior of mocked dependencies, potentially altering the application's logic in malicious ways. This is especially dangerous if the application doesn't properly validate data from mocks or if test configurations can influence production behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [1a. Inject Malicious Data via Mocked Objects [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/1a__inject_malicious_data_via_mocked_objects__high_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker configures a mock to return crafted data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the application. This could include:
    *   **SQL Injection:** If the mocked object interacts with a database, the attacker could inject SQL code to read, modify, or delete data.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the mocked object's output is displayed in a web page, the attacker could inject JavaScript code to steal cookies, redirect users, or deface the site.
    *   **Command Injection:** If the mocked object interacts with the operating system, the attacker could inject commands to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** The attacker could provide overly long strings to trigger buffer overflows in the application code that processes the mock's output.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on input validation).
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (depending on the injected data).
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [1b. Bypass Security Checks via Mocked Methods [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1b__bypass_security_checks_via_mocked_methods__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker leverages a mock that bypasses a security check (authentication, authorization, input validation, etc.). This is extremely dangerous if this mocked behavior is inadvertently used in a production environment.  For example, a mock for an `isAuthenticated()` method might always return `true`.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (assuming some separation of test and production).
*   **Impact:** High (direct security bypass).
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Weaknesses in Test Code Leveraged in Prod [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_weaknesses_in_test_code_leveraged_in_prod__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical, high-risk path. The presence of test code, including mocks, in a production environment creates a massive security vulnerability.  It indicates a fundamental failure in the deployment process.

## Attack Tree Path: [4a. Mocked Security Checks Allow Bypass [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4a__mocked_security_checks_allow_bypass__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most direct and dangerous consequence of having test code in production.  Mocks designed to simplify testing (e.g., always authenticating a user) become exploitable vulnerabilities.  This is essentially the same vulnerability as 1b, but with a much higher likelihood of exploitation if test code is accessible.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (should be low, but mistakes happen).
*   **Impact:** High (complete security bypass).
*   **Effort:** Low.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.
