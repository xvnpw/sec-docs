# Attack Surface Analysis for mockk/mockk

## Attack Surface: [Unexpected Behavior Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/unexpected_behavior_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  Altering the intended behavior of the application through manipulation of MockK's mocking mechanisms.
*   **How MockK Contributes:** MockK *directly* enables replacing real object behavior with mock implementations.  If an attacker can influence this process (e.g., compromised dependency, configuration error allowing test code in production), they control the mock's behavior, *directly* impacting application logic.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies a configuration file (if MockK uses one, which is discouraged) to make a mock authentication service always return `true`, bypassing login checks. Or, a compromised dependency injects malicious code that *directly* alters MockK's runtime behavior.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application crashes, incorrect business logic execution, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if MockK is inadvertently used in production).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Code Separation:**  The most critical mitigation.  Ensure test code (including MockK) is *completely* isolated from production code. Use build tools, CI/CD pipelines, and code organization best practices.  *Never* deploy test code.
    *   **Configuration Validation:** If MockK configuration is loaded externally (discouraged), rigorously validate and sanitize it. Prefer programmatic configuration within test code.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** If mocks interact with external resources (discouraged), grant them the absolute minimum permissions.
    *   **Regular MockK Updates:** Keep MockK updated to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Spying on Sensitive Data (Information Disclosure)](./attack_surfaces/spying_on_sensitive_data__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** Using MockK's `spyk` function to observe and potentially leak sensitive data.
*   **How MockK Contributes:** `spyk` *directly* allows monitoring real object interactions, including arguments and return values. This *direct* observation capability, if misused, exposes sensitive data.
*   **Example:**  A developer uses `spyk` on a method that handles user passwords during testing. If test logs are insecure, or test code leaks into production, passwords are *directly* exposed via MockK's functionality.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (passwords, API keys, personal data).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is involved).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Code Separation:** Ensure `spyk` is *only* used in test code and *never* in production.
    *   **Avoid Spying on Sensitive Operations:** Be extremely cautious when using `spyk` on methods handling sensitive data. Consider alternative testing strategies (mocking dependencies *of* the sensitive component).
    *   **Secure Test Logs:** Ensure test logs are stored securely and inaccessible to unauthorized users.

## Attack Surface: [Mocking of Security-Critical Components (Bypass)](./attack_surfaces/mocking_of_security-critical_components__bypass_.md)

*   **Description:**  Using MockK to create mocks that *directly* bypass the real security logic of the application.
*   **How MockK Contributes:** MockK *directly* allows replacing *any* component with a mock, including security components (authentication, authorization, cryptography). This *direct* replacement capability is the core of the risk.
*   **Example:** A developer mocks the `AuthenticationService` to always return `true`, *directly* disabling authentication checks. If this mock is accidentally used in production, it creates a *direct* and critical vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, cryptographic weakness, complete compromise of security mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if mocks of security components are used incorrectly in production).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Direct Mocking of Security Components:** Instead of mocking the entire security component, mock the *dependencies* of that component. This allows the real security logic to be tested.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Use integration tests to verify the interaction between your code and the *real* security components.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review any code that mocks security-related functionality. Ensure mocks are used appropriately and are *not* bypassing security checks.
