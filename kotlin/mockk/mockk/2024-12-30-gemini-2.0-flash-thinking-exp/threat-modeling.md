Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving the MockK library:

*   **Threat:** Compromised MockK Dependency
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the MockK library on a public repository (e.g., Maven Central). They might upload a malicious version with the same name and version number, or compromise the repository itself. Developers unknowingly download and use this compromised version of MockK.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** The malicious MockK library could contain code to steal sensitive data from the development environment.
        *   **Supply Chain Attack:** The compromised MockK library could inject malicious code into the application's build process.
        *   **Test Manipulation:** The malicious MockK library could alter test results to hide vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected MockK Component:** The entire library artifact (`mockk` dependency).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to monitor dependencies for changes and potential threats.
        *   Pin specific versions of MockK in build files to avoid automatic updates to potentially compromised versions.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies using checksums or signatures if available.
        *   Consider using a private artifact repository with security scanning capabilities.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities within the MockK Library
    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a security vulnerability within the MockK library's code itself. This could involve crafting specific inputs or scenarios that trigger unexpected behavior leading to code execution or other malicious outcomes within the testing environment *through MockK's functionality*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Testing Environment:** A severe vulnerability in MockK could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the development or testing environment.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** A vulnerability in MockK might allow an attacker to access sensitive information from the testing environment's memory or file system *via MockK's internal mechanisms*.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) in Testing:** An attacker could craft inputs that cause MockK to crash or become unresponsive, disrupting the testing process.
    *   **Affected MockK Component:** Various modules or functions within the core `mockk` library depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., argument matching logic, internal state management, proxy generation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest MockK releases and security advisories.
        *   Monitor MockK's issue tracker and security mailing lists for reported vulnerabilities and apply necessary updates promptly.
        *   Contribute to or support security audits of the MockK library to identify potential vulnerabilities proactively.
        *   Isolate the testing environment to limit the potential damage from a successful exploit.
