# Threat Model Analysis for mockk/mockk

## Threat: [Incorrect Mock Setup Masking Security Vulnerabilities](./threats/incorrect_mock_setup_masking_security_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker benefits from security tests passing due to flawed mock configurations *within MockK*. For example, using MockK's `every` block to define a mock for an authentication service that always returns "success," hiding a real authentication bypass vulnerability. The attacker can then exploit this bypass in the actual application.

**Impact:** Security vulnerabilities remain undetected, leading to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security compromises.

**Affected MockK Component:** Mock setup and verification mechanisms (e.g., `every`, `verify`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review mock configurations created using MockK's API to ensure they accurately reflect the behavior of real dependencies, including error and failure scenarios.
* Implement code reviews for test code that utilizes MockK, paying close attention to mock setups.
* Consider using property-based testing to generate a wider range of inputs and scenarios for mocks defined with MockK.

## Threat: [Malicious Mock Implementation (Internal Threat Scenario)](./threats/malicious_mock_implementation__internal_threat_scenario_.md)

**Description:** A malicious insider could intentionally create deceptive mocks *using MockK's features* that pass all tests but introduce subtle vulnerabilities or backdoors when the application interacts with real dependencies. This could involve mocks defined with MockK that behave differently under specific, attacker-controlled conditions.

**Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors that can be exploited for unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.

**Affected MockK Component:** Mock definitions and behavior specifications created using MockK's API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rigorous code review processes, especially for test code that utilizes MockK.
* Enforce separation of duties and access controls within the development team.
* Utilize static analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns in test code that defines mocks using MockK.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in MockK Dependencies Exploited](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_mockk_dependencies_exploited.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in the libraries that MockK depends on. This could potentially allow for remote code execution or other malicious activities if the application using MockK is vulnerable through these transitive dependencies.

**Impact:** Compromise of the application or the environment it runs in, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other security incidents.

**Affected MockK Component:** Transitive dependencies of the MockK library.

**Risk Severity:** Depends on the severity of the dependency vulnerability (can range from low to critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update MockK and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in MockK's dependency tree.
