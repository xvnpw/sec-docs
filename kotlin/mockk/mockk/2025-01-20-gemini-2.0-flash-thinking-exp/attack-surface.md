# Attack Surface Analysis for mockk/mockk

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Mock Definitions in Tests](./attack_surfaces/malicious_mock_definitions_in_tests.md)

* **Description:** Developers might intentionally or unintentionally create mock definitions within tests that, if executed in a more privileged environment or against shared resources, could cause harmful side effects.
    * **How MockK Contributes:** MockK provides the flexibility to define arbitrary behavior for mocked objects using constructs like `every { ... } returns ...`, `answers { ... }`, and `throws { ... }`. This power allows for the creation of mocks that perform actions beyond simple value returning.
    * **Example:** A test might mock a database interaction to always return success, even when the real database operation would fail. If this test is accidentally run against a production-like database, it could mask critical errors or allow invalid data to be persisted. Another example is a mock that triggers an external API call with a destructive payload.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, unintended modifications to shared resources, bypassing security checks, triggering external system vulnerabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Code Reviews for Test Code:**  Thoroughly review test code, especially mock definitions, to ensure they only simulate intended behavior and do not have unintended side effects.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege in Tests:** Design tests to interact with the system under test in a way that minimizes potential harm, even if mocks behave unexpectedly.
        * **Environment Isolation:** Ensure test environments are strictly isolated from production and other sensitive environments to prevent accidental execution of harmful mock behaviors.
        * **Avoid Mocking External Systems in Integration Tests (When Possible):** For integration tests, consider using test containers or in-memory databases instead of mocking external dependencies to ensure realistic interactions.
        * **Clear Naming Conventions for Mocks:** Use naming conventions that clearly indicate a mock is for testing purposes only.
