## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Vulnerabilities in MockK Library Itself](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_mockk_library_itself.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path involves an attacker discovering and exploiting a security vulnerability within the MockK library's code itself.
*   **CRITICAL NODE: Discover and Exploit a Security Flaw in MockK's Code:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** This critical node represents the core of the vulnerability exploitation. An attacker would need to:
        *   Analyze the MockK source code for potential weaknesses (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws, logic errors).
        *   Develop an exploit that leverages the identified vulnerability to achieve a malicious outcome.
*   **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution during test execution, potentially compromising the development or testing environment. In rare and misconfigured scenarios, it could even impact production.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Discover and Exploit a Security Flaw in MockK's Code](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_discover_and_exploit_a_security_flaw_in_mockk's_code.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This critical node represents the core of the vulnerability exploitation. An attacker would need to:
    *   Analyze the MockK source code for potential weaknesses (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws, logic errors).
    *   Develop an exploit that leverages the identified vulnerability to achieve a malicious outcome.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Manipulate Test Outcomes](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_manipulate_test_outcomes.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path focuses on influencing the results of tests to make vulnerable code appear safe, allowing it to pass through the development pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Inject Malicious Mocks](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_mocks.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This involves replacing legitimate MockK library components or injecting malicious mock definitions into the project.
    *   **CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Build Process:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the build system and modifies build scripts to introduce a compromised version of MockK or malicious mock definitions.
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Compromise Developer Environment:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine (e.g., through phishing or exploiting vulnerabilities) and injects malicious code or configurations into the developer's project setup.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Bypassing security checks during testing, leading to the deployment of vulnerable code.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Build Process](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_build_process.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the build system and modifies build scripts to introduce a compromised version of MockK or malicious mock definitions.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Compromise Developer Environment](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_compromise_developer_environment.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine (e.g., through phishing or exploiting vulnerabilities) and injects malicious code or configurations into the developer's project setup.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Modify Existing Tests](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_modify_existing_tests.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This involves directly altering the test code to pass regardless of the underlying code's functionality.
    *   **CRITICAL NODE: Gain Access to Source Code Repository:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the source code repository (e.g., by compromising developer credentials or exploiting VCS vulnerabilities), enabling them to modify test files.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Creating a false sense of security, allowing vulnerable code to pass through the testing phase.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Gain Access to Source Code Repository](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_gain_access_to_source_code_repository.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the source code repository (e.g., by compromising developer credentials or exploiting VCS vulnerabilities), enabling them to modify test files.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit `answers` or `spyk` Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit__answers__or__spyk__functionality.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This involves misusing specific MockK features to execute malicious code during test runs.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Allows execution of arbitrary code during test execution, potentially leading to environment compromise or data exfiltration from the testing environment.
