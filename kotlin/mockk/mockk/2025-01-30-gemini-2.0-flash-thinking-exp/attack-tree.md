## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Test Code in Production [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_test_code_in_production__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Accidental deployment of test code and dependencies (including MockK) to production environments.
*   Configuration errors leading to test-related settings being active in production.
*   Deployment script errors causing test artifacts to be included in production deployments.
**Impact:**
*   Creates the foundation for active mocking in production, which can be directly exploited.
*   Increases the attack surface by introducing test-specific code and libraries into the production environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Test Code Deployment Error [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__test_code_deployment_error__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Accidental Inclusion in Build:**  Build process incorrectly packages test code alongside production code.
*   **Configuration Mismanagement:**  Environment configurations are not properly separated, leading to test configurations being applied in production.
*   **Rollback/Deployment Script Error:**  Faulty scripts during rollback or deployment inadvertently deploy test artifacts.
**Impact:**
*   Leads to the presence of test code in production, a prerequisite for active mocking and subsequent exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Active Mocking in Production [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__active_mocking_in_production__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   MockK library is included in production dependencies.
*   Mocking logic (using MockK APIs) is present and active within the production codebase.
*   Mocking framework is initialized in production, even if not explicitly intended for all code paths.
**Impact:**
*   Enables attackers to exploit active mocks to bypass security controls, manipulate data, and potentially cause information disclosure.
*   Creates a direct vulnerability by allowing the application to behave in a controlled, potentially insecure manner defined by the mocks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Mocking Logic Enabled in Production Code [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__mocking_logic_enabled_in_production_code__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Conditional Mocking Based on Environment Variables [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Environment variables intended for test environments are mistakenly active in production, enabling mocking logic.
*   **Unintended Mocking Logic in Core Application Code:**  Mistakes in code development lead to mocking logic being inadvertently included in core application paths, even without environment variable triggers.
*   **Mocking Framework Initialization in Production:**  The MockK framework is initialized in production, making mocking capabilities available even if not explicitly used in all code paths.
**Impact:**
*   Directly introduces vulnerabilities by enabling mocking behavior in production, allowing attackers to potentially control application responses and actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1. Conditional Mocking Based on Environment Variables [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1__conditional_mocking_based_on_environment_variables__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Environment variables intended to enable mocks in test environments are accidentally set or remain active in production.
*   Application code checks these environment variables and activates mocking logic based on their values in production.
**Impact:**
*   Easily exploitable vulnerability if environment variables are misconfigured in production.
*   Allows attackers to potentially enable mocking behavior by manipulating environment variables if they have any level of control over the production environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Exploiting Active Mocks [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__exploiting_active_mocks__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Leveraging active mocks in production to bypass authentication and authorization checks.
*   Exploiting mocks to circumvent input validation mechanisms.
*   Using mocks to disable or bypass rate limiting and throttling controls.
*   Manipulating data flow by exploiting mocks that interact with databases, external APIs, or internal services.
*   Triggering information disclosure by exploiting mock responses that contain sensitive data.
**Impact:**
*   Can lead to critical security breaches, including unauthorized access, data manipulation, data breaches, denial of service, and information disclosure.
*   Directly exploits the vulnerabilities created by active mocking in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1. Bypass Security Checks via Mocks [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__bypass_security_checks_via_mocks__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Mocking Authentication/Authorization Services [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Mocks are configured to always return successful authentication or authorization, regardless of actual credentials.
*   **Mocking Input Validation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Mocks bypass input validation checks, allowing malicious or invalid input to be processed by the application.
*   **Mocking Rate Limiting/Throttling:** Mocks disable or circumvent rate limiting mechanisms, allowing attackers to overwhelm the system with requests.
**Impact:**
*   **Mocking Authentication/Authorization Services:**  Complete bypass of access controls, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources and data breaches.
*   **Mocking Input Validation:**  Enables injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.), data corruption, and application crashes due to processing invalid input.
*   **Mocking Rate Limiting/Throttling:**  Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, resource exhaustion, and application instability.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1.1. Mocking Authentication/Authorization Services [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_1__mocking_authenticationauthorization_services__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Mocks are set up to always return a positive authentication or authorization response, effectively disabling security checks.
*   Attackers can exploit this by sending requests that would normally be rejected by the authentication/authorization system, but are now allowed due to the mock.
**Impact:**
*   Complete bypass of authentication and authorization, granting attackers full access to protected resources and functionalities.
*   Potentially leads to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and complete compromise of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1.2. Mocking Input Validation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_2__mocking_input_validation__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Mocks are configured to bypass or ignore input validation routines, allowing any input to pass through without proper sanitization or checks.
*   Attackers can inject malicious payloads (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) that would normally be blocked by input validation, but are now processed due to the mock.
**Impact:**
*   Enables various injection attacks, leading to data breaches, data corruption, unauthorized data access, and potential remote code execution in some injection scenarios.
*   Can also cause application crashes or unexpected behavior due to processing invalid or malicious input.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2. Data Manipulation via Mocks [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2__data_manipulation_via_mocks__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Mocking Database Interactions [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Mocks are used to simulate database interactions and return attacker-controlled data instead of actual database results.
*   **Mocking External API Calls:** Mocks are used to simulate external API calls and return attacker-controlled responses, manipulating the application's interaction with external systems.
*   **Mocking Internal Service Dependencies:** Mocks are used to simulate internal service dependencies, allowing attackers to control the behavior of these dependencies and manipulate application logic.
**Impact:**
*   **Mocking Database Interactions:** Data corruption, unauthorized data modification, data breaches by manipulating data retrieved from or stored in the "database" (mocked).
*   **Mocking External API Calls:** Data injection into external systems, incorrect application state based on manipulated mock responses, and potential cascading effects on integrated systems.
*   **Mocking Internal Service Dependencies:** Inconsistent application state, business logic bypass, unexpected application behavior, and potential security vulnerabilities arising from manipulated internal service interactions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2.1. Mocking Database Interactions [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_1__mocking_database_interactions__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Mocks are configured to intercept database queries and return attacker-defined data instead of querying the actual database.
*   Attackers can manipulate the data retrieved by the application, leading to incorrect application logic and potentially data breaches if sensitive data is involved.
**Impact:**
*   Data corruption within the application's perceived data model.
*   Unauthorized data modification if the application uses mocked data to update the actual database (though less likely if mocks are purely for read operations).
*   Data breaches if sensitive data is exposed or manipulated through the mocked database interactions.
