# Threat Model Analysis for mockk/mockk

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Mockk Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_mockk_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker might exploit a vulnerability within the Mockk library's code to compromise the development or testing environment. This could involve injecting malicious code during test execution or exploiting a flaw in Mockk's mocking mechanism.
    *   **How:** Exploitation depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from code injection during test execution, leading to arbitrary code execution within the testing environment, to denial of service attacks against the test suite.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Compromise of the development or testing environment. This could lead to:
        *   **Data breaches:** Sensitive data within the development environment could be exposed.
        *   **Supply chain attacks:** Malicious code could be injected into the build process through compromised tests, potentially affecting the final application.
        *   **Development disruption:**  Testing infrastructure could be rendered unusable, delaying development and release cycles.
*   **Mockk Component Affected:** Potentially any Mockk module or function depending on the nature of the vulnerability, but core mocking engine and instrumentation are likely targets.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Mockk updated:**  Immediately update Mockk to the latest version as soon as security patches are released.
    *   **Monitor security advisories:** Regularly check security advisories and vulnerability databases (like CVE databases, GitHub Security Advisories) for any reported vulnerabilities in Mockk.
    *   **Secure development environment:** Implement robust security measures for the development environment itself, including access controls, intrusion detection, and regular security audits.
    *   **Code reviews:** Conduct security-focused code reviews of test code and development environment configurations to identify potential weaknesses.
    *   **Dependency scanning:** Use automated dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in Mockk and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Mockk's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_mockk's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities present in libraries that Mockk depends on. These vulnerabilities, while not directly in Mockk's code, can be leveraged through Mockk's usage, indirectly affecting applications using Mockk during development and testing.
    *   **How:** Exploitation depends on the nature of the dependency vulnerability and how Mockk utilizes the vulnerable component.  For example, if Mockk depends on a logging library with a remote code execution vulnerability, and Mockk's logging mechanisms are exposed or exploitable, it could be indirectly leveraged.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Similar to vulnerabilities in Mockk itself, compromise of the development or testing environment is possible. This can lead to:
        *   **Data breaches:** Exposure of sensitive data within the development environment.
        *   **Supply chain attacks:**  Malicious code injection into the build process if vulnerabilities allow for manipulation of build artifacts.
        *   **Development disruption:** Instability or unavailability of testing tools and infrastructure.
*   **Mockk Component Affected:** Indirectly affects Mockk through its dependency chain. The vulnerable component is within Mockk's dependencies, but the impact is realized through the use of Mockk.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency scanning:**  Utilize dependency scanning tools to continuously monitor and identify known vulnerabilities in Mockk's dependencies.
    *   **Keep dependencies updated:** Ensure Mockk and all its dependencies are updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
    *   **Monitor dependency advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability notifications for Mockk's dependencies (often available through dependency management tools or vulnerability databases).
    *   **Isolate development environment:**  Implement network segmentation and isolation for the development environment to limit the potential impact of a compromised dependency.
    *   **Regular security audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the development environment and dependency management practices.
