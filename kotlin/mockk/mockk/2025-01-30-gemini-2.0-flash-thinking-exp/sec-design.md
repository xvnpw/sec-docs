# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Priority: Provide a flexible and user-friendly mocking library for Kotlin and Java developers.
  - Goal: Enable developers to write effective and efficient unit tests by simplifying the mocking process.
  - Goal: Foster a strong community around the library, encouraging contributions and ensuring long-term maintainability.
  - Goal: Maintain the library's performance and stability to ensure it remains a reliable tool for developers.

- Business Risks:
  - Business Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by malicious actors in downstream applications that depend on Mockk. This could lead to data breaches, service disruptions, or other security incidents in user projects.
  - Business Risk: Lack of trust in the library due to security concerns could lead to decreased adoption and community engagement.
  - Business Risk: Supply chain attacks targeting the library's dependencies or build process could compromise the integrity of Mockk releases, impacting all users.
  - Business Risk: Performance regressions or instability introduced by malicious or poorly vetted contributions could negatively impact user experience and project stability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - Security control: Open source code - The entire codebase is publicly accessible on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. (Location: GitHub repository)
  - Security control: Public issue tracking - GitHub Issues are used to report bugs, feature requests, and potentially security vulnerabilities, enabling community reporting and discussion. (Location: GitHub Issues)
  - Security control: Pull Request review process - Contributions are submitted as pull requests and are subject to review by maintainers before being merged, providing a degree of code quality and security oversight. (Location: GitHub Pull Requests)
  - Security control: Reliance on GitHub's infrastructure security - The project benefits from GitHub's security measures for code hosting, access control, and infrastructure protection. (Location: GitHub platform)

- Accepted Risks:
  - Accepted risk:  Reliance on community vigilance for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities. The project's security posture is heavily dependent on the active participation of the open-source community to identify and report potential issues.
  - Accepted risk: Potential delay in vulnerability patching.  The response time for addressing reported vulnerabilities depends on maintainer availability and community contributions.
  - Accepted risk:  Risk of supply chain vulnerabilities in dependencies. The project relies on external dependencies, which could introduce vulnerabilities if compromised.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - Recommended security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies. This can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to proactively detect and address vulnerable dependencies.
  - Recommended security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the build process to automatically analyze the codebase for potential security flaws and coding vulnerabilities.
  - Recommended security control: Introduce code signing for releases to ensure the integrity and authenticity of distributed artifacts, protecting against tampering and supply chain attacks.
  - Recommended security control: Establish a clear security policy and vulnerability disclosure process to guide users on how to report security issues and to outline the project's commitment to security.
  - Recommended security control: Conduct periodic security audits or penetration testing to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the codebase and infrastructure.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable as Mockk is a library consumed by other applications and does not directly handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable as Mockk is a library and does not enforce authorization policies.
  - Input Validation: Input validation is crucial within the Mockk API to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in user code. Mockk should validate inputs to its public API methods to ensure data integrity and prevent injection attacks or other input-related vulnerabilities in applications using Mockk.
  - Cryptography: While Mockk itself may not directly implement cryptographic functions, it should avoid introducing vulnerabilities through its dependencies or usage patterns that could weaken the security of applications using it. If Mockk needs to handle sensitive data (even indirectly), it should do so securely and follow security best practices.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Critical Business Process: Software development lifecycle for projects that depend on Mockk.  Mockk facilitates unit testing, which is a crucial part of ensuring software quality and reliability.
  - Critical Business Process: Distribution of the Mockk library to the developer community.  Ensuring the library is available, accessible, and trustworthy is essential for its continued adoption and use.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Data: Mockk Source Code. Sensitivity: Public. The source code is open source and publicly available on GitHub. Integrity is important to prevent malicious modifications.
  - Data: Mockk Build Artifacts (JAR files). Sensitivity: Public.  JAR files are distributed publicly. Integrity and authenticity are crucial to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure users are using legitimate and untampered versions of the library.
  - Data: Vulnerability Reports (GitHub Issues). Sensitivity: Public/Confidential (initially). Vulnerability reports are typically public to facilitate community discussion and transparency. However, in some cases, initial reports might be treated confidentially to allow for coordinated disclosure and patching before public announcement.
