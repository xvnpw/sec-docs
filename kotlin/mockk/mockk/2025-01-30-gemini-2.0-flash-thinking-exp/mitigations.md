# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mockk/mockk

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Isolation and Scope Management](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_isolation_and_scope_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Build Tool:** Utilize your project's build tool (e.g., Gradle, Maven) to define dependency scopes.
    2.  **Isolate `mockk` to Test Scope:**  Specifically declare `mockk` and any related testing libraries (like `mockk-agent`) within the `testImplementation` or `testCompile` scope in your build configuration. This ensures these dependencies are only available during compilation and execution of tests.
    3.  **Verify Production Artifacts:**  Configure build processes and pipelines to explicitly exclude test-scoped dependencies from the final production build artifacts (JARs, WARs, Docker images, etc.).  This might involve using build tool plugins or custom scripts to inspect and filter dependencies.
    4.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit the project's build configuration and generated production artifacts to confirm that `mockk` and test-related libraries are not inadvertently included.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Inclusion of Mocking Framework in Production (High Severity):**  If `mockk` is included in production, it could expose internal mocking capabilities, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate application behavior at runtime if they can influence mock definitions or execution paths. This could lead to bypassing security checks, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Unexpected Runtime Behavior (Medium Severity):**  Even without malicious intent, the presence of `mockk` in production can lead to unpredictable application behavior if mock-related code paths are accidentally triggered in production environments. This can cause application instability or unexpected errors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Inclusion of Mocking Framework in Production (High Impact):**  Effectively eliminates the risk by preventing `mockk` from being present in production.
    *   **Unexpected Runtime Behavior (Medium Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring mock-related code is not present in production, thus preventing accidental triggering of mock behaviors.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   `mockk` is declared as a `testImplementation` dependency in `build.gradle.kts`.
    *   Build process is configured to package application into a JAR file.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit verification step in CI/CD pipeline to automatically check that production JAR does not contain `mockk` or related libraries.
    *   Regular manual audits of production artifacts to confirm dependency isolation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege in Mock Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_in_mock_definitions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Focus Mock Scope:**  When creating mocks using `mockk`, carefully define the scope of mocking to only simulate the specific behaviors and data required for the test case at hand.
    2.  **Avoid Over-Mocking:**  Refrain from mocking functionalities or methods that are not directly relevant to the unit under test. Mock only the necessary interactions with direct dependencies.
    3.  **Restrict Mock Behavior:**  Define mock behaviors as narrowly as possible. For example, if a test only needs to verify that a method is called, use `verify` instead of defining complex `every` blocks that simulate extensive behavior.
    4.  **Review Mock Complexity:**  During code reviews, pay attention to the complexity of mock definitions.  Simpler, more focused mocks are generally safer and easier to maintain. If a mock becomes overly complex, consider refactoring the test or the code under test.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Obscured Real Behavior and Masked Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Overly complex or permissive mocks can obscure the real behavior of the system and potentially mask security vulnerabilities that might be present in the actual implementation. If mocks simulate too much, they might bypass or hide security checks that would be triggered in real scenarios.
    *   **Maintenance Overhead and Test Fragility (Low to Medium Severity):** Complex mocks are harder to understand, maintain, and update. They can also make tests more fragile and prone to breaking when the real implementation changes, even if the core functionality remains the same.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Obscured Real Behavior and Masked Vulnerabilities (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk by promoting focused and minimal mocks that are less likely to mask real system behavior and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Maintenance Overhead and Test Fragility (Low to Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk by leading to simpler, more maintainable, and less fragile tests.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   Developers are generally encouraged to write focused unit tests.
    *   No specific guidelines or enforcement for the principle of least privilege in mock definitions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Document and communicate the principle of least privilege in mock definitions to the development team.
    *   Include guidelines and examples of applying this principle in coding standards and best practices documentation.
    *   Incorporate checks for overly complex mocks during code reviews.
