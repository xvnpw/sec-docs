## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via MockK (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_mockk__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate objective of the attacker and signifies a complete breach of the application's security through vulnerabilities related to MockK.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise During Development/Testing Phase (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_during_developmenttesting_phase__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the software development lifecycle, specifically during testing where MockK is utilized.
It is a critical node because successful compromise at this stage can lead to the introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors into the application before it even reaches production.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Logic through Mock Definitions (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_logic_through_mock_definitions__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Attackers can leverage MockK's features to embed malicious code within test definitions. This code can execute during testing or, in some scenarios, potentially persist or influence build artifacts.
This is a critical node as it represents a direct method of injecting harmful logic using the library itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit MockK's DSL for Code Execution (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mockk's_dsl_for_code_execution__high-risk_path_.md)

MockK's Domain Specific Language (DSL) offers powerful features that, if misused, can allow for arbitrary code execution within the testing context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Mock Definitions with Harmful Side Effects (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_mock_definitions_with_harmful_side_effects__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can create mock definitions that perform actions beyond simply simulating behavior, leading to unintended and harmful consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage `every { ... } answers { ... }` to Execute Arbitrary Code (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage__every_{_____}_answers_{_____}__to_execute_arbitrary_code__high-risk_path_.md)

The `answers` block in MockK allows for custom logic to be executed when a mocked function is called. This can be exploited to run malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Backdoors via Test Code using Mocks (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_backdoors_via_test_code_using_mocks__high-risk_path_.md)

Malicious actors can create mocks that introduce backdoors or vulnerabilities into the application under the guise of testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Create Mocks that Modify Global State or External Systems (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/create_mocks_that_modify_global_state_or_external_systems__high-risk_path_.md)

While not best practice, attackers can create mocks that interact with external systems or modify global application state in a way that introduces vulnerabilities or backdoors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Dependencies via Test Configurations (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_dependencies_via_test_configurations__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can modify build files or test configurations to include malicious dependencies that are only used during testing but could still influence the application's behavior or introduce vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Test Results to Hide Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_test_results_to_hide_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Attackers can manipulate mock behavior or test execution to prevent the detection of existing vulnerabilities, giving a false sense of security.
This is a critical node because it undermines the entire purpose of testing and can lead to the deployment of vulnerable code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Mock Behavior to Bypass Security Checks (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_mock_behavior_to_bypass_security_checks__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can modify mock implementations to always return successful results for security-related checks, effectively bypassing them during testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Mock Implementations to Return False Positives (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_mock_implementations_to_return_false_positives__high-risk_path_.md)

This involves crafting mocks that deliberately provide incorrect positive results for security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Influence Test Execution to Skip Vulnerability Detection Tests (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/influence_test_execution_to_skip_vulnerability_detection_tests__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can modify test configurations or introduce instability to prevent security-focused tests from being executed or from being taken seriously.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Test Configurations to Exclude Critical Security Tests (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_test_configurations_to_exclude_critical_security_tests__high-risk_path_.md)

This involves directly altering test configurations to prevent specific security tests from running.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack on MockK Dependency (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack_on_mockk_dependency__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This involves compromising the MockK library itself or its distribution channels to inject malicious code that would then be included in applications using the library.
This is a critical node due to the potentially widespread impact on all applications that depend on the compromised version of MockK.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise MockK's Repository or Distribution Channels (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_mockk's_repository_or_distribution_channels__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers could gain unauthorized access to MockK's source code repository (e.g., GitHub) or its distribution channels (e.g., Maven Central).

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into a MockK Release (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_a_mockk_release__high-risk_path_.md)

Once control over the repository or distribution channels is achieved, malicious code can be injected into a seemingly legitimate release of the MockK library.
