# Threat Model Analysis for mockk/mockk

## Threat: [Accidental Inclusion of MockK in Production Build](./threats/accidental_inclusion_of_mockk_in_production_build.md)

**Description:** Due to misconfiguration of build tools or developer error, the MockK library might be inadvertently included in the final production artifact. This exposes MockK's internal API and potentially allows attackers to manipulate application behavior through mocking and verification mechanisms in a live environment.

**Impact:** Significant security risk. Attackers could bypass security checks, manipulate application logic, or extract sensitive information by interacting with the MockK API exposed in production.

**Affected Component:** MockK Library (as a whole)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure build tools (e.g., Gradle, Maven) to explicitly exclude test dependencies from production builds.
*   Implement automated checks in the build pipeline to verify that test dependencies are not included in production artifacts.
*   Perform thorough testing of production builds to ensure no unexpected test dependencies are present.

## Threat: [Development Environment Compromise via MockK Vulnerability](./threats/development_environment_compromise_via_mockk_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** A hypothetical, yet possible, vulnerability within the MockK library itself could be exploited to compromise the developer's machine or the build environment. This could involve malicious code execution during the dependency resolution or test execution phase.

**Impact:** Compromise of developer machines, leading to potential code tampering, intellectual property theft, or further attacks on internal systems.

**Affected Component:** MockK Library (core functionality)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep MockK updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
*   Implement strong security practices for developer machines and build environments (e.g., endpoint security, regular patching).
*   Monitor for unusual activity during build and test processes.
