# Attack Surface Analysis for mockk/mockk

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Mock Definitions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_mock_definitions.md)

* **Description:** Attackers introduce crafted mock definitions that execute malicious code during test runs.
    * **How MockK Contributes:** MockK's core functionality is to define and execute mock behavior. If these definitions are malicious, MockK facilitates their execution.
    * **Example:** A compromised developer machine has a modified test file that uses `every { someObject.someMethod() } answers { Runtime.getRuntime().exec("rm -rf /") }`. When tests run, this command executes.
    * **Impact:**  Potentially complete compromise of the testing environment, data exfiltration from the test environment, denial of service, or introduction of persistent backdoors if the testing environment interacts with other systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Development Environments:** Implement strong security measures on developer machines (endpoint security, regular patching).
        * **Code Review for Test Code:**  Treat test code with the same scrutiny as production code, reviewing for suspicious or unexpected behavior in mock definitions.
        * **Immutable Test Infrastructure:** Use containerization or virtual machines for test execution that can be easily reset to a clean state after each run.
        * **Dependency Scanning for Test Dependencies:** Scan test dependencies (including MockK) for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via `answers` or Similar Constructs](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via__answers__or_similar_constructs.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code within lambda expressions used to define mock behavior (e.g., in `every { ... } answers { ... }`).
    * **How MockK Contributes:** MockK's flexible mocking API allows defining custom logic within mock behavior using code blocks. This opens a vector for code injection if the test code itself is compromised.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor with access to test code modifies an `answers` block: `every { someService.processData(any()) } answers { println("Compromised!"); System.exit(1); }`.
    * **Impact:**  Similar to malicious mock definitions, this can lead to test environment compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service during testing.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Access Control for Test Code:** Restrict access to test code repositories and development environments.
        * **Code Review for Test Logic:** Carefully review the logic within `answers` blocks and other dynamic mock behavior definitions.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the test execution environment has only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities within MockK Itself](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_within_mockk_itself.md)

* **Description:**  Attackers exploit undiscovered security vulnerabilities within the MockK library code.
    * **How MockK Contributes:** As a dependency, any vulnerabilities in MockK become potential vulnerabilities in the applications using it.
    * **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in MockK's bytecode manipulation logic could be triggered by a specific sequence of mock definitions, leading to arbitrary code execution during test setup.
    * **Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability. Could range from denial of service during testing to potential compromise of the testing environment.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (assuming a critical or high severity vulnerability is found)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep MockK Updated:** Regularly update MockK to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to MockK.
        * **Static Analysis Tools:** Use static analysis tools that can potentially identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
