# Attack Surface Analysis for coil-kt/coil

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image URLs](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_urls.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a URL pointing to a malicious image file.
    *   **How Coil Contributes:** Coil is directly responsible for fetching and decoding images from provided URLs. If the URL is malicious, Coil will attempt to process it, potentially triggering vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a URL pointing to an image file that exploits a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability in the underlying image decoding library used by Coil during the decoding process.
    *   **Impact:** Potential remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the device or application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for any user-provided image URLs. Consider using allowlists for trusted image sources.
        *   **Developers:**  Ensure Coil and its underlying image decoding libraries are updated to the latest versions to patch known critical vulnerabilities.
        *   **Developers:** Implement security measures like sandboxing or memory protection techniques to limit the impact of potential decoding vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Vulnerabilities Exploited via Image Loading](./attack_surfaces/server-side_vulnerabilities_exploited_via_image_loading.md)

*   **Description:** A compromised or malicious server sends specially crafted responses or image data when Coil requests an image.
    *   **How Coil Contributes:** Coil makes the network request and directly processes the response from the server. Malicious responses can exploit vulnerabilities in Coil's networking or decoding logic.
    *   **Example:** A compromised image server sends an image with malicious metadata that triggers a vulnerability in Coil's image parsing logic, leading to unexpected behavior or a crash.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for denial-of-service, where the application becomes unresponsive or crashes. In more severe cases, vulnerabilities in Coil's handling of server responses could potentially be exploited for information disclosure or even remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Enforce HTTPS for all image requests to ensure data integrity and authenticity, mitigating man-in-the-middle attacks that could inject malicious responses.
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust error handling for network requests and unexpected server responses to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior.
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update Coil and its networking dependencies (like OkHttp) to patch potential vulnerabilities in handling server communication.
