## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Coil Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_coil_exploitation.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the central point of the threat model. Successful exploitation here means the attacker has achieved their objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents a broad category of attacks that leverage weaknesses in how Coil and underlying libraries decode and process image data. It's critical because successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious Image Format](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_image_format.md)

This is a crucial step in exploiting image processing vulnerabilities. By crafting specific image structures, attackers can trigger vulnerabilities in the decoding process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Communication Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_communication_vulnerabilities.md)

This node encompasses attacks that target the network communication involved in fetching images. It's critical because successful exploitation can allow attackers to inject malicious content or redirect the application to attacker-controlled resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Image Server](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_image_server.md)

This node represents the scenario where the application fetches images from a server controlled by the attacker. It's critical because it allows the attacker to directly serve malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

This node highlights the risk of using third-party libraries with known vulnerabilities. It's critical because Coil relies on other libraries, and vulnerabilities in those libraries can be exploited through Coil.

## Attack Tree Path: [Coil Relies on Vulnerable Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/coil_relies_on_vulnerable_libraries.md)

This node specifically points to the fact that Coil's security is dependent on the security of its underlying libraries. It's critical because vulnerabilities in these dependencies can directly impact Coil's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration or Improper Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfiguration_or_improper_usage.md)

This node represents vulnerabilities introduced by developers not using Coil securely. It's critical because it highlights common mistakes that can create exploitable weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerability in Image Decoder (e.g., libjpeg-turbo, Skia)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerability_in_image_decoder__e_g___libjpeg-turbo__skia_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious images that exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows or integer overflows) in the image decoding libraries used by Coil.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (Known vulnerabilities exist and exploits are often available).
    * **Impact:** High (Potential for arbitrary code execution within the application's context).

## Attack Tree Path: [Replace Legitimate Image with Malicious Image (via MITM)](./attack_tree_paths/replace_legitimate_image_with_malicious_image__via_mitm_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the image server (Man-in-the-Middle attack) and replaces the legitimate image response with a malicious one.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Requires network access and ability to perform MITM, harder with properly enforced HTTPS).
    * **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on whether the malicious image exploits processing vulnerabilities).

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Image Server -> Application Configured to Fetch Images from Attacker-Controlled Server](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_image_server_-_application_configured_to_fetch_images_from_attacker-controlled_server.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application is configured (due to a vulnerability or misconfiguration) to load images from a server controlled by the attacker.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on configuration vulnerabilities or user input handling).
    * **Impact:** High (If malicious images exploit processing vulnerabilities).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities -> Coil Relies on Vulnerable Libraries -> Identify Known Vulnerabilities in Coil's Dependencies (e.g., OkHttp, Kotlin Coroutines)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_-_coil_relies_on_vulnerable_libraries_-_identify_known_vulnerabil_375f9966.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the libraries that Coil depends on (e.g., OkHttp for networking, Kotlin Coroutines for concurrency).
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (Known vulnerabilities are often publicly disclosed and exploitable).
    * **Impact:** High (Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, could lead to RCE, DoS, etc.).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration or Improper Usage -> Developer Error in Using Coil -> Not Validating Image Sources Properly](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfiguration_or_improper_usage_-_developer_error_in_using_coil_-_not_validating_image_so_213f3a8d.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers fail to properly validate the sources of images being loaded by Coil, allowing the application to fetch images from untrusted or attacker-controlled servers. This increases the likelihood of attacks involving malicious image servers or MITM.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (Common oversight in development).
    * **Impact:** Increases the likelihood of other high-impact attacks (as described above).
