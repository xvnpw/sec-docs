# Threat Model Analysis for coil-kt/coil

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Image Downloads](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_image_downloads.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the image server. The attacker might replace legitimate images with malicious ones by exploiting a lack of HTTPS enforcement or insecure redirects *within Coil's network loading process*.
*   **Impact:** Displaying malicious content, potentially leading to phishing, misinformation, or exploitation of other vulnerabilities if the malicious image triggers a bug in the application.
*   **Affected Coil Component:** Coil's Network Loader (specifically the `ImageLoader` and its network fetching capabilities).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all image URLs loaded via Coil.
    *   Configure Coil to reject non-HTTPS URLs.
    *   Implement Certificate Pinning for critical image sources *within the Coil configuration*.
    *   Avoid following HTTP redirects or strictly validate redirection targets *when configuring Coil's network client*.

## Threat: [Insecure HTTP Redirections Leading to Malicious Images](./threats/insecure_http_redirections_leading_to_malicious_images.md)

*   **Description:** An initial HTTPS request for an image is redirected to an insecure HTTP URL. An attacker controlling the redirection target can serve a malicious image *due to Coil's default redirect following behavior*.
*   **Impact:** Similar to MITM, displaying malicious content leading to phishing, misinformation, or exploitation of vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Coil Component:** Coil's Network Loader (specifically its redirect following mechanism).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure Coil to disallow HTTP redirects.
    *   Implement custom logic to inspect and validate redirection URLs before allowing Coil to follow them *by customizing Coil's OkHttp client*.
    *   Prefer direct HTTPS URLs whenever possible.

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning](./threats/cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the image cache (disk or memory) to store malicious images associated with legitimate URLs. Subsequent requests for the legitimate URL serve the poisoned image *through Coil's caching mechanism*.
*   **Impact:** Displaying malicious content, potentially leading to phishing, misinformation, or exploitation of vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Coil Component:** Coil's Cache Module (both memory and disk cache implementations).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure proper cache management and integrity checks *when configuring Coil's cache*.
    *   Consider using signed URLs or other mechanisms to verify the authenticity of cached images *before Coil retrieves them from the cache*.
    *   Limit cache duration for sensitive images.
    *   Use secure storage mechanisms for the disk cache.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Image Decoding Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_image_decoding_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Coil relies on underlying platform libraries for image decoding. Vulnerabilities in these libraries could be exploited through specially crafted images *loaded and decoded by Coil*.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, potential remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability in the underlying library).
*   **Affected Coil Component:** Coil's Image Decoder (indirectly, as it uses platform decoding).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the underlying vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the application's dependencies (including Coil) and the device's operating system up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   While not directly controllable by the application developer, being aware of platform vulnerabilities is important.
