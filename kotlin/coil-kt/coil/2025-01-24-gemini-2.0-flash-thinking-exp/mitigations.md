# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for coil-kt/coil

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Coil Dependency](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_coil_dependency.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Regularly monitor Coil's GitHub repository ([https://github.com/coil-kt/coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil)) for new releases and security announcements. Subscribe to release notifications or check the "Releases" tab periodically.
    *   Step 2: Review the release notes and changelogs for each new Coil version. Pay close attention to sections mentioning bug fixes, security patches, or vulnerability resolutions.
    *   Step 3: Update the Coil dependency version in your project's build files (e.g., `build.gradle.kts` or `build.gradle` for Android projects). Change the version number to the latest stable release.
    *   Step 4: Rebuild your project and thoroughly test the application after updating Coil to ensure compatibility and that no regressions have been introduced.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Coil Library:** Severity - **High**. Outdated Coil versions may contain publicly known security flaws that attackers can exploit.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Coil Library:** Significantly reduces risk by patching known vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Needs Assessment.  [**Project Specific:**  Is there a process in place for regularly checking and updating dependencies? Is Coil dependency currently on the latest stable version? Specify where dependency versions are managed in the project.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** Needs Assessment. [**Project Specific:** If not regularly updated, describe the current update frequency for dependencies and if Coil updates are included in this process. If there's no process, this strategy is entirely missing.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Certificate Pinning for Critical Image Sources (via Coil's OkHttpClient)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_certificate_pinning_for_critical_image_sources__via_coil's_okhttpclient_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify critical image sources that require a higher level of security.
    *   Step 2: Obtain the correct SSL/TLS certificates (or public keys) for these critical image servers.
    *   Step 3: Configure a custom `OkHttpClient` instance. Coil uses OkHttp internally and allows you to provide a custom instance.
    *   Step 4: Within the `OkHttpClient` configuration, use OkHttp's Certificate Pinning feature to pin the obtained certificates or public keys for the specific hostnames of your critical image servers.
    *   Step 5: Provide this custom `OkHttpClient` to Coil's `ImageLoader` when creating it. This ensures Coil uses your pinned `OkHttpClient` for network requests.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **MITM Attacks via Compromised Certificate Authorities (CAs):** Severity - **Medium to High** (depending on the value of the protected images). Certificate pinning, configured through Coil's underlying OkHttp client, mitigates MITM attacks even if a CA is compromised.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MITM Attacks via Compromised Certificate Authorities (CAs):** Significantly reduces risk for targeted image sources by ensuring trust in specific certificates.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Needs Assessment. [**Project Specific:** Is certificate pinning currently implemented for any image sources using Coil's `ImageLoader` and a custom `OkHttpClient`? If so, for which sources and how is it configured?]

*   **Missing Implementation:** Needs Assessment. [**Project Specific:** If certificate pinning is not implemented via Coil's `ImageLoader`, consider if it's necessary for critical image sources. If yes, implementation is missing. Identify which image sources would benefit most from pinning within Coil's context.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Be Mindful of Caching Sensitive Images (using Coil's Cache Policies)](./mitigation_strategies/be_mindful_of_caching_sensitive_images__using_coil's_cache_policies_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify if your application handles sensitive images.
    *   Step 2: For requests loading sensitive images *with Coil*, explicitly disable Coil's caching mechanisms. This is done by setting `memoryCachePolicy(CachePolicy.DISABLED)` and `diskCachePolicy(CachePolicy.DISABLED)` in the `ImageRequest.Builder` when loading sensitive images.
    *   Step 3: Ensure your image servers send appropriate `Cache-Control` headers for sensitive images to further guide Coil's caching behavior, although Coil's policy will override server headers when explicitly set.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage from Cached Sensitive Images (Coil's Cache):** Severity - **Medium to High** (depending on the sensitivity of the images). Coil's caching can store images on device storage. Disabling Coil's cache for sensitive images prevents this specific leakage vector.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Leakage from Cached Sensitive Images (Coil's Cache):** Significantly reduces risk by preventing Coil from storing sensitive images in its cache.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Needs Assessment. [**Project Specific:** Does the application handle sensitive images loaded using Coil? Is Coil's caching currently disabled for these sensitive images using `CachePolicy.DISABLED`? Specify where image loading for sensitive data occurs using Coil.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** Needs Assessment. [**Project Specific:** If sensitive images are handled by Coil and caching is not disabled in Coil's `ImageRequest`, implementation is needed. Identify the code sections loading sensitive images with Coil and modify the `ImageRequest` to disable caching.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Configure Coil's ImageLoader Options (Security Relevant Settings)](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_configure_coil's_imageloader_options__security_relevant_settings_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review the configuration of your `ImageLoader` instance in Coil. If using the default, consider a custom one for more control.
    *   Step 2: Examine the configuration of the underlying `OkHttpClient` *used by Coil*. While general `OkHttpClient` security is important, focus on how Coil utilizes it.
    *   Step 3: Review memory and disk cache sizes *configured in Coil's `ImageLoader`*. Adjust them based on application needs and security considerations related to cached data within Coil.
    *   Step 4: If using custom interceptors or event listeners *with Coil's `ImageLoader`*, carefully review their code for security implications within the Coil image loading context.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Insecure Network Configuration (via Coil's OkHttpClient):** Severity - **Medium**.  Coil's `ImageLoader` uses `OkHttpClient`. Ensuring a secure `OkHttpClient` configuration (provided to Coil) is important.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (DoS) via Large Caches (Coil's Cache):** Severity - **Low to Medium**.  Controlling cache sizes in Coil's `ImageLoader` can help manage resource usage related to Coil's caching.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Interceptors/Listeners (within Coil):** Severity - **Variable** (depending on the code). Custom components added to Coil's `ImageLoader` need security review in the context of image loading.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Insecure Network Configuration (via Coil's OkHttpClient):** Partially reduces risk by ensuring a more secure network client for Coil's image requests.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (DoS) via Large Caches (Coil's Cache):** Minimally reduces risk related to Coil's cache resource usage.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Interceptors/Listeners (within Coil):** Significantly reduces risk (through code review of Coil-specific extensions).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Needs Assessment. [**Project Specific:** Is a custom `ImageLoader` configured in Coil? Is a custom `OkHttpClient` provided to Coil's `ImageLoader`? Have `OkHttpClient` settings, cache sizes within Coil's `ImageLoader`, and custom interceptors/listeners been reviewed for security implications specifically related to Coil usage? Describe the current `ImageLoader` and `OkHttpClient` configuration within the Coil context.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** Needs Assessment. [**Project Specific:** If a custom `ImageLoader` and `OkHttpClient` are not used with Coil, consider implementing them for better control over Coil's behavior. If configurations haven't been reviewed in the context of Coil, a security review of these settings is missing. If custom interceptors/listeners are used with Coil, security code review is needed.]
