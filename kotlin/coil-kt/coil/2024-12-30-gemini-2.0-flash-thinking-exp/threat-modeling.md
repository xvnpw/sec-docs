* **Threat:** Malicious Image Content Exploitation
    * **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image file through a source that Coil fetches. This image is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying image decoding process *that Coil triggers*. The attacker might host this malicious image on a compromised server or inject it into a content stream.
    * **Impact:**
        * Denial of Service (DoS): The decoding process could consume excessive CPU or memory, leading to application freezes, crashes, or even device instability.
        * Remote Code Execution (RCE): In severe cases, vulnerabilities in the decoding libraries could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the user's device with the application's permissions.
    * **Affected Coil Component:** `ImageLoader`, specifically the image decoding pipeline initiated by Coil.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Rely on up-to-date Android system libraries and ensure devices are running the latest security patches.
        * Consider using alternative, more robust image decoding libraries if feasible and if they offer better security guarantees.
        * Implement robust error handling around image loading and decoding within the application to prevent crashes from propagating.
        * Sanitize or validate image sources where possible (e.g., whitelisting trusted domains) to reduce the likelihood of encountering malicious content.

* **Threat:** Cache Poisoning - Network Interception
    * **Description:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the network connection while Coil is downloading an image. The attacker intercepts the legitimate image data and replaces it with a malicious image *before Coil caches it*. Coil's caching mechanism then stores and potentially serves this malicious content.
    * **Impact:**
        * Display of misleading or harmful content to the user.
        * Potential for phishing attacks if the replaced image mimics legitimate UI elements or branding.
        * If the malicious image exploits decoding vulnerabilities, it could lead to DoS or RCE.
    * **Affected Coil Component:** `ImageLoader`, `NetworkFetcher`, `DiskCache`, `MemoryCache`. Coil's components are directly involved in fetching and caching the compromised data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce HTTPS for all image URLs.** This is the primary defense against network interception.
        * Implement Certificate Pinning for critical image sources to further prevent MITM attacks even with compromised Certificate Authorities.
        * Consider using integrity checks (e.g., checksums) for downloaded images *within the application logic using Coil's callbacks or interceptors* before allowing Coil to cache them, although this adds overhead.

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Coil's Dependencies
    * **Description:** Coil relies on other libraries (dependencies). If these dependencies have security vulnerabilities, they could indirectly affect applications using Coil. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities through Coil's usage of the affected dependency.
    * **Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency. Could range from DoS to RCE.
    * **Affected Coil Component:**  Various components depending on the vulnerable dependency that Coil utilizes.
    * **Risk Severity:**  Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability, can be High or Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Coil updated to the latest version.** Coil developers will typically update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
        * Monitor security advisories for Coil and its dependencies.
        * Consider using tools that scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
