* **`ImageRequest`:** An immutable data class encapsulating all parameters for a single image load, including the image source, target `ImageView`, and transformations.
* **`Interceptor Chain`:** A sequence of interceptors that can intercept, modify, or short-circuit the image loading request and response.
* **`Fetcher Registry`:**  Manages available `Fetcher` implementations, selecting the appropriate one based on the image source type.
* **`Fetcher`:** Responsible for retrieving the raw image data from a specific source (e.g., network, file).
* **`Cache Accessor`:** A unified interface for interacting with both the memory and disk caches.
* **`Memory Cache`:** Stores decoded `Bitmap` objects in memory for fast retrieval.
* **`Disk Cache`:** Stores encoded image data on disk for persistent caching across application sessions.
* **`Decoder Registry`:** Manages available `Decoder` implementations, selecting the appropriate one based on the image format.
* **`Decoder`:** Responsible for decoding raw image data into a `Bitmap` object.
* **`Bitmap Result`:** Represents the successfully decoded `Bitmap` or an error state.
* **`Transformation Engine`:** Applies a series of `Transformation`s to the `Bitmap`.
* **`Transformation`:** An interface for modifying a `Bitmap` (e.g., resizing, cropping).

## 7. Data Flow

The following outlines the typical flow of an image loading request within Coil:

1. The client application initiates an image load by calling `imageLoader.enqueue(imageRequest)`.
2. The `ImageLoader` receives the `ImageRequest`.
3. The `ImageRequest` is passed through the `Interceptor Chain`.
4. The caching interceptor in the chain uses the `Cache Accessor` to check for the image in the `Memory Cache`.
    * **Memory Cache Hit:** The `Bitmap` is retrieved and passed to the `Transformation Engine`.
5. If not in the memory cache, the caching interceptor checks the `Disk Cache` via the `Cache Accessor`.
    * **Disk Cache Hit:** The encoded image data is retrieved, passed to the appropriate `Decoder` (determined by the `Decoder Registry`), decoded into a `Bitmap`, and then passed to the `Transformation Engine`. The `Bitmap` is also stored in the `Memory Cache`.
6. If not in either cache, the request proceeds to the `Fetcher Registry` to select the appropriate `Fetcher` based on the `ImageRequest.data`.
7. The selected `Fetcher` retrieves the raw image data from the source.
8. The raw data is passed to the `Decoder Registry` to select the appropriate `Decoder`.
9. The selected `Decoder` decodes the data into a `Bitmap`.
10. The decoded `Bitmap` is passed to the `Transformation Engine` to apply any specified `Transformation`s.
11. The transformed `Bitmap` is stored in both the `Memory Cache` and the `Disk Cache` (if caching is enabled).
12. The final `Bitmap` is delivered to the target `ImageView` (or custom target).

```

## 8. Security Considerations (For Threat Modeling)

This section outlines potential security vulnerabilities and threats relevant to Coil's architecture.

* **Network Communication (HttpFetcher):**
    * **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** If HTTPS is not enforced, attackers can intercept and potentially modify image data in transit. Ensure `OkHttpClient` is configured to use HTTPS and validate certificates.
    * **Insecure Connections:**  Allowing fallback to HTTP can expose the application to MITM attacks.
    * **Data Injection/Tampering:** Maliciously crafted URLs or responses could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying networking stack or image decoders. Implement robust input validation and error handling.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Fetching excessively large images or making a high volume of requests can exhaust device resources or network bandwidth. Implement request prioritization and limits.
    * **Server-Side Vulnerabilities:** Coil relies on the security of the image servers it interacts with. Vulnerable servers could serve malicious content.
* **Caching (Memory Cache & Disk Cache):**
    * **Cache Poisoning:** If an attacker can compromise the image source, they could inject malicious images into the cache, which would then be served to users. Implement cache validation mechanisms.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive or private images might be unintentionally cached. Implement appropriate cache control policies and consider encrypting the disk cache.
    * **Local Storage Security (Disk Cache):** The disk cache directory should have appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access or modification of cached data.
    * **Cache Overflow/DoS:**  An attacker might try to fill the cache with a large number of unique images, potentially leading to performance issues or denial of service. Implement cache eviction policies and size limits.
* **Decoding (Decoder):**
    * **Image Format Vulnerabilities:** Certain image formats (e.g., maliciously crafted JPEGs or PNGs) might contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited during decoding, potentially leading to crashes, code execution, or information disclosure. Keep decoding libraries up-to-date and consider using secure decoding options.
    * **Integer Overflow/Buffer Overflow:**  Processing very large or malformed images could lead to integer overflows or buffer overflows during decoding.
    * **Denial of Service:** Decoding computationally expensive image formats or very large images can consume excessive CPU and memory, leading to application unresponsiveness or crashes.
* **Transformations (Transformation Engine & Transformations):**
    * **Resource Exhaustion:** Applying complex or chained transformations can consume significant CPU and memory resources, potentially leading to performance issues or crashes.
    * **Bugs in Custom Transformations:**  Custom `Transformation` implementations might contain bugs that could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Ensure thorough testing of custom transformations.
* **Third-Party Dependencies:**
    * Coil relies on libraries like `OkHttpClient` and potentially others. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could directly impact Coil's security. Regularly update dependencies and monitor for security advisories.
* **Input Validation:**
    * Insufficient validation of image URLs or other input parameters could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. Implement robust input validation to prevent issues like SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) if user-provided URLs are used.

## 9. Future Considerations

* **Improved Security Auditing Tools:**  Providing hooks or interfaces to facilitate security audits and penetration testing.
* **Support for Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Integrating with CSP to restrict the sources from which images can be loaded.
* **Enhanced Cache Security:** Exploring options for encrypting the disk cache by default or providing easier configuration for encryption.
* **Fuzzing and Security Testing:**  Implementing automated fuzzing and security testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
