Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Coil, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Image Downloads**
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the image server, potentially replacing legitimate images with malicious ones.
    *   **How Coil Contributes:** Coil initiates and manages the network requests for image downloads. If the underlying network connection is not secure (e.g., using HTTP instead of HTTPS or ignoring certificate validation errors), Coil facilitates the download over an insecure channel.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on a public Wi-Fi network intercepts the download of a user's profile picture and replaces it with a phishing image.
    *   **Impact:** Displaying malicious content, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or defacement of the application's UI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure all image URLs use HTTPS.
            *   **Implement Certificate Pinning:**  Validate the server's SSL certificate against a known good certificate to prevent MITM attacks even if the device's trusted root store is compromised. Coil supports custom `OkHttpClient` configurations where pinning can be implemented.

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Image Decoding Libraries**
    *   **Description:**  Underlying image decoding libraries used by Coil have security vulnerabilities that can be exploited through malicious image files.
    *   **How Coil Contributes:** Coil relies on platform-provided or external libraries for image decoding. If these libraries have vulnerabilities, Coil indirectly exposes the application to these risks when processing images.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a JPEG decoding library allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device by providing a specially crafted JPEG image.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), memory corruption, application crashes, or other unexpected behavior depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Coil and its dependencies (including the Android platform or any external image decoding libraries) to patch known vulnerabilities.
            *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security vulnerabilities affecting image decoding libraries.
