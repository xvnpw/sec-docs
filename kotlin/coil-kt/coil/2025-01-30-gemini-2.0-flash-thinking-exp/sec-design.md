# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Coil-kt project is an image loading library for Android applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a high-performance and efficient image loading solution for Android developers.
  - Simplify the process of image loading and caching in Android apps.
  - Offer a Kotlin-first and modern API for image loading.
  - Reduce boilerplate code associated with image loading in Android.
  - Improve user experience in Android applications by ensuring fast and smooth image loading.
- Business Risks:
  - Performance bottlenecks in image loading can lead to poor user experience and negative app reviews.
  - Inefficient caching mechanisms can result in excessive data usage and slow loading times.
  - Security vulnerabilities in image handling or network communication could expose user data or compromise device security.
  - Compatibility issues with different Android versions or devices can limit adoption and increase development costs.
  - Lack of ongoing maintenance and updates can lead to the library becoming outdated and insecure over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency management using Gradle and Maven Central, ensuring dependencies are from trusted sources. (Implemented in `build.gradle.kts` files)
  - security control: Code reviews and pull requests are used for code changes. (GitHub repository workflow)
  - security control: Static analysis tools and linters are likely used during development (though not explicitly mentioned in the repository, it's a common practice in Kotlin/Android development). (Assumed best practice)
  - security control: HTTPS is used for network communication by default when fetching images from remote servers. (Assumed best practice for network libraries)
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. (Mitigated by dependency updates and security scanning, but not fully eliminated)
  - accepted risk: Potential for denial-of-service if the library is used to load extremely large or numerous images without proper resource management in the integrating application. (Responsibility of the integrating application developer)
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Implement automated security scanning of dependencies to detect known vulnerabilities. (Can be integrated into CI/CD pipeline)
  - recommended security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the build process to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities. (Can be integrated into CI/CD pipeline)
  - recommended security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities. (Part of ongoing maintenance)
  - recommended security control: Implement input validation and sanitization for image URLs and any user-provided data that influences image loading. (Within the library code)
  - recommended security control: Consider implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers if the library is used in contexts where web content is loaded. (Context dependent, might not be directly applicable to the library itself but relevant for applications using it)

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to an image loading library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of the application using the library when accessing protected image resources.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the application using the library to ensure users are authorized to access requested image resources. The library should respect any authorization mechanisms implemented by the application or image server.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate image URLs to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
    - Requirement: Validate image data formats to prevent processing of malicious or malformed image files.
    - Requirement: Sanitize any user-provided input that influences image loading parameters (e.g., image size, transformations).
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Ensure secure communication (HTTPS) when fetching images from remote servers.
    - Requirement: If storing cached images locally, consider encryption of sensitive image data at rest, especially if the application handles user-specific or private images (though this might be application's responsibility, the library should not hinder it).
    - Requirement: Verify the integrity of downloaded images to prevent tampering during transit. (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures if provided by the image server).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing a smooth and fast user experience in Android applications by ensuring efficient image loading and display.
  - Reducing application development time and complexity related to image handling.
  - Minimizing data usage and battery consumption by optimizing image loading and caching.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Image Data:
    - Sensitivity: Varies depending on the application. For many applications, images are publicly available or not highly sensitive. However, in some applications, images might contain personal or sensitive information (e.g., user profile pictures, medical images).
    - Protection Goals: Confidentiality (if images are sensitive), Integrity (ensure images are not tampered with), Availability (ensure images can be loaded when needed).
  - Cached Image Data:
    - Sensitivity: Same as original image data.
    - Protection Goals: Same as original image data, plus secure storage of cached data.
  - Application Data related to Image Loading (e.g., request parameters, cache metadata):
    - Sensitivity: Low to Medium. Could potentially reveal usage patterns or application behavior.
    - Protection Goals: Integrity (ensure data is not tampered with), Availability.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that applications using Coil-kt might need to adhere to regarding image data handling? (Assumption: No specific compliance requirements are directly imposed on the library itself, but applications using it might have compliance obligations).
  - Are there any specific performance benchmarks or SLAs that Coil-kt aims to achieve? (Assumption: Performance is a key non-functional requirement, but specific benchmarks are not explicitly defined in the input).
  - What is the intended scope of security support and maintenance for Coil-kt in the long term? (Assumption: The project is actively maintained by the community, and security updates will be provided as needed).

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a high-quality, efficient, and developer-friendly image loading library for Android.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Standard security practices for software development and open-source projects are followed. HTTPS is used for network communication. Basic input validation is expected.
  - DESIGN: The design is modular and component-based, allowing for maintainability and extensibility. Caching is a core feature. The library is designed to be integrated into typical Android applications.
  - DEPLOYMENT: Coil-kt is deployed as a library within Android applications, which are deployed on user's Android devices.
  - BUILD: A standard CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions is used for build, test, and potentially security checks. Artifacts are published to Maven Central or GitHub Packages.
