# BUSINESS POSTURE

Coil is an image loading library for Android. It's likely that the primary business goal is to provide a fast, efficient, lightweight, and easy-to-use solution for developers to load images in their Android applications. This contributes to a positive user experience within those apps (faster loading, less memory usage). The project is open-source, so community adoption, contribution, and positive reputation are also important.

Business priorities:

-   Performance: Image loading should be fast and efficient, minimizing impact on application responsiveness and battery life.
-   Ease of Use: The library should be simple to integrate and use for developers of all skill levels.
-   Reliability: The library should handle various image formats, network conditions, and error scenarios gracefully.
-   Maintainability: The codebase should be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain and extend.
-   Community: Foster a vibrant and active community around the project.

Business risks:

-   Security vulnerabilities in the library could expose applications using it to attacks, such as remote code execution or denial of service.
-   Poor performance or instability could negatively impact the user experience of applications using the library.
-   Lack of adoption or negative community perception could lead to the project becoming obsolete.
-   Inability to keep up with changes in the Android ecosystem (new APIs, formats, etc.) could render the library less useful over time.
-   Legal issues related to image processing (e.g., handling of copyrighted material) could arise.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls (based on the GitHub repository):

-   security control: Dependency management: Uses Gradle for dependency management, allowing for version control and updates of third-party libraries. (build.gradle.kts files)
-   security control: Testing: Includes unit and integration tests to verify functionality and prevent regressions. (src/test/ and src/androidtest/ directories)
-   security control: Code style and analysis: Uses Detekt and Ktlint for static code analysis to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues. (.github/workflows/build.yml)
-   security control: Proguard/R8 configuration: Offers configuration options for code shrinking and obfuscation, which can provide a basic level of protection against reverse engineering. (consumer-rules.pro)
-   security control: Handles network operations: Uses OkHttp for network requests, which provides features like connection pooling, timeouts, and support for modern TLS/SSL. (Coil uses OkHttp internally)
-   security control: Supports HTTPS: Encourages the use of HTTPS for secure image loading. (Documentation and examples)
-   security control: Caching mechanisms: Implements memory and disk caching to reduce network requests and improve performance. (Caching is a core feature)
-   security control: Open Source: Being open source allows for community scrutiny and contributions, potentially leading to faster identification and resolution of security vulnerabilities.

Accepted risks:

-   accepted risk: The library processes untrusted image data from potentially untrusted sources (URLs). This inherently carries risks of vulnerabilities related to image parsing and decoding.
-   accepted risk: The library relies on third-party libraries (OkHttp, AndroidX components, etc.), which may have their own security vulnerabilities.
-   accepted risk: The library's caching mechanisms could potentially be exploited to store malicious data if not configured correctly.
-   accepted risk: The library might not be fully hardened against all possible attack vectors, especially those related to image processing vulnerabilities.

Recommended security controls:

-   security control: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all URLs and image data.
-   security control: Integrate a security linter or static analysis tool specifically designed for security vulnerabilities (e.g., FindSecBugs, SpotBugs with security plugins).
-   security control: Regularly update all dependencies to their latest secure versions, including transitive dependencies. Implement automated dependency scanning.
-   security control: Consider using a fuzzer to test the image parsing and decoding components for vulnerabilities.
-   security control: Provide clear security documentation and guidelines for developers using the library, including best practices for secure configuration and usage.
-   security control: Establish a security vulnerability reporting process and actively respond to reported issues.
-   security control: Consider implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) if applicable to the context of the library's usage.
-   security control: Explore using more secure image loading techniques, such as sandboxing image decoding processes.

Security requirements:

-   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as the library itself doesn't handle authentication. However, if the library is used to load images from authenticated sources, it should support standard authentication mechanisms (e.g., passing headers with authentication tokens).
-   Authorization: Not directly applicable, as the library doesn't manage authorization. However, it should be compatible with applications that implement authorization mechanisms for accessing image resources.
-   Input Validation:
    -   URLs should be validated to ensure they are well-formed and point to supported image sources.
    -   Image data should be validated to ensure it conforms to expected formats and sizes.
    -   Headers and other metadata associated with image requests should be validated.
-   Cryptography:
    -   HTTPS should be enforced for all network requests to ensure secure communication.
    -   If caching sensitive images, consider encrypting the cached data.
-   Image Processing:
    -   The library should be resistant to common image processing vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, and format string vulnerabilities.
    -   Consider using memory-safe languages or libraries for image processing if possible.

## DEPLOYMENT

Coil is a library, not a standalone application. Therefore, deployment is about how it's integrated into other Android applications.

Possible deployment solutions:

1.  **Dependency Management System (Gradle/Maven):** Developers add Coil as a dependency in their project's build file (e.g., build.gradle). The dependency management system automatically downloads and includes the library in the application. This is the standard and recommended approach.
2.  **Manual Integration:** Developers could theoretically download the library's source code or compiled artifacts and manually include them in their project. This is not recommended due to complexity and difficulty in managing updates.

Chosen solution (described in detail): Dependency Management System (Gradle)

5.  **Static Analysis (Detekt, Ktlint):** Detekt and Ktlint are used for static code analysis to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues.
6.  **Unit & Integration Tests:** Unit and integration tests are executed to verify the functionality of the library.
7.  **Artifact Generation (AAR):** The build process generates an Android Archive (AAR) file, which is the standard format for Android libraries.
8.  **Maven Central/Google's Maven Repository:** The generated AAR file is published to Maven Central or Google's Maven Repository, making it available for developers to include in their projects.
9. **Reports**: Static analysis and tests generate reports that can be reviewed.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes to protect:

-   **Image loading pipeline:** The core functionality of the library must be reliable and performant. Any disruption or vulnerability in this pipeline directly impacts the user experience of applications using Coil.
-   **Dependency management:** Ensuring that the library and its dependencies are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities is crucial.
-   **Community trust and reputation:** Maintaining a positive reputation and trust within the developer community is essential for the long-term success of the project.

Data to protect and their sensitivity:

-   **Image data (in transit and at rest in cache):** While Coil primarily deals with publicly accessible images, there might be cases where applications use it to load sensitive or private images. The sensitivity of this data depends on the specific application using Coil.
    -   Sensitivity: Potentially high, depending on the application.
-   **URLs and metadata associated with image requests:** These could potentially reveal information about the application or its users.
    -   Sensitivity: Low to moderate.
-   **Source code and build artifacts:** Protecting the integrity of the source code and build artifacts is crucial to prevent malicious code injection.
    -   Sensitivity: High.
