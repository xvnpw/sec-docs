# Threat Model Analysis for coil-kt/coil

## Threat: [Malicious Image Substitution (Coil-Specific Aspects)](./threats/malicious_image_substitution__coil-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within Coil's URL parsing or request handling logic* to bypass application-level URL validation.  Even if the application *attempts* to validate the URL, a flaw in Coil could allow a malicious URL to be processed. This is distinct from the application simply failing to validate the URL.  The attacker's server returns a malicious image.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Display of inappropriate or misleading content.
    *   Potential execution of malicious code if the image contains an exploit targeting a vulnerability in the image decoder (see Decoder Vulnerability Exploitation).
    *   Phishing attacks.
*   **Coil Component Affected:**
    *   `ImageLoader`: Specifically, the internal logic for handling `ImageRequest` and initiating the network request.
    *   `ImageRequest`: The `data` property (URL handling) and any custom `Fetcher` used.
    *   Any custom `Fetcher` or `Decoder` implementations if they are used and have vulnerabilities *that bypass application-level checks*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Defense in Depth:** Even though this threat targets Coil directly, *strong application-level URL validation is still crucial*.  This provides a layer of defense even if Coil has a vulnerability. Use allow-lists, not block-lists.
    *   **Coil Updates:** Keep Coil updated to the latest version.  Vulnerabilities in Coil's URL handling would likely be patched in updates.
    *   **Review Custom Components:** If using custom `Fetcher` or `Decoder` implementations, thoroughly audit them for security vulnerabilities, especially related to URL handling and input validation.
    *   **Report Vulnerabilities:** If you suspect a vulnerability in Coil's URL handling, report it responsibly to the Coil maintainers.

## Threat: [Decoder Vulnerability Exploitation (Coil's Role)](./threats/decoder_vulnerability_exploitation__coil's_role_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file designed to exploit a vulnerability in the *image decoding library used by Coil*. While the vulnerability exists in the *decoder* (e.g., `BitmapFactory` on Android), Coil is the component that *uses* the decoder, making it a direct factor in the exploit chain. The attacker successfully triggers the vulnerability through Coil.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application crash.
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution, leading to complete compromise of the application and potentially the device.
*   **Coil Component Affected:**
    *   `Decoder`: The component responsible for decoding the image data. This often relies on platform-provided decoders (like `BitmapFactory` on Android).
    *   `ImageLoader`: The component that uses the `Decoder`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** This is the *most critical* mitigation. Keep Coil and its dependencies (especially the underlying image decoding libraries, which are often part of the OS) up-to-date. Security patches for decoders are frequently released.
    *   **Coil's Role in Updates:** Monitor Coil releases for updates that may include changes to how it interacts with decoders or that bundle updated decoder libraries (if applicable).
    *   **Input Validation (Limited Effectiveness):** While basic input validation (e.g., checking file extensions) is good practice, it's *not* a reliable defense against sophisticated decoder exploits.  However, it can help prevent some simpler attacks.
    *   **Sandboxing (Difficult):** Ideally, image decoding would happen in a sandboxed process, limiting the impact of a vulnerability. This is often very difficult to achieve in practice, especially on Android.
    * **Alternative Decoders (If Available and Secure):** In some very specific, high-security scenarios, and if technically feasible, you *might* consider using a different, potentially more secure, image decoding library with Coil. This requires *extreme* care and expertise to ensure the alternative decoder is actually more secure and doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities. This is generally *not* recommended unless absolutely necessary.

## Threat: [Cached Image Tampering (If Coil's Caching is Misconfigured)](./threats/cached_image_tampering__if_coil's_caching_is_misconfigured_.md)

*   **Description:** While primarily a file system permission issue, if Coil's `DiskCache` is misconfigured (e.g., using a world-writable directory) *by the application developer*, an attacker could replace legitimate cached images with malicious ones. This highlights Coil's *direct* involvement because the misconfiguration is within Coil's setup.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Display of malicious images, even offline.
    *   Potential code execution (via decoder vulnerabilities).
*   **Coil Component Affected:**
    *   `diskCache`: Specifically, the configuration and location of the disk cache.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential for persistent compromise)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Correct `DiskCache` Configuration:** The *application developer* must ensure that Coil's `DiskCache` is configured to use a secure, private directory with appropriate file permissions. This is *not* something Coil can automatically enforce; it's the developer's responsibility. Follow platform-specific best practices for secure file storage.
    *   **Review Documentation:** Carefully review Coil's documentation regarding `DiskCache` configuration and security recommendations.
    *   **Least Privilege:** The application should run with the least necessary privileges, limiting the potential damage from a compromised cache.
