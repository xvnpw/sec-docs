        print("""
        A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on image downloads using Coil involves the
        following steps:

        1. **Interception:** The attacker positions themselves on the network path
           between the application and the image server. This could be through
           compromising a Wi-Fi network, DNS spoofing, or other network-level attacks.

        2. **Request Interception:** When the application, using Coil's `NetworkFetcher`,
           makes a request to download an image, the attacker intercepts this request.

        3. **Malicious Action:** The attacker can perform several malicious actions:
           * **Image Replacement:** The attacker downloads the legitimate image from the
             server but replaces it with a malicious image before forwarding it to the
             application. This malicious image could be visually similar or completely
             different.
           * **Content Modification:** The attacker might subtly alter the image data
             itself, potentially injecting malicious code or exploiting vulnerabilities
             in the image decoding process.
           * **Redirection:** The attacker could redirect the request to a completely
             different server hosting malicious content.

        4. **Delivery to Application:** Coil's `NetworkFetcher` receives the manipulated
           image data from the attacker, believing it came from the legitimate server.

        5. **Rendering:** The application renders the malicious image, leading to the
           intended impact.

        The `NetworkFetcher` is the vulnerable point because it's responsible for the
        actual network communication and data retrieval. Without proper security measures,
        it blindly accepts the data it receives.

    def _detail_impact(self):
        print("\n### Detailed Impact Assessment:\n")
        print("""
        The impact of a successful MITM attack on image downloads can be significant:

        * **Display of Altered Images:** This is the most immediate and visible impact.
          Attackers can replace legitimate images with misleading information,
          propaganda, or offensive content, potentially damaging the application's
          reputation and user trust.

        * **Malware Delivery via Image Decoding Vulnerabilities:** Specially crafted
          images can exploit vulnerabilities in the image decoding libraries used by
          the Android platform or any custom decoders Coil might utilize. This could
          lead to:
            * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary
              code on the user's device.
            * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the application or the device.
            * **Information Disclosure:** Potentially leaking sensitive data.

        * **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could replace legitimate images with fake
          login screens or other deceptive content to trick users into providing
          credentials or sensitive information.

        * **Brand Damage:** Displaying inappropriate or harmful content can severely
          damage the brand image and user trust associated with the application.

        * **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Depending on the nature of the malicious
          content displayed, the application owner could face legal repercussions.

    def _evaluate_mitigations(self):
        print("\n### Evaluation of Mitigation Strategies:\n")

        print("**1. Enforce HTTPS for all image requests:**")
        print("""
        * **How it Mitigates:** HTTPS encrypts the communication between the application
          and the image server using TLS/SSL. This encryption prevents attackers from
          easily intercepting and understanding the data being transmitted, making it
          extremely difficult to modify the image data in transit.

        * **Effectiveness:** This is the **most fundamental and crucial** mitigation.
          It significantly raises the bar for attackers.

        * **Implementation:** Ensure that the application only loads images from URLs
          starting with `https://`. This can be enforced through code checks and
          configuration.

        * **Limitations:** Relies on the trust of Certificate Authorities (CAs). If a
          CA is compromised, attackers could potentially obtain valid certificates for
          malicious servers.
        """)

        print("\n**2. Implement certificate pinning for the image server (advanced):**")
        print("""
        * **How it Mitigates:** Certificate pinning goes beyond standard HTTPS by
          explicitly trusting only a specific certificate (or a set of certificates)
          for the image server. The application validates the server's certificate
          against the pinned certificate during the TLS handshake.

        * **Effectiveness:** This is a **highly effective** advanced security measure
          that protects against MITM attacks even if a CA is compromised.

        * **Implementation:** Requires embedding the expected certificate (or its hash)
          within the application. Coil or a lower-level networking library would need
          to be configured to perform the pinning check.

        * **Complexity:** This is a more complex strategy to implement and maintain.
          It requires careful management of pinned certificates and updates when the
          server's certificate is rotated. Incorrect implementation can lead to
          application failures.

        * **When to Consider:** Essential for applications handling highly sensitive
          data or when communicating with critical infrastructure where the risk of CA
          compromise is a significant concern.

        print("\n### Additional Security Considerations and Recommendations:\n")
        print("""
        Beyond the core mitigation strategies, consider these additional measures to
        further enhance security:

        * **Input Validation:** While the primary threat is on the network, validating
          the image URL before initiating the download can prevent attacks that try
          to load images from unexpected or untrusted sources.

        * **Secure Defaults:** Ensure Coil's default settings are secure. For example,
          verify that Coil doesn't automatically follow HTTP redirects to non-HTTPS
          URLs.

        * **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling for network
          requests and image loading. Log potential security-related events, such as
          certificate validation failures, to aid in debugging and incident response.

        * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Periodically assess the
          application's security posture, including the image loading process, to
          identify potential vulnerabilities.

        * **Stay Updated with Coil and Android Security Updates:** Keep the Coil
          library and the underlying Android platform updated to patch known security
          vulnerabilities.

        * **Consider Using Coil's Built-in Security Features (if any):** Review Coil's
          documentation for any built-in security features or best practices related
          to network requests and certificate validation.

        **Recommendations for the Development Team:**

        * **Prioritize Enforcing HTTPS:** This should be a non-negotiable requirement.
          Implement checks to ensure all image URLs use HTTPS.

        * **Evaluate Certificate Pinning:** For high-security applications, carefully
          evaluate the feasibility and benefits of implementing certificate pinning.

        * **Implement Comprehensive Error Handling:** Handle network errors and potential
          certificate validation failures gracefully.

        * **Educate Developers:** Ensure the development team understands the risks
          associated with MITM attacks and how to implement secure image loading practices.

        * **Test Thoroughly:** Conduct thorough testing, including simulating MITM
          attacks, to verify the effectiveness of the implemented security measures.
