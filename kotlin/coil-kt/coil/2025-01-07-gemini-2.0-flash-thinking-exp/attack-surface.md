# Attack Surface Analysis for coil-kt/coil

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Image Downloads](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_image_downloads.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the image server, potentially modifying the image data in transit.
    *   **How Coil Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Coil initiates the network request to download the image based on the provided URL. If the connection is not secured with HTTPS, the data is transmitted in plaintext, making it vulnerable to interception. Coil's configuration regarding TLS/SSL verification also plays a role.
    *   **Example:** An application loads an image from `http://example.com/image.jpg` while the user is connected to an open Wi-Fi network. An attacker intercepts the request and replaces the legitimate image with a malicious one.
    *   **Impact:** Displaying misleading, offensive, or malicious content to the user. This could be used for phishing, spreading misinformation, or defacing the application's UI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all image URLs: Ensure that the application only loads images from HTTPS URLs.
        *   Configure Coil for strict TLS/SSL verification: Verify that Coil is configured to properly validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate, preventing bypasses of HTTPS protection.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via User-Controlled Image URLs](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_user-controlled_image_urls.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the image URL to make the application (via Coil) send requests to unintended internal or external resources.
    *   **How Coil Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Coil directly uses the provided image URL to make network requests. If the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize these URLs, an attacker can inject malicious URLs.
    *   **Example:** A user can input a profile picture URL. An attacker provides a URL like `http://internal-server/admin-panel` intending to access an internal administration interface. Coil, without proper validation, attempts to load this "image."
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal services, data breaches, denial of service of internal resources, or even remote code execution on internal systems depending on the vulnerabilities of the targeted internal services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided image URLs: Implement whitelisting or blacklisting of allowed domains/IP ranges.
        *   Avoid using user input directly in image URLs without validation.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF.

## Attack Surface: [Image Format Vulnerabilities Leading to Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/image_format_vulnerabilities_leading_to_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:**  Maliciously crafted images exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying image decoding libraries used by Coil.
    *   **How Coil Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Coil relies on image decoding libraries (either the platform's built-in ones or potentially its own dependencies) to process and display images. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be triggered by specific image structures.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PNG image containing a vulnerability that causes a buffer overflow in the decoding library when Coil attempts to load it. This could potentially lead to a crash or even remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, memory corruption, and potentially remote code execution on the user's device.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Coil and its dependencies updated: Regularly update Coil to benefit from security patches in its dependencies, including image decoding libraries.
        *   Consider using image processing libraries with known security track records and actively maintained.
        *   Implement sandboxing or other isolation techniques to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities in image decoding.
