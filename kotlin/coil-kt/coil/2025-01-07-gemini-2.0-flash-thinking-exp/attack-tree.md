## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Coil [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_coil__critical_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies a complete breach of the application's security through vulnerabilities in the Coil library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Image Loading Process [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_image_loading_process__critical_.md)

This node highlights the core attack surface introduced by Coil. Exploiting vulnerabilities during the process of fetching, decoding, and displaying images is a primary way to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Image Source [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_image_source__critical_.md)

Gaining control over the source of the image Coil loads allows the attacker to deliver arbitrary content, including malicious payloads. This is a powerful position for an attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Image Content [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_image_content__critical_.md)

This node focuses on the danger of the image data itself. If an attacker can deliver a specially crafted image, they can potentially trigger vulnerabilities leading to code execution or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Coil's Internal Logic [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_coil's_internal_logic__critical_.md)

Targeting vulnerabilities within Coil's own code provides a direct path to compromise, potentially bypassing other security measures focused on image sources or content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack__high_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker intercepts the network traffic between the application and the server hosting the image.

**Mechanism:** The attacker replaces the legitimate image being downloaded by Coil with a malicious image hosted on their own server.

**Potential Impact:** Coil loads and processes the malicious image, potentially leading to code execution if the image contains an exploit or if the attacker controls the content being displayed.

## Attack Tree Path: [URL Injection/Manipulation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/url_injectionmanipulation__high_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application constructs the image URL based on user-supplied input or data from an untrusted source without proper sanitization.

**Mechanism:** An attacker injects a malicious URL into the image loading process, causing Coil to fetch an image from a server controlled by the attacker.

**Potential Impact:** Coil loads and processes the malicious image, potentially leading to code execution or the display of misleading or harmful content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deliver Image with Malicious Payload [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/deliver_image_with_malicious_payload__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Embed exploit code within image metadata (e.g., EXIF)](./attack_tree_paths/embed_exploit_code_within_image_metadata__e_g___exif_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers embed malicious scripts or commands within the metadata of an image file.

**Mechanism:** If Coil or an underlying library parses this metadata without proper sanitization, the embedded code can be executed.

**Potential Impact:** Code execution within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Embed exploit code within image data itself (e.g., buffer overflow in decoder) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/embed_exploit_code_within_image_data_itself__e_g___buffer_overflow_in_decoder___high_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers craft an image file with specific data structures that exploit vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows) in the image decoding libraries used by Coil.

**Mechanism:** When Coil attempts to decode the malicious image, the vulnerability is triggered, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Potential Impact:** Remote code execution on the application's server or the user's device.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerable Code Path [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerable_code_path__high_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers provide specific image formats or content that triggers a known bug or vulnerability in Coil's internal processing logic.

**Mechanism:** By carefully crafting the input image, attackers can force Coil to execute a vulnerable code path.

**Potential Impact:** Application crash, unexpected behavior, or potentially code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Coil [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_coil__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Image Decoding Library [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_image_decoding_library__high_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Coil relies on external libraries (like `skia-android` or `libwebp`) for image decoding. These libraries may contain known vulnerabilities.

**Mechanism:** Attackers craft malicious images that exploit these vulnerabilities in the underlying decoding libraries when Coil attempts to process them.

**Potential Impact:** Remote code execution due to vulnerabilities in the decoding process.
