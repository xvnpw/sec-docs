### Key Attack Surfaces Introduced by Filament (High & Critical)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious 3D Model Files
    *   **Description:** Crafted 3D model files with malformed or excessively large data can exploit vulnerabilities in Filament's model parsing logic.
    *   **How Filament Contributes:** Filament's responsibility for parsing various 3D model formats (e.g., glTF, OBJ) introduces the risk of vulnerabilities within these parsing implementations.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted glTF file with an extremely large number of vertices or indices could trigger a buffer overflow during parsing.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow can be controlled.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation on 3D model files *before* passing them to Filament. This includes checking file size limits, data structure integrity, and adherence to format specifications.
        *   Use up-to-date versions of Filament to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the model parsing libraries.
        *   Consider using a separate, sandboxed process for model parsing to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Shader Code (Material Definitions)
    *   **Description:**  Attackers can inject malicious code into shader definitions if the application dynamically generates shaders based on untrusted input without proper sanitization.
    *   **How Filament Contributes:** Filament's support for custom material definitions using a shading language (similar to GLSL) allows for complex and potentially harmful code execution on the GPU.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject code into a dynamically generated shader that reads sensitive data from the rendering context or causes a denial of service by creating an infinite loop on the GPU.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service (GPU hang or application freeze), unexpected visual artifacts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamically generating shader code based on user input whenever possible.
        *   If dynamic shader generation is necessary, implement strict input sanitization and validation to prevent the injection of malicious code.
        *   Use a whitelist approach for allowed shader keywords and functions.
        *   Consider using pre-compiled shaders or a more restricted material definition system.

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal in Asset Loading
    *   **Description:** If the application allows users to specify file paths for loading assets (models, textures, shaders) without proper sanitization, attackers could potentially access files outside the intended directories.
    *   **How Filament Contributes:** Filament's asset loading mechanisms rely on the application providing file paths. If these paths are not properly validated, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could provide a path like "../../sensitive_data.txt" to load a texture, potentially gaining access to sensitive files on the server or client system.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for arbitrary file access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid allowing users to directly specify file paths for asset loading.
        *   If user-provided paths are necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks.
        *   Use relative paths and a well-defined asset directory structure.
        *   Consider using asset management systems that abstract away the underlying file system.
