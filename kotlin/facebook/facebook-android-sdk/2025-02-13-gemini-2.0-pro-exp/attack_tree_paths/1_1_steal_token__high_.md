Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Steal Token (HIGH)" attack path from an attack tree targeting an Android application using the Facebook Android SDK.

## Deep Analysis: Steal Token (Attack Path 1.1)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the various methods an attacker could employ to steal a valid Facebook access token from an Android application utilizing the Facebook SDK.  This understanding will inform the development of robust security measures to mitigate these risks.  We aim to identify vulnerabilities, assess their exploitability, and propose concrete countermeasures.  The ultimate goal is to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data via stolen tokens.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses *exclusively* on the "Steal Token" attack path (1.1) within the broader attack tree.  We will consider:

*   **Android Application Context:**  The analysis is specific to Android applications.  We will not cover web applications or other platforms.
*   **Facebook Android SDK:**  We assume the application correctly integrates and uses the official Facebook Android SDK (as provided by the linked repository).  We will *not* analyze vulnerabilities in custom-built Facebook login implementations.
*   **Token Storage and Handling:**  We will examine how the SDK and the application itself store, transmit, and manage the access token.
*   **Common Attack Vectors:**  We will focus on realistic and prevalent attack vectors relevant to Android and the Facebook SDK.
*   **Post-Compromise Actions:** While the primary focus is on *stealing* the token, we will briefly touch upon the potential consequences of a stolen token to highlight the severity.

**1.3 Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methodologies:

*   **Threat Modeling:**  We will use a threat modeling approach to systematically identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Review (Conceptual):**  While we don't have access to the specific application's code, we will conceptually review common coding patterns and potential vulnerabilities based on best practices and known issues with the Facebook SDK.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities in the Facebook Android SDK, Android OS, and related libraries.  This includes reviewing CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), security advisories, and research papers.
*   **Static Analysis (Conceptual):** We will conceptually apply static analysis principles to identify potential weaknesses in how the token might be handled.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):** We will conceptually apply dynamic analysis principles, considering how an attacker might interact with a running application to extract the token.
*   **Best Practices Review:**  We will compare potential vulnerabilities against established security best practices for Android development and secure token management.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Steal Token (1.1)

This section breaks down the "Steal Token" attack path into specific attack vectors, analyzes their feasibility, and proposes mitigation strategies.

**2.1 Attack Vectors:**

We can categorize the methods for stealing a Facebook access token into several key attack vectors:

*   **2.1.1  Insecure Storage:**
    *   **Description:** The application stores the access token in a location that is easily accessible to other applications or attackers with device access.  This is the most common and critical vulnerability.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **2.1.1.a  Unencrypted Shared Preferences:** Storing the token in `SharedPreferences` without encryption.  Any app with `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission (or root access) can read this data.
        *   **2.1.1.b  Plaintext Files:** Storing the token in a plaintext file on external storage (SD card) or even internal storage without proper permissions.
        *   **2.1.1.c  World-Readable Databases:** Storing the token in a SQLite database with overly permissive file permissions.
        *   **2.1.1.d  Hardcoded Tokens:**  (Less likely for *issued* tokens, but possible for development/testing) Hardcoding a token directly in the application's code.  This is easily extracted via reverse engineering.
        *   **2.1.1.e  Insecure KeyStore Usage:** Improperly using the Android KeyStore system, such as using a weak key alias or predictable key generation parameters.
        *   **2.1.1.f  Debuggable Build:** Shipping a debuggable build of the application.  Attackers can use debugging tools to inspect memory and extract the token.
    *   **Feasibility:** HIGH.  Insecure storage is a prevalent issue in Android applications.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Use EncryptedSharedPreferences:**  Utilize the `EncryptedSharedPreferences` class from the Android Jetpack Security library. This provides automatic encryption and decryption of data stored in SharedPreferences.
        *   **Android KeyStore System:**  Store sensitive data like tokens (or keys used to encrypt tokens) securely within the Android KeyStore system.  Use strong, randomly generated keys.
        *   **Avoid External Storage:**  Never store access tokens on external storage.
        *   **Proper File Permissions:**  If storing data in internal storage files, use the most restrictive file permissions possible (`MODE_PRIVATE`).
        *   **Database Security:**  If using a database, ensure it's encrypted (e.g., using SQLCipher) and has appropriate access controls.
        *   **Code Obfuscation & Anti-Tampering:**  Use ProGuard/R8 and consider additional code obfuscation and anti-tampering techniques to make reverse engineering more difficult.
        *   **Release Builds Only:**  Never ship a debuggable build to production.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify storage vulnerabilities.

*   **2.1.2  Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:**  The application exposes the access token through insecure IPC mechanisms, allowing other malicious applications to intercept it.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **2.1.2.a  Unprotected Broadcast Receivers:**  The application broadcasts the token (or information that can be used to obtain it) via an unprotected `BroadcastReceiver`.
        *   **2.1.2.b  Insecure Content Providers:**  The application exposes the token through a `ContentProvider` without proper permission checks.
        *   **2.1.2.c  Vulnerable Services:**  The application uses an `IntentService` or other service that leaks the token due to improper handling of incoming Intents.
        *   **2.1.2.d  Implicit Intents:** Using implicit intents to handle sensitive data, which can be intercepted by malicious apps.
    *   **Feasibility:** MEDIUM to HIGH.  IPC vulnerabilities are common, especially in complex applications.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Use Explicit Intents:**  Whenever possible, use explicit Intents to communicate between components within your application.
        *   **Permission Checks:**  Implement strict permission checks for all IPC mechanisms (BroadcastReceivers, ContentProviders, Services).  Use custom permissions where appropriate.
        *   **LocalBroadcastManager:**  For broadcasts within your application, use `LocalBroadcastManager` to prevent other applications from receiving them.
        *   **Secure Content Providers:**  Carefully design and implement Content Providers with robust permission models and input validation.
        *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in Intents:**  Never include the access token directly in an Intent.  If you must pass related data, use a secure identifier or a short-lived, one-time-use token.

*   **2.1.3  Network Interception (Man-in-the-Middle - MitM):**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker intercepts the network communication between the application and Facebook's servers, capturing the access token during transmission.  This is less likely if HTTPS is used *correctly*, but vulnerabilities can still exist.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **2.1.3.a  Lack of Certificate Pinning:**  The application does not implement certificate pinning, making it vulnerable to MitM attacks using forged certificates.
        *   **2.1.3.b  Trusting Custom Certificate Authorities (CAs):**  The application trusts user-installed or malicious CAs, allowing an attacker to intercept traffic.
        *   **2.1.3.c  Vulnerable TLS/SSL Libraries:**  The application uses an outdated or vulnerable version of a TLS/SSL library (e.g., an old version of OpenSSL).
        *   **2.1.3.d  Downgrade Attacks:** The attacker forces the connection to use a weaker, compromised encryption protocol.
    *   **Feasibility:** MEDIUM.  Requires the attacker to be in a position to intercept network traffic (e.g., on the same Wi-Fi network, compromised router, malicious VPN).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Certificate Pinning:**  Implement certificate pinning to ensure the application only trusts the legitimate Facebook server certificate (or a small set of trusted certificates).  The Facebook SDK itself should handle this for its own communication, but verify this and pin any other connections made by your app that might handle the token.
        *   **Network Security Configuration:** Use Android's Network Security Configuration to control which CAs are trusted and enforce TLS requirements.
        *   **Up-to-Date Libraries:**  Keep all network-related libraries (including the Facebook SDK and any HTTP clients) up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Avoid Mixed Content:**  Ensure all communication is over HTTPS.  Do not load any resources over HTTP.
        *   **Monitor for TLS Errors:**  Implement robust error handling for TLS/SSL connection failures, and log any suspicious activity.

*   **2.1.4  Reverse Engineering and Code Manipulation:**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker decompiles the application's APK, analyzes the code, and identifies how the access token is handled.  They might then modify the code to extract the token or bypass security checks.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **2.1.4.a  Decompilation:**  Using tools like `apktool`, `dex2jar`, and `jd-gui` to reverse engineer the application's code.
        *   **2.1.4.b  Code Injection:**  Using frameworks like Frida or Xposed to inject code into the running application and extract the token from memory.
        *   **2.1.4.c  Tampering with SDK:** Modifying the Facebook SDK itself to leak the token.
    *   **Feasibility:** MEDIUM to HIGH.  Reverse engineering is relatively easy, but code injection and SDK tampering require more advanced skills.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Code Obfuscation:**  Use ProGuard/R8 to obfuscate the code, making it more difficult to understand.
        *   **Native Code (NDK):**  Implement critical security logic in native code (C/C++) using the Android NDK.  This is harder to reverse engineer than Java/Kotlin code.
        *   **Root Detection:**  Implement root detection to prevent the application from running on rooted devices, which are more vulnerable to code injection.
        *   **Integrity Checks:**  Implement integrity checks to detect if the application's code has been modified.
        *   **Anti-Debugging Techniques:**  Use anti-debugging techniques to make it more difficult for attackers to attach a debugger to the application.

*   **2.1.5  WebView Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:** If the application uses a `WebView` to handle any part of the Facebook login flow (not recommended, but possible), vulnerabilities in the `WebView` could be exploited to steal the token.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **2.1.5.a  JavaScript Injection:**  An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `WebView`, which can then access the token.
        *   **2.1.5.b  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  If the `WebView` loads content from a vulnerable website, an XSS attack could be used to steal the token.
        *   **2.1.5.c  File Access:**  Improperly configured `WebView` settings could allow access to local files, potentially including the token.
    *   **Feasibility:** MEDIUM.  Depends on how the `WebView` is used and configured.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Avoid WebViews for Login:**  Use the Facebook SDK's built-in login mechanisms, which are designed to be secure.  Do *not* implement the login flow manually using a `WebView`.
        *   **Enable JavaScript Carefully:**  Only enable JavaScript in the `WebView` if absolutely necessary.
        *   **Disable File Access:**  Disable file access from the `WebView` unless absolutely required.
        *   **Set WebSettings Securely:**  Configure the `WebView`'s `WebSettings` with secure defaults (e.g., disable `setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs` and `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs`).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  If loading external content, use a Content Security Policy to restrict the resources the `WebView` can load.
        *   **Input Validation:** Sanitize any input passed to the webview.

*   **2.1.6  Social Engineering / Phishing:**
    *   **Description:**  The attacker tricks the user into revealing their Facebook credentials or granting access to a malicious application that then steals the token. This is technically outside the application itself, but a significant threat.
    *   **Feasibility:** HIGH.  Social engineering is often the easiest way to compromise a user's account.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **User Education:**  Educate users about phishing attacks and the importance of not entering their credentials into untrusted applications or websites.
        *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Encourage users to enable 2FA on their Facebook accounts. This adds an extra layer of security even if their credentials are stolen.
        *   **App Reputation:** Maintain a good app reputation and respond promptly to user reports of suspicious activity.

*   **2.1.7 Facebook SDK Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:**  A vulnerability in the Facebook SDK itself could allow an attacker to steal the access token.
    *   **Feasibility:** LOW. Facebook actively maintains and updates their SDK. However, zero-day vulnerabilities are always a possibility.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Keep SDK Updated:**  Regularly update to the latest version of the Facebook SDK to receive security patches.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:**  Monitor Facebook's security advisories and developer blogs for announcements of vulnerabilities and updates.
        *   **Independent Security Audits:** Consider commissioning independent security audits of your application, including the integration with the Facebook SDK.

**2.2  Consequences of Stolen Token:**

A stolen Facebook access token can have severe consequences, including:

*   **Unauthorized Access to User's Facebook Account:**  The attacker can post on the user's behalf, send messages, access private information, and potentially damage the user's reputation.
*   **Access to Sensitive Data:**  If the application uses the token to access other services or APIs, the attacker could gain access to sensitive data stored in those services.
*   **Account Takeover:**  The attacker could potentially change the user's password and completely take over their Facebook account.
*   **Financial Loss:**  If the application is linked to financial transactions, the attacker could potentially steal money or make unauthorized purchases.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach involving stolen tokens can damage the reputation of the application and the company behind it.

### 3. Conclusion

Stealing a Facebook access token is a high-impact attack.  The most likely attack vectors involve insecure storage of the token within the Android application.  Mitigation requires a multi-layered approach, including secure coding practices, proper use of Android's security features (EncryptedSharedPreferences, KeyStore), network security (certificate pinning), and protection against reverse engineering.  Regular security audits and updates are crucial to maintain a strong security posture.  User education and encouraging the use of 2FA are also important preventative measures. The Facebook SDK itself should be kept up-to-date, and developers should be aware of potential vulnerabilities and follow best practices.
