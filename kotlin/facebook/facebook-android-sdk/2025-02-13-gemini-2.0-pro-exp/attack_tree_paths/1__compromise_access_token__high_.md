Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Compromise Access Token" attack tree path for an Android application using the Facebook Android SDK, structured as you requested.

## Deep Analysis: Compromise Access Token (Facebook Android SDK)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify the specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors that could lead to the compromise of a Facebook access token within an Android application utilizing the Facebook Android SDK.  We aim to understand the technical details of *how* an attacker could achieve this, the potential impact, and, crucially, to propose concrete mitigation strategies.  This analysis will inform secure coding practices and security testing efforts.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Android Applications:**  We are exclusively concerned with Android applications.  Web or iOS applications using the Facebook SDK are out of scope.
*   **Facebook Android SDK:**  The analysis centers on vulnerabilities related to the use of the official Facebook Android SDK.  Third-party libraries or custom implementations interacting with Facebook's APIs are out of scope, unless they directly interact with the official SDK's token management.
*   **Access Token Compromise:**  The scope is limited to the compromise of the *access token* itself.  Attacks that bypass authentication entirely (e.g., exploiting server-side vulnerabilities in Facebook's infrastructure) are out of scope.  We are concerned with how the *client-side* application handles and protects the token.
*   **Current SDK Version:** The analysis will assume the use of a reasonably up-to-date version of the Facebook Android SDK.  While we'll consider historical vulnerabilities, the primary focus is on currently exploitable weaknesses. We will mention the specific version we are considering for the analysis. Let's assume we are analyzing version **16.0.0** of the Facebook Android SDK, as it is a recent version at the time of this analysis.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  While we don't have access to a specific application's source code, we will analyze common code patterns and potential implementation flaws based on the Facebook SDK documentation, best practices, and known vulnerabilities.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  We will systematically identify potential threats and attack vectors, considering the attacker's perspective and capabilities.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities in the Facebook Android SDK and related components (e.g., Android OS, WebView, etc.).  This includes reviewing CVEs, security advisories, and research papers.
*   **Best Practice Analysis:**  We will compare common implementation patterns against established security best practices for Android development and secure token handling.
*   **Attack Tree Decomposition:** We will break down the "Compromise Access Token" node into more specific sub-nodes, representing different attack techniques.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**1. Compromise Access Token (HIGH)**

We'll break this down into several sub-nodes, each representing a distinct attack vector:

**1.1.  Improper Storage of Access Token (HIGH)**

*   **1.1.1.  Storing in SharedPreferences (Unencrypted) (CRITICAL)**
    *   **Description:**  A common, but highly insecure, practice is to store the access token directly in `SharedPreferences` without any encryption.  `SharedPreferences` is intended for simple key-value pairs and is not designed for sensitive data.
    *   **Technical Details:**  `SharedPreferences` data is stored in an XML file within the application's private data directory.  While this directory is protected by the Android OS's sandboxing, a rooted device or a compromised application with file access permissions can read this file.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete account takeover.  The attacker can use the token to impersonate the user and access their Facebook data.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Never store access tokens directly in unencrypted `SharedPreferences`.**
        *   Use the **Android Keystore system** to securely store cryptographic keys.
        *   Use a library like **Jetpack Security** (specifically `EncryptedSharedPreferences`) to encrypt sensitive data stored in `SharedPreferences`. This wraps the Keystore and provides a simpler API.
        *   Consider using the **AccountManager** API if the token needs to be shared between applications (though this has its own security considerations).

*   **1.1.2.  Storing in SQLite Database (Unencrypted) (HIGH)**
    *   **Description:**  Storing the token in a local SQLite database without encryption is also vulnerable.
    *   **Technical Details:**  Similar to `SharedPreferences`, the database file is stored in the application's private data directory.  Root access or a compromised application can access the database.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Encrypt the database.** Use libraries like SQLCipher to encrypt the entire SQLite database.
        *   **Encrypt the token column.**  If encrypting the entire database is not feasible, encrypt only the column containing the access token using a key derived from the Android Keystore.

*   **1.1.3.  Storing in External Storage (CRITICAL)**
    *   **Description:**  Storing the token on external storage (e.g., SD card) is extremely dangerous.
    *   **Technical Details:**  External storage is generally world-readable, meaning any application with the `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission can access the file.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Never store access tokens on external storage.**

*   **1.1.4 Hardcoding Token (CRITICAL)**
    * **Description:** Storing token directly in source code.
    * **Technical Details:** Source code can be decompiled.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover.
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   **Never store access tokens in source code.**

**1.2.  Interception of Access Token (HIGH)**

*   **1.2.1.  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (HIGH)**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker intercepts the network communication between the application and Facebook's servers, capturing the access token during the authentication process or subsequent API calls.
    *   **Technical Details:**  This can occur if:
        *   The application does not properly validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate.
        *   The user is connected to a compromised Wi-Fi network.
        *   The device is infected with malware that can intercept network traffic.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Ensure proper SSL/TLS certificate validation.**  The Facebook SDK *should* handle this correctly by default, but it's crucial to verify.  Do not disable certificate validation or use custom trust managers without a very strong understanding of the risks.
        *   **Use Certificate Pinning.**  This adds an extra layer of security by verifying that the server's certificate matches a pre-defined certificate or public key.  This makes it much harder for an attacker to use a forged certificate.
        *   **Educate users about the risks of using public Wi-Fi.**
        *   **Consider using a VPN on untrusted networks.** (This is a user-side mitigation, but the app can encourage it.)

*   **1.2.2.  WebView Hijacking (MEDIUM)**
    *   **Description:**  If the Facebook login flow is handled within a `WebView`, vulnerabilities in the `WebView` or improper configuration could allow an attacker to inject JavaScript and steal the access token.
    *   **Technical Details:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  If the `WebView` loads untrusted content, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript to steal the token.
        *   **Improper `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` Implementation:**  If the application does not properly handle redirects within the `WebView`, an attacker could redirect the user to a malicious page that steals the token.
        *   **Vulnerable `WebView` Versions:**  Older versions of `WebView` may have known vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Use the Facebook SDK's built-in login dialogs whenever possible.**  These are generally more secure than custom `WebView` implementations.
        *   **If using a `WebView`, ensure it is up-to-date.**  Use the latest version of the Android System WebView.
        *   **Sanitize any user-supplied input that is displayed in the `WebView`.**
        *   **Implement `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` carefully to prevent malicious redirects.**
        *   **Enable JavaScript only if absolutely necessary.**  If JavaScript is enabled, be extremely cautious about the content loaded into the `WebView`.
        *   **Consider using `WebChromeClient` to handle JavaScript alerts and other potentially dangerous events.**

*   **1.2.3 Sniffing unencrypted traffic (HIGH)**
    * **Description:** Capturing network traffic.
    * **Technical Details:** If application is misconfigured and using http instead of https, attacker can sniff the traffic.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover.
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   **Use https.**

**1.3.  Leakage Through Logs or Debugging (MEDIUM)**

*   **1.3.1.  Logging the Access Token (HIGH)**
    *   **Description:**  The application inadvertently logs the access token to the system log (Logcat) or a file.
    *   **Technical Details:**  Logcat is accessible to other applications with the `READ_LOGS` permission (though this is restricted in newer Android versions).  Log files may also be accessible.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Never log the access token.**  Carefully review all logging statements to ensure that sensitive data is not being logged.
        *   **Use a logging library that allows you to filter sensitive data.**
        *   **Disable logging in production builds.**

*   **1.3.2  Leaving Debugging Information Enabled (MEDIUM)**
    *   **Description:**  The application is released with debugging features enabled that could expose the access token.
    *   **Technical Details:**  Debuggers can be used to inspect the application's memory and potentially extract the access token.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Disable debugging in production builds.**  Ensure that the `android:debuggable` attribute in the `AndroidManifest.xml` is set to `false`.
        *   **Use ProGuard or R8 to obfuscate the code and make it harder to reverse engineer.**

**1.4.  Exploiting SDK Vulnerabilities (LOW to HIGH)**

*   **1.4.1.  Known SDK Vulnerabilities (Varies)**
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the Facebook Android SDK itself could allow an attacker to compromise the access token.
    *   **Technical Details:**  These vulnerabilities could be related to token storage, handling, or communication.  They are typically patched in newer SDK versions.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to account takeover.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Keep the Facebook Android SDK up-to-date.**  Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly.
        *   **Monitor security advisories and CVE databases for known vulnerabilities.**
        *   **Consider using a vulnerability scanner to identify potential vulnerabilities in your application and its dependencies.**

*   **1.4.2  Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (LOW)**
    *   **Description:**  Undiscovered vulnerabilities in the SDK could be exploited.
    *   **Technical Details:**  These are vulnerabilities that are not yet publicly known.
    *   **Impact:**  Unknown, but potentially severe.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Follow all other security best practices to minimize the attack surface.**
        *   **Implement robust error handling and security monitoring.**
        *   **Participate in bug bounty programs to encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.**

**1.5. Device Compromise (HIGH)**
* **1.5.1 Malware (HIGH)**
    * **Description:** Malware installed on device.
    * **Technical Details:** Malware can access application data.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Use security tools.**
        * **Educate users.**

* **1.5.2 Rooted Device (HIGH)**
    * **Description:** Device is rooted.
    * **Technical Details:** Rooted device bypass security restrictions.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Detect rooted device.**
        * **Warn user about risk.**

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

Compromising a Facebook access token is a high-impact attack.  The most critical vulnerabilities often stem from improper storage of the token within the application.  Developers *must* use secure storage mechanisms like the Android Keystore and Jetpack Security.  MitM attacks are also a significant threat, highlighting the importance of proper SSL/TLS certificate validation and certificate pinning.  Regularly updating the Facebook SDK and following secure coding practices are essential for mitigating these risks.  Finally, educating users about security best practices (e.g., avoiding public Wi-Fi, being cautious about app permissions) can also help reduce the overall risk.
