## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Access Token (HIGH)](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_access_token__high_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the primary attack vector, as access tokens grant access to user data and functionality. Compromising a token allows the attacker to impersonate the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Steal Token (HIGH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_steal_token__high_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** Obtaining a valid, already-issued access token.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 MITM Attack](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_mitm_attack.md)

*   **Description:** Intercepting network traffic between the app and Facebook's servers. While the SDK *should* enforce HTTPS, misconfigurations in the app or a compromised Certificate Authority could allow this.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Improper Storage (HIGH) - Critical Node](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_improper_storage__high__-_critical_node.md)

*   **Description:** The application storing the access token insecurely, making it vulnerable to theft. Examples include storing it in plain text in SharedPreferences, hardcoding it in the app's code, or logging it to a file.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low (if the app is poorly coded) / Intermediate (if exploiting a vulnerability to access storage)
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice / Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit SDK Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_sdk_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Logic Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_logic_flaws.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Deep Linking Handling / Deep Linking Login Flows (HIGH) - Critical Node](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_deep_linking_handling__deep_linking_login_flows__high__-_critical_node.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the SDK handles deep links associated with Facebook login.  A malicious app could register itself to handle the same deep links, intercepting the login flow and potentially stealing the access token or performing unauthorized actions.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Deprecated Features (HIGH)](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_deprecated_features__high_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** Using outdated and potentially vulnerable features of the SDK.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1 Using Deprecated API (HIGH) - Critical Node](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_using_deprecated_api__high__-_critical_node.md)

*   **Description:** The application continuing to use deprecated API endpoints that might have known vulnerabilities or weaker security mechanisms.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.2 Using Deprecated LoginBehavior (e.g., WebView) (HIGH) - Critical Node](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_2_using_deprecated_loginbehavior__e_g___webview___high__-_critical_node.md)

*   **Description:** The application using older, less secure login methods (like embedding a WebView directly) instead of the recommended `LoginManager` and associated `LoginBehavior` options.  These older methods might be more susceptible to attacks.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
