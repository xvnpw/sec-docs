# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/facebook-android-sdk

## Threat: [Malicious SDK Version](./threats/malicious_sdk_version.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could distribute or trick developers into using a modified version of the Facebook Android SDK containing malicious code. This code could be designed to exfiltrate user data handled by the SDK, inject malicious functionality within SDK processes, or compromise the application's interaction with Facebook services.
*   **Impact:** Severe data breaches involving Facebook user data, compromise of user devices through SDK vulnerabilities, reputational damage to the application, potential financial loss.
*   **Affected Component:** Entire SDK package, specifically any module or function the malicious code is inserted into.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always download the SDK from official and trusted sources (e.g., Facebook's official Maven repository).
    *   Verify the integrity of the downloaded SDK using checksums or digital signatures provided by Facebook.
    *   Implement dependency management tools that can detect and alert on unexpected changes in dependencies.
    *   Regularly update the SDK to benefit from security patches and improvements.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known SDK Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_known_sdk_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could leverage publicly known security vulnerabilities within specific versions of the Facebook Android SDK. They would target applications using these vulnerable versions to gain unauthorized access to Facebook user data managed by the SDK, execute arbitrary code within the SDK's context, or cause denial of service affecting SDK functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes related to SDK failures, data breaches of Facebook user information, unauthorized access to user accounts via SDK exploits, potential remote code execution within the application's context through SDK vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** Specific modules or functions within the SDK as identified in security advisories (e.g., specific versions of the `LoginManager`, `ShareDialog`, or `GraphRequest` components).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with the latest SDK releases and security advisories from Facebook.
    *   Implement a robust update mechanism for the application to ensure users are running the latest version with security patches.
    *   Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing, specifically focusing on the application's integration with the Facebook SDK.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on SDK Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_sdk_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could compromise third-party libraries or dependencies used *by* the Facebook Android SDK. This could involve injecting malicious code into these dependencies, which would then be included in applications using the Facebook SDK, potentially affecting the SDK's functionality and data handling.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of malware or spyware that could intercept or manipulate data handled by the SDK, data exfiltration through compromised SDK components, unauthorized access to device resources facilitated by SDK vulnerabilities introduced through dependencies.
*   **Affected Component:** Indirectly affects the entire SDK and any part of the application that interacts with it, but the initial compromise occurs in the SDK's dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in SDK dependencies.
    *   Regularly update dependencies, including those used by the Facebook SDK.
    *   Consider using tools that verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Access Tokens (SDK Related)](./threats/insecure_storage_of_access_tokens__sdk_related_.md)

*   **Description:** The Facebook Android SDK might store access tokens in a way that is vulnerable to access by other applications or malicious actors on the device if not handled with care by the integrating application. While the SDK provides some secure storage mechanisms, improper usage or reliance on default settings could lead to exposure. Attackers gaining access to these tokens can impersonate the user within the Facebook ecosystem through the SDK.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user Facebook accounts through the SDK, ability to perform actions on behalf of the user via SDK functionalities, potential privacy breaches within the Facebook platform.
*   **Affected Component:** `AccessToken` class and related storage mechanisms *within the SDK*, and how the integrating application interacts with these mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize the SDK's recommended secure storage mechanisms for access tokens (e.g., relying on the SDK's default secure storage which leverages Android Keystore).
    *   Avoid overriding or customizing token storage in a way that reduces security.
    *   Implement mechanisms to detect and invalidate potentially compromised tokens.

## Threat: [OAuth 2.0 Misconfiguration (SDK Related)](./threats/oauth_2_0_misconfiguration__sdk_related_.md)

*   **Description:** Improper configuration of the OAuth 2.0 flow *within the Facebook Android SDK integration* can introduce vulnerabilities. For example, if the application's configuration allows for insecure redirect URIs, attackers could intercept authorization codes or access tokens during the login process facilitated by the SDK.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover of Facebook accounts through the SDK login flow, unauthorized access to user data within the Facebook platform, ability to perform actions on behalf of the user via the SDK.
*   **Affected Component:** `LoginManager` module and the underlying OAuth 2.0 implementation *within the SDK and its configuration in the integrating application*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly adhere to Facebook's OAuth 2.0 guidelines and best practices when configuring the SDK.
    *   Ensure that only secure and explicitly defined redirect URIs are configured for the application within the Facebook Developer Console.
    *   Implement state parameters to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks during the OAuth flow initiated by the SDK.
