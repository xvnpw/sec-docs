# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/facebook-android-sdk

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Access Tokens and User Data](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_access_tokens_and_user_data.md)

- **Description:** Sensitive information like Facebook access tokens is stored insecurely on the device.
- **How facebook-android-sdk contributes:** The SDK manages authentication and often provides mechanisms for storing and retrieving access tokens. If developers don't implement secure storage practices, the SDK's data can be vulnerable.
- **Example:** An access token is stored in SharedPreferences without encryption. A malicious app could potentially access this token.
- **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user's Facebook data.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:** Utilize Android's Keystore system for storing sensitive credentials. Encrypt data before storing it in SharedPreferences or internal storage. Avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Redirect URI Validation in OAuth Flow](./attack_surfaces/improper_redirect_uri_validation_in_oauth_flow.md)

- **Description:** The application doesn't properly validate the redirect URI after a successful Facebook login, allowing an attacker to intercept the authorization code or access token.
- **How facebook-android-sdk contributes:** The SDK handles the OAuth 2.0 flow, including redirecting back to the application. If the developer doesn't configure or handle the redirect URI validation correctly, it creates a vulnerability.
- **Example:** An attacker registers a malicious application with a crafted redirect URI. If the legitimate app doesn't strictly validate the redirect URI returned by Facebook, the attacker's app could receive the authorization code.
- **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to the user's Facebook account.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:** Strictly validate redirect URIs against a predefined whitelist. Ensure the redirect URI is registered correctly in the Facebook Developer Console. Use HTTPS for all communication.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Deep Link Handling Initiated by Facebook](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_deep_link_handling_initiated_by_facebook.md)

- **Description:**  The application doesn't properly validate or sanitize data received through deep links initiated by Facebook, potentially leading to malicious actions.
- **How facebook-android-sdk contributes:** The SDK facilitates App Links and deep linking functionalities. If the application's deep link handling logic is flawed, attackers can exploit it through crafted Facebook links.
- **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious Facebook link that, when clicked, redirects the user to the application with harmful parameters, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data manipulation within the app.
- **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution within the application's context, data manipulation, or unauthorized actions.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received through deep links, regardless of the source. Implement proper input validation and avoid directly executing code based on deep link parameters.
