### Security Implications of Key Components:

*   **Core Module:**
    *   **Security Implication:** The management of access tokens is critical. If the mechanisms for acquisition, storage, and refreshing are flawed, it could lead to unauthorized access to user data and Facebook platform functionalities. Insecure storage of the Facebook App ID could also lead to impersonation or abuse.
    *   **Security Implication:** Reliance on HTTPS for all communication is a positive security measure. However, improper implementation or vulnerabilities in the underlying network libraries could potentially lead to downgrade attacks or man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Security Implication:** Error handling and reporting mechanisms should not inadvertently expose sensitive information or internal SDK details that could be exploited by attackers.

*   **Login Module:**
    *   **Security Implication:** The OAuth 2.0 implementation must be robust and adhere strictly to the specification to prevent vulnerabilities like authorization code interception or token leakage. Improper handling of redirect URIs is a significant risk.
    *   **Security Implication:** Customizable UI components for login, while improving user experience, could be susceptible to UI redressing attacks if not implemented carefully.
    *   **Security Implication:** Supporting multiple login methods introduces complexity and requires careful attention to the security of each method. The native app switch relies on the security of the Facebook app itself. Web-based OAuth flows depend on the security of the WebView implementation and the handling of cookies and session data.
    *   **Security Implication:** The permission request mechanism needs to be transparent to the user and prevent the application from requesting excessive permissions, which could increase the impact of a compromised access token.

*   **Graph API Module:**
    *   **Security Implication:** The interface for making Graph API requests must prevent injection attacks. Improper serialization or deserialization of data could lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Implication:** Helper functions for common API endpoints should be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not introduce security flaws or bypass intended security checks.

*   **Share Module:**
    *   **Security Implication:** The handling of shared content needs to prevent the sharing of malicious links or content that could harm users or the Facebook platform.
    *   **Security Implication:** Pre-built UI components for sharing should be designed to prevent UI redressing or other manipulation.
    *   **Security Implication:** The management of share parameters and metadata must be secure to prevent tampering or injection of malicious data.

*   **App Events Module:**
    *   **Security Implication:** While anonymized, the transmission of event data still raises privacy concerns. The SDK must ensure compliance with privacy regulations and avoid collecting or transmitting sensitive personal information without explicit consent.
    *   **Security Implication:** The mechanism for transmitting event data should be secure to prevent interception or modification of the data.

*   **Gaming Services Module:**
    *   **Security Implication:** Authentication and authorization within the gaming context need to be robust to prevent unauthorized access to game features or user data.
    *   **Security Implication:** Access to leaderboards and achievements should be controlled to prevent cheating or manipulation.

*   **Advertising Support Module:**
    *   **Security Implication:** The collection and transmission of advertising-related data must be done securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.
    *   **Security Implication:** Integration with Facebook's advertising SDKs or APIs introduces dependencies that need to be regularly reviewed for security vulnerabilities.

*   **Account Kit Module (Potentially Deprecated/Separate):**
    *   **Security Implication:** If still integrated, the security of phone number and email verification processes is crucial to prevent account takeovers or spam. The design document correctly highlights the need to verify its current status.

*   **Utility Modules:**
    *   **Security Implication:** Deep linking functionality needs to be carefully implemented to prevent malicious deep links from performing unauthorized actions or redirecting users to phishing sites. Proper validation of deep link parameters is essential.
    *   **Security Implication:** Logging and debugging utilities should not inadvertently log sensitive information in production builds.
