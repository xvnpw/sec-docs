## Attack Tree Path: [Steal access token and use it to impersonate the user within the application.](./attack_tree_paths/steal_access_token_and_use_it_to_impersonate_the_user_within_the_application.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Insecure Access Token Handling](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_insecure_access_token_handling.md)

**Attack Vector:** This node represents a fundamental weakness in how the application manages the user's Facebook access token. If the token is not handled securely, it becomes a prime target for attackers.
    *   **Why Critical:** A compromised access token allows the attacker to impersonate the user, gaining unauthorized access to their data and potentially the application's functionalities. It's a gateway to account takeover and further malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Steal Access Token from Insecure Storage](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_steal_access_token_from_insecure_storage.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application stores the Facebook access token in an insecure location, such as SharedPreferences without encryption. An attacker with access to the device's file system (e.g., through rooting, device compromise, or backup extraction) can retrieve the token.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** This is a relatively common developer mistake and requires moderate effort from the attacker, leading directly to account takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Intercept Access Token during Network Transmission (Man-in-the-Middle)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_intercept_access_token_during_network_transmission__man-in-the-middle_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application communicates with Facebook servers without enforcing HTTPS. An attacker on the same network can intercept the network traffic and steal the access token during transmission.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** This attack is feasible on unsecured Wi-Fi networks and requires readily available tools, posing a significant threat to users on public networks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Application does not properly validate data received from the SDK.](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_application_does_not_properly_validate_data_received_from_the_sdk.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application trusts data received from the Facebook SDK without proper sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to inject malicious code or data.
    *   **Why Critical:** This node represents a fundamental security flaw that can lead to various injection vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS, allowing for data breaches, session hijacking, and other malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Application does not properly validate data received from the SDK -> SQL Injection through data retrieved from Facebook Graph API.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_application_does_not_properly_validate_data_received_from_the_sdk_-_sql_injection_thr_3f53609f.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses data retrieved from the Facebook Graph API in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. An attacker can manipulate the Graph API response or the application's handling of it to inject malicious SQL code, potentially gaining access to the application's database.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** SQL Injection can lead to significant data breaches and the ability to manipulate or delete sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Application does not properly validate data received from the SDK -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when displaying user data from Facebook.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_application_does_not_properly_validate_data_received_from_the_sdk_-_cross-site_script_a7f185be.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application displays user data retrieved from Facebook without proper encoding or sanitization. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the data, which will then be executed in other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking or other client-side attacks.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** XSS vulnerabilities are common and can be exploited to steal user credentials or perform actions on their behalf.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Account Takeover](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_account_takeover.md)

**Attack Vector:** This represents the successful compromise of a user's account within the application. This can be achieved through various means, including stealing access tokens or exploiting vulnerabilities in the login flow.
    *   **Why Critical:** Account takeover is a severe security breach, granting the attacker full control over the user's account and potentially their data and actions within the application. It's the ultimate goal of many of the identified high-risk paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Steal access token and use it to impersonate the user within the application.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_steal_access_token_and_use_it_to_impersonate_the_user_within_the_application.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker successfully obtains a valid Facebook access token (through methods described above) and uses it to make API calls or perform actions within the application as if they were the legitimate user.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** This is a direct consequence of insecure access token handling and allows the attacker to fully impersonate the user, leading to significant potential damage.
