# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/facebook-android-sdk

## Threat: [Access Token Theft via Insecure Storage](./threats/access_token_theft_via_insecure_storage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's Facebook access token if the SDK or the integrating application stores it insecurely on the device (e.g., in plain text, shared preferences without encryption). The attacker can then use this token to impersonate the user, access their Facebook account, and potentially perform actions on their behalf within the application and on Facebook.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data, privacy breach, reputational damage for the application.
*   **Affected Component:** `LoginManager`, `AccessToken`, Local Storage (Android Shared Preferences, Files)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Android's `EncryptedSharedPreferences` or Android Keystore System to securely store access tokens.
    *   Avoid storing access tokens in plain text or easily accessible locations.
    *   Regularly review and audit token storage mechanisms.
    *   Implement proper session management and token invalidation.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking through SDK Vulnerability](./threats/session_hijacking_through_sdk_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in the SDK's session management or handling of authentication responses could allow an attacker to hijack a user's Facebook session. This might involve intercepting network traffic, exploiting cross-site scripting (XSS) if web views are involved, or other session manipulation techniques. Successful hijacking grants the attacker access to the user's authenticated session within the application.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user account, data breach, malicious actions performed under the user's identity within the application.
*   **Affected Component:** `LoginManager`, `AuthenticationActivity`, Network Communication Layer
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Facebook SDK updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all network communication.
    *   Implement robust session validation and anti-session fixation measures in the application.
    *   Carefully review and test SDK integration for session management vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known SDK Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_known_sdk_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of the Facebook Android SDK can be exploited by attackers. Attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise the application, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, unauthorized access, denial of service, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Vulnerable SDK Modules (depends on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always keep the Facebook SDK updated to the latest stable version.**
    *   Monitor Facebook's security advisories and release notes for reported vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management process to promptly address reported SDK vulnerabilities.
