# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/facebook-android-sdk

## Attack Surface: [Redirect URI Manipulation in OAuth 2.0 Flow](./attack_surfaces/redirect_uri_manipulation_in_oauth_2_0_flow.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow initiated by the Facebook Android SDK by manipulating the redirect URI. If the SDK integration or backend validation is insufficient, the authorization code or access token can be redirected to a malicious server.
*   **Facebook-Android-SDK Contribution:** The SDK is responsible for initiating and managing the OAuth 2.0 flow for Facebook Login. Weaknesses in how the application integrates with the SDK's OAuth flow, particularly in redirect URI handling, directly create this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the Facebook Login request initiated by the SDK and modifies the `redirect_uri` parameter. If the application's backend or the SDK integration doesn't strictly validate this URI against a whitelist, the authorization code is sent to the attacker's controlled URI. The attacker can then exchange this code for an access token, gaining unauthorized access to the user's account within the application.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, complete compromise of user account within the application, unauthorized access to user data managed by the application, and potential data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Strictly validate the redirect URI on the backend server.** Ensure it exactly matches the pre-registered and expected URI. Do not rely solely on client-side validation.
        *   **Utilize the SDK's recommended best practices for OAuth 2.0 implementation.** Follow Facebook's security guidelines for redirect URI handling.
        *   **Implement server-side checks to verify the state parameter** in the OAuth flow to prevent CSRF attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Access Tokens](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_access_tokens.md)

*   **Description:** Facebook Access Tokens, managed and potentially stored by the Facebook Android SDK, are stored insecurely on the Android device. If an attacker gains access to the device or application's data storage, they can steal these tokens and impersonate the user.
*   **Facebook-Android-SDK Contribution:** The SDK handles the lifecycle of Facebook Access Tokens. If developers rely on default or insecure storage methods without implementing robust encryption, the SDK's token management contributes to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** The application uses the SDK's default token caching mechanism, which might store tokens in SharedPreferences without strong encryption. An attacker gains root access to the device or exploits an application vulnerability to access SharedPreferences and retrieves the plaintext or weakly encrypted Facebook Access Token. This stolen token allows the attacker to directly access Facebook APIs on behalf of the user, potentially bypassing application security controls.
*   **Impact:** Full account impersonation on Facebook and within the application, unauthorized access to user's Facebook data and application-related data, privacy violations, and potential misuse of user accounts for malicious activities.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Utilize the Android Keystore system to securely encrypt and store Access Tokens.** Do not store tokens in plaintext or easily reversible formats like SharedPreferences without encryption.
        *   **Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms.** Limit the lifespan of access tokens and enforce regular token refresh to minimize the window of opportunity for stolen tokens.
        *   **Consider using hardware-backed Keystore** for enhanced security if available on target devices.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated SDK Version Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/outdated_sdk_version_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Using an outdated version of the Facebook Android SDK exposes the application to known, potentially critical security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer SDK releases.
*   **Facebook-Android-SDK Contribution:** The Facebook Android SDK, like any software, may contain vulnerabilities. Facebook releases updates to address these. Using an outdated version directly inherits any known vulnerabilities present in that version.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability (e.g., remote code execution, data leakage) is discovered and patched in a newer version of the Facebook Android SDK. An application still using the older, vulnerable SDK version becomes a target for attackers who can exploit this publicly known vulnerability to compromise the application and potentially the user's device.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, application crashes, denial of service, device compromise, and potential full control over the application and user data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Maintain a process for regularly updating the Facebook Android SDK to the latest stable version.**
        *   **Actively monitor Facebook's security advisories and release notes** for the SDK to stay informed about security updates and vulnerabilities.
        *   **Implement automated dependency checking and update mechanisms** in the development pipeline to ensure timely SDK updates.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in SDK Libraries](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_sdk_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** The Facebook Android SDK relies on third-party libraries. Critical vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly create attack vectors in applications using the SDK.
*   **Facebook-Android-SDK Contribution:** The SDK bundles and depends on various libraries. If these dependencies have critical security flaws, they become part of the application's attack surface through the SDK integration.
*   **Example:** A critical remote code execution vulnerability is discovered in a networking library used as a dependency by the Facebook Android SDK. Applications using the SDK, even without directly using the vulnerable networking library code themselves, become indirectly vulnerable. Attackers could potentially exploit this dependency vulnerability through interactions with the SDK's functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, application instability, device compromise, and potential full control over the application and user data due to exploitation of vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Regularly scan the Facebook Android SDK's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.**
        *   **Update SDK dependencies to patched versions promptly when vulnerabilities are identified and updates are available.**
        *   **Monitor security advisories for dependencies** used by the SDK and proactively manage dependency updates.
