# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Facebook Android SDK project aims to empower Android developers to seamlessly integrate Facebook functionalities into their mobile applications. This integration facilitates user authentication via Facebook, content sharing on the platform, access to Facebook's social graph data, and the utilization of Facebook's advertising and analytics tools.

The primary business priorities and goals for the Facebook Android SDK are:
- Increase adoption of the Facebook platform by Android developers.
- Provide developers with robust and easy-to-use tools to enhance user engagement and app growth.
- Expand Facebook's reach and data collection capabilities through mobile applications.
- Support Facebook's advertising ecosystem by enabling mobile app integrations.

The most important business risks associated with the Facebook Android SDK project that need to be addressed are:
- Developer dissatisfaction due to complexity, bugs, or lack of features in the SDK, leading to decreased adoption and potential migration to competitor platforms.
- Security vulnerabilities within the SDK that could be exploited by malicious actors to compromise applications using the SDK, leading to data breaches, reputational damage for Facebook and developers, and legal liabilities.
- Privacy violations arising from improper data handling or collection by the SDK, resulting in regulatory fines, user distrust, and damage to Facebook's brand image.
- Supply chain risks associated with dependencies and build processes, potentially introducing vulnerabilities or malicious code into the SDK.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the Facebook Android SDK project include:
- security control: Code reviews are conducted for all code changes to identify potential security vulnerabilities and ensure code quality. (Location: Facebook's internal development process)
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are likely used to automatically scan the codebase for common security flaws. (Location: Facebook's internal development process)
- security control: Dependency management practices are in place to track and manage third-party libraries used by the SDK, including vulnerability scanning of dependencies. (Location: Facebook's internal development process, dependency management tools like Maven or Gradle)
- security control: HTTPS is enforced for all communication between the SDK and Facebook servers to protect data in transit. (Location: Network communication layer within the SDK)
- security control: API key and access token management is implemented to control access to Facebook APIs and protect user data. (Location: Authentication and authorization modules within the SDK)
- security control: Regular security updates and patches are released to address identified vulnerabilities in the SDK. (Location: Facebook's SDK release and maintenance process)

Accepted risks for the Facebook Android SDK project include:
- accepted risk: Risks associated with third-party dependencies, where vulnerabilities in external libraries could affect the SDK despite Facebook's dependency management efforts.
- accepted risk: Risks stemming from improper usage of the SDK by developers, leading to security vulnerabilities in their applications that are not directly caused by the SDK itself.
- accepted risk: The inherent complexity of a large codebase like the SDK may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities despite security measures.

Recommended security controls to implement for the Facebook Android SDK project:
- recommended security control: Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) to identify runtime vulnerabilities and security issues that may not be detectable by SAST.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular penetration testing by external security experts to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in the SDK's security posture.
- recommended security control: Establish a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage security researchers to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
- recommended security control: Implement fuzzing techniques to automatically test the SDK's robustness against malformed or unexpected inputs.
- recommended security control: Appoint security champions within the development team to promote security awareness and best practices throughout the development lifecycle.
- recommended security control: Enhance supply chain security measures by implementing binary component analysis and provenance checks for dependencies.

Security requirements for the Facebook Android SDK project:
- Authentication:
    - security requirement: Securely authenticate users with Facebook accounts using industry-standard protocols like OAuth 2.0.
    - security requirement: Protect user credentials and access tokens from unauthorized access and disclosure.
    - security requirement: Implement multi-factor authentication options where applicable to enhance account security.
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization mechanisms to control access to Facebook APIs and user data based on permissions granted by users and applications.
    - security requirement: Ensure that applications using the SDK can only access data and functionalities they are explicitly authorized to use.
    - security requirement: Regularly review and update API permissions to align with evolving privacy policies and user expectations.
- Input Validation:
    - security requirement: Implement robust input validation on all data received from Android applications and Facebook APIs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    - security requirement: Sanitize and encode user-provided data before displaying it or using it in further processing to mitigate cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
    - security requirement: Validate data types, formats, and ranges to prevent unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms and protocols to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - security requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys and certificates, following industry best practices.
    - security requirement: Implement data encryption for sensitive data stored locally within the SDK or application using the SDK.
