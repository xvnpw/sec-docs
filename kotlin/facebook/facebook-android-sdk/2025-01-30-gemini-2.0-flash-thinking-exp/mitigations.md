# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for facebook/facebook-android-sdk

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Data Collection (SDK Features and Permissions)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_data_collection__sdk_features_and_permissions_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review SDK Permissions:**  Examine the permissions requested by the Facebook SDK in your `AndroidManifest.xml`. Focus on understanding *why* the SDK requests each permission and if these permissions are truly necessary for the *Facebook SDK features* you are using in your application.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary SDK Features:** Identify Facebook SDK features that are not essential for your application's core functionality *related to Facebook*. Consult the Facebook SDK documentation and disable or avoid initializing SDK modules or functionalities that collect data you don't require for your Facebook integration. For example, if you only use Facebook Login, ensure you are not enabling App Events or other analytics features of the SDK unless explicitly needed for your Facebook-related goals.
    3.  **Limit Data Requested by SDK APIs:** When using Facebook SDK APIs (like Login, Graph API calls), explicitly request only the minimum user data and permissions required for the intended *Facebook-related* functionality. For example, when using Facebook Login, only request `public_profile` and `email` if that's sufficient, and avoid requesting broader permissions unless absolutely necessary for your Facebook feature set.
    4.  **Privacy-Preserving Alternatives (Consider Alternatives to SDK Features):** Explore if there are privacy-preserving alternatives to certain Facebook SDK features. For example, if you are using Facebook Analytics through the SDK, consider if there are alternative analytics solutions that are more privacy-focused or offer better user control, especially for data *beyond* essential Facebook integration.
    5.  **Granular User Control (Related to SDK Data Sharing):** Provide users with granular control over data sharing *specifically related to Facebook SDK features*. Implement settings within your application that allow users to opt-out of specific data collection aspects of the Facebook SDK, if feasible and relevant to the Facebook functionalities you offer.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privacy violations due to SDK data collection (High Severity):** Unnecessary data collection by the Facebook SDK can lead to violations of user privacy expectations and regulations.
    *   **Data breaches of SDK-collected data (Medium Severity):** Collecting more data than needed via the SDK increases the potential impact if data collected by the SDK is breached.
    *   **Compliance issues related to SDK data handling (Medium Severity):** Failure to minimize data collection through the SDK can result in non-compliance with privacy laws concerning data processed by third-party SDKs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privacy violations due to SDK data collection: High reduction in risk.
    *   Data breaches of SDK-collected data: Medium reduction in risk.
    *   Compliance issues related to SDK data handling: Medium reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Permissions are reviewed in `AndroidManifest.xml`. We are only using `public_profile` and `email` permissions for Facebook Login.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular user control over Facebook SDK data sharing is missing. We need to consider adding settings for users to manage optional Facebook SDK data features (if any are used beyond core login).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Storage and Handling of SDK Data](./mitigation_strategies/data_storage_and_handling_of_sdk_data.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify SDK Data Storage:** Pinpoint all locations in your application where data obtained *from the Facebook SDK* or related to *Facebook SDK interactions* is stored locally (e.g., Facebook access tokens, cached user profile information retrieved via the SDK, any analytics data if collected by the SDK).
    2.  **Utilize Secure Storage for SDK Data:** For sensitive data obtained or managed by the Facebook SDK (especially access tokens and potentially user profile information retrieved via the SDK), use Android's secure storage mechanisms: Encrypted Shared Preferences or Android Keystore System. Prioritize using Keystore to encrypt access tokens obtained from the Facebook SDK before storing them.
    3.  **Avoid Insecure Storage of SDK Data:** Never store sensitive Facebook SDK-related data in plain text in Shared Preferences, internal storage, or external storage.
    4.  **Data Retention Policies for SDK Data:** Define and implement clear data retention policies specifically for Facebook SDK-related data. Determine how long you need to store data obtained or managed by the SDK and establish processes to delete it securely when no longer needed, aligning with privacy regulations and user expectations concerning third-party SDK data.
    5.  **Access Control for SDK Data:** Implement access control mechanisms within your application to restrict access to Facebook SDK-related data to only the necessary components and processes that directly interact with the Facebook SDK or require this data for Facebook-related features.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data breaches of SDK data due to insecure storage (High Severity):** If sensitive Facebook SDK data is stored insecurely, it becomes vulnerable to unauthorized access if the device is compromised or if there are vulnerabilities in the application that allow extraction of SDK data.
    *   **Unauthorized access to SDK data within the application (Medium Severity):** Lack of access control can lead to unintended or malicious access to Facebook SDK data by components within your application that should not interact with Facebook SDK data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breaches of SDK data due to insecure storage: High reduction in risk.
    *   Unauthorized access to SDK data within the application: Medium reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Facebook Access Tokens are currently stored in Shared Preferences, but *not* encrypted.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Encryption of Facebook Access Tokens obtained via the SDK using Android Keystore is missing. We need to encrypt access tokens before storing them. Data retention policies for Facebook SDK data are not formally defined. Access control for Facebook SDK data within the application needs review.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Transparency and User Consent (Regarding SDK Data Practices)](./mitigation_strategies/transparency_and_user_consent__regarding_sdk_data_practices_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Privacy Policy Update (SDK Data Disclosure):** Update your application's privacy policy to explicitly and clearly disclose information *specifically about the Facebook SDK's data practices*:

        *   Explain how this data is used by you *in conjunction with Facebook SDK features* and how it is used by Facebook.
        *   Clearly state that data is shared with Facebook *through the SDK*.
        *   Provide a link to Facebook's privacy policy for users to understand Facebook's data handling practices.
    2.  **Obtain Explicit User Consent (For SDK Data Collection - Where Required):** If required by privacy regulations or best practices, implement mechanisms to obtain explicit and informed consent from users *before* enabling Facebook SDK features that collect and share data. This consent should be specifically for the data processing performed by the Facebook SDK.
    3.  **User Control and Opt-Out Mechanisms (SDK Data Features):** Provide users with accessible mechanisms to control their data sharing preferences *related to Facebook SDK features*. Offer options to opt-out of data collection or specific Facebook SDK functionalities (if applicable to your application's use of the SDK).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privacy violations due to lack of SDK data transparency (High Severity):** Lack of transparency about Facebook SDK data collection is a privacy violation.
    *   **Legal and regulatory penalties related to SDK data consent (High Severity):** Failure to obtain proper consent for SDK data processing can lead to legal issues.
    *   **Reputational damage due to SDK data handling concerns (High Severity):** Lack of transparency and perceived disregard for user privacy regarding Facebook SDK data can damage reputation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privacy violations due to lack of SDK data transparency: High reduction in risk.
    *   Legal and regulatory penalties related to SDK data consent: High reduction in risk.
    *   Reputational damage due to SDK data handling concerns: High reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Our privacy policy mentions Facebook SDK, but needs more detail on SDK data practices. No explicit consent mechanisms or granular user control for Facebook SDK data.
