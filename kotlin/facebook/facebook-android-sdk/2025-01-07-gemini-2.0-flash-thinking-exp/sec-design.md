## 5. Data Flow (Detailed)

The SDK manages various types of data, and understanding their flow is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Authentication Data Flow:**
    *   **Initiation:** The Android application calls the SDK's login methods.
    *   **Authentication Request:** The SDK constructs an authentication request, potentially using custom Chrome Tabs, a WebView, or by invoking the native Facebook application via an intent.
    *   **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the Facebook login screen (either in-app or external) and provides credentials.
    *   **Credential Transmission:** User credentials are transmitted over HTTPS to the Facebook Authentication Server.
    *   **Token Issuance:** Upon successful authentication, the Facebook Authentication Server issues an OAuth 2.0 access token, along with a refresh token and potentially other metadata.
    *   **Token Redirection:** The access token is redirected back to the Android application, typically through a redirect URI handled by the SDK.
    *   **Token Storage:** The SDK (or the integrating application) stores the access token securely, ideally in the Android Keystore or encrypted SharedPreferences. The security of this storage is paramount.
*   **Graph API Request Data Flow:**
    *   **Request Construction:** The Android application utilizes the SDK to build requests to specific Graph API endpoints. This includes specifying parameters, HTTP methods, and required permissions.
    *   **Authentication Header:** The SDK attaches the user's access token to the request's authorization header (typically a Bearer token).
    *   **HTTPS Transmission:** The request is transmitted over an HTTPS connection to the Facebook Graph API.
    *   **API Processing:** Facebook servers validate the access token, check permissions, and process the request.
    *   **Response Handling:** The Graph API returns a response, typically in JSON format, over HTTPS.
    *   **SDK Processing:** The SDK parses the JSON response and provides the data to the Android application.
*   **Sharing Data Flow:**
    *   **Content Preparation:** The Android application prepares the content to be shared (text, links, images, videos).
    *   **Share Intent/Dialog:** The SDK provides mechanisms like Share Dialogs or allows direct API calls for sharing. Using Share Dialogs often involves Android Intents.
    *   **Content Transmission:** Shared content is transmitted to Facebook servers over HTTPS. For media, this may involve uploading files.
    *   **Privacy Settings:** The user's privacy settings on Facebook govern who can see the shared content. The SDK should respect these settings.
*   **App Events Data Flow:**
    *   **Event Logging:** The Android application uses the SDK to log specific app events.
    *   **Batching and Transmission:** The SDK may batch events and transmit them periodically to Facebook servers over HTTPS.
    *   **Data Aggregation:** Facebook servers aggregate and process the event data for analytics and advertising purposes.
*   **Advertising Data Flow:**
    *   **Ad Request:** The SDK requests ad configurations and content from Facebook's ad servers.
    *   **Ad Delivery:** Ad content (images, videos, text) is delivered to the SDK over HTTPS.
    *   **Impression Tracking:** The SDK tracks ad impressions and interactions.
    *   **Data Reporting:** Interaction data is reported back to Facebook's ad servers.
