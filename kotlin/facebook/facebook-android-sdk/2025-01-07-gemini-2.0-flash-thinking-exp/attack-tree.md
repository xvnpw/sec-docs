## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws.md)

This path represents the most critical threat as successful attacks here directly lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and potentially sensitive data.

*   **Steal or Impersonate User Access Tokens:** This is a critical node as obtaining a valid access token allows an attacker to impersonate a user and perform actions on their behalf.
    *   **Intercept Access Tokens during Transmission:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Network Traffic:** An attacker intercepts communication between the application and Facebook servers to steal the access token. This is more likely on insecure networks or if the application doesn't strictly enforce HTTPS.
        *   **Malicious App on Device Intercepting Broadcasts/Intents:** A malicious application installed on the same device as the target application listens for and intercepts broadcasts or intents containing the access token.
    *   **Extract Access Tokens from Application Storage:** This is a critical node highlighting the importance of secure storage.
        *   **Rooted Device Accessing Shared Preferences/Internal Storage:** On a rooted device, an attacker can easily access the application's internal storage and shared preferences where access tokens might be stored insecurely.
        *   **Vulnerability in Application Code Exposing Tokens:**  A flaw in the application's code could unintentionally expose access tokens, for example, through logging, insecure data sharing, or improper error handling.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in OAuth Flow Implementation:**
        *   **Authorization Code Interception/Redirection Attack:** An attacker intercepts the authorization code during the OAuth flow, typically by manipulating the redirection URI, and uses it to obtain an access token for the victim's account.
    *   **Exploit Leaked Client Secret (If improperly stored or exposed):** This is a critical node due to the severe impact. If the Facebook App Secret is compromised, attackers can generate valid access tokens without user interaction, gaining full control over the application's Facebook integration.

*   **Bypass Authentication Mechanisms:** This path focuses on circumventing the intended authentication process.
    *   **Exploit Logic Flaws in Custom Authentication Integration with Facebook Login:** If the application has implemented custom logic on top of Facebook Login, vulnerabilities in this logic could allow attackers to bypass authentication checks.
    *   **Replay Attacks using Stolen Authentication Credentials:** An attacker reuses previously intercepted or stolen authentication credentials (like access tokens) to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in SDK Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_sdk_functionality.md)

This path focuses on exploiting specific features and functionalities provided by the Facebook Android SDK.

*   **Exploit Deep Linking Vulnerabilities:** This is a critical node as it represents a direct way to manipulate the application's behavior.
    *   **Crafting Malicious Deep Links to Trigger Unintended Actions:** Attackers create specially crafted deep links that, when opened by the application, trigger unintended actions, potentially leading to data theft, unauthorized access, or application malfunction.
    *   **Bypassing Deep Link Validation to Access Sensitive Areas:** If the application doesn't properly validate the source and parameters of deep links, attackers can craft links that bypass security checks and directly access sensitive parts of the application.
