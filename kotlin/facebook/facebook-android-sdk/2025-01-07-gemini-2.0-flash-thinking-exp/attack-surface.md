# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/facebook-android-sdk

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on SDK Network Communication](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_sdk_network_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers intercept communication between the application and Facebook servers.
*   **How Facebook Android SDK Contributes:** The SDK handles network requests to Facebook's APIs. If the SDK doesn't enforce HTTPS correctly or if the device has compromised trust stores, communication can be intercepted.
*   **Example:** A user connects to a public Wi-Fi network where an attacker is performing a MITM attack. The attacker intercepts the OAuth access token exchanged between the app and Facebook.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, theft of user data, modification of data sent to Facebook.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Ensure the application and the SDK rely solely on HTTPS for all communication with Facebook. Implement certificate pinning to prevent trust store bypass. Utilize Android's Network Security Configuration to enforce secure connections. Regularly update the SDK to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Local Storage of SDK Data](./attack_surfaces/insecure_local_storage_of_sdk_data.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data managed by the SDK (like access tokens, user IDs) is stored insecurely on the device.
*   **How Facebook Android SDK Contributes:** The SDK might store authentication tokens or user data in SharedPreferences or internal storage without proper encryption by default.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains root access to a user's device and extracts the SharedPreferences file containing the Facebook access token, allowing them to impersonate the user.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data, privacy breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Utilize Android's `EncryptedSharedPreferences` or other secure storage mechanisms to encrypt sensitive data handled by the SDK. Avoid storing sensitive information locally if possible. Implement proper key management for encryption.

## Attack Surface: [Intent Redirection/Hijacking via SDK Authentication Flows](./attack_surfaces/intent_redirectionhijacking_via_sdk_authentication_flows.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious applications intercept or manipulate intents used by the SDK for authentication flows (e.g., OAuth redirects).
*   **How Facebook Android SDK Contributes:** The SDK uses custom URL schemes or `Intent` filters for handling authentication callbacks. If not properly secured, other apps can intercept these.
*   **Example:** A malicious app registers an `Intent` filter that matches the callback URL used by the Facebook SDK. When the user authenticates, the malicious app receives the authentication code or token instead of the legitimate app.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data, potential for phishing attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Use `PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE` when creating `PendingIntent` objects for authentication callbacks. Verify the signing certificate of the calling application when receiving authentication responses. Use secure deep linking practices.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in SDK Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_sdk_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** The Facebook Android SDK relies on third-party libraries that might contain security vulnerabilities.
*   **How Facebook Android SDK Contributes:** The SDK bundles or depends on external libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, they can be exploited through the SDK.
*   **Example:** The SDK uses an older version of a networking library with a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution. An attacker exploits this vulnerability through the SDK's network calls.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Regularly update the Facebook Android SDK to the latest version, which includes updates to its dependencies. Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address vulnerabilities in the SDK's dependencies.
