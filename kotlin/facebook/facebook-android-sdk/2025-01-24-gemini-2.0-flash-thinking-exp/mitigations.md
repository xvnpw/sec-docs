# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for facebook/facebook-android-sdk

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize SDK Usage](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_sdk_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Feature Audit (SDK Focus):** Conduct a feature audit specifically targeting features that *currently utilize* the Facebook Android SDK.
    2.  **SDK Necessity Assessment:** For each feature using the SDK, critically evaluate if the *Facebook SDK is absolutely essential* or if alternative solutions (direct API calls, different SDKs, in-house implementations *that avoid the Facebook SDK*) could be used.
    3.  **SDK Module Reduction:** If certain *SDK modules or functionalities are not required*, remove them from project dependencies. Modify `build.gradle` to exclude specific *Facebook SDK* components.
    4.  **Code Refactoring (SDK Removal):** Refactor code to remove dependencies on *unnecessary Facebook SDK features*. Ensure functionality remains after *reducing SDK usage*.
    5.  **Regular SDK Usage Review:** Periodically re-evaluate *Facebook SDK usage* as features evolve to ensure continued minimization of the *SDK footprint*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Increased SDK Attack Surface (High Severity):** A larger *Facebook SDK* footprint means more *SDK code* and potential *SDK vulnerabilities* to exploit. Minimizing usage reduces the *SDK attack surface*.
    *   **Unnecessary SDK Data Collection (Medium Severity):** Unused *Facebook SDK features* might still collect data. Minimizing usage reduces the risk of *unnecessary data collection by the SDK*.
    *   **Facebook SDK Dependency Bloat (Low Severity):** Unnecessary *Facebook SDK dependencies* increase application size and complexity related to *managing the SDK*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Increased SDK Attack Surface:** High Reduction
    *   **Unnecessary SDK Data Collection:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Facebook SDK Dependency Bloat:** Medium Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   This mitigation strategy is currently missing. A feature audit and necessity assessment of *Facebook SDK usage* have not been conducted. The project likely includes the full *Facebook SDK* dependency without specific module selection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Thoroughly Review SDK Permissions](./mitigation_strategies/thoroughly_review_sdk_permissions.md)
