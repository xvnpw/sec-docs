    *   Requires careful review of the Facebook SDK documentation to understand module dependencies and functionalities.
    *   Involves modifying `build.gradle` files, which is a standard Android development task.
    *   Thorough testing is crucial after module reduction to ensure that required functionalities are still working correctly.
*   **Potential Challenges:**
    *   Identifying the precise modules required for specific features can be complex and require in-depth SDK knowledge.
    *   Incorrect module removal can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.
    *   SDK module dependencies might not always be clearly documented, requiring experimentation and testing.

**Example `build.gradle` modification:**

```gradle
dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies ...

    implementation("com.facebook.android:facebook-login:latest.version") // Keep login module
    // Remove or comment out modules that are not needed, e.g., share, applinks, etc.
    // implementation("com.facebook.android:facebook-share:latest.version")
    // implementation("com.facebook.android:facebook-applinks:latest.version")
    implementation("com.facebook.android:facebook-core:latest.version") // Core is often required
    // ...
}
```

**2.4. Code Refactoring (SDK Removal)**

*   **Description:** This step involves actively refactoring application code to *eliminate dependencies on unnecessary Facebook SDK features*. This might involve replacing SDK calls with direct API interactions, alternative libraries, or in-house solutions.
