Here are the high and critical threats directly involving the Facebook Android SDK:

*   **Threat:** Insecure Storage of Access Tokens
    *   **Description:** An attacker with physical access to the device or through malware could access the Facebook access token if the Facebook Android SDK's default storage mechanism is used insecurely or if developers override it with an insecure implementation (e.g., storing in shared preferences without encryption). This allows the attacker to impersonate the user.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can access the user's Facebook profile, post content, send messages, and perform other actions as the compromised user.
    *   **Affected Component:** `AccessToken` class, specifically the default storage mechanism within the SDK.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Utilize Android's Keystore system to securely store access tokens. Avoid relying solely on the SDK's default storage if it doesn't meet security requirements. Educate developers on secure storage practices.

*   **Threat:** Authorization Code Interception via Malicious App
    *   **Description:** A malicious application on the same device could register the same custom URL scheme used by the Facebook Android SDK for the OAuth redirect. When the user logs in, the Facebook Android SDK could inadvertently pass the authorization code to the malicious app instead of the legitimate one.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can obtain an access token for the user, allowing them to impersonate the user on Facebook.
    *   **Affected Component:** `LoginManager` module, specifically the OAuth flow and handling of redirect URIs within the SDK.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure the redirect URI is unique and difficult to guess. The Facebook Android SDK implements protections against this, relying on Android's intent resolution mechanism. Keep the SDK updated to benefit from the latest security measures.

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Login Flow
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepting network traffic during the Facebook login process initiated by the Facebook Android SDK could potentially steal the authorization code or the access token if HTTPS is not strictly enforced by the SDK or if the application doesn't properly validate SSL certificates.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can gain unauthorized access to the user's Facebook account.
    *   **Affected Component:** `LoginManager` module, network communication within the SDK.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure the application and the Facebook Android SDK enforce HTTPS for all communication with Facebook's servers. Implement certificate pinning within the application to prevent MITM attacks by verifying the server's SSL certificate, even if the SDK defaults are compromised.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Outdated SDK Version
    *   **Description:** Using an outdated version of the Facebook Android SDK could expose the application to known security vulnerabilities within the SDK code itself that have been patched in newer versions.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities within the SDK to compromise the application or user data related to Facebook integration.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire SDK codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update the Facebook Android SDK to the latest stable version. Monitor Facebook's release notes and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities and necessary updates.
