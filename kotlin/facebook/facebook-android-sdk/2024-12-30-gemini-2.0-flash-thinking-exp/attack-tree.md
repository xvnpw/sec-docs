## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** To gain unauthorized access to user data, manipulate application functionality, or compromise the application's integrity by exploiting weaknesses introduced by the Facebook Android SDK.

**Sub-Tree:**

*   **CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws
    *   *** HIGH RISK PATH *** Steal Facebook Access Token
        *   Method: Intercept Network Traffic (e.g., MITM)
        *   Method: Exploit Insecure Storage of Token
    *   **CRITICAL NODE** Bypass Facebook Login
*   **CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Facebook Graph API Interactions
    *   *** HIGH RISK PATH *** Manipulate API Requests
        *   Method: Parameter Tampering

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws**

*   This node represents the fundamental security of user access. If an attacker can bypass or compromise authentication and authorization mechanisms, they can gain unauthorized access to user accounts and data.

**2. HIGH RISK PATH: Steal Facebook Access Token**

*   **Attack Vector: Method: Intercept Network Traffic (e.g., MITM)**
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network communication between the application and Facebook servers to steal the access token. This often involves Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, where the attacker positions themselves between the user and the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Account Takeover, Data Access)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires network monitoring capabilities)
*   **Attack Vector: Method: Exploit Insecure Storage of Token**
    *   **Description:** The application stores the Facebook access token insecurely on the user's device, making it accessible to malicious applications or attackers with physical access to the device. Common insecure storage methods include SharedPreferences without encryption.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Account Takeover, Data Access)
    *   **Effort:** Low (If the vulnerability exists)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Difficult to detect remotely)

**3. CRITICAL NODE: Bypass Facebook Login**

*   This node represents the ability of an attacker to circumvent the intended Facebook login process. Successful exploitation here grants unauthorized access without legitimate credentials.

**4. CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Facebook Graph API Interactions**

*   This node represents vulnerabilities in how the application interacts with the Facebook Graph API. Compromising this node allows attackers to manipulate data sent to or received from Facebook, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data breaches.

**5. HIGH RISK PATH: Manipulate API Requests**

*   **Attack Vector: Method: Parameter Tampering**
    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies parameters in API requests sent from the application to the Facebook Graph API. This can be done to access unauthorized data, perform actions the user did not intend, or manipulate data on Facebook. This is often possible if the application relies solely on client-side validation.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Data manipulation, unauthorized actions)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires server-side validation and logging to detect anomalies)
