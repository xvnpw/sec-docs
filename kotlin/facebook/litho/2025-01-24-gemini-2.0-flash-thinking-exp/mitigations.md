## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Component Design and Implementation (Litho-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_component_design_and_implementation__litho-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Principle of Least Privilege in Litho Components:** Design each Litho component to access and manipulate only the data strictly necessary for its functionality. Avoid passing excessive props or managing unnecessary state.
    2.  **Immutable Data Flow in Litho:** Leverage Litho's unidirectional data flow and immutability principles. Ensure data passed as props is treated as read-only within components unless explicitly designed for controlled state updates via `useState` or similar mechanisms.
    3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization at Litho Component Boundaries:** Implement input validation and sanitization logic *within* Litho components, specifically at the point where props are received or user interactions are handled. This prevents malicious data from propagating through the component tree and affecting UI rendering or application logic.
    4.  **Secure State Management within Litho Components:**  Carefully manage component state using Litho's state management features (`useState`, `useReducer`). Avoid storing sensitive data directly in component state if possible. If necessary, ensure secure handling and clearing of sensitive state data within the component's lifecycle.
    5.  **Litho Component Lifecycle Security:** Understand and utilize Litho component lifecycle methods (`onMount`, `onUnmount`, etc.) to perform security-related actions, such as clearing sensitive data from state or releasing resources when components are no longer active.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure via Component Props/State (Litho-Specific):** (High Severity) -  Overly permissive data access in Litho components can lead to unintended exposure of sensitive information if a component is compromised or misused.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Props (Litho-Specific):** (High Severity) -  If Litho components render user-provided data from props without proper sanitization, they become vulnerable to XSS attacks.
    *   **State Corruption in Litho Components:** (Medium Severity) -  Uncontrolled or insecure state management in Litho components can lead to state corruption, causing unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure via Component Props/State:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces data exposure by limiting data access within the Litho component architecture.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Props:** High Risk Reduction - Directly mitigates XSS vulnerabilities arising from unsanitized data passed as Litho component props.
    *   **State Corruption in Litho Components:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of state-related vulnerabilities within the Litho component framework.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Principle of least privilege is conceptually understood, but not consistently enforced in all Litho components. Input validation and sanitization are implemented in some areas, but not uniformly across all component boundaries. Secure state management practices are still evolving.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent application of least privilege across all Litho components.  Standardized input validation and sanitization practices at component boundaries.  Formalized guidelines for secure state management within Litho components, especially when handling sensitive data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mitigation of Re-rendering and Lifecycle Issues in Litho](./mitigation_strategies/mitigation_of_re-rendering_and_lifecycle_issues_in_litho.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secure `shouldUpdate` and `memo` Usage in Litho:** When using Litho's performance optimizations like `shouldUpdate` and `memo`, ensure these optimizations do not bypass security checks or data sanitization logic during component re-renders. Carefully review the conditions used in `shouldUpdate` and `memo` to avoid unintended security implications.
    2.  **Secure Litho Component Lifecycle Management:**  Thoroughly understand the Litho component lifecycle (`onCreate`, `onMount`, `onUnmount`, `onBind`, `onUnbind`). Ensure security-related operations, such as clearing sensitive data or releasing resources, are correctly performed at appropriate lifecycle stages, especially during component unmounting or when components become unbound from data.
    3.  **Avoid Side Effects in Litho Render Logic:**  Adhere to Litho's recommendation to keep render logic pure and free of side effects. Avoid performing security-sensitive operations (e.g., API calls, data modifications) directly within render methods, as these can be triggered unexpectedly during re-renders and lead to vulnerabilities.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Bypassing Security Checks due to `shouldUpdate`/`memo` (Litho-Specific):** (Medium Severity) - Incorrectly implemented optimizations can inadvertently skip security checks during re-renders, leading to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Resource Leaks or Data Persistence Issues due to Lifecycle Mismanagement (Litho-Specific):** (Medium Severity) - Improper lifecycle management in Litho components can lead to resource leaks or failure to clear sensitive data when components are no longer needed.
    *   **Unintended Side Effects from Render Logic (Litho-Specific):** (Medium Severity) - Performing security-sensitive operations in render logic can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential vulnerabilities due to the nature of Litho's rendering process.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Bypassing Security Checks due to `shouldUpdate`/`memo`:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of bypassing security checks by promoting careful and security-aware usage of Litho's optimization features.
    *   **Resource Leaks or Data Persistence Issues due to Lifecycle Mismanagement:** Medium Risk Reduction - Minimizes resource leaks and data persistence issues by emphasizing proper lifecycle management in Litho components.
    *   **Unintended Side Effects from Render Logic:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of side effects and vulnerabilities arising from improper use of Litho's render logic.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - `shouldUpdate` and `memo` are used for performance optimization, but security implications are not always explicitly considered during implementation. Lifecycle management is generally understood, but security aspects are not always prioritized.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal guidelines and code review checklists to ensure secure usage of `shouldUpdate` and `memo` in Litho.  Security-focused training on Litho component lifecycle management.  Stricter enforcement of pure render logic and separation of concerns in Litho components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Addressing Asynchronous Operations and Threading in Litho](./mitigation_strategies/addressing_asynchronous_operations_and_threading_in_litho.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secure Background Thread Operations in Litho:** When Litho components perform asynchronous operations using background threads (e.g., via `@OnEvent` with background thread annotations), ensure these operations are secure. Validate and sanitize data received from background threads *before* using it in UI rendering or component state updates.
    2.  **Secure Communication between Litho Threads:**  Ensure secure communication of data between background threads and the main UI thread in Litho applications. Validate and sanitize data passed between threads to prevent injection vulnerabilities or data corruption.
    3.  **Thread Safety in Litho Components:** Be mindful of thread safety when designing Litho components, especially if they access shared resources or mutable data from background threads. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms if necessary, although Litho's architecture generally minimizes the need for manual thread synchronization in UI components.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption due to Threading Issues in Litho:** (Medium Severity) -  Improper handling of asynchronous operations and threading in Litho components can lead to data corruption or race conditions, potentially causing security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities via Background Thread Data (Litho-Specific):** (Medium Severity) -  If data received from background threads is not properly validated and sanitized before being used in the UI, it can introduce injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption due to Threading Issues:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of data corruption and race conditions arising from asynchronous operations in Litho components.
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities via Background Thread Data:** Medium Risk Reduction - Mitigates injection vulnerabilities by emphasizing secure handling of data from background threads in Litho applications.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Background threads are used for performance, but security considerations in data handling across threads are not always explicitly addressed. Thread safety is generally assumed due to Litho's architecture, but explicit security reviews for thread-related issues are not routine.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal guidelines for secure handling of data in asynchronous Litho operations.  Code review focus on thread safety and data validation in components using background threads.  Potentially automated checks or linting rules to detect potential threading-related security issues in Litho components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and Updates for Litho](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_updates_for_litho.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly Update Litho Framework:** Keep the Facebook Litho framework itself updated to the latest stable version. Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched in libraries, and updating Litho ensures you benefit from these security fixes.
    2.  **Monitor Litho Dependencies:** Be aware of the dependencies used by Litho (both direct and transitive). Regularly check for security vulnerabilities in these dependencies using dependency scanning tools.
    3.  **Update Litho Dependencies:** When security vulnerabilities are identified in Litho's dependencies, update those dependencies to patched versions as quickly as possible. This might involve updating Litho itself or directly updating the vulnerable dependency if possible and compatible.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Litho Framework:** (High Severity) - Using outdated versions of Litho exposes the application to known security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions.
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Litho Dependencies:** (Medium to High Severity) - Vulnerabilities in libraries used by Litho can be exploited to compromise the application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Litho Framework:** High Risk Reduction - Directly mitigates the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in the Litho framework itself.
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Litho Dependencies:** Medium to High Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities in Litho's dependency chain.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Litho framework is generally updated periodically, but dependency scanning and proactive dependency updates for security vulnerabilities are not consistently performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated dependency vulnerability scanning integrated into the build process.  Regular review and updating of Litho and its dependencies based on vulnerability reports.  Establish a process for quickly patching or mitigating vulnerabilities in Litho dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Reviews and Security Testing Focused on Litho Architecture](./mitigation_strategies/code_reviews_and_security_testing_focused_on_litho_architecture.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Litho-Specific Security Code Reviews:** Conduct code reviews with a specific focus on security aspects related to Litho's architecture and component model. Train developers on common security pitfalls specific to Litho, such as data handling in components, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations within the framework.
    2.  **Security Testing of Litho Components:** Include security testing specifically targeting Litho components. This should involve unit tests, integration tests, and potentially penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in component logic, data handling, and interactions within the Litho framework.
    3.  **Focus on Litho-Specific Vulnerability Patterns:** During security testing and code reviews, specifically look for vulnerability patterns that are more likely to occur in Litho applications, such as XSS due to unsanitized props, state management issues leading to data leaks, or threading-related vulnerabilities in components.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unidentified Litho-Specific Vulnerabilities:** (Medium to High Severity) -  General security practices might miss vulnerabilities that are specific to the Litho framework's architecture and features.
    *   **Developer Errors in Litho Security Practices:** (Medium Severity) -  Lack of specific training and focus on Litho security can lead to developer errors that introduce vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unidentified Litho-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Medium to High Risk Reduction - Increases the likelihood of identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities that are specific to the Litho framework.
    *   **Developer Errors in Litho Security Practices:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces developer errors by providing targeted training and code review focus on Litho security.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Code reviews are conducted, but security focus is not always specifically tailored to Litho architecture. Security testing includes general application security, but Litho-specific component testing is not consistently performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formalized Litho-specific security code review checklists and guidelines.  Training for developers on Litho security best practices and common vulnerabilities.  Dedicated security testing procedures and tools for Litho components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Build Configurations for Litho Applications](./mitigation_strategies/secure_build_configurations_for_litho_applications.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secure Build Configurations for Litho:** Ensure build configurations used for Litho applications are secure. Avoid embedding sensitive data (e.g., API keys, secrets) directly in the codebase or build artifacts.
    2.  **Feature Pruning in Litho Builds:** If your application does not utilize all features of Litho, consider using build configurations or build tools to prune unused Litho features. This reduces the application's attack surface by removing potentially vulnerable code that is not needed.
    3.  **Code Obfuscation/Minification for Litho Builds:**  Apply code obfuscation and minification techniques to the built application code. While not a primary security measure, this can make it more difficult for attackers to reverse engineer the application and identify potential vulnerabilities in Litho component logic.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Build Artifacts:** (High Severity if sensitive data is embedded) - Embedding sensitive data in build artifacts can lead to direct exposure if the artifacts are compromised.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface due to Unused Litho Features:** (Low to Medium Severity) - Unused features can represent a larger attack surface, even if not directly exploited, by increasing the amount of code that needs to be secured.
    *   **Reverse Engineering of Litho Application Logic:** (Low Severity) - While not directly preventing vulnerabilities, making reverse engineering harder can increase the effort required for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Build Artifacts:** High Risk Reduction (if implemented correctly) - Effectively prevents direct exposure of embedded sensitive data.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface due to Unused Litho Features:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the attack surface by removing unnecessary code.
    *   **Reverse Engineering of Litho Application Logic:** Low Risk Reduction - Provides a minor layer of defense against reverse engineering.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Secure build configurations are generally followed for sensitive data, but feature pruning and code obfuscation are not consistently applied for Litho applications.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formalized build configuration guidelines for Litho applications, emphasizing security.  Integration of feature pruning into the Litho build process where applicable.  Consistent application of code obfuscation/minification for release builds of Litho applications.
