    *   **Data Handling in Components:**  Ensuring proper sanitization and encoding of data displayed in UI components to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, especially when data originates from external sources or user input.  Litho's declarative nature can sometimes obscure where data is being rendered, making XSS less obvious.
    *   **Lifecycle Management:** Understanding component lifecycle methods (e.g., `@OnCreateLayout`, `@OnUpdateState`) and ensuring security checks and data sanitization are performed at appropriate stages. Improper lifecycle management could lead to data leaks or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Litho heavily utilizes asynchronous operations for performance. Security considerations in asynchronous code, such as race conditions, improper error handling, and data leaks in background threads, need to be specifically addressed in the context of Litho components.
    *   **State Management:**  Securely managing component state and preventing unintended data exposure or manipulation through state updates.  Understanding how state is persisted and accessed is crucial.
    *   **Props and Data Binding:**  Ensuring that data passed as props is validated and sanitized before being used within components.  Incorrect data binding can lead to vulnerabilities if not handled securely.

**Strengths:**
