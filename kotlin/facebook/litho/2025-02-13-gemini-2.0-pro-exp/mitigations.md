## Mitigation Strategy: [Server-Side State Validation (for Litho-Driven UI)](./mitigation_strategies/server-side_state_validation__for_litho-driven_ui_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Litho State Triggers:** Identify all user interactions within Litho components that *should* trigger a state change with security implications. This goes beyond simple UI updates; focus on actions that affect permissions, data access, or business logic.
2.  **API-Driven State Updates:** Instead of directly updating the Litho component's state on the client, send a request to a dedicated server-side API endpoint. This request should describe the *intended* state change.
3.  **Server-Side Validation and Authorization:** The API endpoint should:
    *   Authenticate the user.
    *   Authorize the user to perform the requested action (based on roles, permissions, and the *current* server-side application state).
    *   Fetch the *authoritative* data (not relying on the client's potentially manipulated state).
    *   Validate the intended state change against the authoritative data and user permissions.
    *   Apply the state change *only* if valid and authorized.
4.  **Server-Driven UI Updates:** The server's response should include the *new, validated* state. The Litho component should update its UI *exclusively* based on this server-provided state, using Litho's `@State` and `@Prop` mechanisms to re-render as needed.  *Never* directly update the UI based on client-side input without server validation.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Component State Manipulation (Client-Side):** (Severity: High) Prevents attackers from directly manipulating the Litho component's state to bypass security checks or trigger unauthorized actions.
*   **Unintended Component Rendering (Client-Side):** (Severity: Medium) Reduces the risk by ensuring that state changes that lead to component rendering are validated on the server.

**Impact:**
*   **Component State Manipulation:** Risk significantly reduced (approaching elimination with comprehensive implementation).
*   **Unintended Component Rendering:** Risk moderately reduced; complements component-level authorization.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `/api/user/profile`: Implemented for profile updates. Server validates changes.
*   `/api/data/fetch`: Implemented for sensitive data. Server verifies authorization.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `/api/component/visibility`: Missing. No server-side validation for component visibility.
*   `/api/actions/submit`: Partially implemented. Some actions lack server-side validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimal State Exposure (within Litho Components)](./mitigation_strategies/minimal_state_exposure__within_litho_components_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Audit Litho State:** Carefully review all `@State` variables within your Litho components.
2.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Identify any sensitive data stored in these `@State` variables (e.g., user details, tokens, internal application state).
3.  **Refactor for Server-Side Storage:** For each piece of sensitive data:
    *   **Prefer Server-Side:**  Store the data *exclusively* on the server whenever possible.
    *   **Fetch On Demand:** Use Litho's `@Prop` to pass data *into* the component only when needed for rendering. Fetch this data from the server using a secure API call.
    *   **Short-Lived State:** If temporary client-side storage is *unavoidable*, use `@State` but ensure the data is:
        *   Minimal: Store only the *absolute minimum* required data.
        *   Cleared: Use Litho's lifecycle methods (e.g., `onComponentWillUnmount`) to explicitly clear the `@State` variable when the component is no longer in use.
    *   **Avoid Derived State:** Do *not* derive sensitive state from other state variables within the component.  Fetch all sensitive data directly from the server.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Component State Manipulation (Client-Side):** (Severity: High) Reduces the impact of successful state manipulation by minimizing the sensitive data available.
*   **Data Exposure through Layout Specs:** (Severity: Medium) Indirectly mitigates this by reducing the chance of sensitive data being present in the component's state.

**Impact:**
*   **Component State Manipulation:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Data Exposure through Layout Specs:** Risk moderately reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Authentication tokens are in HTTP-only cookies, not Litho state.
*   Sensitive user data is fetched from the server, not stored in `@State`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Some less-sensitive user data (name, email) is in `@State` for convenience. Needs review.
*   Error messages sometimes contain sensitive information.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Binding, Not Hardcoding (in Litho Layout Specs)](./mitigation_strategies/data_binding__not_hardcoding__in_litho_layout_specs_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review Layout Code:** Examine all Litho component code that defines layouts (typically within `onCreateLayout`).
2.  **Identify Hardcoded Values:** Look for any hardcoded strings, numbers, or other values directly within the layout definition (e.g., within `Text.create()`, `Image.create()`, etc.).
3.  **Use `@Prop` for Dynamic Data:** Replace *all* hardcoded values with `@Prop` variables. These props should be passed into the component from a parent component or fetched from a secure data source (ideally, the server).
4.  **Avoid Literal Values in Layout:** The goal is to have *no* literal sensitive values within the `onCreateLayout` method itself. All data should be dynamically provided through props.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Exposure through Layout Specs:** (Severity: High) Prevents sensitive data from being directly embedded in the layout, which could be exposed through client-side inspection.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Exposure through Layout Specs:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination with complete implementation).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Most components use `@Prop` for dynamic content.
*   Data fetching uses HTTPS and authentication.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Some static text labels (error messages, info components) have hardcoded values. Needs review.
*   Older components might have hardcoded data; a full audit is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Component-Level Authorization (within Litho's Rendering)](./mitigation_strategies/component-level_authorization__within_litho's_rendering_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Component Permissions:** Create a system for defining which users (or roles) are authorized to *view* specific Litho components.
2.  **Associate Permissions:** Associate these permissions with individual Litho components. This could be done via:
    *   Annotations: Custom annotations on the component class.
    *   Configuration: A separate configuration file mapping components to permissions.
    *   Service: A dedicated authorization service.
3.  **`onCreateLayout` Checks:** Within each Litho component's `onCreateLayout` method:
    *   **Fetch User Context:** Obtain the current user's context (ID, roles, permissions).  This should *ultimately* come from a secure server-side source, even if it's initially passed down through props.
    *   **Authorization Check:** Use the defined permissions and the user context to determine if the user is authorized to view this component.
    *   **Conditional Rendering:**
        *   **Authorized:** If authorized, proceed with the normal `onCreateLayout` logic, returning the component's layout.
        *   **Unauthorized:** If *not* authorized, return:
            *   `null` or an empty `Component` (to hide the component completely).
            *   A `Component` that displays an "Unauthorized" message.
4. **Server-Side Enforcement:** This is a *client-side* check for rendering, but it *must* be backed by server-side authorization for any data fetching or actions performed by the component.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unintended Component Rendering (Client-Side):** (Severity: High) Prevents unauthorized components from being rendered, even if an attacker manipulates state or routing.
*   **Component State Manipulation (Client-Side):** (Severity: Medium) Adds a layer of defense by preventing unauthorized rendering even with state manipulation.

**Impact:**
*   **Unintended Component Rendering:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Component State Manipulation:** Risk moderately reduced (secondary defense).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Some components have basic role-based checks, but it's inconsistent.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A comprehensive, centralized authorization system is lacking.
*   Need more granular permissions beyond basic roles.
*   Need consistent checks in *all* components.
