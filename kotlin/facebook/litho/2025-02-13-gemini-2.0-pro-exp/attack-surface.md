# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/litho

## Attack Surface: [1. Component Logic Flaws (State/Event Handling)](./attack_surfaces/1__component_logic_flaws__stateevent_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** Errors within a Litho component's `@OnUpdateState`, `@OnEvent`, or other state-manipulating methods, leading to incorrect state transitions, data corruption, or exploitable behavior. This is *intrinsic* to how Litho manages state and events.
    *   **Litho Contribution:** Litho's declarative, stateful component model and asynchronous operations are the *direct* source of this risk. The framework's design necessitates careful handling of state and concurrency.
    *   **Example:** A component handling user authentication incorrectly updates its state after a failed login attempt, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication due to a race condition in the `@OnEvent` handler for login events.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, information disclosure, privilege escalation, denial of service (depending on the component's role).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rigorous Code Reviews:** Focus specifically on state management, event handling, and asynchronous operations *within* Litho components. Look for race conditions, incorrect state updates, and logic errors.
        *   **Unit Testing (Component-Level):** Exhaustively unit test each Litho component, covering all state transitions, event handling scenarios, and edge cases. Use mocking to isolate component behavior.
        *   **State Management Best Practices:** Adhere strictly to Litho's recommended practices for state management. Understand the lifecycle of `@State` variables and how they are updated.
        *   **Concurrency Handling:** Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `synchronized` blocks, atomic variables, Litho's built-in concurrency utilities) to prevent race conditions in asynchronous operations *within* components.
        *   **Input Validation (Internal to Component):** Even if external input is validated, perform *internal* validation within the Litho component to ensure data integrity before updating state.
        *   **Fuzz Testing (Component-Specific):** Fuzz test individual Litho components with a variety of inputs, including unexpected or malformed data, to identify potential vulnerabilities related to state handling.

## Attack Surface: [2. Layout Complexity Attacks (DoS via Litho Engine)](./attack_surfaces/2__layout_complexity_attacks__dos_via_litho_engine_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting the complexity of Litho's *own* layout engine to cause excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory), leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This is a direct attack on Litho's core functionality.
    *   **Litho Contribution:** Litho's layout engine (often using Yoga) is the *direct* target of this attack. The vulnerability lies in how Litho processes and renders complex component hierarchies.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input that results in a deeply nested or excessively large Litho component tree, causing Litho's layout engine to consume all available memory and crash the application.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash or unresponsiveness).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization (Layout-Specific):** Limit the depth and complexity of user-generated content that *directly* influences the structure of Litho components. Restrict nesting levels, the number of child components, or the size of text rendered within Litho.
        *   **Resource Limits (Litho-Aware):** Implement mechanisms to limit the resources (CPU time, memory) that Litho's layout engine can consume. This might involve custom layout logic or integrating with platform-specific resource monitoring to detect and throttle excessive Litho layout operations.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Layout-Triggering Actions):** Limit the frequency with which users can submit content or perform actions that could trigger complex Litho layout calculations.
        *   **Monitoring (Litho Performance):** Monitor application performance and resource usage, specifically focusing on Litho's layout and rendering times, to detect potential DoS attacks targeting the layout engine.

## Attack Surface: [3. Dependency-Related Vulnerabilities (Litho Itself)](./attack_surfaces/3__dependency-related_vulnerabilities__litho_itself_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities *within* the Litho library itself that can be exploited. This is distinct from vulnerabilities in *other* libraries used by the application.
    *   **Litho Contribution:** This is a direct risk stemming from the use of the Litho framework. Any vulnerability in Litho's code is a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in Litho's component recycling mechanism that allows an attacker to inject malicious code or data into a recycled component, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely, potentially including arbitrary code execution, data theft, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Litho Updates:** Keep the Litho library up-to-date with the *latest* security patches and releases. This is the primary defense against known vulnerabilities in Litho itself.
        *   **Monitor Litho Security Advisories:** Actively monitor security advisories and announcements specifically related to the Litho framework. Subscribe to mailing lists or follow relevant channels to stay informed.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning (Targeted at Litho):** While general dependency scanning is important, ensure your scanning tools specifically check for vulnerabilities in the Litho library itself.
