## Attack Tree Path: [A1: Deeply Nested Layouts (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/a1_deeply_nested_layouts__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Litho's performance degrades with excessively deep component hierarchies. Attackers can influence data or input to force the creation of extremely nested layouts. This could be through user-generated content, manipulated API responses, or other input vectors. The deeper the nesting, the more processing Litho requires, leading to slowdowns or even unresponsiveness.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce limits on nesting depth through code reviews, static analysis, or runtime checks.
        *   Optimize component structure to minimize nesting. Use `flatten` operations judiciously.
        *   Regularly profile application performance to identify and address areas with excessive nesting.

## Attack Tree Path: [A2: Frequent Layout Updates (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/a2_frequent_layout_updates__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Triggering excessive layout calculations and re-renders overwhelms Litho, leading to performance degradation. Attackers can manipulate input or state to cause rapid, unnecessary updates. This can be achieved by rapidly changing data that feeds into Litho components, causing constant re-rendering.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use debouncing or throttling to limit the frequency of state updates and layout calculations.
        *   Implement efficient `shouldComponentUpdate` logic (or Litho's equivalent) to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Ensure components only re-render when relevant props or state change.
        *   Use immutable data structures to make it easier for Litho to detect changes and avoid unnecessary updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [B1.1: Duplicate Keys (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/b1_1_duplicate_keys__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Litho uses keys to identify and recycle components. If an attacker manipulates key generation to create duplicate keys, the wrong data might be displayed, potentially leaking sensitive information. This could happen if the attacker can influence the data used to generate keys, causing collisions.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Ensure unique and predictable key generation based on component data and position. Avoid using user-provided data directly as keys without sanitization and validation.
            *   Implement checks to detect and handle potential key collisions.

## Attack Tree Path: [B2.1: Unintended Data Exposure (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/b2_1_unintended_data_exposure__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect data binding can unintentionally expose sensitive data in the UI. This might occur if a component receives more data than needed or if data isn't properly masked/redacted. The attacker might exploit this by inspecting the rendered UI or network traffic.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Only pass necessary data to each component. Avoid passing entire data objects if only a few fields are needed.
            *   Transform sensitive data before passing it to components (masking, redaction).
            *   Follow secure coding practices for handling sensitive data (encryption, proper storage).
