# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/litho

## Threat: [Excessive Component Re-layouts (DoS)](./threats/excessive_component_re-layouts__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted input that causes rapid and continuous updates to the data driving Litho components. The attacker exploits a poorly implemented `shouldComponentUpdate` method, or a component that reacts excessively to minor data changes, or triggers deeply nested updates.
    *   **Impact:**  The application's UI freezes (becomes unresponsive), leading to a poor user experience. In severe cases, the application may crash due to an ANR (Application Not Responding) error.
    *   **Affected Litho Component:** `Component` (specifically, the lifecycle methods like `shouldComponentUpdate`, `onUpdateState`, and the overall component tree structure), `Sections` (if data changes affect large lists).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement efficient `shouldComponentUpdate` logic in all components. Use `arePropsEqual` and `areStateEqual`.
        *   **Developer:** Profile the application using Litho's profiling tools (Systrace, Litho Profiler).
        *   **Developer:** Debounce or throttle user input that triggers UI updates.
        *   **Developer:** Avoid deeply nested component hierarchies.
        *   **Developer:** Use `useCached` to memoize expensive calculations.
        *   **Developer:** Sanitize and validate all input data.
        *   **Developer:** Use the Sections API's diffing capabilities effectively.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion via Component Inflation (DoS)](./threats/memory_exhaustion_via_component_inflation__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates data to force Litho to create an extremely large number of components, exceeding available memory. The attacker might exploit a vulnerability in how the application handles list data or pagination.
    *   **Impact:** The application crashes due to an OutOfMemoryError.
    *   **Affected Litho Component:** `Sections` (particularly when handling large or unbounded lists), `ComponentTree`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement robust pagination for all lists.
        *   **Developer:** Set reasonable limits on the maximum number of items displayed.
        *   **Developer:** Carefully manage the lifecycle of components within lists, ensuring proper recycling.
        *   **Developer:** Monitor memory usage and set alerts.
        *   **Developer:** Validate the size and structure of data received from external sources.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Component Props (Information Disclosure)](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_component_props__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses debugging tools to inspect the view hierarchy or application memory, finding sensitive data that was passed as props to Litho components.
    *   **Impact:**  Leakage of sensitive user data or application secrets.
    *   **Affected Litho Component:** `Component` (specifically, the props), `LayoutSpec`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** *Never* pass sensitive data directly as props.
        *   **Developer:** Store sensitive data securely (Android Keystore, encrypted SharedPreferences).
        *   **Developer:** Pass only identifiers or keys to components.
        *   **Developer:** Use `@Prop(resType = ResType.PRIVATE)` as an *additional* layer of protection (but do *not* rely on it as the sole security measure).
        *   **Developer:** Implement data redaction techniques.

## Threat: [Unintentional Logging of Sensitive Data (Information Disclosure)](./threats/unintentional_logging_of_sensitive_data__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains access to application logs and finds sensitive data that was inadvertently logged by Litho's internal logging or by custom logging statements within components.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive user data or application secrets.
    *   **Affected Litho Component:** `Component` (any component with logging statements), Litho's internal logging (controlled by `ComponentsConfiguration`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Review *all* logging statements and ensure they do *not* include sensitive data.
        *   **Developer:** Use a logging library that supports redaction or filtering.
        *   **Developer:** Configure Litho's internal logging appropriately. Disable or reduce verbosity in production. Use `ComponentsConfiguration.IS_INTERNAL_BUILD`.
        *   **Developer:** Implement a secure logging strategy.

## Threat: [Injection of Malicious Components (Tampering/Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/injection_of_malicious_components__tamperingelevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Description:** The application dynamically loads Litho components based on external input. An attacker provides a malicious component that executes arbitrary code or compromises the UI.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker gains complete control over the application's UI, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data theft, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Litho Component:**  Any mechanism used for dynamic component loading (e.g., a custom `ComponentTree` builder).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** *Strongly avoid* dynamically loading Litho components from untrusted sources.
        *   **Developer:** If dynamic component loading is *absolutely necessary*, implement extremely strict validation and sandboxing:
            *   **Code Signing:** Verify the digital signature.
            *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate the structure and content.
            *   **Sandboxing:** Run components in a restricted environment.
            *   **Capability Restrictions:** Define a security policy that limits capabilities.
            *   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits.
