# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/litho

## Threat: [Malicious Component Injection](./threats/malicious_component_injection.md)

**Description:**
*   **What the attacker might do:** An attacker could attempt to inject a crafted or compromised Litho component into the application's component hierarchy. This could happen if the application dynamically loads components or if there are vulnerabilities in how components are registered or instantiated *within the Litho framework itself*. The attacker's component could contain malicious logic.
*   **How:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Litho's internal component loading mechanisms, insecure component registration processes managed by Litho, or by compromising a trusted source of components *integrated with Litho*.
**Impact:**
*   The injected component could execute arbitrary code within the application's context, leading to data theft, unauthorized actions, or application crashes. It could also be used to display misleading UI elements to phish for user credentials or trick users into performing unwanted actions.
**Affected Litho Component:**
*   `ComponentTree`, `Component.Builder`, any custom `Component` or `KComponent` loading mechanism *provided by or integrated with Litho*.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Code Signing and Verification:** Ensure all dynamically loaded components *managed by Litho* are signed and their signatures are verified before loading.
*   **Input Validation:** If component definitions or parameters are received from external sources *and processed by Litho's component loading mechanisms*, rigorously validate them to prevent injection of malicious code.
*   **Secure Component Registration:** Implement secure mechanisms for registering and managing available components *within the Litho framework*, restricting access to authorized sources only.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run component loading and instantiation processes *managed by Litho* with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Threat: [State Manipulation Leading to Data Exposure or Incorrect Behavior](./threats/state_manipulation_leading_to_data_exposure_or_incorrect_behavior.md)

**Description:**
*   **What the attacker might do:** An attacker could attempt to manipulate the internal state of Litho components. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how state is managed, accessed, or updated *within the Litho framework*.
*   **How:** Exploiting race conditions in asynchronous state updates *managed by Litho*, finding vulnerabilities in Litho's state management logic, or potentially through memory manipulation if the underlying platform allows and Litho doesn't provide sufficient protection.
**Impact:**
*   Manipulating component state could lead to the display of incorrect or sensitive information to the user. It could also cause the application to behave in unexpected or unintended ways, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or functional errors.
**Affected Litho Component:**
*   `State` mechanism within any Litho `Component` or `KComponent`, `StateUpdater` interfaces *provided by Litho*.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Immutability:** Favor immutable state management patterns where possible *when using Litho's state management features*.
*   **Proper Access Modifiers:** Use appropriate access modifiers (private, internal) for state variables *within Litho components* to restrict direct access from outside the component.
*   **Validation Before State Updates:** Implement validation checks on data before updating the component's state *using Litho's state update mechanisms*.
*   **Secure State Management Logic:** Carefully design and review custom state management logic *interacting with Litho's state management*.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Component Definitions](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_component_definitions.md)

**Description:**
*   **What the attacker might do:** An attacker could craft or inject Litho components with definitions that are intentionally designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) during layout or rendering *performed by Litho*.
*   **How:** Creating components with deeply nested layouts, performing computationally expensive operations within component lifecycle methods *executed by Litho*, or generating a very large number of components *handled by Litho's rendering pipeline*.
**Impact:**
*   This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the application to become slow, unresponsive, or crash. It could also drain the device's battery.
**Affected Litho Component:**
*   `ComponentTree`, `Layout` calculation process, any `Component` or `KComponent` with complex or inefficient logic *that impacts Litho's core functionality*.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Resource Limits:** Implement limits on the complexity and depth of the component tree *within the constraints of Litho's rendering capabilities*.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor application performance and identify components that are consuming excessive resources *during Litho's layout and rendering phases*.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potentially inefficient or resource-intensive component definitions *that could negatively impact Litho's performance*.
*   **Component Recycling:** Implement component recycling techniques *compatible with Litho's component lifecycle* to reuse existing components instead of creating new ones unnecessarily.
