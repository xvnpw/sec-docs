# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/litho

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of User Interactions within Components](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_user_interactions_within_components.md)

- **Description:** Event handlers within Litho components do not properly validate or sanitize data derived from user interactions.
    - **How Litho Contributes:** Litho components handle user interactions through event listeners. If these listeners process user input without proper validation, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    - **Example:** A button click listener in a Litho component takes user-provided text from an `EditText` and directly uses it in an intent to launch another activity without sanitizing or validating the input. A malicious user could inject intent injection payloads.
    - **Impact:** Logic errors, potential for exploiting underlying system functionality (e.g., intent injection), unauthorized actions.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Validate and sanitize all user input received through event handlers before using it.
        - Avoid directly using user input in sensitive operations without proper checks.
        - Follow secure coding practices for handling user input and interacting with system APIs.

## Attack Surface: [Developer Misuse of State Management](./attack_surfaces/developer_misuse_of_state_management.md)

- **Description:** Developers incorrectly manage component state, especially when dealing with sensitive information.
    - **How Litho Contributes:** Litho's state management mechanisms, if not used carefully, can lead to vulnerabilities.
    - **Example:** Sensitive user data is stored directly in a component's state without proper encryption or protection. This data could be inadvertently logged or exposed during debugging or if the component's state is persisted improperly.
    - **Impact:** Information disclosure, privacy violations.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Avoid storing sensitive information directly in component state if possible.
        - If sensitive data must be stored, encrypt it appropriately.
        - Follow secure coding practices for managing application state and handling sensitive data.
        - Be mindful of data persistence and logging configurations.
