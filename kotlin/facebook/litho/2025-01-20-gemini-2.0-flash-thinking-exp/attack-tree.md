## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Component Logic -> Malicious Data in Props/State -> Inject Malicious Data via External Sources](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_component_logic_-_malicious_data_in_propsstate_-_inject_malicious_data_via__eef6e99b.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Inject Malicious Data via External Sources
    *   **Mechanism:** Attacker manipulates data from external sources (e.g., API responses, shared preferences) that is then used to populate Litho component props or state, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Medium - UI corruption, application crashes, triggering unintended actions, potential data leakage if the malicious data is logged or used in insecure ways.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the application's input validation and data handling practices.
    *   **Effort:** Low - Can often be achieved by manipulating API requests or shared preferences.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low - Basic understanding of application data flow.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring data flow and identifying anomalies.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Component Logic -> Logic Errors in Event Handlers -> Exploitable Logic in Custom Event Handling](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_component_logic_-_logic_errors_in_event_handlers_-_exploitable_logic_in_cus_2ebb8cea.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitable Logic in Custom Event Handling
    *   **Mechanism:** Vulnerabilities exist in the custom logic implemented within event handlers of Litho components.
    *   **Impact:** High - Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including data manipulation, unauthorized actions, and application crashes.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common source of vulnerabilities if secure coding practices are not followed.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Depends on the complexity of the event handler logic.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Requires understanding of the event handler's purpose and logic.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires code review and dynamic analysis of event handler behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploit Litho's Internal Mechanisms -> Vulnerabilities in Litho's Dependency Libraries -> Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploit_litho's_internal_mechanisms_-_vulnerabilities_in_litho's_dependency_librari_5283964d.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies
    *   **Mechanism:** Litho relies on other libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, an attacker might exploit them through the Litho application.
    *   **Impact:** High - Depends on the vulnerability in the dependency, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common attack vector if dependencies are not regularly updated.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Exploits often readily available for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Depends on the complexity of the exploit.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium - Vulnerability scanners can detect known vulnerabilities.
