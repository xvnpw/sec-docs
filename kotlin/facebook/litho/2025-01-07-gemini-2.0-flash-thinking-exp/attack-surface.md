# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/litho

## Attack Surface: [Code Generation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/code_generation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the Litho annotation processors or code generation logic can lead to the generation of vulnerable code within the application.
    *   **How Litho Contributes:** Litho heavily relies on annotation processing to generate boilerplate code and optimize UI rendering. Bugs in this process can directly introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A flaw in the code generation for handling certain component properties could lead to the creation of code that bypasses security checks or introduces vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the Litho library to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the code generation process.
        *   Thoroughly review generated code, although this can be challenging due to its automated nature.
        *   Report any suspected code generation issues to the Litho development team.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Annotations](./attack_surfaces/malicious_annotations.md)

*   **Description:** If an attacker can influence the annotations used in Litho components (e.g., through compromised dependencies or developer oversight), they could inject malicious logic or alter the intended behavior.
    *   **How Litho Contributes:** Litho's declarative nature relies heavily on annotations to define component behavior and properties.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could introduce a custom annotation that, when processed by Litho, generates code that leaks sensitive data or performs unauthorized actions.
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and validate all dependencies used in the project, ensuring they come from trusted sources.
        *   Implement code review processes to identify any suspicious or unexpected annotations.
        *   Consider static analysis tools that can detect potentially malicious annotation usage.

## Attack Surface: [Component Recycling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/component_recycling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Improper handling of component recycling in Litho can lead to sensitive data from a previous component instance being inadvertently displayed or accessed in a subsequent instance.
    *   **How Litho Contributes:** Litho optimizes performance by reusing component instances. If component state is not cleared or reset correctly, data leakage can occur.
    *   **Example:** A component displaying user details might be recycled and reused for another user without properly clearing the previous user's data, leading to information disclosure.
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that all component state is properly cleared or reset in lifecycle methods like `onUnbind` or when the component is no longer in use.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive data directly within component state if possible. Consider using more robust state management solutions.
        *   Thoroughly test component recycling scenarios, especially with sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [Asynchronous Layout Issues leading to Race Conditions](./attack_surfaces/asynchronous_layout_issues_leading_to_race_conditions.md)

*   **Description:** Litho's asynchronous layout mechanism, if not handled carefully, can introduce race conditions or timing-related vulnerabilities, leading to unexpected UI states or data inconsistencies.
    *   **How Litho Contributes:** Litho performs layout calculations off the main thread. Improper synchronization or data sharing between threads can lead to race conditions.
    *   **Example:** Two asynchronous layout calculations might attempt to update the same component property simultaneously, leading to an inconsistent state or a crash. This could be exploited to manipulate displayed information.
    *   **Impact:** Medium
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use thread-safe data structures and synchronization mechanisms when sharing data between Litho components and background threads.
        *   Carefully manage state updates in asynchronous operations to avoid race conditions.
        *   Thoroughly test UI interactions and data updates under various load conditions.
