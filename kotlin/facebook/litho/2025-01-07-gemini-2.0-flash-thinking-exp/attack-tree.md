## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rendering Logic -> Inject Malicious Components/Views [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rendering_logic_-_inject_malicious_componentsviews__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to inject malicious UI elements into the application's rendering process. This is achieved by providing crafted data that, when processed by Litho, results in the instantiation of harmful components.

**Consequences:** Successful injection can lead to:
* **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious components can be designed to steal sensitive user data or application secrets.
* **Malicious Actions:**  Injected components can trigger unauthorized actions within the application or on the user's device.
* **UI Manipulation:**  The attacker can alter the UI to mislead the user or trick them into performing unwanted actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rendering Logic -> Inject Malicious Components/Views -> Supply Crafted Data -> Malicious Data in API Response (Impacting Litho Rendering) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rendering_logic_-_inject_malicious_componentsviews_-_supply_crafted_data_-_malicious_data_in_3efa888a.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application fetches data from an API, and this data is used by Litho to render UI components. An attacker compromises the API or intercepts the response to inject malicious data. When Litho processes this tainted data, it renders harmful UI elements.

**Consequences:** Similar to the previous point, this can lead to data exfiltration, malicious actions, and UI manipulation. The reliance on external data sources makes this a significant risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries Used by Litho [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries_used_by_litho__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Litho relies on various third-party libraries. If these libraries have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them through the application. This often involves using publicly available exploits targeting specific versions of these libraries.

**Consequences:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability but can range from:
* **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's device.
* **Denial of Service:** The application can be crashed or made unresponsive.
* **Data Breaches:** Sensitive data handled by the vulnerable library can be exposed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries Used by Litho -> Identify and Leverage Known Vulnerabilities -> Outdated Dependency with Known Exploits [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries_used_by_litho_-_identify_and_leverage_known_vulnera_bcd38b7a.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses an outdated version of a third-party library that has publicly known vulnerabilities. Attackers can easily find and utilize exploits for these vulnerabilities.

**Consequences:**  This path directly leads to the consequences described in the previous point, emphasizing the importance of keeping dependencies up-to-date.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Application State Through Litho -> Intercept and Modify Data Flow to Litho Components [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_application_state_through_litho_-_intercept_and_modify_data_flow_to_litho_components__cri_1546212b.md)

**Attack Vector:**  An attacker intercepts the data flowing to Litho components, typically from network requests or local storage, and modifies it before it reaches the rendering logic.

**Consequences:**
* **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can alter the data displayed to the user, potentially leading to misinformation or financial losses.
* **Bypassing Security Checks:** Modifying data related to authentication or authorization can allow the attacker to bypass security measures.
* **Triggering Unexpected Behavior:** Altered data can cause the application to enter unintended states or perform unexpected actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Application State Through Litho -> Intercept and Modify Data Flow to Litho Components -> Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Data Sources (Impacting Litho) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_application_state_through_litho_-_intercept_and_modify_data_flow_to_litho_components_-_ma_7457a753.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, intercepting network traffic between the application and its data sources (e.g., backend API). They then modify the data being sent to the Litho components.

**Consequences:** This leads to the consequences described in the previous point, highlighting the importance of secure communication channels.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Application State Through Litho -> Intercept and Modify Data Flow to Litho Components -> Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Data Sources (Impacting Litho) -> Compromise Backend API Serving Data to Litho [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_application_state_through_litho_-_intercept_and_modify_data_flow_to_litho_components_-_ma_33fb4151.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker successfully compromises the backend API that provides data to the Litho application. This allows them to directly control the data being sent to the application.

**Consequences:** This is a critical point of failure, allowing the attacker to:
* **Inject Malicious Data:** As described in the rendering logic attacks.
* **Manipulate Application State:** By controlling the data, the attacker can force the application into arbitrary states.
* **Perform Unauthorized Actions:** The compromised API can be used to perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration with Native Code (if applicable) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_with_native_code__if_applicable___high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the Litho application integrates with native code (e.g., via JNI), vulnerabilities in the native code can be exploited.

**Consequences:** Exploiting native code vulnerabilities can have severe consequences, including:
* **Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's device with the privileges of the application.
* **Device Compromise:** In severe cases, vulnerabilities in native code can lead to full device compromise.
* **Data Access:** The attacker can gain access to sensitive data stored on the device.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration with Native Code (if applicable) -> Identify and Leverage Vulnerabilities in Native Modules [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_with_native_code__if_applicable__-_identify_and_leverage_vulnerabilities_in_nati_b6557f98.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies and exploits specific vulnerabilities within the native code modules that the Litho application interacts with.

**Consequences:** This directly leads to the consequences described in the previous point, emphasizing the critical nature of secure native code development.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration with Native Code (if applicable) -> Identify and Leverage Vulnerabilities in Native Modules -> Buffer Overflows in Native Code Called by Litho [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_with_native_code__if_applicable__-_identify_and_leverage_vulnerabilities_in_nati_0aa989a2.md)

**Attack Vector:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the native code that Litho calls. The attacker provides input that overflows a buffer, potentially overwriting memory and gaining control of execution.

**Consequences:** This can lead to remote code execution and device compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration with Native Code (if applicable) -> Identify and Leverage Vulnerabilities in Native Modules -> Insecure JNI Bindings [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_with_native_code__if_applicable__-_identify_and_leverage_vulnerabilities_in_nati_bed234e7.md)

**Attack Vector:** The way Litho interacts with native code through JNI (Java Native Interface) is insecure. This could involve improper handling of data passed between Java and native code, leading to vulnerabilities.

**Consequences:** This can allow attackers to bypass security checks, access sensitive data, or even execute arbitrary code.
