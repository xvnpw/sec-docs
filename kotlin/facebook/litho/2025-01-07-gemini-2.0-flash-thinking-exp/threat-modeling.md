# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/litho

## Threat: [Malicious Component Injection](./threats/malicious_component_injection.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Component Injection

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious Litho components or manipulate existing component definitions if the data source for rendering is compromised or lacks proper sanitization. This could involve crafting malicious data payloads that, when processed by Litho's component creation logic (e.g., within a `LayoutSpec`), result in the instantiation of components with unintended and harmful behavior.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the component's lifecycle, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification of application behavior, or denial of service. The attacker could potentially access sensitive data or resources accessible to the application.

**Affected Litho Component:** `Component` class, `@LayoutSpec`-annotated classes, data binding mechanisms within components.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data used to define or configure Litho components.
*   Enforce code reviews to identify potential injection points in component creation logic.
*   Consider using immutable data structures for component configuration to prevent modification after creation.

## Threat: [Component State Manipulation](./threats/component_state_manipulation.md)

**Threat:** Component State Manipulation

**Description:** An attacker might find ways to directly manipulate the internal state of Litho components, bypassing intended state update mechanisms. This could happen if state variables are inadvertently exposed or if vulnerabilities exist in custom state management logic implemented within components (using `@State` and `@OnUpdateState`). An attacker could potentially send crafted requests or exploit vulnerabilities in the application's communication layer to alter the state.

**Impact:** Unexpected application behavior, data corruption, or privilege escalation depending on how the state is used to control application logic or access resources. For example, manipulating the state of a component controlling access rights could grant unauthorized access.

**Affected Litho Component:** Components using `@State` annotation, state update methods annotated with `@OnUpdateState`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enforce strict encapsulation of component state. Avoid directly exposing state variables.
*   Ensure all state updates are performed through well-defined and authorized channels (e.g., using `@OnEvent` or `@OnUpdateState`).
*   Implement validation logic within state update methods to prevent invalid or malicious state transitions.
*   If using custom state management, rigorously review the logic for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Event Handlers](./threats/malicious_event_handlers.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Event Handlers

**Description:** If event handlers within Litho components are not properly secured, an attacker might be able to trigger unintended actions or inject malicious code through event manipulation. This could involve crafting malicious events or exploiting vulnerabilities in how event data is processed within the handler (e.g., within methods annotated with `@OnEvent`).

**Impact:** Execution of unintended code, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data modification, or cross-site scripting (XSS) if the event handler interacts with the DOM in a vulnerable way (though Litho primarily targets native platforms, web contexts are possible).

**Affected Litho Component:** Components using event handling annotations like `@OnClick`, `@OnLongClick`, etc.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement secure event handling practices. Validate and sanitize any data received through event handlers.
*   Avoid directly manipulating the DOM from within Litho components if possible, and if necessary, ensure proper escaping to prevent XSS.
*   Enforce proper authorization checks within event handlers to prevent unauthorized actions.
