## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Litho-Specific Vulnerabilities - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH POTENTIAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_litho-specific_vulnerabilities_-__critical_node__high-risk_path_potential_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Focuses on exploiting weaknesses inherent in how Litho components are defined, rendered, or handle events. While Litho is generally robust, developer errors in component implementation can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Why High-Risk Potential:**  If successful, these exploits can directly impact the application's UI and potentially underlying logic, bypassing standard security layers.
    * **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:**
        * **1.1.2. Insecure Data Handling in Components (Props/State) - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting improper handling of data passed as props or state to Litho components. This includes lack of sanitization, validation, or secure storage of sensitive data within components.
            * **Why High-Risk:**  UI components are often the entry point for user-controlled data. Vulnerabilities here are easily exploitable and can lead to various impacts depending on how the data is used.
            * **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:**
                * **1.1.2.1. Data Injection via Props/State - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                    * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious data through props or state, especially if these are derived from external, untrusted sources without proper sanitization. This can lead to UI manipulation, logic errors, or even backend exploitation if the injected data is passed further.
                    * **Why High-Risk:** High likelihood due to common developer oversight in input sanitization. High impact as it can lead to various forms of compromise. Low effort and skill for attackers to test and exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application Logic Using Litho Components - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH POTENTIAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_application_logic_using_litho_components_-__critical_node__high-risk_p_eef74d1c.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in the application's business logic that are exposed or accessible through Litho UI components. This focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application uses Litho to interact with backend systems and handle user actions.
    * **Why High-Risk Potential:**  UI components are the interface to application logic. Vulnerabilities here can directly compromise core functionalities and data.
    * **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:**
        * **2.1.1. Improper Access Control via UI Actions - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * **Attack Vector:** Bypassing access controls by manipulating UI interactions. This occurs when authorization checks are insufficient or rely solely on UI-level restrictions without proper backend enforcement.
            * **Why High-Risk:** Medium likelihood due to developers sometimes over-relying on UI security. High impact as it directly leads to unauthorized access. Low effort and skill for attackers to test and exploit.
            * **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:**
                * **2.1.1.1. Unauthorized Functionality Access - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                    * **Attack Vector:** Directly accessing restricted functionalities through UI manipulation, bypassing intended access control mechanisms.
                    * **Why High-Risk:**  Directly leads to unauthorized actions. Relatively easy to exploit if backend authorization is weak.
        * **2.1.2. Data Validation Bypass via UI Input - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * **Attack Vector:** Bypassing client-side validation performed in Litho components and sending malicious or invalid data to the backend. This is critical when server-side validation is missing or insufficient.
            * **Why High-Risk:** High likelihood due to common mistake of relying only on client-side validation. High impact as it can lead to backend vulnerabilities like injection flaws. Low effort and skill for attackers to exploit.
            * **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:**
                * **2.1.2.1. Client-Side Validation Only - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                    * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the lack of server-side validation after bypassing client-side checks in the UI.
                    * **Why High-Risk:**  Directly leads to backend vulnerabilities. Very easy to exploit by intercepting and modifying requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Dependencies of Litho (Indirectly) - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH POTENTIAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_dependencies_of_litho__indirectly__-__critical_node__high-risk_path_potential_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Indirectly compromising the application by exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Litho or the application itself. This is a supply chain attack vector.
    * **Why High-Risk Potential:**  Dependencies are a common attack surface. Exploiting them can have widespread impact and is often overlooked.
    * **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:**
        * **3.1. Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries Used by Litho (or Application with Litho) - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated or unpatched third-party libraries that Litho or the application depends on.
            * **Why High-Risk:** Medium likelihood due to the constant discovery of new vulnerabilities in libraries and potential for delayed updates. High impact as vulnerabilities can range from DoS to remote code execution. Low effort and skill for attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities.
            * **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:**
                * **3.1.1. Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                    * **Attack Vector:** Targeting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in dependencies.
                    * **Why High-Risk:**  Exploits are often readily available for known vulnerabilities. Easy to detect vulnerable libraries with automated tools.
                    * **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:**
                        * **3.1.1.1. Exploiting Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                            * **Attack Vector:** Using readily available exploits or techniques to target known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
                            * **Why High-Risk:**  Lowest effort and skill for attackers. High impact if vulnerabilities are severe.

* **Attack Vector:**  Using social engineering tactics, particularly phishing, to target users of the Litho application. While not Litho-specific, it's a critical threat vector for mobile applications in general.
    * **Why High-Risk:**  Social engineering attacks are often successful as they target human vulnerabilities. Can bypass technical security measures.
    * **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:**
        * **4.1. Phishing Attacks Targeting Users of Litho Application - [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * **Attack Vector:**  Creating deceptive communications (emails, messages, fake websites) to trick users into revealing credentials or installing malware.
            * **Why High-Risk:** Medium likelihood due to the prevalence of phishing attacks. Critical impact as it can lead to full account compromise and device infection. Low effort and skill for attackers to launch phishing campaigns.
            * **Sub-Nodes Breakdown:**
