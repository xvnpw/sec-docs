## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for Component Properties](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_component_properties.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for Component Properties
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all Litho Component properties:** Review all defined Litho Components and pinpoint every property (`@Prop`) they accept as input. These properties are the primary way data flows into Litho components.
    2.  **Utilize Litho's Prop Validation:** Leverage Litho's built-in prop validation mechanisms (`@Prop(validate = true)`) and custom `PropValidations` to enforce data type and format constraints directly at the component level. This is a Litho-specific feature for ensuring data integrity.
    3.  **Implement Sanitization within Components or Prop Setters:**  Within the Litho Component's `render` method or within custom prop setters (if used), sanitize property values before they are used in rendering or logic. This is crucial when properties handle user-provided content or data from external sources that will be displayed in the UI rendered by Litho.
    4.  **Handle Validation Errors Gracefully in Litho Components:** Implement error handling within Litho components to manage cases where prop validation fails. This could involve logging errors using Litho's logging mechanisms, displaying fallback UI elements, or preventing rendering of specific parts of the component.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Prop Validations:** As Litho components evolve and new properties are added, regularly review and update prop validation rules to maintain data integrity and security. Ensure new properties are properly validated using Litho's features.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (XSS, potentially others in specific contexts):** Severity: High (if Litho is used in a context where web content rendering is possible, or if components are misused to execute code based on props).
    *   **Data Integrity Issues within Litho UI:** Severity: Medium (Incorrect data processing or UI rendering within Litho components due to malformed or unexpected input properties).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** High reduction (significantly reduces the attack surface by preventing malicious data from being processed and rendered by Litho components due to enforced validation and sanitization at the component property level).
    *   **Data Integrity Issues within Litho UI:** High reduction (ensures data consistency and reliability within the Litho UI, preventing rendering errors and unexpected behavior caused by invalid properties).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Prop validation is used in some components, particularly for simple type checks, but custom `PropValidations` and comprehensive sanitization within components are not consistently applied across all Litho components.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in many Litho components, especially those that receive data from backend services or handle user-generated content. Need to implement robust prop validation and sanitization for all relevant Litho component properties using Litho's features and best practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege in Data Binding for Litho Components](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_in_data_binding_for_litho_components.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege in Data Binding for Litho Components
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Data Binding to Litho Components:**  Specifically examine how data is passed as props to Litho Components. Focus on the data structures and objects used to populate `@Prop` fields.
    2.  **Identify Minimum Required Props for Each Litho Component:** For each Litho Component, determine the absolute minimum set of properties (`@Prop` fields) it truly needs to function and render correctly.
    3.  **Restrict Data Exposure via Props:**  Modify data binding logic to pass only the necessary data as props to Litho Components. Avoid passing entire data objects or exposing properties that are not directly used within the component's `render` method or component logic.
    4.  **Utilize Litho's Data Model Best Practices:**  Follow Litho's recommended data modeling practices to create specific data structures or data transfer objects (DTOs) tailored to the needs of individual Litho Components. This ensures components only receive the data they require as props.
    5.  **Regularly Audit Litho Component Prop Usage:** Periodically review how props are used within Litho Components to ensure the principle of least privilege is maintained as components are updated and new features are added.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure through Litho Component Props:** Severity: Medium (Accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive data through props passed to Litho components, potentially leading to information disclosure if component state or rendering logic is compromised).
    *   **Information Leakage from Litho Components (through logs, debugging):** Severity: Low to Medium (Increased risk of sensitive data being logged or exposed during debugging if Litho components receive more data than necessary as props).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure through Litho Component Props:** Moderate reduction (limits the amount of sensitive data potentially accessible through Litho component props, reducing the impact of potential vulnerabilities within the component or its rendering logic).
    *   **Information Leakage from Litho Components:** Low to Moderate reduction (reduces the chance of accidentally logging or exposing sensitive data related to Litho components during development and debugging).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. In some Litho components, prop usage is optimized, but in other parts of the application, components might receive larger data objects as props than strictly necessary. For example, list item Litho components might receive full user objects when only a name and image URL are needed for rendering.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in list item Litho components, detail view Litho components, and complex form Litho components. Need to refactor data binding to ensure Litho components only receive the minimum necessary data as props across the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Masking and Redaction within Litho UI Components](./mitigation_strategies/data_masking_and_redaction_within_litho_ui_components.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Data Masking and Redaction within Litho UI Components
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data Display in Litho Components:**  Locate all Litho Components that are responsible for displaying sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, phone numbers, email addresses, personal IDs) in the UI.
    2.  **Implement Masking/Redaction Logic within Litho Component Render Methods:** Within the `render` method of the relevant Litho Components, implement logic to apply masking or redaction techniques to sensitive data *before* it is rendered in the UI. This ensures the masking is applied directly within the Litho rendering process.
    3.  **Utilize Litho's State for Masking Control (if needed):** If masking needs to be dynamically controlled (e.g., show/hide masked data), use Litho's `@State` mechanism within the component to manage the masking state and update the UI accordingly.
    4.  **Ensure Consistent Masking Across Litho UI:** Apply masking consistently across all Litho Components for the same types of sensitive data to maintain a uniform security posture and user experience within the Litho-rendered UI.
    5.  **Test Masking in Litho UI Rendering:** Thoroughly test the masking implementation within Litho Components to ensure that sensitive data is properly masked in all relevant UI scenarios and that the masking logic does not introduce any rendering issues or performance problems within the Litho framework.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (Litho UI Level):** Severity: Medium to High (Direct exposure of sensitive data in the UI rendered by Litho components, increasing the risk of unauthorized viewing or recording of sensitive information displayed by Litho).
    *   **Shoulder Surfing/Visual Hacking of Litho UI:** Severity: Medium (Reduces the risk of sensitive data being observed by unauthorized individuals looking at the user's screen when viewing the Litho-rendered UI).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure (Litho UI Level):** High reduction (significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data being directly visible in the Litho UI, protecting users from casual observation or screen recording of the Litho-rendered interface).
    *   **Shoulder Surfing/Visual Hacking of Litho UI:** Moderate reduction (makes it harder for unauthorized individuals to quickly glean sensitive information by visually observing the Litho-rendered screen).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic masking is used for password input fields rendered by Litho, but more comprehensive masking for other sensitive data displayed by Litho components is missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing for Litho components displaying credit card numbers, phone numbers, email addresses, personal IDs, and other sensitive information in profile screens, transaction history, and settings pages rendered using Litho. Need to implement consistent masking within Litho components across all UI elements displaying sensitive data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure State Management Practices within Litho Components](./mitigation_strategies/secure_state_management_practices_within_litho_components.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure State Management Practices within Litho Components
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Sensitive Data in Litho Component State (`@State`):**  Avoid storing sensitive data directly in Litho Component state (`@State` fields) if possible. Explore alternative approaches for managing sensitive data that do not rely on persistent component state.
    2.  **Encrypt Sensitive Data in Litho Component State (if necessary):** If sensitive data *must* be stored in Litho Component state, encrypt it before setting it as `@State`. Use appropriate encryption techniques suitable for mobile environments. Decrypt the data only when needed within the component's rendering or logic.
    3.  **Control State Updates in Litho Components:** Implement proper control mechanisms for updating Litho Component state (`@State`). Ensure state updates are triggered by well-defined events and are validated before being applied. Use Litho's state update mechanisms (`useState`, `useMutation`) responsibly.
    4.  **Regularly Review Litho Component State Logic:** Periodically review the state management logic within Litho Components to ensure it adheres to secure coding practices and does not introduce vulnerabilities related to state handling. Pay attention to how `@State` is used and updated.
    5.  **Consider Alternative State Management Patterns with Litho:** Explore alternative state management patterns that might be more secure for sensitive data, such as using ephemeral state, or relying on data fetched on-demand rather than storing it persistently in Litho component state.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure from Litho Component State:** Severity: Medium (Exposure of sensitive data stored in Litho Component state, potentially through memory dumps, debugging tools specific to Litho, or vulnerabilities in Litho's state management mechanisms).
    *   **State Manipulation Attacks targeting Litho Components:** Severity: Medium (Manipulation of Litho Component state to bypass security checks, alter application behavior within the Litho UI, or gain unauthorized access by exploiting state management vulnerabilities).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure from Litho Component State:** Moderate reduction (reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure from Litho Component state by minimizing storage and encrypting when necessary, specifically within the context of Litho's state management).
    *   **State Manipulation Attacks targeting Litho Components:** Moderate reduction (makes it harder to manipulate Litho Component state maliciously by implementing controlled state transitions and secure state management practices within the Litho framework).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic state management is implemented using Litho's `@State` API, but no specific measures are in place to encrypt sensitive data in Litho component state or enforce strict state transition controls beyond standard Litho state management patterns.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing encryption for sensitive data stored in Litho component state, more robust state transition validation within Litho components, and a formal security review process specifically for Litho component state management logic. Need to enhance state management security within Litho components, especially for components handling sensitive user data or application settings that might be managed via Litho state.
