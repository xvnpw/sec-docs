# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/litho

## Attack Surface: [Logic Errors in Component Lifecycle Methods](./attack_surfaces/logic_errors_in_component_lifecycle_methods.md)

**Description:** Critical vulnerabilities arising from flawed or insecure logic within Litho component lifecycle methods (e.g., `@OnCreateLayout`, `@OnUpdateState`, `@OnEvent`) that can lead to significant application compromise.
**Litho Contribution:** Litho's core architecture relies on these methods for rendering and state management. Critical bugs here can directly lead to severe vulnerabilities.
**Example:** A component's `@OnUpdateState` method, triggered by user input, contains a logic error that allows an attacker to overwrite critical application state, bypassing authentication checks and gaining unauthorized access to sensitive features or data.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data corruption, complete application compromise, potentially remote code execution if logic errors interact with other vulnerabilities.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Rigorous Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory, in-depth code reviews focusing specifically on lifecycle method logic and state transitions.
*   **Comprehensive Unit and Integration Testing:** Develop extensive unit and integration tests that cover all lifecycle methods, especially edge cases and error conditions, simulating malicious inputs and state manipulations.
*   **Formal Verification (where applicable):** For critical components, consider formal verification techniques to mathematically prove the correctness and security of lifecycle method logic.
*   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of Litho components, focusing on lifecycle method implementations and potential logic flaws.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Side Effects in Event Handlers Leading to Critical State Corruption](./attack_surfaces/unintended_side_effects_in_event_handlers_leading_to_critical_state_corruption.md)

**Description:** High severity vulnerabilities where event handlers (`@OnClick`, `@OnLongClick`, custom events) inadvertently or maliciously trigger actions that corrupt critical application state, leading to significant security breaches.
**Litho Contribution:** Litho's event handling mechanism, while essential for interactivity, can become a critical attack vector if handlers are not carefully designed and secured.
**Example:** An `@OnClick` handler on a seemingly innocuous UI element, when triggered under specific conditions (e.g., manipulated state or crafted input), modifies a shared, critical application state variable that controls access to sensitive user data. This allows an attacker to bypass authorization and access data belonging to other users.
**Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, potential for further exploitation by leveraging corrupted state.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Event Handlers:** Design event handlers to only modify the absolutely necessary state and avoid broad or shared state modifications unless strictly controlled and secured.
*   **Input Validation and Contextual Security Checks in Handlers:**  Validate all inputs and perform contextual security checks *within* event handlers before performing any state modifications or actions, ensuring the action is authorized and safe in the current application state.
*   **Immutable State Management (where feasible):** Favor immutable state management patterns to reduce the risk of unintended side effects and make state transitions more predictable and auditable.
*   **Security Focused Testing of Event Flows:**  Specifically test event flows and handler interactions for potential unintended state modifications and security implications, including negative testing with malicious inputs and state.

## Attack Surface: [Inefficient Component Rendering Logic Leading to Exploitable Denial of Service](./attack_surfaces/inefficient_component_rendering_logic_leading_to_exploitable_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** High severity performance vulnerabilities where poorly optimized component rendering logic can be easily exploited by an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) on the client device, rendering the application unusable.
**Litho Contribution:** While Litho aims for performance, inefficient component design, especially in complex layouts or with heavy computations in rendering, can create exploitable DoS conditions.
**Example:** A component with extremely computationally expensive `@OnCreateLayout` logic is used within a frequently re-rendered list or layout. An attacker can craft input or trigger application flows that force rapid and repeated rendering of this component, quickly exhausting device resources (CPU, memory) and causing the application to become unresponsive and effectively unusable for legitimate users.
**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application unresponsiveness, significant disruption of service for legitimate users, negative impact on user experience and potentially business operations.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Proactive Performance Profiling and Optimization:** Implement rigorous performance profiling during development to identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks in component rendering logic *before* deployment.
*   **Resource Limits and Rate Limiting (where applicable):**  If possible, implement client-side resource limits or rate limiting mechanisms to mitigate the impact of excessive rendering requests, although client-side DoS mitigation is generally challenging.
*   **Efficient Layout and Component Design:**  Prioritize efficient layout design, minimize component complexity, and avoid unnecessary computations within rendering methods.
*   **Stress Testing and DoS Simulation:** Conduct stress testing and DoS simulations to identify and address potential performance vulnerabilities that could be exploited for DoS attacks. Focus on scenarios that involve rapid or repeated rendering of computationally intensive components.
