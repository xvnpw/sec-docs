## Threat: [Insecure Component Logic leading to Critical Application Failure or Data Breach](./threats/insecure_component_logic_leading_to_critical_application_failure_or_data_breach.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the custom logic within a Litho Component (e.g., in `onUpdateState`, `onEvent`, lifecycle methods) to cause critical application failure or a data breach. This could involve manipulating input data or triggering specific event sequences to force the component into a state where it crashes, leaks sensitive data, or performs unauthorized actions. For example, a flaw in a component handling user authentication could be exploited to bypass authentication or gain access to sensitive user data.
**Impact:** Critical application failure, data breach (exposure of sensitive user data, credentials, or internal system information), potential for remote code execution if component logic interacts with native code or external systems insecurely (less likely in typical Litho usage, but theoretically possible if integrations are poorly designed).
**Affected Litho Component:** Individual Litho Components (LayoutSpecs, Kotlin/Java classes defining critical component logic, especially those handling data processing, authentication, authorization, or sensitive operations).
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Rigorous Security Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough security-focused code reviews of all component logic, especially components handling sensitive data or critical application functions.
*   **Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Scanning:** Perform penetration testing and vulnerability scanning specifically targeting component logic and data handling within Litho components.
*   **Input Validation and Output Encoding:** Implement strict input validation for all data processed within components and proper output encoding to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design components with the principle of least privilege in mind, limiting their access to sensitive data and system resources.
*   **Secure Development Training:** Ensure developers receive secure development training focused on common component-level vulnerabilities and secure coding practices within the Litho framework.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure through Props and Component Hierarchy in Production Builds](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_through_props_and_component_hierarchy_in_production_builds.md)

**Description:**  Sensitive data is unintentionally exposed through props passed to components or within the component hierarchy itself, and this exposure persists in production builds. An attacker who gains access to the application's memory (through memory dumps, debugging tools in compromised environments, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain code execution) could potentially extract this sensitive information directly from the running application. This is exacerbated if debug features that expose component hierarchy are unintentionally left enabled in production.
**Impact:** High severity information disclosure of sensitive data (PII, API keys, internal application secrets, business-critical data).  Reputational damage, legal and regulatory repercussions, financial loss.
**Affected Litho Component:** Prop system, Component Tree structure, potentially Debugging tools if inadvertently enabled in production.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Data Flow Security Review:** Conduct a thorough review of data flow within the application, specifically focusing on how sensitive data is passed as props and rendered in the UI.
*   **Minimize Sensitive Data in UI Layer:**  Reduce the amount of sensitive data directly passed as props to UI components. Process and transform data on backend or data layers before presenting it in the UI, only passing necessary, non-sensitive representations.
*   **Secure Data Handling Components:** Design specific components to handle and display sensitive data securely, implementing masking, redaction, or encryption where appropriate within the UI layer.
*   **Disable Debug Features in Production:**  Strictly disable all debug features, including component hierarchy inspection tools and verbose logging, in production builds. Implement robust build configurations to ensure debug features are automatically stripped out for release builds.
*   **Memory Protection Measures:** Implement Android security best practices to protect application memory from unauthorized access, such as using ProGuard/R8 for code obfuscation and enabling security features offered by the Android platform.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application, specifically focusing on data handling and potential sensitive data exposure within the Litho UI layer.
