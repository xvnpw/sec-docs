Here's the updated key attack surface list focusing on high and critical elements directly involving Litho:

*   **Improper Data Handling in Props and State**
    *   **Description:** Data received as `Props` or managed within `State` is not properly sanitized or validated before being used, especially when rendering UI elements or interacting with other components.
    *   **How Litho Contributes:** Litho's declarative nature encourages passing data through `Props` and managing component-specific data in `State`. If developers don't implement proper input validation and sanitization within their component logic, this data becomes a potential injection point.
    *   **Example:** A `Text` component receives user-provided text as a `Prop`. If this text contains malicious JavaScript and the `Text` component is rendered within a `WebView` using a mechanism that doesn't escape HTML, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   **Impact:** XSS attacks, information disclosure, UI manipulation, potential for further exploitation depending on the context where the unsanitized data is used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation on all data received as `Props` and managed within `State`. Define expected data types, formats, and ranges.
        *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Encode or escape data appropriately before rendering it in UI elements, especially when using components that can interpret HTML or other markup (e.g., when rendering in a `WebView`). Utilize context-aware escaping techniques.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** When rendering within `WebView` components, implement a strong Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the `WebView` can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.

*   **Incorrect Implementation of Event Handlers**
    *   **Description:** Event handlers (e.g., `onClick`, `onLongClick`) in Litho components are implemented in a way that introduces security risks.
    *   **How Litho Contributes:** Litho's event handling mechanism allows developers to define actions in response to user interactions. If these actions involve sensitive operations or use user input without proper validation, they can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An `onClick` handler for a button takes user input from an `EditText` and directly constructs a URL for an implicit intent without validating the input. A malicious user could inject arbitrary URLs, potentially leading to phishing attacks or launching unintended applications.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary URL redirection, launching unintended applications, potential for command injection if user input is used in system commands.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation in Event Handlers:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user input used within event handlers before performing any actions.
        *   **Use Explicit Intents:** Prefer explicit intents over implicit intents when launching other activities or services to have more control over the target component.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the actions performed within event handlers have the minimum necessary permissions.

*   **Serialization/Deserialization Issues with State and Props**
    *   **Description:** If `State` or `Props` objects are serialized and deserialized (e.g., for saving instance state), vulnerabilities can arise if the deserialization process is not secure.
    *   **How Litho Contributes:** Litho components often need to preserve their state across configuration changes or app restarts. If developers use standard Java serialization without proper precautions, it can be vulnerable to object injection attacks.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor could craft a serialized `State` object containing malicious code. When the application deserializes this object, the code could be executed.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, application compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Standard Java Serialization:** Prefer safer serialization mechanisms like Gson or Protocol Buffers, which are less prone to object injection attacks.
        *   **Custom Serialization/Deserialization:** Implement custom serialization and deserialization logic to have more control over the process and prevent the instantiation of arbitrary objects.
        *   **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks (e.g., using digital signatures) on serialized data to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
