### Key Attack Surface List: Arrow-kt (High & Critical)

*   **Attack Surface:** Resource Leaks with `Resource`
    *   **Description:** The `Resource` type in Arrow is designed for safe resource management (acquisition and release). If the `release` action is not guaranteed to execute (e.g., due to errors in the `use` block or improper handling of exceptions), resources might leak, leading to resource exhaustion.
    *   **How Arrow Contributes:** Arrow's `Resource` provides the mechanism for resource management. Improper use of its `use` and `release` semantics can lead to leaks.
    *   **Example:** A `Resource` acquires a database connection but the `release` action is within a `try-catch` block that doesn't rethrow exceptions correctly, causing the connection to remain open indefinitely if an error occurs.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service due to resource exhaustion (e.g., running out of file handles, database connections, memory).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use the `use` extension function with `Resource` to ensure automatic release.
        *   Carefully handle exceptions within `use` blocks to avoid preventing the `release` action.
        *   Test resource acquisition and release logic thoroughly, including error scenarios.
        *   Monitor resource usage in production to detect potential leaks.

*   **Attack Surface:** Uncontrolled Execution of Concurrent `IO` Actions
    *   **Description:** If the application uses Arrow's `IO` for concurrent operations, vulnerabilities could arise if the execution of these concurrent actions is not properly controlled. An attacker might be able to overwhelm the system by triggering a large number of concurrent `IO` actions, leading to resource exhaustion or denial of service.
    *   **How Arrow Contributes:** Arrow's `IO` provides tools for concurrency. Mismanagement of concurrent `IO` execution can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An endpoint triggers a new `IO.fx { ... }` block for each incoming request without any limits on the number of concurrent executions. An attacker could flood the endpoint with requests.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, resource exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement proper concurrency control mechanisms, such as limiting the number of concurrent tasks using semaphores or thread pools.
        *   Use rate limiting on API endpoints that trigger concurrent operations.
        *   Monitor resource usage under load to identify potential bottlenecks.

*   **Attack Surface:** Information Disclosure through Error Handling in `Either` or `Validated`
    *   **Description:** If error handling logic using `Either` or `Validated` is not carefully designed, it might inadvertently expose sensitive information in error messages or error types.
    *   **How Arrow Contributes:** Arrow's `Either` and `Validated` are used for explicit error handling. Improper handling can lead to information leaks.
    *   **Example:** An `Either<AuthenticationError, User>` returns an `AuthenticationError` containing the user's password in plain text when authentication fails.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the information).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid including sensitive information directly in error types or messages.
        *   Use generic error types and provide more detailed information through logging or internal error tracking.
        *   Sanitize error messages before displaying them to users.
