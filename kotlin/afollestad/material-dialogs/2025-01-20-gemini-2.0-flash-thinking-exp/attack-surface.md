# Attack Surface Analysis for afollestad/material-dialogs

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Views Integrated via `customView`](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_views_integrated_via__customview_.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses the `customView` functionality to embed its own layouts within the dialog, and these custom layouts contain vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Material-Dialogs Contributes:** `material-dialogs` provides the `customView` method, directly enabling the integration of arbitrary layouts. This makes the application's attack surface dependent on the security of these custom views.
    *   **Example:** A custom view used in a dialog contains an `EditText` vulnerable to a format string bug. When the dialog is shown, a specially crafted string passed to the custom view could lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the vulnerability within the custom view.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Custom View Development:** Implement rigorous security measures when developing custom views, including thorough input validation, output encoding, and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., format string bugs, SQL injection if the custom view interacts with databases).
        *   **Regular Security Audits of Custom Views:** Conduct thorough security reviews and penetration testing of any custom views used within the dialogs.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure custom views operate with the minimum necessary permissions and have restricted access to application resources.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews for any custom view implementations to identify potential security flaws early in the development process.
