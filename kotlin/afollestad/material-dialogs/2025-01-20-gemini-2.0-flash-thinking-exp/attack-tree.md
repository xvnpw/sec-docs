# Attack Tree Analysis for afollestad/material-dialogs

Objective: Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the `material-dialogs` library.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   **CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Application via Material Dialogs**
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Inject Malicious Content into Dialog
        *   **CRITICAL NODE:** Exploit Insufficient Input Sanitization by Application
            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Inject Malicious JavaScript (e.g., via title, content, list items if rendered as HTML)
            *   Inject Malicious Formatting/Markup (e.g., HTML injection leading to UI disruption or phishing)
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content into Dialog](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_into_dialog.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a lack of proper input sanitization by the application when passing data to the `material-dialogs` library for display. This allows the attacker to inject malicious content into the dialog's title, message, or list items.

**Consequences:**
*   If the dialog content is rendered as HTML, injecting malicious JavaScript can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the application. This can be used to steal session cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the application.
*   Injecting malicious HTML or other markup can disrupt the dialog's layout, making it confusing or unusable. It can also be used for phishing attacks by creating fake login forms or other deceptive content within the dialog to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious JavaScript](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_javascript.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Specifically, within the "Inject Malicious Content into Dialog" path, the attacker crafts input containing `<script>` tags or other JavaScript execution vectors. If the application doesn't sanitize this input and the `material-dialogs` library renders it as HTML, the injected JavaScript will execute when the dialog is displayed.

**Consequences:**
*   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Web Context (if applicable):** The attacker can access and manipulate the web context of the application, potentially gaining access to sensitive data stored in cookies or local storage.
*   **Execute Arbitrary Code within Web Context (if applicable):** The attacker can execute any JavaScript code they choose, allowing them to perform a wide range of malicious actions, as described in the "Inject Malicious Content into Dialog" section.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Material Dialogs](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_material_dialogs.md)

**Significance:** This is the root goal of the attacker. If this node is reached, the attacker has successfully compromised the application by exploiting vulnerabilities related to the `material-dialogs` library. All other nodes and paths in the tree contribute to achieving this ultimate goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insufficient Input Sanitization by Application](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insufficient_input_sanitization_by_application.md)

**Significance:** This node represents a fundamental security flaw in the application's handling of user input. It is a critical enabler for the "Inject Malicious Content into Dialog" high-risk path. If the application properly sanitizes input before passing it to `material-dialogs`, the risk of injecting malicious content is significantly reduced. This node acts as a gateway for a significant class of attacks related to this library.
