# Threat Model Analysis for afollestad/material-dialogs

## Threat: [Malicious Input Injection via Custom Views](./threats/malicious_input_injection_via_custom_views.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code or data through input fields within a custom view that is integrated into a `material-dialogs` dialog. This could involve entering SQL injection payloads, command injection strings, or cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads, depending on how the application processes this input. The attacker might aim to gain unauthorized access to the application's data, execute arbitrary code on the device, or manipulate the application's behavior. The vulnerability arises from the application's use of `material-dialogs` to present the custom view without proper input sanitization.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information, remote code execution, application compromise, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `customView()` function, the specific layout and input fields defined within the custom view provided by the application *and integrated using `material-dialogs`*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received from custom views before processing it.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.
*   Avoid executing system commands directly with user-provided input. If necessary, sanitize the input thoroughly and use safe alternatives.
*   Encode output properly to prevent XSS vulnerabilities if the input is displayed elsewhere.

## Threat: [UI Spoofing/Phishing via Custom Layouts](./threats/ui_spoofingphishing_via_custom_layouts.md)

**Description:** A malicious application could create a `material-dialogs` dialog with a custom layout that closely resembles a legitimate system dialog or a dialog from another trusted application. This could trick users into providing sensitive information (like passwords or credentials) or granting permissions they wouldn't otherwise grant, believing they are interacting with a legitimate system component. The flexibility of `material-dialogs` in allowing custom layouts enables this attack vector.

**Impact:** Credential theft, unauthorized access, social engineering attacks, malware installation.

**Affected Component:** `customView()` function, the layout XML used to define the custom dialog *when used with `material-dialogs`*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Educate users about the risks of providing sensitive information in unexpected dialogs.
*   Implement visual cues or branding within your application's dialogs to distinguish them from system dialogs.
*   Android itself provides some mechanisms to identify the calling package, which can be used to verify the origin of certain actions, though this is not directly a feature of `material-dialogs` mitigation.
