## Attack Tree Path: [1. Input Validation/Sanitization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/1__input_validationsanitization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the overarching attack vector where the application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input *before* it's passed to the `material-dialogs` library for display. This failure opens the door to various injection attacks.
*   **Why High-Risk:** This is the most common point of failure in web applications dealing with user input. Developers often overlook or incorrectly implement sanitization, making this a highly probable attack path.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement robust server-side and client-side input validation and sanitization using a well-vetted library (e.g., DOMPurify).
    *   Never trust user input. Always assume it's potentially malicious.
    *   Use a "whitelist" approach, allowing only known-good characters and patterns, rather than trying to block known-bad ones.
    *   Encode output appropriately for the context (e.g., HTML encoding for displaying data in HTML).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Unsanitized Input to Dialog Content](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_unsanitized_input_to_dialog_content.md)

*   **Description:** This is the specific point where unsanitized user input is passed to the `material-dialogs` library, typically to parameters like `title` or `message`.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the *root cause* of the most likely and impactful vulnerabilities (XSS and HTML injection). If this node is compromised, the attacker gains a significant foothold.
*   **Mitigation:** Same as above (for `[[1. Input Validation/Sanitization Bypass]]`). This node *emphasizes* the critical importance of sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 XSS via title](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_xss_via_title.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `title` parameter of a `material-dialogs` dialog. If the application doesn't properly escape or sanitize this input, the injected script will execute in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Example:** An attacker might provide a title like: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` or a more sophisticated payload to steal cookies, redirect the user, or modify the page content.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** XSS can lead to complete account takeover, session hijacking, data theft, and defacement of the application.
    *   The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strictly sanitize the `title` parameter using a robust HTML sanitization library.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
    *   Use output encoding (HTML encoding) when displaying the title.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 HTML Injection via message](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_html_injection_via_message.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to XSS, but instead of injecting JavaScript, the attacker injects malicious HTML into the `message` parameter of a dialog. This can be used to create phishing forms, load external content (potentially malicious), or alter the appearance of the dialog.
*   **Example:** An attacker might provide a message like: `<iframe src="https://malicious.example.com"></iframe>` or `<a href="javascript:evilCode()">Click here</a>`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Medium:** While generally less severe than XSS, HTML injection can still lead to phishing attacks, data breaches, and user deception.
    *   The attacker can control the visual presentation of the dialog and potentially trick the user.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Sanitize the `message` parameter using a robust HTML sanitization library.  Be particularly careful about allowing potentially dangerous HTML tags like `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<script>`.
    *   Consider using a more restrictive sanitization policy for the `message` than for the `title`, as the `message` is often intended to display richer content.
    *   Use output encoding (HTML encoding) when displaying the message.
