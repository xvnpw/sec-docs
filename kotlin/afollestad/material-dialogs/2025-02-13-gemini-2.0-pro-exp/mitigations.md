## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Within Dialog Context)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization__within_dialog_context_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Within Dialog Context)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Dialogs:** Locate all instances where `material-dialogs` is used with the `input()` function to create input dialogs.
    2.  **Define Expected Input:** For *each* input field within these dialogs, define the precise expected data type, allowed characters, length constraints, and any specific patterns (using regular expressions).
    3.  **Implement Validation *Immediately After Input*:** Within the `onPositive` callback (or equivalent) of the `MaterialDialog`, *immediately* after retrieving the input string from the dialog, perform the validation:
        *   **Type Check:** If a number is expected, attempt to parse it and handle potential exceptions.
        *   **Length Check:** Enforce minimum and maximum length limits.
        *   **Character Whitelisting:** Use regular expressions to allow *only* the defined set of characters.  Prioritize whitelisting over blacklisting.
        *   **Pattern Matching:** Use regular expressions to enforce specific formats (e.g., email addresses, dates).
    4.  **Error Handling (Within Dialog):** If validation fails, display a clear, user-friendly error message *within the dialog itself*.  Consider using `material-dialogs` to show the error, preventing the dialog from closing until valid input is provided.  Do *not* proceed with using the invalid data.
    5.  **Sanitization (If Necessary):** If the input *must* contain characters that are potentially dangerous in other contexts, consider *encoding* rather than removing them. Use appropriate encoding functions *before* passing the data out of the dialog's context.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (Passed to Other Components) (Severity: High/Critical):** Reduces the risk of SQL injection, XSS, and command injection *if* the dialog's output is later used insecurely. This mitigation focuses on preventing the dialog from *producing* malicious output.
    *   **Data Corruption (Passed to Other Components) (Severity: Medium):** Prevents invalid data from being passed to other parts of the application.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Passed to Other Components) (Severity: Medium):** Prevents excessively long input strings from being passed on.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Significantly reduces the risk of the dialog being a source of malicious data. The effectiveness depends on how the data is *used* after leaving the dialog.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Basic length checks are in `UserProfileActivity`'s dialog. Type checking for numeric inputs.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `FeedbackActivity`: Feedback dialog lacks character whitelisting and pattern matching.
    *   `SearchActivity`: Search dialog lacks comprehensive validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Custom View Handling (Within Dialog)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_custom_view_handling__within_dialog_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Custom View Handling (Within Dialog)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `customView` Usage:** Locate all instances where `material-dialogs` uses the `customView` option.
    2.  **Isolate and Secure:** Treat the custom view *within the dialog* as a self-contained unit with its own security requirements.
    3.  **Apply Dialog-Specific Security:**
        *   **Input Validation (Within Custom View):** If the custom view contains input fields, implement input validation *within the custom view's logic*, *before* passing data back to the main dialog handler.  Follow the same principles as strategy #1.
        *   **WebView Security (Within Custom View):** If the custom view contains a `WebView`, apply all `WebView` security best practices *within the context of the dialog*:
            *   Disable JavaScript if possible.
            *   Enable Safe Browsing.
            *   Use a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).
            *   Be extremely cautious with `addJavascriptInterface`.
        *   **Intent Handling (Within Custom View):** If the custom view launches Intents, validate those Intents *before* launching them from within the dialog.
        *   **Data Handling (Within Custom View):** Avoid storing sensitive data directly within the custom view's state *within the dialog*.
    4.  **Minimize External Interactions:** Limit the custom view's interactions with the rest of the application *from within the dialog*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XSS (Within Dialog's WebView) (Severity: High):**
    *   **Intent Spoofing (From Dialog) (Severity: Medium):**
    *   **Data Leakage (From Dialog) (Severity: Medium):**
    *   **Other UI Vulnerabilities (Within Dialog) (Severity: Variable):**

*   **Impact:**
    *   Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities within the custom view affecting the dialog itself or being passed to the rest of the application.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No. The project does not use `customView`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Not applicable, but *must* be implemented if `customView` is used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Clear Sensitive Data on Dialog Dismissal](./mitigation_strategies/clear_sensitive_data_on_dialog_dismissal.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Clear Sensitive Data on Dialog Dismissal

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Dialogs:** Determine which `material-dialogs` instances contain or handle sensitive information.
    2.  **Implement `onDismissListener`:** Add an `onDismissListener` (or `onCancelListener`) to the `MaterialDialog` instance.
    3.  **Clear Data *Within* the Listener:** Inside the listener, *explicitly* clear any sensitive data held by the dialog:
        *   Set text fields within the dialog to empty strings (`editText.setText("")` for input dialogs).
        *   Nullify references to sensitive objects held by the dialog.
        *   If using a `customView`, ensure the custom view's elements also clear sensitive data.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage (From Dialog) (Severity: Medium to High):** Prevents sensitive data from remaining in the dialog's memory after it's dismissed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Reduces the risk of sensitive data being accessible after the dialog is no longer visible.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Login dialog clears the password field on dismissal.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `UserProfileActivity`: User profile editing dialog should clear fields.
    *   Any other dialogs handling sensitive data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Callback Data (Originating from Dialog)](./mitigation_strategies/validate_callback_data__originating_from_dialog_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Validate Callback Data (Originating from Dialog)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dialog Callbacks:** Locate all callbacks used with `material-dialogs` (e.g., `onPositive`, `onNegative`, `onNeutral`).
    2.  **Treat Dialog Data as Potentially Untrusted:** Within each callback implementation, treat any data *originating from the dialog* as potentially untrusted. This is crucial even if basic validation was done *within* the dialog.
    3.  **Implement Validation *Before* Using Data:** Before using the data passed to the callback, perform thorough validation:
        *   Check for null or empty values.
        *   Re-validate data types and formats (even if checked in the dialog â€“ defense in depth).
        *   If the data represents a selection from a list dialog, ensure the selected item is valid.
    4. **Defensive Programming:** Handle unexpected data gracefully within the callback.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Logic Errors (Due to Dialog Data) (Severity: Medium):**
    *   **Injection Attacks (If Data Used Insecurely) (Severity: Variable):** Reduces the risk, but relies on secure usage *after* the callback.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Improves robustness and helps prevent unexpected behavior caused by potentially flawed data from the dialog.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Some callbacks have basic null checks.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   All callbacks should be reviewed for comprehensive validation of data originating from the dialog.
    *   `FeedbackActivity`: `onPositive` callback needs more robust validation of the user's comment.
