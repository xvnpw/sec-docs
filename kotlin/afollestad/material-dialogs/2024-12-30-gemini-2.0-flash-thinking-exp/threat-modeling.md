Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the `material-dialogs` library:

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Custom Views
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTML or JavaScript code and injects it into data that is subsequently rendered within a custom view used by `material-dialogs`. When the dialog is displayed, this malicious script executes within the context of the application. This is a direct vulnerability stemming from how `material-dialogs` handles and renders custom view content.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker can potentially steal sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the user, redirect the user to malicious websites, or deface the application's UI.
    *   **Affected Component:** `customView` functionality, specifically the rendering of provided content within the `MaterialDialog` class.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize all user-provided or dynamically generated data *before* passing it to the `customView` for rendering.
        *   Avoid directly rendering untrusted HTML content within the `customView`. Consider using safer alternatives for displaying dynamic content or escaping HTML.

*   **Threat:** UI Redressing/Clickjacking via Custom Views
    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages the `customView` functionality to overlay malicious UI elements on top of the legitimate dialog content provided by `material-dialogs`. This can trick users into performing unintended actions, such as clicking on a hidden button that initiates a harmful operation. This directly exploits the ability to embed arbitrary views within the dialog.
    *   **Impact:** Users can be tricked into performing actions they did not intend, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized transactions, or installation of malware.
    *   **Affected Component:** `customView` functionality within the `MaterialDialog` class.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when using `customView` and ensure the content is fully controlled and trusted.
        *   Implement measures within the application's UI framework to prevent overlaying of content if possible.
        *   Clearly indicate interactive elements within the dialog to avoid confusion.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Dependencies
    *   **Description:** `material-dialogs` might rely on other third-party libraries. If these dependencies have known *critical* security vulnerabilities, they could directly impact applications using `material-dialogs`. This is a risk inherent in using any library with dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** The application could be vulnerable to the same exploits as the vulnerable dependency, potentially leading to various security breaches, including remote code execution or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** The underlying dependencies of the `material-dialogs` library, managed through its build configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a critical vulnerability exists in a dependency).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `material-dialogs` and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
        *   Regularly check for known vulnerabilities in the dependencies using security scanning tools or dependency vulnerability databases.
        *   Consider using dependency management tools that provide vulnerability scanning and alerting features.
