Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving `material-dialogs` and with high or critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Unsanitized User Input in Input Dialogs
    *   **Description:** When using `input` dialogs, user-provided text is retrieved by the application. If this input is not properly sanitized before being used in other parts of the application, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Material-Dialogs Contributes:** The library provides the `input` dialog functionality, making it easy for developers to collect user input. It's the point where untrusted data enters the application flow.
    *   **Example:** A user enters `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` in an input dialog, and the application later displays this unsanitized input in a `WebView`, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on how the unsanitized input is used, the impact can range from UI disruption (XSS) to data breaches (SQL injection if used in database queries) or even remote code execution (if used in system commands).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Always sanitize and validate user input retrieved from `input` dialogs before using it. Use appropriate encoding functions for display (e.g., HTML escaping), parameterized queries for database interactions, and avoid executing user-provided input as code.
