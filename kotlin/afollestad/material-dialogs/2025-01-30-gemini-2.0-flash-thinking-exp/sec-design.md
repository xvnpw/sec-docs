# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Material Dialogs library for Android aims to provide developers with a simple, flexible, and aesthetically pleasing way to create dialogs in their Android applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enhance User Experience: Provide visually appealing and user-friendly dialogs to improve the overall user experience of Android applications.
  - Developer Productivity: Offer a well-documented and easy-to-use library that simplifies dialog creation, saving developers time and effort.
  - Code Consistency: Promote consistent dialog design across different Android applications using the library.
  - Open Source Community Contribution: Foster a collaborative open-source project that benefits the Android developer community.

- Business Risks:
  - Security Vulnerabilities: If the library contains security vulnerabilities, applications using it may become vulnerable, potentially leading to data breaches or other security incidents.
  - Library Instability: Bugs or lack of maintenance in the library could lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior, negatively impacting user experience and developer trust.
  - Dependency Issues: Compatibility problems with other libraries or Android versions could hinder adoption and create integration challenges for developers.
  - License Compliance: Incorrect licensing or license violations could lead to legal issues for developers using the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Issue Tracking - GitHub Issues are used to report bugs and feature requests, including potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Pull Requests - Code changes are submitted via pull requests, enabling code review and collaboration. Implemented: GitHub Repository.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Review - Security depends on the vigilance of the open-source community to identify and report vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Potential for Undiscovered Vulnerabilities - Like any software, there is a risk of undiscovered security vulnerabilities in the library.
  - accepted risk: Third-Party Dependencies - The library may depend on other third-party libraries, which could introduce their own vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development workflow to automatically scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Material Dialogs.
  - security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits of the codebase by security experts to proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses.
  - security control: Secure Development Practices Documentation - Document secure coding practices and guidelines for contributors to follow.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a UI library itself. However, developer authentication is required for contributing to the project via GitHub (security control: GitHub Authentication).
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the library's runtime behavior. Authorization is relevant for code contributions and repository management on GitHub (security control: GitHub Authorization).
  - Input Validation: The library should handle user-provided input to dialogs safely to prevent potential injection vulnerabilities (e.g., in custom view handling or string formatting). Security requirement: Implement robust input validation for all user-provided data processed by the library.
  - Cryptography:  Not a primary requirement for a UI library. Cryptography might be relevant if the library were to handle sensitive data display or input, but in its current scope, it's less critical. Security requirement: Evaluate the need for cryptography if future features involve handling sensitive data.
