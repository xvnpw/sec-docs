# Attack Surface Analysis for afollestad/material-dialogs

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Using an outdated version of `material-dialogs` with known security flaws.
    * **How Material-Dialogs Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  Including the library as a dependency introduces the risk of inheriting its vulnerabilities. Older versions may have publicly disclosed exploits within the library's code itself.
    * **Example:**  `material-dialogs` version X.Y.Z has a known vulnerability *within its own code* allowing arbitrary code execution if a specially crafted configuration option is used. An attacker could target applications using this vulnerable version.
    * **Impact:**  Can range from minor issues to complete application compromise, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and remote code execution *due to the library's flaw*.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update the `material-dialogs` library to the latest stable version.
        * Monitor security advisories and release notes specifically for `material-dialogs`.
        * Use dependency management tools that provide vulnerability scanning and alerts for library dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom View Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_view_handling.md)

* **Description:**  Using `setCustomView()` or similar methods to display untrusted or unsanitized content within the dialog.
    * **How Material-Dialogs Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  The library provides the direct mechanism (`setCustomView()`) to inject and render arbitrary views. If the content of these views is not safe, the library facilitates the vulnerability.
    * **Example:**  An application uses `setCustomView()` to display HTML content fetched from a remote server. If the server is compromised or serves malicious HTML containing JavaScript, this script can be executed within the dialog's context *because `material-dialogs` renders the provided view*.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) like vulnerabilities within the application context, leading to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious activities *facilitated by the dialog's rendering*.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid displaying untrusted or user-provided content directly within custom views used with `material-dialogs`.
        * If displaying external content is necessary, thoroughly sanitize it *before* passing it to `setCustomView()`.
        * Implement proper Content Security Policy (CSP) if displaying web content within the custom view provided to `material-dialogs`.
        * Isolate custom view rendering logic and ensure secure handling of the content source.
