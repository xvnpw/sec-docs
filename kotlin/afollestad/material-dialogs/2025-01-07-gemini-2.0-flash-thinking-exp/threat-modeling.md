# Threat Model Analysis for afollestad/material-dialogs

## Threat: [Malicious Custom Views](./threats/malicious_custom_views.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can provide a crafted custom view that, when rendered by `material-dialogs`, executes malicious code within the application's context. This could be due to vulnerabilities in how `material-dialogs` handles custom view inflation or lifecycle events, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code embedded within the custom view definition.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or complete device compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `CustomViewDialog` functionality, specifically the `setCustomView()` method and the underlying view inflation and management mechanisms within the library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using the `setCustomView()` functionality if possible.
    *   If custom views are absolutely necessary, ensure the library is updated to the latest version with potential security patches related to custom view handling.
    *   Thoroughly vet the source and content of any custom views before using them with `material-dialogs`.
    *   Consider implementing additional security checks within the application before and after inflating custom views.

## Threat: [Input Field Injection Vulnerability within the Library](./threats/input_field_injection_vulnerability_within_the_library.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability within `material-dialogs`'s `InputDialog` component could allow an attacker to inject malicious code directly through the input field, bypassing standard application-level sanitization. This could be due to flaws in how the library handles input rendering or data retrieval, allowing for the execution of code when the input is processed by the library itself.
*   **Impact:**  Potential for code execution within the application's context, or manipulation of the application's internal state through crafted input strings processed by the library.
*   **Affected Component:** `InputDialog` functionality, specifically the input processing and retrieval mechanisms within the library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `material-dialogs` library updated to the latest version, ensuring any reported input handling vulnerabilities are patched.
    *   Even with library updates, always perform thorough input sanitization and validation within the application after retrieving input from `material-dialogs` dialogs as a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   Avoid using features of the `InputDialog` that might involve dynamic code execution or interpretation of the input string by the library itself (if such features exist).
