## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit lack of input sanitization in custom view or message](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_input_sanitization_in_custom_view_or_message.md)

*   **[CRITICAL] Display Malicious Content [HIGH_RISK_PATH]:** This involves injecting harmful content into the dialog, exploiting how the application renders and presents information to the user.
    *   **[HIGH_RISK_PATH] Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript (if WebView is used):** If the application uses a `WebView` within the dialog, attackers can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code. This code can then be executed within the context of the `WebView`, potentially leading to:
        *   Session hijacking by stealing cookies.
        *   Redirection to malicious websites.
        *   Execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit lack of input sanitization in custom view or message:** If the content displayed in the `WebView` (either in a custom view or the main message) is derived from user input or external sources and not properly sanitized, it becomes vulnerable to HTML and JavaScript injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft dialog to mimic legitimate system or application prompts](./attack_tree_paths/craft_dialog_to_mimic_legitimate_system_or_application_prompts.md)

*   **[CRITICAL] Display Malicious Content [HIGH_RISK_PATH]:** This involves injecting harmful content into the dialog, exploiting how the application renders and presents information to the user.
    *   **[HIGH_RISK_PATH] Display Phishing/Social Engineering Content:** Attackers craft dialogs that convincingly mimic legitimate system or application prompts. This can trick users into:
        *   Providing sensitive information like passwords or personal details.
        *   Granting unnecessary permissions.
        *   Performing actions they wouldn't normally undertake.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads (if displayed unsanitized)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_cross-site_scripting__xss__payloads__if_displayed_unsanitized_.md)

*   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Input Handling [HIGH_RISK_PATH]:** Attackers target the mechanisms through which the dialog receives and processes user input, aiming to inject malicious data or manipulate application logic.
    *   **[CRITICAL] Malicious Input in Text Fields [HIGH_RISK_PATH]:** Text fields within dialogs are prime targets for injection attacks.
        *   **[HIGH_RISK_PATH] Inject Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads (if displayed unsanitized):** If the application displays the text field input elsewhere without proper sanitization, attackers can inject XSS payloads. When this unsanitized input is rendered in a web context (even within the app if using WebViews elsewhere), the malicious script can execute, potentially leading to:
            *   Stealing user credentials.
            *   Defacing the application's UI.
            *   Performing actions on the user's behalf.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Injection via unsanitized data](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_injection_via_unsanitized_data.md)

*   **Exploit List/Selection Inputs:** While not directly marked as critical at the top level, this path can lead to a critical vulnerability.
        *   **[HIGH_RISK_PATH] Inject malicious data into list items (if dynamically generated):** If the items in a list dialog are fetched from an external source or generated dynamically based on user-controlled data, attackers might inject malicious data into these items.
            *   **[CRITICAL] Server-Side Injection via unsanitized data:** If the application uses the selected item's data without proper sanitization on the backend (e.g., in database queries or system commands), it can lead to severe vulnerabilities like SQL injection or command injection, allowing attackers to:
                *   Access or modify sensitive data.
                *   Compromise the application's backend infrastructure.
                *   Potentially gain control of the server.
