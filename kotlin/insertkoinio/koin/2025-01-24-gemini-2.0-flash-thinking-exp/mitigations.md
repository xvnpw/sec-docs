## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Dependency Scope](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_dependency_scope.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Dependency Scope
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review all Koin modules:** Examine each Koin module definition in your application code.
    2.  **Identify dependency scopes:** For each dependency definition (`single`, `factory`, `scope`), analyze where and how it is used within Koin modules.
    3.  **Restrict scope using Koin features:** Utilize Koin's scoping features (`scope`, module-level visibility) to limit dependency accessibility to only the necessary modules or features.
    4.  **Avoid global `single` for sensitive dependencies:** Refrain from using `single` with global visibility in Koin for dependencies that handle sensitive data or operations. Prefer scoped or factory definitions within Koin modules when appropriate.
    5.  **Regularly audit Koin scopes:** Periodically review Koin module definitions to ensure scopes are still appropriate and haven't become overly permissive in Koin configurations over time.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Dependencies (High Severity):**  If sensitive dependencies (e.g., database connections, API clients with credentials) defined in Koin are globally accessible, any part of the application, even compromised or less secure components, could potentially access and misuse them through Koin's dependency resolution.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Broader Koin scopes can unintentionally expose internal application components and their dependencies managed by Koin, potentially revealing architectural details or sensitive information to attackers who gain partial access through Koin's dependency graph.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Dependencies (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the attack surface within Koin's dependency management and preventing unintended access to critical resources managed by Koin.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk by limiting the visibility of internal components managed by Koin, making it harder for attackers to gather information about the application's structure through Koin's dependency relationships.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We are using Koin scopes in our feature modules (`feature-user`, `feature-product`) but some core services are still defined as global `single` instances in `AppModule.kt` within Koin.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to refactor `AppModule.kt` to use more granular Koin scopes for core services and review all existing `single` definitions in Koin modules to ensure they are truly needed globally within the Koin context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Public Visibility of Internal Dependencies (within Koin Modules)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_public_visibility_of_internal_dependencies__within_koin_modules_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Public Visibility of Internal Dependencies (within Koin Modules)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Design Koin modules with clear interfaces:** Define clear interfaces or abstractions for modules to interact with each other through Koin.
    2.  **Expose only necessary interfaces through Koin:** In Koin modules, only define and expose the interfaces or abstractions that other modules need to use via Koin's dependency injection.
    3.  **Keep implementation details private within Koin modules:** Internal implementation classes and dependencies within Koin modules should not be directly exposed through Koin's module definitions.
    4.  **Utilize visibility modifiers (Kotlin example) within Koin modules:** In languages like Kotlin, use `internal` visibility modifier for Koin definitions and classes that are intended for module-internal use only within Koin modules.
    5.  **Avoid direct dependency injection of concrete classes across Koin modules:** Prefer injecting interfaces resolved by Koin and let Koin resolve the concrete implementation within the module where it's defined in Koin.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Exposing internal dependencies through Koin can reveal implementation details managed by Koin, making it easier for attackers to understand the application's inner workings and potentially find vulnerabilities related to Koin's dependency management.
    *   **Dependency Confusion/Substitution (Medium Severity):** If internal dependencies managed by Koin are easily accessible, attackers might attempt to substitute them with malicious implementations if they can compromise the Koin dependency injection mechanism or configuration.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk by obscuring internal implementation details managed by Koin and making reverse engineering or vulnerability analysis related to Koin's dependency structure more difficult.
    *   **Dependency Confusion/Substitution (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk by making it harder to tamper with internal dependencies managed by Koin from outside the intended module through Koin's injection points.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We are using interfaces for service definitions in many Koin modules, but some modules still directly expose concrete classes through Koin. Visibility modifiers are not consistently used for internal Koin definitions.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to review Koin module designs to ensure interfaces are used consistently for inter-module communication via Koin. Implement `internal` visibility for Koin definitions and classes that are not intended for external module use within Koin modules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Koin Configuration Loading](./mitigation_strategies/secure_koin_configuration_loading.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Koin Configuration Loading
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Koin configuration sources:** Determine where Koin modules and configurations are loaded from (e.g., code, configuration files, environment variables) within the Koin application setup.
    2.  **Secure configuration storage for Koin:** Ensure configuration files or storage mechanisms used by Koin are protected with appropriate access controls (file system permissions, secure vaults, etc.).
    3.  **Validate Koin configuration sources:** If loading Koin modules from external sources, validate the integrity and authenticity of the source before Koin processes it. Use checksums or signatures if possible for Koin configurations.
    4.  **Sanitize external configuration data for Koin:** If configuration data used by Koin comes from external sources (especially user inputs or network sources), sanitize and validate it before using it to define Koin modules or dependencies to prevent injection attacks within Koin's context.
    5.  **Avoid dynamic Koin module loading from untrusted sources:** Do not load Koin modules or configurations dynamically from untrusted sources or user-controlled paths, as this can lead to code injection vulnerabilities within the Koin dependency injection framework.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection (High Severity):** If Koin modules or configurations are loaded dynamically from untrusted sources, attackers could inject malicious code by manipulating the configuration source that Koin uses to build its dependency graph.
    *   **Configuration Tampering (Medium Severity):** If configuration sources used by Koin are not properly secured, attackers could modify them to alter application behavior managed by Koin, potentially leading to security breaches or denial of service through Koin's dependency resolution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Injection (High Impact):** Eliminates or significantly reduces the risk of code injection through Koin configuration loading.
    *   **Configuration Tampering (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized configuration changes affecting Koin's behavior and their potential security consequences.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We load Koin modules from code and some configuration from environment variables for Koin. Environment variables are accessed securely within our deployment pipeline.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We are not currently validating the integrity of environment variables used in Koin configuration. We should implement validation and consider using a more robust secrets management solution for sensitive configuration parameters used by Koin instead of plain environment variables. We also need to ensure no dynamic Koin module loading from external sources is present.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Protect Sensitive Configuration Parameters (Used in Koin)](./mitigation_strategies/protect_sensitive_configuration_parameters__used_in_koin_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Protect Sensitive Configuration Parameters (Used in Koin)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify sensitive parameters in Koin:** Determine which configuration parameters used in Koin modules are sensitive (e.g., API keys, database credentials, encryption keys) and managed through Koin.
    2.  **Avoid hardcoding sensitive values in Koin modules:** Never hardcode sensitive parameters directly in Koin modules or application code that Koin uses.
    3.  **Use secure storage mechanisms for Koin parameters:** Store sensitive parameters used by Koin in secure configuration management systems like environment variables (with caution), secrets management vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.), or encrypted configuration files accessed by Koin.
    4.  **Access sensitive parameters securely from Koin modules:** Access sensitive parameters from Koin modules using secure methods provided by the chosen storage mechanism when Koin resolves dependencies.
    5.  **Minimize logging of sensitive parameters during Koin operations:** Avoid logging sensitive parameters during Koin initialization or runtime. If logging is necessary, redact or mask sensitive values used by Koin.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Exposure (High Severity):** Hardcoding or insecurely storing sensitive parameters used by Koin can lead to credential exposure if the code repository, application logs, or configuration files used by Koin are compromised.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Resources (High Severity):** Exposed credentials managed by Koin can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to backend systems, databases, or APIs that Koin-managed components interact with.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Exposure (High Impact):** Eliminates or significantly reduces the risk of credential exposure by preventing hardcoding and promoting secure storage of parameters used by Koin.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Resources (High Impact):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized access by protecting the credentials needed to access critical resources that Koin-managed components rely on.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We are using environment variables for some sensitive parameters used in Koin, but not consistently. Some older modules might still have hardcoded values or less secure configuration methods within Koin.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to conduct a thorough audit to identify all sensitive parameters used in Koin modules. Migrate all sensitive parameters used by Koin to a secure secrets management solution. Enforce a policy against hardcoding sensitive values in code used by Koin.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Verbose Koin Logging in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_verbose_koin_logging_in_production.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Verbose Koin Logging in Production
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Koin logging level:** In your application's Koin initialization, configure the Koin logging level to be appropriate for production. Typically, set it to a minimal level (e.g., `ERROR` or `WARN`) or disable Koin logging entirely if not needed in production.
    2.  **Remove or conditionally compile debug Koin logging:** Remove or conditionally compile out any verbose debug logging statements that might be present in Koin modules or related code.
    3.  **Review Koin log outputs:** Regularly review application logs in production to ensure no sensitive information is being inadvertently logged by Koin or related components.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity):** Verbose Koin logging in production can expose internal application details related to Koin's dependency management, dependency configurations, or even sensitive data in some cases, which could be valuable to attackers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of information disclosure through excessive Koin logging by minimizing the amount of detail logged by Koin in production.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have a basic logging configuration that sets the level to `INFO` in production, but Koin's default logging might still be verbose.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to explicitly configure Koin's logger to a less verbose level (e.g., `WARN` or `ERROR`) in production environments. Review Koin logging configuration and ensure no sensitive data is logged by default by Koin.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Access to Koin Debugging Features](./mitigation_strategies/secure_access_to_koin_debugging_features.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Access to Koin Debugging Features
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Koin debugging features:** Recognize Koin's debugging features like `koinApplication.dumpValues()` or any custom debugging endpoints that might expose Koin internals.
    2.  **Restrict access to Koin debugging in production:** Ensure that these Koin debugging features are not accessible in production environments or are protected by strong authentication and authorization mechanisms if accidentally included.
    3.  **Disable Koin debugging endpoints in production:** If Koin debugging features are exposed through HTTP endpoints or similar, disable these endpoints in production deployments.
    4.  **Use feature flags or environment variables to control Koin debugging:** Control the availability of Koin debugging features using feature flags or environment variables, ensuring they are disabled by default in production builds.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Koin debugging features can expose detailed information about the application's dependency graph managed by Koin, Koin configuration, and potentially even dependency values resolved by Koin, which could be valuable to attackers.
    *   **Abuse of Debugging Endpoints (Medium Severity):** If Koin debugging endpoints are exposed and not properly secured, attackers could abuse them to gather information about Koin's internal state or potentially manipulate the application's state through Koin.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of information disclosure by preventing unauthorized access to Koin debugging information.
    *   **Abuse of Debugging Endpoints (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting Koin debugging endpoints for malicious purposes.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We are aware of Koin's debugging features but haven't explicitly secured them in production. We are not currently exposing any debugging endpoints, but `koinApplication.dumpValues()` could be accidentally used in production code.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to explicitly disable or remove any usage of Koin debugging features in production builds. Implement checks to prevent accidental inclusion of Koin debugging code in production. If Koin debugging endpoints are needed for non-production environments, implement strong authentication and authorization for them.
