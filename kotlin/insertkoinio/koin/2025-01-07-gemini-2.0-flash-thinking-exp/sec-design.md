## 5. Data Flow

The following sequence diagram illustrates the typical flow of data during a reward claim process, providing a visual representation of the interactions between components:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant "User App" as UA
    participant "Backend API" as API
    participant "Smart Contracts" as SC
    participant "Database" as DB
    participant "Blockchain" as BC

    UA->>API: Request to claim reward
    API->>DB: Retrieve user information and reward eligibility
    DB-->>API: User information and eligibility data
    API->>SC: Call function to claim reward (transaction)
    SC->>BC: Execute transaction, update blockchain state
    BC-->>SC: Transaction confirmation
    SC->>API: Emit "RewardClaimed" event
    API->>DB: Update user's reward balance and transaction history
    DB-->>API: Confirmation of data update
    API->>UA: Reward claim successful notification
```

**Detailed Steps of the Reward Claim Data Flow:**

1. **User Initiation:** The user interacts with the User Application to initiate the process of claiming a reward.
2. **API Request:** The User Application sends a request to the Backend API, specifying the reward to be claimed.
3. **Eligibility Verification:** The Backend API queries the Database to retrieve the user's information and verify their eligibility for the requested reward based on predefined rules stored off-chain.
4. **Smart Contract Interaction:** If the user is deemed eligible, the Backend API constructs and sends a transaction to invoke the appropriate function within the Smart Contracts on the Blockchain. This transaction initiates the on-chain reward distribution process.
5. **Blockchain Processing:** The Blockchain Network receives the transaction, validates it, executes the relevant smart contract logic, and updates the global state of the ledger to reflect the reward distribution.
6. **Transaction Confirmation:** The Blockchain Network broadcasts a confirmation of the successful transaction execution back to the interacting parties, including the Smart Contracts.
7. **Event Emission:** The Smart Contracts emit a specific event (e.g., "RewardClaimed") signaling the successful completion of the reward claim on the blockchain.
8. **Off-chain Data Update:** The Backend API (or a dedicated Off-chain Worker monitoring blockchain events) detects the "RewardClaimed" event and proceeds to update the off-chain Database with the user's updated reward balance and a record of the transaction for historical purposes.
9. **Confirmation to User:** The Backend API sends a confirmation message back to the User Application, informing the user that their reward claim was successful.

## 6. Deployment Architecture

While precise deployment details are subject to the specific infrastructure choices, a typical deployment architecture for Koin would likely involve:

*   **Cloud-Based Infrastructure:** The Backend API, Database, and Off-chain Workers are commonly hosted on a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, leveraging their scalability and reliability.
*   **Containerization with Docker:** Docker is likely used to package the Backend API and Off-chain Workers into containers, ensuring consistent execution environments across different deployments.
*   **Container Orchestration with Kubernetes:** Kubernetes may be employed to manage and orchestrate the containerized components, providing features like automated scaling, self-healing, and simplified deployments.
*   **Blockchain Node Connectivity:** The Backend API requires a connection to a Blockchain node to interact with the Smart Contracts. This could involve running a self-hosted node or utilizing a third-party blockchain infrastructure provider.
*   **Robust Security Measures:** Implementing comprehensive security measures, including secure network configurations, strict access controls, and data encryption (both in transit and at rest), is crucial for protecting the deployed components and sensitive data.
*   **Environment Separation:** Utilizing separate environments for development, staging, and production to ensure code quality and minimize risks associated with deploying new changes.
