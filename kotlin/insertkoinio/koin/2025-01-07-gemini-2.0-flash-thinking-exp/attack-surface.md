# Attack Surface Analysis for insertkoinio/koin

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Dynamic Module Loading](./attack_surfaces/insecure_dynamic_module_loading.md)

* **Description:** The application loads Koin modules dynamically based on external input (e.g., configuration files, user input).
    * **How Koin Contributes:** Koin's ability to load modules at runtime, often through `koin.loadModules(moduleList)`, can be exploited if the `moduleList` source is untrusted or improperly validated.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies a configuration file to include a malicious Koin module that, upon loading, executes arbitrary code or compromises application data.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breach, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Avoid dynamic module loading based on external, untrusted sources.
            * If dynamic loading is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization for module paths or definitions.
            * Use a predefined, trusted set of modules.
            * Implement strong access controls for configuration files or data sources used for module loading.

## Attack Surface: [Property Injection from Untrusted Sources](./attack_surfaces/property_injection_from_untrusted_sources.md)

* **Description:** Koin injects property values from external sources (e.g., configuration files, environment variables) without proper validation.
    * **How Koin Contributes:** Koin's `koin.getProperty()` or similar mechanisms retrieve values that are then injected into application components. If the source of these properties is compromised, malicious values can be injected.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies an environment variable that is used by Koin to set the URL for an API endpoint. This could redirect the application to a malicious server.
    * **Impact:** High. Data manipulation, redirection to malicious sites, credential theft (if injected into authentication parameters).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Validate and sanitize all property values retrieved by Koin before using them.
            * Use secure storage mechanisms for sensitive configuration data.
            * Implement access controls to restrict who can modify configuration files or environment variables.
        * **Users (System Administrators):**
            * Secure the environment where the application runs, ensuring that configuration files and environment variables are protected from unauthorized access.

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Inclusion of Test Modules in Production](./attack_surfaces/accidental_inclusion_of_test_modules_in_production.md)

* **Description:** Koin modules intended for testing purposes (e.g., mocking dependencies, providing test data) are inadvertently included in the production build.
    * **How Koin Contributes:** Koin loads all registered modules. If test modules are not properly excluded from the production build process, they will be active in the production environment.
    * **Example:** A test module provides a mock implementation of an authentication service that bypasses security checks. If this module is active in production, authentication can be trivially bypassed.
    * **Impact:** Critical to High. Security bypasses, data breaches, unauthorized access.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the functionality of the test module).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Implement clear separation between test and production code and Koin modules.
            * Use build configurations or dependency management tools to ensure that test-specific Koin modules are excluded from production builds.
            * Employ code review processes to identify and prevent the accidental inclusion of test code in production.
