# Threat Model Analysis for insertkoinio/koin

## Threat: [Malicious Module Injection](./threats/malicious_module_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control over the source of Koin module definitions and injects a malicious Koin module. This module defines and provides malicious dependencies or overrides existing ones with compromised implementations. The malicious code within these modules is executed by Koin during application startup or dependency resolution.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application, arbitrary code execution, data breaches, manipulation of application logic.

**Affected Koin Component:** Module Definition DSL, `koin.loadModules()`, `koin.module()`

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the source of Koin module definitions with strict access controls and integrity checks.
*   Implement code signing or similar mechanisms to verify the authenticity of module files.
*   Perform regular security audits of the build and deployment processes to prevent unauthorized module modifications.

## Threat: [Re-definition of Core Dependencies with Malicious Implementations](./threats/re-definition_of_core_dependencies_with_malicious_implementations.md)

**Description:** An attacker introduces a Koin module that redefines core application dependencies with malicious implementations. Koin's dependency resolution mechanism might prioritize this attacker-controlled module, effectively replacing legitimate dependencies.

**Impact:**  Significant changes in application behavior, data manipulation, unauthorized actions performed by the malicious dependency, potential for complete application takeover.

**Affected Koin Component:** Module Definition DSL, `single()`, `factory()`, dependency resolution mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strict control over the dependencies used in the application, including Koin modules.
*   Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability analysis specifically for custom Koin modules.
*   Consider architectural patterns that limit the ability to easily override core dependencies within Koin.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution within Koin Context](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_within_koin_context.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the classloader or dependency resolution process used by Koin, causing it to inject a malicious dependency instead of the intended one. This could occur in complex setups or with custom Koin loaders.

**Impact:** Execution of malicious code, data manipulation, privilege escalation, unexpected application behavior.

**Affected Koin Component:** Dependency resolution mechanism, custom Koin loaders (if used).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Maintain a clear and well-defined classpath to prevent unintended dependency resolution.
*   Avoid overly complex or dynamic classloading.
*   If using custom Koin loaders, ensure their secure implementation and rigorously audit their code.

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Information in Modules](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_modules.md)

**Description:** Developers unintentionally embed sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) directly within Koin module definitions. This information is then accessible through the application's Koin container.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access to external services or internal systems.

**Affected Koin Component:** Module Definition DSL, `single()`, `factory()`, `get()` when used to retrieve configuration values.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly avoid hardcoding sensitive information in Koin modules.
*   Utilize secure configuration management practices, such as environment variables or dedicated secret management tools, and inject these securely into dependencies.
*   Implement regular scanning of code and configuration for accidentally exposed secrets.
