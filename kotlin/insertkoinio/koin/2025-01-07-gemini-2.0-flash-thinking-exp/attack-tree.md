## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Dependency Definitions -> Inject Malicious Configuration -> Exploit External Configuration Loading -> Supply Malicious Configuration File/Source](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_dependency_definitions_-_inject_malicious_configuration_-_exploit_external_configuration__d6c64069.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application loads Koin modules and dependency bindings from external configuration files or sources (e.g., properties files, YAML, environment variables). An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how these configurations are loaded, parsed, or accessed.

**Mechanism:** The attacker crafts a malicious configuration file or manipulates an existing configuration source. This malicious configuration overrides legitimate dependency definitions with attacker-controlled components or introduces new, malicious bindings.

**Impact:** Successful injection of malicious configuration allows the attacker to substitute core application components with their own, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, or unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Dependency Resolution -> Override Dependencies with Malicious Implementations -> Exploit Custom Factory Functions -> Provide Malicious Factory Logic](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_dependency_resolution_-_override_dependencies_with_malicious_implementations_-_exploit_cu_52eb5e63.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses custom factory functions within Koin modules to create instances of dependencies. An attacker targets these custom factory functions.

**Mechanism:** The attacker finds a way to influence the logic within a custom factory function. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the factory function's code, manipulating data used by the factory, or even replacing the factory function itself if the module loading process is insecure.

**Impact:** By controlling the factory function, the attacker can ensure that a malicious implementation of a dependency is instantiated and injected whenever that dependency is requested, leading to various forms of compromise depending on the dependency's role.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Injection Mechanisms -> Constructor Injection Abuse -> Inject Malicious Dependencies into Constructors -> Force Koin to inject attacker-controlled objects](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_injection_mechanisms_-_constructor_injection_abuse_-_inject_malicious_dependencie_49567227.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses constructor injection, where dependencies are provided as arguments to a class's constructor. An attacker aims to control the dependencies being injected.

**Mechanism:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how Koin resolves dependencies for constructor injection. This could involve manipulating qualifiers, providing malicious implementations that match the required type, or exploiting weaknesses in Koin's resolution logic.

**Impact:** If the attacker can control the dependencies injected into a class's constructor, they can inject malicious objects that execute code upon instantiation, manipulate the state of the object, or otherwise compromise its functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Scopes and Lifecycles -> Singleton Abuse -> Modify Shared Singleton Instance -> Gain access to a mutable singleton and alter its state](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_scopes_and_lifecycles_-_singleton_abuse_-_modify_shared_singleton_instance_-_gain_access_to_a__57c1d6d5.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses singleton scope for certain dependencies, meaning only one instance of the dependency exists throughout the application's lifecycle. An attacker targets these singleton instances, particularly if they are mutable.

**Mechanism:** The attacker finds a way to obtain a reference to a mutable singleton instance. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that expose the singleton, or by manipulating Koin's internal state if vulnerabilities exist. Once they have a reference, they modify the singleton's state.

**Impact:** Modifying the state of a singleton can have widespread consequences, affecting any part of the application that relies on that singleton. This could lead to data corruption, unauthorized actions, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** As described in the High-Risk Path.

**Impact:**  Gaining control over dependency definitions allows for the complete subversion of the application's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Koin Modules](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_koin_modules.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises the application's build process or dependency management system to introduce a malicious Koin module.

**Mechanism:** The attacker adds a malicious Koin module to the project's dependencies (e.g., via Maven, Gradle). When the application starts, Koin loads this malicious module, which can contain arbitrary code that executes during initialization.

**Impact:** This grants the attacker immediate and significant control over the application, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or complete takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Custom Factory Functions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_custom_factory_functions.md)

**Attack Vector:** As described in the High-Risk Path.

**Impact:**  Compromising a factory function allows the attacker to substitute legitimate dependencies with malicious ones, leading to various forms of compromise depending on the dependency's role.

## Attack Tree Path: [Constructor Injection Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/constructor_injection_abuse.md)

**Attack Vector:** As described in the High-Risk Path.

**Impact:** Successful abuse of constructor injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code during object creation, potentially gaining control early in the application's lifecycle.

## Attack Tree Path: [Singleton Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/singleton_abuse.md)

**Attack Vector:** As described in the High-Risk Path.

**Impact:**  Compromising a singleton instance can have widespread and critical consequences, affecting the entire application's behavior and potentially exposing sensitive data or functionality.
