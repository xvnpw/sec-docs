## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Definition Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_definition_manipulation.md)

High-Risk Path: Exploit Dependency Definition Manipulation
  Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Module
    Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Module Loading Mechanism
      Description: An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how the application loads Koin modules. This could involve loading modules from untrusted external sources without proper validation.
    Critical Node: Leverage Unvalidated External Configuration Source
      Description: Specifically, the application loads module definitions from an external source (e.g., a remote URL) without verifying its integrity or authenticity, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious module.
    Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerability in Custom Module Factory
      Description: If the application uses custom module factories, an attacker could exploit flaws in the factory's logic (e.g., insecure deserialization, arbitrary class loading) to inject malicious definitions.
  Attack Vector: Override Legitimate Dependency with Malicious Implementation
    Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Configuration Overriding
      Description: The application allows overriding existing Koin definitions through configuration mechanisms that are not properly secured.
    Critical Node: Leverage Unprotected Configuration Files
      Description: Configuration files used to override Koin definitions are accessible and modifiable by an attacker, allowing them to replace legitimate dependencies with malicious ones.
    Critical Node: Abuse Features Allowing Runtime Definition Changes
      Description: If Koin or custom application code allows for dynamic modification of dependency definitions at runtime, an attacker could exploit this to swap out legitimate components with malicious ones.
    Critical Node: Exploit Reflection Vulnerabilities
      Description: If Koin or its extensions use reflection in an insecure manner (e.g., loading classes based on untrusted input), an attacker could leverage this to instantiate malicious objects as dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Property Resolution Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_property_resolution_vulnerabilities.md)

High-Risk Path: Exploit Property Resolution Vulnerabilities
  Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Property Value
    Critical Node: Exploit Environment Variable Injection
      Description: The application uses environment variables for configuration that are resolved by Koin. An attacker who can control the environment where the application runs can inject malicious values, potentially leading to code execution or other vulnerabilities depending on how these properties are used.
