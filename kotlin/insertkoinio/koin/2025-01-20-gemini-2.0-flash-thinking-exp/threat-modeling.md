# Threat Model Analysis for insertkoinio/koin

## Threat: [Malicious Module Injection](./threats/malicious_module_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Module Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject a crafted Koin module into the application's dependency graph. This could happen if the application dynamically loads modules from untrusted sources (e.g., external files, network locations) without proper validation. The attacker's module could define malicious dependencies or override existing ones with compromised implementations.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution if the malicious module instantiates and executes harmful code. Data exfiltration if the module accesses and transmits sensitive information. Denial of service if the module disrupts critical application functionality.
    *   **Affected Koin Component:** `module` definition, module loading mechanisms (if dynamically used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamic loading of Koin modules from untrusted sources.
        *   If dynamic loading is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of the module source.
        *   Use code signing or other integrity checks to verify the authenticity of loaded modules.
        *   Implement robust access controls to prevent unauthorized modification of module sources.

## Threat: [Dependency Overriding with Malicious Implementations](./threats/dependency_overriding_with_malicious_implementations.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Overriding with Malicious Implementations
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the application's configuration or dependency resolution logic to override legitimate dependencies with malicious ones. This could involve manipulating configuration files, environment variables, or exploiting weaknesses in custom dependency factories. The malicious implementation would then be used by the application, potentially leading to unintended and harmful actions.
    *   **Impact:** Data manipulation as the malicious dependency could alter data before it's processed or stored. Privilege escalation if the replaced dependency controls access to sensitive resources. Bypassing security checks if the overridden dependency was responsible for enforcing security policies.
    *   **Affected Koin Component:** Dependency resolution (`inject`, `get`), `module` definitions (especially if allowing overrides), custom factories/providers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls on configuration files and environment variables.
        *   Avoid allowing external or untrusted sources to directly influence dependency bindings.
        *   If dependency overriding is a required feature, implement strict authorization and validation mechanisms for overrides.
        *   Use Koin's features for testing and verifying dependency configurations.

## Threat: [Configuration Vulnerabilities in Custom Factories/Providers](./threats/configuration_vulnerabilities_in_custom_factoriesproviders.md)

*   **Threat:** Configuration Vulnerabilities in Custom Factories/Providers
    *   **Description:** If the application uses custom factories or providers for dependency creation, vulnerabilities in their implementation could be exploited. For example, a factory might fetch data from an external source without proper validation, leading to injection attacks, or it might create dependencies with insecure default configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability in the custom factory/provider. Could range from information disclosure and data manipulation to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Koin Component:** Custom factories and providers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom factory and provider implementations for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Apply secure coding practices when developing custom factories, including input validation and sanitization.
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in custom factories.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to resources within custom factories.
