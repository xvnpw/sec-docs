# Attack Surface Analysis for insertkoinio/koin

## Attack Surface: [Injection of Malicious Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/injection_of_malicious_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can influence the dependencies injected by Koin, replacing legitimate components with malicious ones.
    *   **How Koin Contributes:** Koin's core functionality is dependency injection. If the configuration of Koin modules allows for external influence on which implementations are chosen (e.g., through unvalidated configuration files or environment variables), it creates an entry point for malicious dependencies.
    *   **Example:** An application uses Koin to inject an `HttpClient` implementation. If the class name for `HttpClient` is read from an environment variable that isn't sanitized, an attacker could set this variable to point to a malicious class that intercepts network requests.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service, or any other malicious activity the injected dependency is programmed to perform.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict Dependency Resolution: Avoid allowing external, untrusted sources to directly dictate which classes Koin instantiates.
        *   Use Sealed Modules:  Define Koin modules in a way that limits the ability to override or replace definitions from outside the module.
        *   Code Reviews: Carefully review Koin module configurations to ensure no external influence points are unintentionally created.
        *   Input Validation: If external configuration is used to influence dependency selection, rigorously validate and sanitize the input.

## Attack Surface: [Overriding Dependencies with Malicious Implementations](./attack_surfaces/overriding_dependencies_with_malicious_implementations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages Koin's overriding capabilities to replace legitimate dependencies with malicious versions.
    *   **How Koin Contributes:** Koin explicitly allows for overriding existing definitions. If this mechanism is not properly controlled or secured, it can be abused.
    *   **Example:** In a testing environment, a developer might override a database access component with a mock. If this overriding mechanism is inadvertently left enabled or exposed in production (e.g., through a debug flag), an attacker could override it with a malicious component that steals data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, manipulation of application logic, privilege escalation, or other malicious actions depending on the overridden dependency's role.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Overriding Mechanisms:  Ensure that dependency overriding is strictly controlled and not accessible or enabled in production environments.
        *   Environment-Specific Configurations: Use different Koin configurations for development, testing, and production environments, ensuring overriding is disabled or tightly controlled in production.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege:  Limit the ability to override dependencies to only necessary components and contexts.

## Attack Surface: [Injection of Malicious Properties](./attack_surfaces/injection_of_malicious_properties.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious values into properties managed by Koin, altering application behavior or configuration.
    *   **How Koin Contributes:** Koin allows for injecting properties from various sources (files, environment variables, etc.). If these sources are not secured or validated, they become attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** An application reads a database connection string from a property file loaded by Koin. If an attacker can modify this file, they could inject a malicious connection string pointing to an attacker-controlled database to steal data.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized access, denial of service (by misconfiguring resources), or other unintended application behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Property Sources: Protect the sources from which Koin loads properties. Use appropriate file system permissions, secure environment variable management, etc.
        *   Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize all property values loaded by Koin, especially those used in critical operations or security-sensitive contexts.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege for Property Access: Limit which components can access and modify sensitive properties.
        *   Consider Secrets Management Solutions: For sensitive information like API keys or database credentials, use dedicated secrets management solutions instead of relying solely on Koin's property mechanism.

## Attack Surface: [Misuse of Scopes Leading to Unintended Data Sharing](./attack_surfaces/misuse_of_scopes_leading_to_unintended_data_sharing.md)

*   **Description:** Improperly defined or managed Koin scopes can lead to dependencies being shared across unintended parts of the application, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing unauthorized modifications.
    *   **How Koin Contributes:** Koin's scope management feature controls the lifecycle and sharing of dependencies. Misconfiguration can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A user-specific data service is incorrectly scoped as a singleton. This means the same instance is shared across all user requests, potentially leading to one user accessing another user's data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, or corruption of data due to unintended shared state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Careful Scope Definition:  Thoroughly understand Koin's scoping mechanisms and carefully define scopes based on the intended lifecycle and sharing requirements of dependencies.
        *   Code Reviews Focusing on Scopes: Pay close attention to scope definitions during code reviews to identify potential misconfigurations.
        *   Testing Scope Boundaries: Implement tests to verify that dependencies are correctly scoped and isolated as intended.
