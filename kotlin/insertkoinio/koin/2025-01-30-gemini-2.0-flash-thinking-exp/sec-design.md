# BUSINESS POSTURE

Koin is a pragmatic and lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers. It simplifies dependency management in Kotlin applications across various platforms like Android, Kotlin Multiplatform, and backend systems.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Simplify dependency injection for Kotlin developers.
- Provide a lightweight and performant dependency injection solution.
- Support multiple Kotlin platforms (Android, KMP, backend).
- Offer an easy-to-use API and developer experience.
- Maintain an active and supportive community.

Business Risks:
- Complexity in usage leading to developer frustration and lower adoption.
- Performance issues impacting application responsiveness.
- Security vulnerabilities in the framework itself or its usage patterns.
- Lack of community support and maintenance leading to project stagnation.
- Incompatibility with future Kotlin versions or platform changes.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features for repository access control and vulnerability scanning. Implemented in: GitHub repository settings and GitHub Security features.
- security control: Open-source project with community review, promoting transparency and external security audits. Implemented in: Open GitHub repository and community contributions.
- security control: Unit and integration tests to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. Implemented in: Project's test suite within the GitHub repository.
- security control: Dependency management using Gradle and Maven Central, relying on their security measures for dependency integrity. Implemented in: build.gradle.kts files and Maven Central repository.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Koin.
- accepted risk: Security misconfigurations by users when implementing Koin in their applications.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, especially before major releases.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using Koin to prevent common security misconfigurations.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable for Koin framework itself, as it's a library. Authentication is the responsibility of applications using Koin.
- Authorization: Not applicable for Koin framework itself. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using Koin.
- Input Validation: Koin framework itself does not directly handle external user input. Input validation is the responsibility of applications using Koin, especially when injecting user-provided data. However, Koin should validate its internal configurations and APIs to prevent unexpected behavior.
- Cryptography: Koin framework itself does not require cryptography. Cryptographic operations are the responsibility of applications using Koin if needed.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Providing a reliable and secure dependency injection framework to the Kotlin community.
- Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Koin library in Maven Central.
- Ensuring the Koin library is free from vulnerabilities that could be exploited in applications using it.

Data Sensitivity:
- Koin project itself does not directly handle sensitive user data.
- However, vulnerabilities in Koin could indirectly lead to security breaches in applications that use it, potentially exposing sensitive data managed by those applications.
- Sensitivity level: Low for Koin project data itself, but High indirect impact on applications using Koin.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the specific security concerns of the organization using this design document for threat modeling?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements that Koin needs to adhere to?
- What is the risk appetite of the organization regarding open-source dependencies?
- Are there any existing security tools or processes already in place that Koin development should integrate with?
- What are the performance requirements for Koin, and how might security measures impact performance?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a secure and reliable dependency injection framework for the Kotlin community. Security is a significant concern, but ease of use and performance are also important.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The project currently relies on basic open-source security practices. There is a willingness to improve security posture by implementing recommended security controls.
- DESIGN: The design is modular and follows standard software development practices. The deployment context is application-dependent, and the build process can be enhanced with more security checks.
