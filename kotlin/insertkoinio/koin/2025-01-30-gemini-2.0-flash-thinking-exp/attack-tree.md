## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Koin Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_koin_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the configuration of Koin to inject malicious components or manipulate application behavior. This path is high-risk because successful configuration compromise can lead to immediate and significant control over the application.

    *   **1.1. Manipulate Koin Module Loading [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Focuses on altering the process by which Koin modules are loaded into the application. By injecting malicious modules, attackers can introduce arbitrary code into the application's execution flow.
            *   **1.1.2. Inject Malicious Koin Module [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** The core action of inserting a module containing malicious code into the application's Koin context. This is a critical node because it directly achieves code execution within the application.
                    *   **1.1.2.1. Modify Configuration Files (if modules loaded via config) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** If Koin modules are loaded from configuration files, attackers attempt to modify these files to include references to their malicious modules.

                                *   **Attack Vector:**  Gaining unauthorized access to the configuration files is the prerequisite for modifying them. This can be achieved through various means like exploiting file system vulnerabilities, compromising configuration servers, or using stolen credentials.
                    *   **1.1.2.2. Exploit Dynamic Module Loading Vulnerabilities (if applicable):**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses dynamic module loading mechanisms (e.g., loading modules based on user input or external data), attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in this logic to inject malicious module paths or content.
                            *   **1.1.2.2.1. Identify & Exploit Injection Points in Module Loading Logic [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                                *   **Attack Vector:**  Identifying and exploiting injection points in the code responsible for dynamic module loading. This requires understanding the application's code and finding weaknesses in how it handles external input related to module loading.

                        *   **Attack Vector:** If properties are loaded from files, attackers attempt to modify these files to inject malicious property values.
                            *   **1.2.2.1.1. Access and Modify Property Files (e.g., file system access) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                                *   **Attack Vector:**  Similar to configuration files, gaining unauthorized access to property files is necessary to modify them.

                        *   **Attack Vector:** If properties are sourced from environment variables, attackers try to control the environment in which the application runs to set malicious environment variables. This could involve server access or container escape.

                *   **Attack Vector:** The act of injecting crafted property values designed to cause harm. This is a critical node as it represents the successful exploitation of property injection.
                    *   **1.2.3.1. Inject values that lead to code execution, data leakage, or denial of service [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** The ultimate goal of property injection attacks. Malicious properties can be crafted to:
                            *   **1.2.3.1.2. Inject malicious code snippets (if properties are used in unsafe ways) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                                *   **Attack Vector:** If the application unsafely uses property values in contexts where code execution is possible (e.g., using properties in scripting engines or `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`), attackers can inject code snippets as property values.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Vulnerabilities in Custom Factories/Providers (if used) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__vulnerabilities_in_custom_factoriesproviders__if_used___high-risk_path_.md)

                        *   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting any type of security vulnerability present in the custom factory/provider code, such as logic flaws, resource leaks, or insecure handling of sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Koin Library Vulnerabilities (Less Likely, but Possible):](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_koin_library_vulnerabilities__less_likely__but_possible_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities within the Koin library itself. While less likely than application-specific vulnerabilities, it's still a potential high-impact path if a vulnerability exists.
    *   **3.3. Exploit Identified Vulnerability (if found) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
