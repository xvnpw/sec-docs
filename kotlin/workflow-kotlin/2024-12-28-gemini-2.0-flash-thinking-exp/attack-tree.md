            *   **Critical Node: Supply Malicious Input to Vulnerable Worker**

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Workflow Definition Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to inject malicious code or logic directly into the workflow definitions. This can be achieved by compromising the source where definitions are stored (e.g., Git repository, database) or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how definitions are processed (e.g., deserialization flaws). Successful exploitation grants the attacker significant control over the application's behavior as defined by the workflows.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable)**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If workflow definitions are serialized and then deserialized, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is a critical node because it directly leads to Remote Code Execution, the highest severity impact.
*   **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Authorization Flaws in Workflow Management**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  If the application has weak or missing authorization controls for managing workflows, attackers can gain unauthorized access to modify existing workflow definitions. This allows them to alter the intended behavior of the application, potentially injecting malicious steps or changing critical logic.
*   **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Workflow State Management Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the mechanisms used to store and manage the state of running workflows. If this state is stored insecurely or without proper access controls, attackers can directly access and modify it. This can lead to manipulation of workflow progress, data corruption, and bypassing security checks.
*   **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Insecure State Persistence**
    *   **Attack Vector:** This focuses on the specific vulnerability of storing workflow state in an insecure manner. This includes storing state unencrypted, making it easily accessible, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the serialization/deserialization of state objects, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution or state manipulation.
*   **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Workflow Execution Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to interfere with the execution of workflows to inject malicious logic or disrupt the intended flow. This often involves targeting the `Worker` components, which are the units of work within a workflow.
*   **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Inject Malicious Logic via Workers**
    *   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on injecting malicious code or commands through the `Worker` components. This can be achieved by supplying malicious input that a vulnerable worker processes without proper sanitization, leading to code execution within the worker's context.
*   **Critical Node: Supply Malicious Input to Vulnerable Worker**
    *   **Attack Vector:** This is a direct attack vector where the attacker provides crafted input to a `Worker` that exploits a vulnerability (e.g., command injection, SQL injection). Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands or queries, leading to significant or critical impact depending on the worker's function.
