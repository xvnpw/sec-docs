# Threat Model Analysis for detekt/detekt

## Threat: [Introduction of Malicious Custom Detekt Rules](./threats/introduction_of_malicious_custom_detekt_rules.md)

**Threat:** Introduction of Malicious Custom Detekt Rules
    * **Description:** A developer with malicious intent or insufficient security awareness creates a custom Detekt rule that introduces vulnerabilities. This could involve rules that execute arbitrary code during analysis, intentionally ignore security flaws, or introduce backdoors during the build process.
    * **Impact:** Direct execution of malicious code during the build process, potentially compromising the build environment or injecting malicious code into the application. Masking of existing vulnerabilities.
    * **Affected Component:** `detekt-api` for rule creation, `detekt-core` for rule execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement a rigorous review process for all custom Detekt rules before they are integrated.
        * Enforce coding standards and security best practices for writing custom rules.
        * Consider sandboxing or isolating the execution environment for custom rules.
        * Limit the ability to create and modify custom rules to trusted developers.

## Threat: [Exploitation of False Negatives Leading to Undetected Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_false_negatives_leading_to_undetected_vulnerabilities.md)

**Threat:** Exploitation of False Negatives Leading to Undetected Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** Detekt fails to identify actual security vulnerabilities or code quality issues present in the codebase. This could be due to limitations in the existing rules, edge cases in the code, or vulnerabilities in Detekt itself. An attacker relies on these blind spots to introduce or maintain vulnerable code.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerable code into production, increasing the risk of security breaches, data leaks, or other software defects.
    * **Affected Component:** `detekt-core` analysis engine, specific rules that fail to detect vulnerabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Combine Detekt with other static analysis tools and security testing methods (SAST, DAST).
        * Regularly update Detekt to benefit from new rules and improved detection capabilities.
        * Encourage developers to manually review code for potential issues beyond automated analysis.
        * Participate in the Detekt community to report and address missed detections.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Detekt Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_detekt_dependencies.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Detekt Dependencies
    * **Description:** Detekt relies on various third-party libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit them if they can influence the build process or the environment where Detekt is executed. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other security breaches within the build infrastructure.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of the build environment. Potential for supply chain attacks if malicious code is injected through vulnerable dependencies.
    * **Affected Component:**  Dependencies managed by the build system (e.g., Gradle dependencies).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Detekt to benefit from updates to its dependencies.
        * Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify known vulnerabilities in Detekt's dependencies.
        * Evaluate the security posture of Detekt's dependencies before adoption.

## Threat: [Tampering with Detekt Executable or Runtime Environment](./threats/tampering_with_detekt_executable_or_runtime_environment.md)

**Threat:** Tampering with Detekt Executable or Runtime Environment
    * **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges on the build server could replace the legitimate Detekt executable with a modified version. This modified version could skip security checks, introduce malicious code into the build process, or exfiltrate sensitive information.
    * **Impact:** Bypassing of security analysis, leading to the introduction of vulnerable code. Potential for malware injection into the application build. Compromise of the build environment.
    * **Affected Component:** `detekt-cli` executable and its runtime environment.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong access controls for the build environment and the directories containing the Detekt executable.
        * Use checksum verification or digital signatures to ensure the integrity of the Detekt executable.
        * Run Detekt in a controlled and isolated environment with limited privileges.
        * Regularly monitor the build environment for unauthorized changes.
