## Attack Tree Path: [Influence Detekt's Analysis](./attack_tree_paths/influence_detekt's_analysis.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to manipulate how Detekt analyzes the codebase. This can be achieved by injecting malicious rules or exploiting vulnerabilities in Detekt's parsing logic.

**Impact:** Successfully influencing Detekt's analysis can lead to critical vulnerabilities being missed during the static analysis phase, allowing them to be deployed into the application. It can also involve intentionally misdirecting developers by flagging benign code, masking real issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Rules](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_rules.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker successfully introduces malicious rules into Detekt's configuration. These rules can be designed to ignore specific types of vulnerabilities, effectively silencing warnings for dangerous code patterns.

**Impact:** This directly undermines the security benefits of using Detekt, as critical vulnerabilities will not be reported, leading to a false sense of security and the potential deployment of vulnerable code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerability.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits weaknesses in how Detekt's configuration is managed, such as insecure file permissions or lack of access controls. This allows them to gain write access to the configuration files and directly inject malicious rules.

**Impact:** This provides a direct and effective way for attackers to manipulate Detekt's behavior, leading to the consequences described in the "Inject Malicious Rules" attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Detekt Reports](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_detekt_reports.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains the ability to modify the reports generated by Detekt. This can involve removing entries for actual vulnerabilities or altering the severity of findings to make them appear less critical.

**Impact:** Even if Detekt correctly identifies vulnerabilities, manipulating the reports can prevent developers from addressing them, leading to the deployment of vulnerable code. It can also create a false impression of security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Write Access to Report Output Directory](./attack_tree_paths/gain_write_access_to_report_output_directory.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits misconfigurations or vulnerabilities to gain write access to the directory where Detekt stores its reports. This direct access allows them to modify the report files.

**Impact:** This is the direct mechanism for achieving the "Manipulate Detekt Reports" attack vector, allowing attackers to hide or alter vulnerability findings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Detekt's Execution Environment](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_detekt's_execution_environment.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker targets the environment where Detekt is executed, typically the build or CI/CD pipeline. This can involve exploiting vulnerabilities in Detekt's dependencies or, less likely, compromising the Detekt distribution itself.

**Impact:** Successful compromise of the execution environment can lead to arbitrary code execution during the build process. This allows the attacker to inject malicious code directly into the application artifacts, potentially creating backdoors or other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies and exploits known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries that Detekt depends on. This can be done if the dependencies are outdated or if there are unpatched security flaws.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the Detekt execution environment, potentially allowing the attacker to compromise the build process and inject malicious code into the application.
