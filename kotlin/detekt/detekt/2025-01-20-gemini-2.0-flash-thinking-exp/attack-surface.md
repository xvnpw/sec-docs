# Attack Surface Analysis for detekt/detekt

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Manipulation (.detekt.yml)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_manipulation___detekt_yml_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers modify the Detekt configuration file to influence analysis behavior.
    * **How Detekt Contributes:** Detekt relies on this file to define rules, thresholds, and plugin configurations.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies `.detekt.yml` to disable security-related rules, allowing vulnerable code to pass unnoticed.
    * **Impact:**  Reduced code quality, introduction of vulnerabilities, potential bypass of security checks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access controls on the `.detekt.yml` file.
        * Store the configuration file in version control and track changes.
        * Use code review processes for modifications to the configuration file.
        * Consider using a centralized configuration management system if applicable.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Custom Rules/Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_custom_rulesplugins.md)

* **Description:** Attackers introduce or modify custom Detekt rules or plugins to execute malicious code during analysis.
    * **How Detekt Contributes:** Detekt allows the use of custom rules and plugins to extend its functionality.
    * **Example:** A malicious plugin is introduced that, when executed by Detekt, exfiltrates sensitive data from the project or compromises the build environment.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, compromise of the build environment, supply chain attack.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly vet and review all custom rules and plugins before integration.
        * Implement code signing for custom rules/plugins to verify their origin and integrity.
        * Run Detekt in a sandboxed or isolated environment, especially when using custom rules.
        * Limit the permissions of the user/process running Detekt.
