## Deep Analysis: Malicious Custom Rule Injection for Code Execution in Detekt

This analysis provides a deep dive into the "Malicious Custom Rule Injection for Code Execution" threat identified for our application using Detekt. We will explore the attack vectors, potential impact, technical details, and expand on the proposed mitigation strategies.

**1. Deeper Understanding of the Threat:**

The core of this threat lies in the inherent trust placed in custom Detekt rules. Detekt, by design, allows users to extend its functionality by creating custom rules written in Kotlin. These rules are essentially executable code that runs within the Detekt environment during code analysis. If an attacker can inject malicious code disguised as a legitimate rule, they can leverage Detekt's execution context to perform arbitrary actions.

**Key Assumptions for the Attack to Succeed:**

* **Ability to Introduce Malicious Rules:** The attacker must find a way to add or modify custom rule definitions that Detekt will load and execute.
* **Detekt Execution Environment:** The malicious rule will be executed within the environment where Detekt is run. This is typically the build server or a developer's local machine.
* **Permissions of the Execution Environment:** The effectiveness of the attack depends on the permissions granted to the user or process running Detekt.

**2. Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

The provided description outlines potential attack vectors, which we can further elaborate on:

* **Compromised Rule Repository:**
    * **Direct Access:**  If the custom rule definitions are stored in a version control system (like Git) and the attacker gains unauthorized access (e.g., through compromised credentials, stolen SSH keys, or vulnerabilities in the repository platform), they can directly modify or add malicious rules.
    * **Supply Chain Attack:** If the custom rules are sourced from an external or internal repository that is itself compromised, the attacker can inject malicious rules at the source.
* **Social Engineering Targeting a Developer:**
    * **Phishing:** An attacker could trick a developer into adding a malicious rule to the project, perhaps by disguising it as a legitimate bug fix or improvement.
    * **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate access to the codebase or rule repository could intentionally introduce malicious rules.
* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the Rule Deployment Process:**
    * **Insecure Deployment Pipelines:** If the process for deploying custom rules involves insecure steps (e.g., lacking proper validation, relying on insecure protocols), an attacker might be able to inject malicious rules during the deployment phase.
    * **Lack of Access Control:** Insufficient restrictions on who can deploy or manage custom rules can create opportunities for unauthorized modification.

**3. Capabilities of Malicious Custom Rules:**

The power of this attack lies in the fact that the malicious rule is essentially arbitrary Kotlin code executed within the Detekt environment. This grants significant capabilities to the attacker:

* **File System Manipulation:**
    * **Reading Sensitive Files:** Accessing configuration files, environment variables, source code, build artifacts, and other sensitive data.
    * **Modifying Files:** Altering source code, build scripts, configuration files, potentially introducing backdoors or sabotaging the application.
    * **Deleting Files:** Disrupting the build process or removing evidence of the attack.
* **Network Communication:**
    * **Exfiltrating Data:** Sending sensitive information (secrets, code, build logs) to an external server controlled by the attacker.
    * **Downloading Malware:** Fetching and executing additional malicious payloads.
    * **Communicating with a Command and Control (C&C) Server:** Establishing a persistent connection for further instructions and data exfiltration.
* **System Operations:**
    * **Executing System Commands:** Running arbitrary commands on the build server or developer machine, potentially escalating privileges or installing malware.
    * **Forking Processes:** Creating new processes to perform malicious activities in the background.
    * **Resource Exhaustion:**  Consuming system resources to cause denial of service.
* **Build Process Manipulation:**
    * **Introducing Backdoors:** Modifying the build output to include malicious code in the final application.
    * **Sabotaging Builds:** Causing builds to fail or produce incorrect artifacts.
* **Credential Harvesting:**
    * **Accessing Environment Variables:** Extracting API keys, database credentials, and other secrets stored in environment variables.
    * **Keylogging:** Monitoring keystrokes if the rule runs on a developer's machine.

**4. Technical Deep Dive into Affected Detekt Component:**

The threat description correctly identifies the **Rule Engine (`detekt-core`)** as the affected component. Let's elaborate on the specific mechanisms involved:

* **Rule Loading:** Detekt uses `RuleSetProvider` implementations to discover and load rule sets. Custom rules are typically loaded through a custom `RuleSetProvider` that points to the location of the custom rule definitions (e.g., JAR file, Kotlin source files).
* **Rule Instantiation:**  When Detekt runs, it instantiates the `Rule` classes defined within the loaded rule sets. This involves executing the constructor of the `Rule` class.
* **Rule Execution:** The core of the vulnerability lies in the `visit` methods of the `Rule` classes. These methods are invoked by Detekt's visitor pattern as it traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the code being analyzed. Malicious code can be embedded within these `visit` methods or within helper functions called by them.
* **Execution Context:** The malicious rule executes within the same JVM process as Detekt. This grants it access to the same resources and permissions as the Detekt process.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a malicious custom rule with the following simplified (and dangerous) code:

```kotlin
package com.example.malicious

import io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.api.CodeSmell
import io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.api.Debt
import io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.api.Entity
import io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.api.Issue
import io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.api.Rule
import io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.api.Severity
import java.io.File

class MaliciousRule : Rule() {
    override val issue = Issue(
        javaClass.simpleName,
        Severity.CRITICAL,
        "This rule is malicious",
        Debt.FIVE_MINS
    )

    override fun visit(element: KtElement) {
        super.visit(element)
        // Malicious code execution
        try {
            val sensitiveFile = File("/etc/passwd") // Example: Accessing a sensitive file
            println("Contents of sensitive file: ${sensitiveFile.readText()}")
            // Potentially exfiltrate this data
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            println("Error accessing file: ${e.message}")
        }
    }
}
```

When Detekt loads and executes this rule, the `visit` method will be called for each `KtElement` in the codebase, and the malicious code within the `try` block will be executed.

**5. Expanded Impact Assessment:**

Beyond the initial description, the impact of this threat can be far-reaching:

* **Supply Chain Compromise:** If malicious rules are injected into a shared rule repository used by multiple projects or organizations, the impact can cascade, affecting numerous downstream systems and applications.
* **Loss of Trust:**  A successful attack can erode trust in the development process, build pipeline, and the application itself.
* **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:** Data breaches resulting from exfiltrated secrets can lead to significant legal and regulatory penalties (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
* **Reputational Damage:**  News of a successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization.
* **Operational Disruption:**  Malicious rules can disrupt the build process, leading to delays in releases and impacting business operations.
* **Financial Losses:**  Remediation efforts, legal fees, and potential fines can result in significant financial losses.

**6. Enhanced Mitigation Strategies (Defense in Depth):**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point. We can expand on them and implement a defense-in-depth approach:

* **Strict Access Control and Authorization:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users who need to create or modify custom rules.
