# Threat Model Analysis for detekt/detekt

## Threat: [Malicious Custom Rule Injection for Code Execution](./threats/malicious_custom_rule_injection_for_code_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Custom Rule Injection for Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker with the ability to add or modify custom Detekt rules introduces a malicious rule. This rule, when executed by Detekt during analysis, could perform arbitrary code execution on the build server or developer's machine. This could involve exfiltrating secrets, installing malware, or disrupting the build process. The attacker might achieve this by compromising the rule repository, through social engineering targeting a developer, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the rule deployment process.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the build environment or developer workstation, leading to potential data breaches, supply chain attacks, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Detekt Component:** Rule Engine (`detekt-core` module, specifically the rule loading and execution mechanism).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control who can create and modify custom Detekt rules.
        *   Implement a mandatory code review process for all custom rules before they are integrated.
        *   Utilize static analysis or sandboxing techniques to inspect custom rule code for malicious behavior before deployment.
        *   Enforce signed custom rule packages if supported by the tooling.
        *   Regularly audit and review existing custom rules.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Detekt Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_detekt_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Detekt Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Detekt relies on various third-party libraries. An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies if they are not kept up-to-date. This could be achieved by targeting the build environment where Detekt is executed or potentially even through crafted code that triggers vulnerable code paths within the dependencies *during the Detekt analysis process itself*.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. This could compromise the build environment or developer machines *during Detekt's execution*.
    *   **Affected Detekt Component:** Dependency Management (impacts various modules depending on the vulnerable dependency).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Detekt to the latest version, which includes updated dependencies.
        *   Use dependency management tools that automatically identify and alert on known vulnerabilities (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk).
        *   Implement a process for promptly addressing identified dependency vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track Detekt's dependencies.

## Threat: [Tampering with Analysis Results to Hide Vulnerabilities](./threats/tampering_with_analysis_results_to_hide_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Tampering with Analysis Results to Hide Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the build environment could intercept and modify the Detekt reports *generated by Detekt* before they are reviewed. They could remove findings related to vulnerabilities, falsely mark issues as resolved, or even inject misleading information directly into the report files.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of vulnerable code due to a false sense of security stemming from manipulated Detekt output. This could lead to security breaches and other negative consequences.
    *   **Affected Detekt Component:** Report Generation (`detekt-report-sarif`, `detekt-report-txt`, etc., depending on the report format).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement integrity checks on Detekt reports to detect tampering.
        *   Secure the storage and transmission of Detekt reports.
        *   Use digital signatures for reports to ensure authenticity.
        *   Automate the process of reviewing and acting on Detekt findings to reduce manual intervention points where tampering could occur.
