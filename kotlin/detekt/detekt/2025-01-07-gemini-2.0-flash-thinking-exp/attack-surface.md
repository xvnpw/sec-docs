# Attack Surface Analysis for detekt/detekt

## Attack Surface: [Dependency on Malicious External Artifacts](./attack_surfaces/dependency_on_malicious_external_artifacts.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Dependency on Malicious External Artifacts
    - **Description:**  The application relies on downloading Detekt artifacts (JAR files, plugins) from external sources. If these sources are compromised, malicious code could be introduced.
    - **How Detekt Contributes:** Detekt is typically added as a build dependency, requiring the build system to fetch artifacts from repositories like Maven Central or GitHub releases. This creates a point of interaction with external sources for obtaining the Detekt tool itself.
    - **Example:** An attacker compromises the Maven Central repository and replaces the legitimate Detekt JAR with a malicious one. Developers unknowingly download and integrate this compromised version of Detekt.
    - **Impact:**  Code execution within the build process, potentially leading to compromised build artifacts, data exfiltration, or supply chain attacks affecting the final application.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Verify checksums and signatures of downloaded Detekt artifacts.
        - Use dependency management tools with vulnerability scanning capabilities to detect known issues in Detekt's dependencies.
        - Pin specific versions of Detekt dependencies to avoid unexpected updates with malicious content.
        - Consider using a private or mirrored repository for dependencies to control the source.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Custom Rule Sets or Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_custom_rule_sets_or_plugins.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Malicious Custom Rule Sets or Plugins
    - **Description:** Detekt allows for the use of custom rule sets and plugins, which are essentially code executed during the analysis process. Maliciously crafted rules or plugins could introduce vulnerabilities.
    - **How Detekt Contributes:** Detekt's extensibility allows developers to add custom logic in the form of rules and plugins that are executed by the Detekt engine.
    - **Example:** A developer includes a custom Detekt rule that, during analysis, reads sensitive environment variables and sends them to an external server.
    - **Impact:** Information disclosure, arbitrary code execution within the analysis environment, denial of service by consuming excessive resources during analysis.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Thoroughly review and audit all custom rule sets and plugins before integration.
        - Restrict the sources from which custom rules and plugins are loaded.
        - Implement code signing for custom rules and plugins to verify their authenticity.
        - Run Detekt with custom rules in an isolated environment with limited permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection through Detekt CLI](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_through_detekt_cli.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Command Injection through Detekt CLI
    - **Description:** If Detekt is executed via a command-line interface and the arguments are constructed from untrusted sources, it could be vulnerable to command injection.
    - **How Detekt Contributes:** Detekt provides a CLI for execution, which can be integrated into build scripts or other automation, making it susceptible if the command construction is flawed.
    - **Example:** A build script dynamically constructs the Detekt command using user-provided input. A malicious user provides input containing shell commands, which are then executed by the system when Detekt is invoked.
    - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running Detekt.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Avoid constructing Detekt command-line arguments from untrusted sources.
        - Sanitize and validate any input used to build the command.
        - Use parameterized commands or safer methods for passing arguments if possible.
