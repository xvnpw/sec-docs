## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Detekt Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_detekt_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success at this node means the application is compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Detekt's Code Analysis Logic (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_detekt's_code_analysis_logic__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This path focuses on subverting Detekt's primary function: code analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Code Snippets Designed to Evade Detection](./attack_tree_paths/craft_code_snippets_designed_to_evade_detection.md)

    *   Attackers craft malicious code that is not flagged by Detekt's rules.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize Obfuscation Techniques Not Recognized by Rules (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_obfuscation_techniques_not_recognized_by_rules__high-risk_path_.md)

        *   Employing code obfuscation methods that Detekt's rules don't recognize to hide malicious intent.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Subtle Logic Flaws Undetected by Current Rules (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_subtle_logic_flaws_undetected_by_current_rules__high-risk_path_.md)

        *   Exploiting subtle programming errors or vulnerabilities that Detekt's current rules are not designed to catch.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Detekt's Configuration (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_detekt's_configuration__critical_node__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This critical node represents a significant weakness. If the attacker can control Detekt's configuration, they can effectively disable its security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Detekt Configuration Files (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_detekt_configuration_files__high-risk_path_start_.md)

    *   Directly altering Detekt's configuration files to weaken or disable security rules.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Configuration Files (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_configuration_files__critical_node_.md)

        *   A critical prerequisite for configuration manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Machine (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_machine__high-risk_path_.md)

            *   Gaining access to a developer's machine to access configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CI/CD Pipeline Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cicd_pipeline_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

            *   Exploiting weaknesses in the CI/CD pipeline to access or modify configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Version Control System with Write Permissions (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/access_version_control_system_with_write_permissions__high-risk_path_.md)

            *   Obtaining write access to the version control system to modify configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disable Critical Security Rules (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/disable_critical_security_rules__high-risk_path_.md)

    *   Directly disabling rules that would detect vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within Detekt Itself (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_detekt_itself__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in Detekt's own code or its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Detekt's Process (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce__in_detekt's_process__high-risk_path_start_.md)

    *   The most severe outcome of exploiting Detekt's vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Detekt's Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_detekt's_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

        *   Leveraging known vulnerabilities in the libraries Detekt uses.

*   The CI/CD pipeline is a critical node. Compromising it allows attackers to bypass Detekt or inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Detekt Execution in CI/CD (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_detekt_execution_in_cicd__high-risk_path_start_.md)

    *   Directly interfering with how Detekt is run in the CI/CD pipeline.
