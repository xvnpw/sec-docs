**Configuration Files Targeted:**

The specific configuration files an attacker would target depend on the project and the technologies used, but common examples include:

* **`.env` files:** Often used to store environment variables, including sensitive credentials.
* **`application.properties` or `application.yml`:** Configuration files for Spring Boot applications, potentially containing database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.
* **`config.json` or similar:** General configuration files for various applications and services.
* **Cloud provider configuration files:** Files containing credentials for AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.
* **`.gitattributes` or `.gitignore`:** While not directly containing secrets, these files can reveal information about the project structure and potential areas of interest.
* **`detekt` configuration files (`detekt.yml`):**  As mentioned earlier, these files can be manipulated to weaken security analysis.
* **SSH keys (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`):** Providing access to remote servers and systems.

**Impact of Accessing Configuration Files:**

Gaining access to these configuration files can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breaches:**  Exposure of sensitive customer data or internal information.
* **Financial Loss:**  Due to data breaches, system downtime, or legal repercussions.
