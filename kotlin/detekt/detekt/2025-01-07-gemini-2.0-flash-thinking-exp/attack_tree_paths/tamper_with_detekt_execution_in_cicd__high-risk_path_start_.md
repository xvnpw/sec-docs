This is an excellent starting point for analyzing the "Tamper with Detekt Execution in CI/CD" attack path. Let's break down this high-risk path further, exploring the potential attack vectors, impacts, and mitigation strategies in more detail.

**Attack Tree Expansion:**

Under the umbrella of "Directly interfering with how Detekt is run in the CI/CD pipeline," we can identify several key sub-objectives and their corresponding attack vectors:

**1. Modifying the CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct Code Commit:** An attacker with write access to the repository directly modifies the CI/CD configuration files (e.g., `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/*.yml`, Jenkinsfile). This could be due to compromised developer credentials, insider threats, or insufficient access controls.
    *   **Pull Request Manipulation:** A malicious actor submits a pull request that subtly alters the CI/CD configuration, hoping it will be merged without thorough review. This could involve adding steps to skip Detekt, modify its configuration, or inject malicious code before or after Detekt execution.
    *   **Exploiting CI/CD System Vulnerabilities:**  Leveraging vulnerabilities in the CI/CD platform itself (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) to modify pipeline configurations.
    *   **Compromising CI/CD Secrets:** If CI/CD secrets are poorly managed and exposed, attackers might use them to authenticate and modify pipeline configurations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Skipping Detekt Execution:**  Completely removing the Detekt execution step from the pipeline.
    *   **Altering Detekt Configuration:**  Changing the path to the Detekt configuration file, disabling crucial rules, or modifying severity thresholds to ignore critical findings.
    *   **Introducing Malicious Scripts:**  Injecting additional commands before or after Detekt execution to compromise the build environment, exfiltrate data, or introduce backdoors.
    *   **Changing Detekt Version:**  Downgrading to a vulnerable version of Detekt or using a custom, backdoored version.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement robust access control mechanisms for the repository and CI/CD platform. Employ multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   **Code Review for CI/CD Changes:** Treat changes to CI/CD configurations with the same scrutiny as application code. Implement mandatory code reviews for all CI/CD modifications.
    *   **Pipeline as Code Security Scanning:**  Use tools to scan CI/CD configuration files for security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
    *   **Secret Management:** Securely manage CI/CD secrets using dedicated secret management tools and avoid storing them directly in configuration files.
    *   **Version Control and Audit Logs:**  Maintain a clear history of changes to CI/CD configurations and regularly audit these logs for suspicious activity.

**2. Tampering with the Detekt Configuration File:**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct Code Commit:** Similar to modifying CI/CD configuration, gaining unauthorized access to modify the `detekt.yml` or similar configuration file.
    *   **Pull Request Manipulation:**  Subtly altering the configuration file within a malicious pull request. This could involve disabling specific rules or excluding directories containing malicious code.
    *   **Exploiting Build Process Vulnerabilities:** If the build process involves dynamic generation or manipulation of the Detekt configuration, vulnerabilities in this process could be exploited.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Disabling Critical Rules:**  Turning off rules that detect specific types of vulnerabilities, allowing malicious code to pass undetected.
    *   **Lowering Severity Thresholds:**  Changing the severity level required for a rule to trigger, effectively silencing important warnings.
    *   **Excluding Files or Directories:**  Preventing Detekt from analyzing specific parts of the codebase where malicious code might be hidden.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Control access to the repository and the Detekt configuration file.
    *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review any changes to the Detekt configuration file.
    *   **Configuration as Code and Version Control:** Treat the Detekt configuration file as code and manage it under version control.
    *   **Centralized Configuration Management:**  Consider using a centralized configuration management system to manage and distribute Detekt configurations.

**3. Manipulating the Detekt Execution Environment:**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromising CI/CD Agent:** If the CI/CD agent running Detekt is compromised, attackers can directly manipulate the environment.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks on Dependencies:**  Injecting malicious code into dependencies used by the Detekt execution process (e.g., build tools, scripting languages).
    *   **Docker Image Tampering:** If Detekt is run within a Docker container, attackers might try to use a compromised base image or inject malicious layers.
    *   **Environment Variable Manipulation:**  Altering environment variables that influence Detekt's behavior or introduce vulnerabilities into the execution process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injecting Malicious Code during Execution:**  Running malicious scripts alongside Detekt to compromise the build environment or exfiltrate data.
    *   **Interfering with Detekt's Analysis:**  Modifying files or dependencies during the analysis process to hide vulnerabilities.
    *   **Spoofing Results:**  Manipulating the output of Detekt to falsely indicate a clean bill of health.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure CI/CD Agents:**  Harden and regularly update CI/CD agents. Implement security monitoring and intrusion detection on these systems.
    *   **Dependency Management and Security Scanning:**  Use dependency management tools and regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Employ Software Composition Analysis (SCA).
    *   **Secure Docker Image Management:**  Use trusted base images, regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities, and implement a secure image registry.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for CI/CD Jobs:**  Limit the permissions of the CI/CD job running Detekt.

**4. Replacing the Detekt Executable:**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromising the Build Environment:**  If the build environment is compromised, attackers could replace the legitimate Detekt executable with a malicious version.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**  Intercepting the download of the Detekt executable during the build process and replacing it with a malicious one.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks on Detekt Distribution:**  While less likely for a mature project like Detekt, vulnerabilities in the distribution channels could be exploited.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Running Malicious Code:**  The replaced executable could perform arbitrary malicious actions.
    *   **Falsifying Results:**  The malicious Detekt could always report a clean analysis, regardless of the code's quality.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Checksum Verification:**  Verify the integrity of the downloaded Detekt executable using checksums (e.g., SHA-256).
    *   **Secure Download Sources:**  Ensure Detekt is downloaded from trusted and secure sources (official releases, verified repositories).
    *   **Code Signing:**  Verify the digital signature of the Detekt executable to ensure its authenticity.

**Risk Assessment:**

This attack path is considered **HIGH-RISK** due to the following factors:

*   **High Impact:** Successful tampering can lead to the introduction of vulnerabilities, bypass security checks, and potentially compromise the entire application.
*   **Moderate to High Feasibility:** Depending on the security posture of the CI/CD pipeline and the organization's security awareness, these attacks can be feasible. Insider threats or compromised credentials significantly increase the likelihood.

**Detection and Response:**

Beyond mitigation, it's crucial to have mechanisms in place to detect and respond to these attacks:

*   **Monitoring CI/CD Activity:**  Monitor CI/CD logs for unusual activity, such as unexpected changes to configurations or the execution of unfamiliar commands.
*   **Alerting on Configuration Changes:**  Implement alerts for any modifications to CI/CD configuration files or the Detekt configuration.
*   **Regular Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the CI/CD pipeline and its configurations.
*   **Baseline Comparisons:**  Establish baselines for CI/CD configurations and Detekt execution behavior to detect deviations.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Have a clear incident response plan in place to address potential compromises of the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Where possible, utilize immutable infrastructure for CI/CD agents to prevent persistent modifications.
*   **Security Scanning of Build Artifacts:**  Even if Detekt is tampered with, subsequent security scans of the built artifacts (e.g., container images, binaries) might still detect introduced vulnerabilities.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

Based on this analysis, here are actionable recommendations for the development team:

*   **Prioritize CI/CD Security:** Treat the CI/CD pipeline as a critical security component and allocate resources to secure it.
*   **Implement Strong Access Controls:** Enforce the principle of least privilege for all users and services interacting with the CI/CD pipeline and repository.
