# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Goal: Improve Kotlin code quality and maintainability.
  - Goal: Reduce technical debt in Kotlin projects.
  - Goal: Enforce coding standards and best practices across development teams.
  - Goal: Automate code review processes to identify potential issues early in the development lifecycle.
  - Priority:  Provide a reliable and accurate static analysis tool for Kotlin.
  - Priority:  Ensure ease of integration into existing development workflows and CI/CD pipelines.
  - Priority:  Maintain and expand the rule set to cover a wide range of code quality concerns.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk: False positives or negatives in code analysis could erode developer trust and adoption.
  - Risk: Performance issues in code analysis could slow down development workflows.
  - Risk: Lack of updates or maintenance could lead to the tool becoming outdated and less effective.
  - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the detekt tool itself could be exploited if integrated into sensitive environments.
  - Risk: Incompatibility with future Kotlin versions or build tools could disrupt user workflows.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions to the detekt project (described in GitHub repository contribution guidelines).
  - security control: Static analysis of detekt codebase using detekt itself and other tools (implicitly practiced as a code quality tool).
  - security control: Dependency management using Gradle and dependency scanning tools (implicitly practiced as standard software development practice).
  - security control: Distribution via Maven Central and GitHub Releases (standard software distribution channels).
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Open source nature implies public code repository and community contributions, which requires trust in contributors and maintainers.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for bug fixes and feature enhancements may lead to slower response times compared to commercial products.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning of dependencies to identify known vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Introduce signed releases to ensure integrity and authenticity of distributed artifacts.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits of the detekt codebase, potentially including penetration testing.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for detekt as a static analysis tool. It does not require user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for detekt as a static analysis tool. It does not manage user permissions.
  - Input Validation:
    - security requirement: Detekt needs to robustly parse and validate Kotlin code to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior due to malformed input.
    - security requirement: Configuration files (e.g., `detekt.yml`) should be validated to prevent misconfiguration issues.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable for the core functionality of detekt. However, if future features involve secure communication or data storage, cryptography requirements will need to be considered.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Protecting the quality and maintainability of Kotlin codebases that use detekt.
  - Ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the detekt tool itself, as it is relied upon for code quality checks.
  - Maintaining developer trust in the tool and its findings.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of detekt itself: High sensitivity. Integrity and confidentiality are important to prevent malicious modifications and maintain trust in the tool.
  - Configuration files for detekt: Medium sensitivity. Misconfiguration could lead to bypass of security checks or unexpected behavior.
  - Analysis reports generated by detekt: Low to Medium sensitivity. Reports may contain information about code structure and potential vulnerabilities, but are generally not considered highly confidential.
  - Dependencies used by detekt: Medium sensitivity. Vulnerabilities in dependencies could impact the security of detekt itself.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported in detekt or its dependencies?
  - Are there any plans to implement signed releases for detekt artifacts?
  - Is there a formal security audit process for the detekt project?
  - What is the policy for managing and reviewing custom rules contributed by the community?
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a valuable open-source tool for the Kotlin community to improve code quality.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is considered important, but the project relies on community contributions and standard open-source security practices. There is no dedicated security team or budget.
  - DESIGN: The architecture is relatively simple, centered around a CLI application and a core analysis engine. Deployment is primarily focused on local developer usage and CI/CD integration. Build process is automated using GitHub Actions and standard Gradle practices.
