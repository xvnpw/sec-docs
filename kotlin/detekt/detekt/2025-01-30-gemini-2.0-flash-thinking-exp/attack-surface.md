# Attack Surface Analysis for detekt/detekt

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (High to Critical)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__high_to_critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Detekt relies on external libraries. Critical or high severity vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the build environment.
    *   **Detekt Contribution:** Detekt's functionality depends on numerous Kotlin and Java libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries directly expose detekt and the build environment.
    *   **Example:** A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability is discovered in a logging library used by detekt. If exploited, an attacker could gain complete control of the build server by crafting malicious log messages processed by detekt during analysis.
    *   **Impact:**  **Critical:** Full compromise of the build environment, including potential for unauthorized access, data breaches, and manipulation of build artifacts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if RCE is possible), **High** (if significant information disclosure or denial of service is possible).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Proactive Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline to continuously monitor detekt's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Immediate Patching:**  Establish a process for rapidly updating detekt and its dependencies when high or critical severity vulnerabilities are identified and patches are released. Prioritize security updates.
        *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Kotlin, Java, and common libraries used in the ecosystem to proactively identify potential risks.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Rule Vulnerabilities - Resource Exhaustion & Information Disclosure (High)](./attack_surfaces/custom_rule_vulnerabilities_-_resource_exhaustion_&_information_disclosure__high_.md)

*   **Description:**  Poorly written custom rules can introduce high severity vulnerabilities like resource exhaustion or unintentional information disclosure.
    *   **Detekt Contribution:** Detekt executes custom rules written in Kotlin. Insecure custom rules directly impact detekt's operation and can harm the build process.
    *   **Example:** A custom detekt rule is created with an algorithm that has exponential time complexity or contains an infinite loop. When analyzing a large codebase, this rule causes detekt to consume excessive CPU and memory, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) of the build server and significantly delaying development. Another example: a custom rule might inadvertently log or report sensitive data (like API keys found in code) in a way that is easily accessible in build logs.
    *   **Impact:**  **High:** Denial of service of the build pipeline, significant performance degradation, potential for unintentional exposure of sensitive information in build logs or reports.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (due to potential for DoS and sensitive information leakage).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Security Code Review for Custom Rules:** Implement a strict code review process specifically focused on security and performance for all custom detekt rules before deployment. Reviews should be performed by security-aware developers.
        *   **Performance Testing of Custom Rules:**  Thoroughly test custom rules in a staging or testing environment with representative codebases to identify and mitigate performance bottlenecks and resource consumption issues before deploying to production build pipelines.
        *   **Secure Coding Training for Rule Developers:** Provide developers creating custom detekt rules with training on secure coding practices, focusing on common pitfalls like resource exhaustion, logging sensitive data, and avoiding potential code injection vulnerabilities (even if less likely in detekt's context).
        *   **Rule Sandboxing/Resource Limits (Feature Request for detekt):**  Ideally, detekt itself would provide mechanisms to sandbox custom rules or enforce resource limits to prevent malicious or poorly written rules from causing widespread damage. (This is a potential feature enhancement for detekt itself).

## Attack Surface: [Input Vulnerabilities - Code Parsing Engine Exploits (High - Theoretical, but potentially Critical)](./attack_surfaces/input_vulnerabilities_-_code_parsing_engine_exploits__high_-_theoretical__but_potentially_critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  While less likely in a mature tool, critical vulnerabilities in detekt's Kotlin code parsing engine could theoretically be exploited by maliciously crafted Kotlin code to achieve severe impacts.
    *   **Detekt Contribution:** Detekt's core function is parsing and analyzing Kotlin code.  Critical bugs in the parser are directly exploitable through code input.
    *   **Example:**  A highly sophisticated attacker discovers a buffer overflow or memory corruption vulnerability in detekt's Kotlin parser. They craft a specific Kotlin code snippet that, when analyzed by detekt, triggers this vulnerability, allowing for arbitrary code execution on the build server.  While the probability is low for a mature tool, the impact is critical if it occurs.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical:** Remote code execution on the build server, potentially leading to full system compromise. **High:** Denial of service if crafted input reliably crashes the parser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (Impact is critical, probability is lower but not negligible for complex software).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Continuous Updates of detekt:**  Prioritize keeping detekt updated to the latest versions to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the parsing engine.
        *   **Security Audits of detekt Codebase (For detekt maintainers/advanced users):**  For organizations with extremely high security requirements, consider contributing to or commissioning security audits of the detekt codebase itself, focusing on the parsing engine and core analysis logic.
        *   **Input Fuzzing (For detekt maintainers/advanced users):**  Employ fuzzing techniques to continuously test detekt's parser with a wide range of potentially malicious Kotlin code inputs to proactively uncover and address vulnerabilities. This is primarily a mitigation for detekt developers but understanding this practice increases user awareness of potential risks.
