## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Detekt Itself [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_detekt_itself__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on directly exploiting weaknesses within the Detekt tool itself. This is a high-risk area because vulnerabilities in security tools can have significant consequences, potentially undermining the security posture they are intended to improve.
*   **Critical Node:** "Exploit Vulnerabilities in Detekt Itself" is a critical node as it represents a direct compromise of the security tool, leading to potentially widespread impact.
*   **Sub-Vectors within this path (Focusing on High-Risk):**
    *   **Exploit Detekt Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Detekt relies on external dependencies. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them. This is a high-risk path because successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the build server or developer machines where Detekt is run.
        *   **Critical Node:** "Exploit Detekt Dependency Vulnerabilities" is critical because dependencies are a common source of vulnerabilities and can have a wide attack surface.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   Identify vulnerable dependency used by Detekt (e.g., using CVE databases, dependency scanning tools).
            *   Exploit the known vulnerability in the identified dependency.
            *   **Result:** Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) on build server or developer machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Detekt Configuration to Weaken Security [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_detekt_configuration_to_weaken_security__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path involves attackers gaining access to and modifying Detekt's configuration to reduce its effectiveness in detecting security vulnerabilities. This is high-risk because it silently weakens security controls, potentially leading to undetected vulnerabilities in the application.
*   **Critical Node:** "Manipulate Detekt Configuration to Weaken Security" is critical as configuration is the central control mechanism for Detekt's behavior.
*   **Sub-Vectors within this path (Focusing on High-Risk):**
    *   **Disable Critical Security Rules [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers disable specific Detekt rules that are designed to detect security vulnerabilities (e.g., rules for injection flaws, hardcoded secrets, etc.). This directly prevents Detekt from identifying these types of issues.
        *   **High Risk Path:** Disabling security rules is a direct and impactful way to weaken security.
        *   **Critical Node:** "Gain access to Detekt configuration file (detekt.yml or similar)" is critical because access to the configuration file is a prerequisite for manipulating the configuration.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   Gain unauthorized access to the Detekt configuration file (e.g., `detekt.yml`).
            *   Comment out or remove configurations for critical security rules.
            *   **Result:** Detekt fails to detect security vulnerabilities, leading to vulnerable code being deployed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Custom Detekt Rules (If Applicable) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_custom_detekt_rules__if_applicable___critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses custom Detekt rules, this introduces a new attack surface. Attackers can inject malicious code into these custom rules, leading to arbitrary code execution when Detekt runs. This is high-risk due to the potential for direct and severe compromise of the build environment or developer machines.
*   **Critical Node:** "Supply Malicious Custom Detekt Rules (If Applicable)" is critical because custom rules, if not properly secured, can become a significant vulnerability.
*   **Sub-Vectors within this path (Focusing on High-Risk):**
    *   **Application uses custom Detekt rules [CRITICAL NODE] AND Gain ability to contribute or modify custom rule codebase [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If an attacker can gain access to the codebase where custom Detekt rules are defined and maintained, they can inject malicious code into these rules.
        *   **Critical Nodes:** Both "Application uses custom Detekt rules" and "Gain ability to contribute or modify custom rule codebase" are critical. The first because it establishes the attack surface, and the second because it represents the point of compromise.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   Application uses custom Detekt rules.
            *   Attacker gains unauthorized ability to contribute to or modify the custom rule codebase (e.g., through compromised accounts, insecure access controls).
            *   Attacker introduces malicious code within a custom Detekt rule.
            *   **Result:** Arbitrary code execution on build server or developer machine when Detekt runs the malicious rule.
    *   **Application uses untrusted/external custom Detekt rules [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the application includes custom Detekt rules from untrusted external sources (e.g., public repositories without proper review), these rules might already contain malicious code.
        *   **Critical Node:** "Application uses untrusted/external custom Detekt rules" is critical because it represents a direct intake of potentially malicious code into the security tool's execution environment.
        *   **High Risk Path:** Using untrusted external code is inherently a high-risk practice.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   Application includes custom Detekt rules from an untrusted source.
            *   Malicious code is already embedded within the untrusted custom rule.
            *   **Result:** Arbitrary code execution on build server or developer machine when Detekt runs the malicious rule.
