# Threat Model Analysis for detekt/detekt

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Crafted Kotlin Files](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_crafted_kotlin_files.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Kotlin file specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities in detekt's Kotlin parsing engine. When detekt analyzes this file, the attacker could achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by triggering arbitrary code execution within the detekt process, or cause a critical Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing detekt in a way that disrupts critical workflows. The vulnerability lies in detekt's ability to securely process potentially malicious Kotlin syntax.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **RCE:** Full control over the build server or developer machine running detekt, allowing for complete system compromise, data exfiltration, supply chain attacks, or further malicious activities within the development environment.
        *   **Critical DoS:**  Complete disruption of the CI/CD pipeline or local development analysis, halting development and release processes.
    *   **Affected Detekt Component:** Code Parsing Module
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediately update detekt:**  Prioritize updating detekt to the latest version as security patches are released to address parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   **Strict input validation (if feasible):**  While challenging for code analysis tools, explore if any pre-processing or validation of Kotlin files *before* they reach detekt's core parsing can be implemented to detect and reject suspicious files.
        *   **Sandboxing and Isolation:** Run detekt within a heavily sandboxed environment with extremely limited privileges to contain any potential RCE. Use containerization or virtual machines to isolate detekt execution.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Limits:** Implement strict resource limits (CPU, memory) for detekt processes to mitigate potential DoS attacks that aim to exhaust resources.

## Threat: [Configuration Injection leading to Arbitrary File Write/Read](./threats/configuration_injection_leading_to_arbitrary_file_writeread.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious `detekt.yml` or other configuration file to exploit vulnerabilities in detekt's configuration parsing logic. By manipulating configuration settings, the attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary file write or read access on the system where detekt is running. This could be achieved through path traversal vulnerabilities or insecure handling of file paths within the configuration parsing component of detekt.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Arbitrary File Write:**  Allows an attacker to overwrite critical system files, inject malicious code into build artifacts, or modify application configurations, leading to complete system compromise or supply chain attacks.
        *   **Arbitrary File Read:** Enables an attacker to read sensitive files, including secrets, private keys, or source code, leading to confidentiality breaches and potential further exploitation.
    *   **Affected Detekt Component:** Configuration Parsing Module
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Configuration Source:**  Ensure detekt configuration files are sourced only from trusted locations and are protected from unauthorized modification. Use version control and access controls to manage `detekt.yml` files.
        *   **Secure Configuration Parsing:**  Report any suspected path traversal or file handling vulnerabilities in detekt's configuration parsing to the maintainers. Advocate for robust input validation and sanitization within the configuration parsing module.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run detekt with the minimum necessary file system permissions.  Avoid running detekt as root or with overly permissive user accounts.
        *   **Configuration File Validation:** Implement automated validation of detekt configuration files to detect and reject potentially malicious configurations before they are processed by detekt.
