### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Supply Malicious Custom Detekt Rules

**Attack Tree Path:** Supply Malicious Custom Detekt Rules (If Applicable) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Overall Risk Assessment:** **High**.  The ability to inject malicious code into custom Detekt rules represents a significant security risk. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the development and build environment, potentially compromising sensitive data, build pipelines, and developer machines. The "CRITICAL NODE" and "HIGH RISK PATH" designations are justified due to the direct and severe potential impact.

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: General Analysis

**Description:**  If an application utilizes custom Detekt rules to extend its code analysis capabilities, this introduces a new attack surface. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the process of developing, managing, and integrating these custom rules to inject malicious code. This malicious code, when executed by Detekt during analysis, can compromise the system.

**Vulnerabilities Exploited:**

* **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** Custom rules, if not properly vetted, can contain malicious code disguised as legitimate rule logic. Detekt itself might not have built-in mechanisms to validate the safety of custom rules.
* **Insufficient Access Control:** Weak access controls to the codebase where custom rules are stored and managed can allow unauthorized individuals to modify or introduce malicious rules.
* **Untrusted Sources:**  Using custom rules from untrusted external sources without thorough review introduces the risk of incorporating pre-existing malicious code.
* **Code Injection:**  The core vulnerability is code injection. By manipulating the custom rule definition, attackers can inject arbitrary code that will be executed by the Detekt engine.

**Threat Actors:**

* **Malicious Insiders:**  Developers or operators with legitimate access to the codebase who might intentionally introduce malicious rules.
* **External Attackers:**  Attackers who gain unauthorized access to the codebase through compromised accounts, vulnerabilities in version control systems, or supply chain attacks.
* **Compromised Dependencies:**  If custom rules rely on external dependencies, attackers could compromise these dependencies to inject malicious code indirectly.

**Impact:**

* **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The most critical impact is arbitrary code execution on the machine running Detekt. This could be a developer's workstation, a CI/CD server, or any other environment where Detekt is executed.
* **Data Exfiltration:**  Malicious code can be designed to steal sensitive data, such as source code, credentials, environment variables, or build artifacts.
* **System Compromise:**  Attackers can gain persistent access to compromised systems, install backdoors, or pivot to other systems within the network.
* **Supply Chain Contamination:**  If malicious rules are committed to a shared repository and used by other projects, the attack can propagate through the software supply chain.
* **Denial of Service:**  Malicious rules could be designed to consume excessive resources, leading to denial of service for the build process or developer machines.

#### 4.2. Sub-Vector 1: Application uses custom Detekt rules AND Gain ability to contribute or modify custom rule codebase [CRITICAL NODE] [CRITICAL NODE]

**Attack Vector:** This sub-vector focuses on the scenario where the application legitimately uses custom Detekt rules, and an attacker gains the ability to modify the codebase where these rules are defined and maintained.

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Application uses custom Detekt rules [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is critical because it establishes the attack surface. Without custom rules, this attack path is not applicable.
* **Gain ability to contribute or modify custom rule codebase [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is critical because it represents the point of compromise.  The attacker needs write access to inject malicious code.

**Attack Steps (Detailed):**

1. **Application uses custom Detekt rules:**  The target application is configured to use custom Detekt rules, extending the default analysis capabilities. This is a prerequisite for this attack sub-vector.
2. **Attacker gains unauthorized ability to contribute to or modify the custom rule codebase:** This is the core vulnerability exploitation step.  This could be achieved through:
    * **Compromised Developer Accounts:**  Phishing, credential stuffing, or malware could be used to compromise developer accounts with write access to the repository containing custom rules.
    * **Insecure Access Controls:**  Weak or misconfigured access controls on the repository (e.g., overly permissive permissions, lack of multi-factor authentication) could allow unauthorized access.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Version Control System:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the version control system (e.g., Git, GitLab, GitHub) to gain unauthorized write access.
    * **Social Engineering:**  Tricking authorized personnel into granting access or committing malicious code.
3. **Attacker introduces malicious code within a custom Detekt rule:** Once write access is gained, the attacker modifies an existing custom rule or creates a new one, embedding malicious code within its logic. This code could be disguised to appear as legitimate rule functionality.
    * **Example Malicious Code (Conceptual - Kotlin):**
    ```kotlin
    class MaliciousRule : Rule("MaliciousRule", Severity.CodeSmell, Debt.FIVE_MINS) {
        override val issue = Issue(
            "MaliciousRule",
            Severity.CodeSmell,
            "This rule is malicious."
        )

        override fun visitKtFile(file: KtFile) {
            super.visitKtFile(file)
            // Malicious Payload - Example: Exfiltrate environment variables
            val envVars = System.getenv().entries.joinToString("\n") { "${it.key}=${it.value}" }
            java.io.File("/tmp/env_vars.txt").writeText(envVars)
            // ... other malicious actions ...
        }
    }
    ```
4. **Detekt runs the malicious rule:** During the normal build process or code analysis workflow, Detekt executes the custom rules, including the malicious one.
5. **Result: Arbitrary code execution on build server or developer machine:** The malicious code embedded in the custom rule is executed with the privileges of the Detekt process. This leads to the impacts described in section 4.1 (Data Exfiltration, System Compromise, etc.).

**Mitigation Strategies for Sub-Vector 1:**

* **Strong Access Control:** Implement robust access control mechanisms for the repository containing custom Detekt rules. Use the principle of least privilege, and enforce multi-factor authentication for all developers with write access.
* **Code Review for Custom Rules:**  Mandatory code review process for all changes to custom Detekt rules, performed by security-conscious personnel. Focus on understanding the logic and potential side effects of the rules.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization (Rule Logic):**  While challenging, consider if there are ways to limit the capabilities of custom rules or sandbox their execution to prevent arbitrary system calls. (This might be a feature request for Detekt itself).
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the codebase and access controls related to custom Detekt rules.
* **Security Awareness Training:**  Train developers on the risks of malicious code injection through custom rules and best practices for secure development and code review.
* **Monitoring and Logging:**  Implement monitoring and logging of changes to custom rule files and unusual Detekt execution patterns.

#### 4.3. Sub-Vector 2: Application uses untrusted/external custom Detekt rules [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Attack Vector:** This sub-vector focuses on the scenario where the application includes custom Detekt rules from untrusted external sources, such as public repositories or third-party vendors without proper vetting.

**Critical Node:**

* **Application uses untrusted/external custom Detekt rules [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is critical because it directly introduces potentially malicious code into the execution environment.  The lack of trust in the source is the core vulnerability.

**High Risk Path:**  Using untrusted external code is inherently a high-risk practice in software development.  It bypasses internal security controls and relies on the security posture of an unknown entity.

**Attack Steps (Detailed):**

1. **Application includes custom Detekt rules from an untrusted source:** The application's build configuration or documentation instructs developers to include custom Detekt rules from an external source that is not thoroughly vetted or controlled by the organization. Examples include:
    * Public GitHub repositories without security audits.
    * Third-party rule sets from vendors with questionable security practices.
    * Downloading rules from untrusted websites or file sharing platforms.
2. **Malicious code is already embedded within the untrusted custom rule:** The untrusted source, whether intentionally malicious or compromised, contains custom Detekt rules that already include malicious code. This code could be designed to be stealthy and blend in with legitimate rule logic.
3. **Detekt runs the malicious rule:** When Detekt is executed, it loads and runs the custom rules from the untrusted source, including the malicious rule.
4. **Result: Arbitrary code execution on build server or developer machine:**  Similar to Sub-vector 1, the malicious code executes with Detekt's privileges, leading to the same potential impacts (Data Exfiltration, System Compromise, etc.).

**Mitigation Strategies for Sub-Vector 2:**

* **Avoid Untrusted External Rules:**  The strongest mitigation is to **strictly avoid using custom Detekt rules from untrusted external sources.**  If custom rules are necessary, prioritize developing them internally and maintaining full control over their codebase.
* **Thorough Vetting of External Rules (If Absolutely Necessary):** If using external rules is unavoidable, implement a rigorous vetting process:
    * **Source Code Review:**  Conduct a thorough manual code review of all external custom rules before integration. Focus on understanding the logic, dependencies, and potential side effects.
    * **Static and Dynamic Analysis:**  Apply static and dynamic analysis tools to the external rule code to detect potential vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.
    * **Reputation Assessment:**  Evaluate the reputation and security practices of the external source. Consider the history of the repository, the maintainers, and any reported security incidents.
    * **Sandboxed Environment Testing:**  Test external rules in a sandboxed environment before deploying them to production build environments.
* **Dependency Management:**  If external rules rely on dependencies, carefully manage and vet these dependencies as well. Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
* **"Vendor" Security Assessment:** If using rules from a third-party vendor, conduct a security assessment of the vendor's development and security practices.
