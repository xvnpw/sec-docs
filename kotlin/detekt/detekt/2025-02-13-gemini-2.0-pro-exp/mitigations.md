# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for detekt/detekt

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Rule Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_rule_updates.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Rule Updates

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule Regular Updates:** Establish a recurring schedule (e.g., monthly, bi-weekly) to check for updates to `detekt` and its associated rule sets. Integrate this into the existing dependency management process.
    2.  **Review Changelog:** Before updating, carefully review the `detekt` changelog.  Look for:
        *   New rules added (especially those related to security).
        *   Updates to existing rules (bug fixes, improved detection).
        *   Deprecated rules (and their replacements).
    3.  **Update Dependencies:** Use the project's dependency management tool (e.g., Gradle, Maven) to update `detekt` to the latest stable version.
    4.  **Test After Update:** After updating, run a full `detekt` analysis and review the results.  Ensure that the update hasn't introduced any unexpected issues or a significant increase in false positives.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **False Negatives (Missed Issues):** (Severity: Medium to High) - Outdated rules may not detect newer coding patterns or vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **False Negatives:** Significantly reduces the risk of missing newly discovered vulnerability patterns or coding best practices.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dependency updates are performed as part of the regular sprint cycle.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized changelog review process is not consistently followed.  Developers sometimes update without fully understanding the changes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive and Tuned Rule Set Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_and_tuned_rule_set_configuration.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Comprehensive and Tuned Rule Set Configuration

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Start with a Baseline:** Begin with a comprehensive rule set, such as the default `detekt` configuration or a well-regarded community configuration.
    2.  **Review Each Rule:** Carefully examine each rule in the configuration. Understand its purpose, the types of issues it detects, and any configurable parameters.
    3.  **Tune Parameters:** Adjust rule parameters (e.g., thresholds, allowed patterns) to reduce false positives without significantly increasing false negatives.  This often requires experimentation and iterative refinement.
    4.  **Document Exceptions:** If any rules are disabled, document the *precise* reason for disabling them. Include:
        *   The specific rule ID.
        *   The rationale (e.g., known false positive, conflict with a library, performance impact).
        *   Any alternative checks or mitigating factors.
        *   A plan for potential future re-enablement (e.g., "Re-evaluate when library X is updated").
    5.  **Version Control:** Store the `detekt` configuration file in the project's version control system (e.g., Git) to ensure consistency across the team and track changes.
    6.  **Regular Review:** Periodically (e.g., every few months) review the entire configuration, especially disabled rules and tuned parameters, to ensure it remains effective and relevant.
    7. **Baseline File:** Generate a baseline file to suppress existing issues. Regularly review and reduce the baseline.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **False Negatives (Missed Issues):** (Severity: Medium to High) - An overly permissive configuration or disabled rules can lead to missed issues.
    *   **False Positives (Noise):** (Severity: Low to Medium) - An overly strict configuration can generate excessive false positives, wasting developer time.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **False Negatives:** Reduces the risk of missing important code quality and potential security issues.
    *   **False Positives:** Improves developer productivity and reduces "alert fatigue" by minimizing noise.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A `detekt` configuration file is stored in the repository.
    *   Basic tuning of some rules has been performed.
    * Baseline file is generated.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal documentation of disabled rules and their rationale is incomplete.
    *   Regular, scheduled reviews of the entire configuration are not consistently performed.
    * Baseline file is not reviewed regularly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consistent Application via CI/CD and Pre-Commit Hooks](./mitigation_strategies/consistent_application_via_cicd_and_pre-commit_hooks.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Consistent Application via CI/CD and Pre-Commit Hooks

*   **Description:**
    1.  **CI/CD Integration:**
        *   Add a `detekt` task to the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
        *   Configure the task to run `detekt` on every code change (e.g., pull request, merge).
        *   Set up build failure conditions: Configure the pipeline to fail the build if `detekt` reports issues exceeding a defined severity threshold (e.g., fail on any "error" level issues).
    2.  **Pre-Commit Hooks:**
        *   Install a pre-commit hook framework (e.g., `pre-commit` for Git).
        *   Configure a `detekt` hook within the pre-commit framework. This will run `detekt` locally *before* a developer can commit code.
        *   Configure the hook to block commits if `detekt` reports issues.
    3.  **Consistent Configuration:** Ensure that both the CI/CD pipeline and the pre-commit hooks use the *same* `detekt` configuration file. This is crucial for consistency.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Inconsistent Application:** (Severity: Medium) - Ensures `detekt` is run consistently across the entire codebase and throughout the development lifecycle.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Inconsistent Application:** Significantly reduces the risk of code slipping through without being checked by `detekt`.  Enforces consistent code quality standards.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `detekt` is integrated into the GitLab CI pipeline.
    *   Builds fail if `detekt` reports errors.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Pre-commit hooks are not currently implemented.  Developers can bypass `detekt` checks locally.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Feedback Loop and False Positive Management](./mitigation_strategies/feedback_loop_and_false_positive_management.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Feedback Loop and False Positive Management

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Reporting Mechanism:** Establish a clear and easy way for developers to report false positives. This could be:
        *   A dedicated Slack channel.
        *   A specific issue tracker label.
        *   A simple form or spreadsheet.
    2.  **Triage Reports:** Designate a person or team responsible for reviewing reported false positives.
    3.  **Investigate and Tune:** For each reported false positive:
        *   Investigate the root cause.
        *   Determine if the rule configuration needs adjustment (e.g., tuning parameters, adding exceptions).
        *   Consider if the code itself could be refactored to avoid triggering the rule (while still maintaining good coding practices).
    4.  **Document Changes:** If the configuration is changed, document the reason for the change and the specific false positive that triggered it.
    5.  **Communicate Updates:** Inform developers about changes to the `detekt` configuration, especially those related to false positive reduction.
    6. **Regular Review:** Periodically review all reported false positives and the corresponding configuration changes to identify any patterns or recurring issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **False Positives (Noise):** (Severity: Low to Medium) - Reduces the number of false positives, improving developer productivity and trust in `detekt`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **False Positives:** Minimizes wasted developer time and reduces the likelihood of genuine issues being ignored due to "alert fatigue."

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Developers can report false positives in a dedicated Slack channel.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal triage and investigation process is not consistently followed.
    *   Documentation of configuration changes related to false positives is often lacking.
    *   Regular review of reported false positives is not performed.
