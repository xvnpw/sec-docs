# Deep Analysis of Detekt Attack Tree Path: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Configuration

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the attack vector described by the path:  `1. Exploit Detekt Configuration -> 1.1. Inject Malicious Rule Configuration -> 1.1.1.1. Rule uses a vulnerable custom rule implementation -> 1.1.1.1.1. Vulnerable custom rule allows arbitrary code execution via scripting`.  We aim to identify the specific vulnerabilities, preconditions, and mitigation strategies related to this attack path.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to prevent this type of attack.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where Detekt is configured to allow custom rules, and those custom rules utilize scripting capabilities (e.g., Groovy, Kotlin Script) that could be exploited for arbitrary code execution.  We will consider:

*   The Detekt configuration mechanism.
*   The process of loading and executing custom rules.
*   The potential for scripting languages within custom rules to interact with the underlying system.
*   The privileges under which Detekt and its custom rules execute.
*   Existing security mechanisms within Detekt (if any) that might mitigate this attack.
*   The development and CI/CD pipeline context in which Detekt is used.

We will *not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities in Detekt's core rule engine itself (1.1.1.2).
*   Compromise of the Git repository (1.1.2.1), although we will touch on how secure configuration management relates to the primary attack path.
*   Attacks that do not involve custom rule scripting.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  We will assume access to the Detekt source code and analyze relevant sections related to custom rule loading, execution, and scripting support.  Since we don't have direct access, we'll make informed assumptions based on Detekt's documentation and common practices in similar tools.
2.  **Documentation Review:** We will thoroughly review Detekt's official documentation, including sections on custom rule creation, configuration, and security considerations.
3.  **Threat Modeling:** We will use threat modeling principles to identify potential attack surfaces and vulnerabilities within the custom rule scripting mechanism.
4.  **Best Practices Research:** We will research secure coding practices for static analysis tools and scripting language sandboxing techniques.
5.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will investigate known vulnerabilities in similar tools or scripting engines that might be relevant to Detekt.
6.  **Hypothetical Exploit Development:** We will conceptually design a hypothetical exploit to illustrate the attack and its potential impact.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

**Attack Path:** 1. Exploit Detekt Configuration -> 1.1. Inject Malicious Rule Configuration -> 1.1.1.1. Rule uses a vulnerable custom rule implementation -> 1.1.1.1.1. Vulnerable custom rule allows arbitrary code execution via scripting

**2.1. Preconditions:**

For this attack to be successful, several preconditions must be met:

1.  **Custom Rules Enabled:** Detekt must be configured to allow the use of custom rules.  This is often a feature, not a bug, but it opens the door to this attack vector.
2.  **Scripting Support:** The custom rule mechanism must support scripting (e.g., Groovy, Kotlin Script).  This allows for more complex rule logic but also introduces the risk of code execution.
3.  **Lack of Sandboxing/Isolation:**  The scripting environment within the custom rule must *not* be adequately sandboxed or isolated from the underlying system.  This is the crucial vulnerability.  A proper sandbox would restrict the script's access to system resources, preventing arbitrary code execution.
4.  **Configuration Injection Vector:** The attacker must have a way to inject their malicious custom rule configuration.  This could be through:
    *   **Direct File Modification:**  If the attacker has write access to the Detekt configuration file (e.g., `detekt.yml`).
    *   **Compromised Build System:**  If the configuration is loaded from a build system (e.g., Gradle, Maven) that the attacker has compromised.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking a developer into using a malicious configuration file.
    *   **Dependency Confusion/Poisoning:** If custom rules are loaded as external dependencies, the attacker might be able to publish a malicious package.

**2.2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

The core vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sandboxing or isolation of the scripting environment within custom rules.  Here's a breakdown of potential issues:

*   **Unrestricted System Calls:**  If the scripting engine allows direct calls to system functions (e.g., `Runtime.exec()`, `System.getenv()`, file I/O operations), the attacker can execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Reflection Abuse:**  Even if direct system calls are restricted, reflection (the ability of a program to examine and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime) can often be used to bypass security restrictions.  The attacker might be able to use reflection to access restricted classes or methods.
*   **Dependency Injection Vulnerabilities:** If the custom rule can load external libraries or dependencies, those dependencies might contain vulnerabilities that the attacker can exploit.
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** If the custom rule configuration or data passed to the rule is deserialized insecurely, it could lead to code execution.
*   **Lack of Resource Limits:**  The scripting environment might not have limits on CPU usage, memory allocation, or network access.  This could allow the attacker to perform denial-of-service attacks or exfiltrate data.
* **Kotlin Script Specifics:** If Kotlin Script (.kts) is used, the attacker might try to leverage features like:
    - `@file:CompilerOptions`: To inject compiler flags that could weaken security.
    - Unsafe reflection to access internal Kotlin or JVM APIs.
    - Loading external .jar files with malicious code.

**2.3. Hypothetical Exploit (Conceptual):**

Let's assume Detekt uses Kotlin Script for custom rules and doesn't properly sandbox the scripting environment.  An attacker could craft a malicious `detekt.yml` configuration like this:

```yaml
custom:
  MyMaliciousRule:
    active: true
    ruleSetId: MaliciousRules
    ruleId: ExecuteCommand
    config:
      script: |
        import java.io.*
        fun runCommand(command: String): String {
            val process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command)
            val reader = BufferedReader(InputStreamReader(process.inputStream))
            val output = StringBuilder()
            var line: String?
            while (reader.readLine().also { line = it } != null) {
                output.append(line).append("\n")
            }
            process.waitFor()
            return output.toString()
        }

        val result = runCommand("whoami") // Or a more malicious command
        println("Command output: $result")
```

This script defines a function `runCommand` that uses `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` to execute an arbitrary shell command.  When Detekt runs with this configuration, it will execute the `whoami` command (or any other command the attacker chooses) and print the output.  This demonstrates arbitrary code execution. A more sophisticated attacker could use this to install malware, steal data, or compromise the system.

**2.4. Impact:**

The impact of this attack is **Very High**.  Successful exploitation grants the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Detekt process.  This could lead to:

*   **Complete System Compromise:**  The attacker could gain full control of the system running Detekt.
*   **Data Breach:**  Sensitive data accessible to the Detekt process (e.g., source code, API keys) could be stolen.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  The attacker could use the compromised system to attack other systems on the network.
*   **Supply Chain Attack:**  If Detekt is used in a CI/CD pipeline, the attacker could inject malicious code into the software being built, leading to a supply chain attack.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack could severely damage the reputation of the organization.

**2.5. Mitigation Strategies:**

Several mitigation strategies can be employed to prevent this attack:

1.  **Disable Custom Rules (If Possible):**  The most straightforward mitigation is to disable custom rules entirely if they are not essential. This eliminates the attack vector.

2.  **Strict Sandboxing:**  If custom rules are required, implement a robust sandboxing mechanism for the scripting environment.  This is the most critical mitigation.  Consider:
    *   **Restricted Classpath:**  Limit the classes and packages available to the script.  Use a whitelist approach, allowing only essential classes.
    *   **Security Manager:**  Use a Java Security Manager (if applicable) to enforce fine-grained permissions on the script.  This can prevent access to system resources, network connections, and other sensitive operations.
    *   **Resource Limits:**  Set limits on CPU usage, memory allocation, and execution time for the script.
    *   **Separate Process:**  Run the scripting engine in a separate, isolated process with reduced privileges.
    *   **Containerization:**  Run the entire Detekt process (including custom rules) within a container (e.g., Docker) with limited capabilities.

3.  **Secure Configuration Management:**
    *   **Store Configuration Securely:**  Protect the Detekt configuration file from unauthorized modification.  Use access control mechanisms and version control.
    *   **Code Review:**  Require code review for all changes to the Detekt configuration, especially when custom rules are involved.
    *   **Automated Scanning:**  Use tools to scan the Detekt configuration for potentially malicious patterns or settings.

4.  **Input Validation:**  Validate any input passed to custom rules to prevent injection attacks.

5.  **Dependency Management:**  If custom rules can load external dependencies, use a secure dependency management system and regularly scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of Detekt and its configuration to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

7.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run Detekt with the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid running it as root or with administrator privileges.

8.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor Detekt's activity for suspicious behavior, such as unexpected system calls or network connections.  Set up alerts for any anomalies.

9. **Specific to Kotlin Script:**
    - Disable or heavily restrict the use of `@file:CompilerOptions`.
    - Implement a custom `KotlinJsr223DefaultScriptEngineFactory` that overrides security-sensitive methods.
    - Use a custom class loader to prevent loading of arbitrary .jar files.

## 3. Conclusion

The attack path analyzed presents a significant security risk if Detekt is configured to allow custom rules with scripting capabilities without proper sandboxing.  The ability to execute arbitrary code through a malicious Detekt configuration can lead to severe consequences, including complete system compromise.  Implementing robust sandboxing, secure configuration management, and other mitigation strategies outlined above is crucial to protect against this attack vector. The development team should prioritize these security measures to ensure the safe use of Detekt, especially in CI/CD pipelines and other sensitive environments.
