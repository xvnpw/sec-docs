# Threat Model Analysis for detekt/detekt

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering - Disable Critical Rules](./threats/configuration_tampering_-_disable_critical_rules.md)

*   **Threat:** Configuration Tampering - Disable Critical Rules

    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the `detekt.yml` (or equivalent configuration file) modifies it to disable crucial security rules (e.g., disabling rules related to SQL injection, hardcoded credentials, or insecure cryptography). They achieve this by commenting out rules, setting `active: false`, or manipulating thresholds to prevent violations from being reported.
    *   **Impact:**  Vulnerabilities that *should* have been detected by the disabled rules are now allowed to pass into the codebase, significantly increasing the risk of security breaches and making the application more susceptible to attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** `detekt.yml` (configuration file), specifically the rule configurations within the `rules` section. This directly affects the `Config` class and related parsing logic within detekt's core, which determines which rules are active and how they are applied.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control:** Limit write access to the `detekt.yml` file to only authorized personnel (e.g., security engineers, senior developers).
        *   **Version Control & Change Tracking:**  Store the `detekt.yml` file in a version control system (like Git) and *require* pull requests/code reviews for *any* changes. This creates an audit trail and allows for scrutiny of modifications.
        *   **Centralized Configuration (Read-Only):** If possible, store a "master" copy of the `detekt.yml` in a read-only repository that the build system pulls from. This prevents direct modification in individual projects.
        *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement a pre-commit hook or CI/CD step that validates the `detekt.yml` against a schema or a predefined set of allowed configurations. This can prevent accidental or malicious disabling of critical rules.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review the `detekt.yml` file to ensure that critical rules are enabled and configured appropriately.

## Threat: [Baseline Manipulation - Hiding New Vulnerabilities](./threats/baseline_manipulation_-_hiding_new_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Baseline Manipulation - Hiding New Vulnerabilities

    *   **Description:** An attacker introduces a new vulnerability into the codebase. Instead of fixing the vulnerability, they add an entry to the `baseline.xml` file. This suppresses the warning from detekt, effectively hiding the vulnerability from future scans and allowing it to persist.
    *   **Impact:** The newly introduced vulnerability remains undetected, significantly increasing the risk of exploitation. The integrity of the baseline as a record of *legitimate* pre-existing issues is compromised.
    *   **Affected Component:** `baseline.xml` (baseline file), and the `BaselineProvider` component within detekt that is responsible for loading and applying the baseline during analysis.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Baseline Review Process:**  Mandate code reviews and approvals for *any* changes to the `baseline.xml` file. Treat baseline modifications with the same level of scrutiny as code changes.
        *   **Baseline Change Tracking:** Utilize version control to track all changes to the baseline. Consider using tools that can visualize baseline changes over time and highlight new additions for easier review.
        *   **Baseline Expiration/Review:** Implement a policy for periodic review and "clean up" of the baseline. Old baseline entries should be re-evaluated; they should either be fixed or have a clear, documented justification. Consider setting an "expiration date" for baseline entries to force re-evaluation.
        *   **Automated Baseline Checks:** Develop scripts or CI/CD integrations that analyze the baseline and flag suspicious additions (e.g., new entries that match known vulnerability patterns or are added without corresponding code fixes).

## Threat: [Plugin Exploitation - Arbitrary Code Execution](./threats/plugin_exploitation_-_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Plugin Exploitation - Arbitrary Code Execution

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a third-party detekt plugin. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the detekt process. Since detekt often runs as part of a CI/CD pipeline, this could grant the attacker access to the build server or other sensitive resources.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker could gain control of the build server, steal secrets (API keys, credentials), modify the codebase, disrupt the development process, or launch further attacks. This represents a severe security compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** The vulnerable third-party detekt plugin (the specific component depends on the plugin's internal structure). This directly impacts detekt's `extensions` loading mechanism and the overall security of the detekt runtime environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Plugin Vetting:** Thoroughly vet all third-party plugins *before* using them. Review the plugin's source code (if available), check its reputation and community support, and search for any known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Trusted Sources:** Only install plugins from trusted sources (e.g., the official detekt plugin repository, reputable developers with a proven track record).
        *   **Plugin Updates:** Keep all plugins updated to their latest versions to receive security patches and bug fixes.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run detekt with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running it as root or with administrative access to the build server or other systems.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider running detekt in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Docker container with limited permissions) to isolate it and limit the impact of a potential plugin compromise.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Employ a dependency scanning tool to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in detekt plugins and their dependencies.
