# BUSINESS POSTURE

detekt is a static code analysis tool for Kotlin. It operates on the abstract syntax tree provided by the Kotlin compiler. The primary business goal is to help Kotlin developers maintain code quality and consistency by identifying potential code smells, bugs, and style violations. The project aims to be highly configurable and extensible, allowing users to customize rules and even write their own.

Business priorities:

- Maintainability: The project must be easy to maintain and extend, given its open-source nature and reliance on community contributions.
- Accuracy: The analysis should be accurate, minimizing false positives and false negatives to ensure developer trust.
- Performance: The analysis should be performant enough to be integrated into build pipelines and IDEs without significant overhead.
- Configurability: Users should be able to easily configure the tool to match their specific coding standards and project needs.
- Extensibility: The tool should be designed to allow users to easily add custom rules and integrations.

Business risks:

- Inaccurate analysis leading to wasted developer time investigating false positives or missed bugs due to false negatives.
- Poor performance impacting build times and developer workflow.
- Lack of adoption due to difficult configuration or limited extensibility.
- Security vulnerabilities introduced through custom rules or integrations.
- Project abandonment due to lack of maintainability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: The project uses GitHub's built-in security features, such as code scanning and dependency analysis. (Described in GitHub repository settings and workflows).
- security control: The project has a security policy that describes how to report vulnerabilities. (Described in SECURITY.md file).
- security control: The project uses static analysis tools (including detekt itself) to identify potential issues. (Described in build configuration and CI workflows).
- security control: The project uses dependency management tools to keep dependencies up to date. (Described in build configuration).

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: The project relies on the Kotlin compiler and its abstract syntax tree. Any vulnerabilities or inaccuracies in the compiler could impact detekt's analysis.
- accepted risk: Custom rules and integrations developed by third parties may introduce security vulnerabilities or performance issues.
- accepted risk: The project is open source and relies on community contributions. While efforts are made to review contributions, malicious or poorly written code could be introduced.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation process to track all dependencies and their versions.
- security control: Introduce a regular security audit process, including penetration testing and code review focused on security aspects.
- security control: Provide clear guidelines and security best practices for developers creating custom rules and integrations.
- security control: Consider implementing a sandboxing mechanism for executing custom rules to limit their potential impact.

Security requirements:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable, as detekt is a command-line tool and doesn't handle user authentication.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable, as detekt operates on source code and doesn't manage access control.
- Input Validation: detekt processes Kotlin source code as input. Input validation is crucial to prevent injection vulnerabilities, especially in custom rules. The Kotlin compiler itself performs the initial parsing and validation, but custom rules must handle any additional input (e.g., configuration files) securely.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable, as detekt is not involved in cryptographic operations. However, if custom rules handle sensitive data (which should be avoided), they must use appropriate cryptographic libraries and practices.

- security control: The build process uses Gradle's dependency management to ensure consistent and reproducible builds.
- security control: detekt itself is used as part of the build process to analyze its own code (dogfooding).
- security control: The build process includes unit and integration tests to verify the functionality of detekt.
- security control: GitHub Actions workflows are configured to use specific versions of dependencies and actions, reducing the risk of supply chain attacks.
- security control: The build artifacts (JAR files) are published to Maven Central, a trusted repository.
- security control: The release process is automated and requires maintainer approval, reducing the risk of unauthorized releases.
- security control: SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools, including detekt, are used to scan the codebase for vulnerabilities.
- security control: Dependency scanning tools are used to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:

- The integrity and reliability of the static analysis process.
- The reputation of the detekt project and its trustworthiness.
- The development workflow of Kotlin developers using detekt.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

- Kotlin source code (analyzed by detekt): Sensitivity varies depending on the code being analyzed. It could range from non-sensitive open-source code to highly confidential proprietary code.
- detekt configuration files: May contain information about enabled rules and custom configurations. Sensitivity is generally low, but malicious configurations could impact analysis results.
- detekt reports: Contain the results of the analysis, highlighting potential issues in the code. Sensitivity depends on the sensitivity of the analyzed code.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that detekt needs to consider, especially regarding the handling of source code and reports?
- What is the expected level of security expertise for users developing custom rules? Should we provide more detailed security guidelines or a sandbox environment?
- What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities discovered in detekt or its dependencies?
- What are the plans for future development and how might they impact the security posture?

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary users of detekt are Kotlin developers who are concerned with code quality and maintainability.
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The project aims to be a community-driven effort, with contributions from various developers.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Users are responsible for the security of their own Kotlin code and the environment in which they run detekt.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The Kotlin compiler is assumed to be secure and reliable.
- DESIGN: The Gradle plugin deployment model is representative of other deployment methods.
- DESIGN: The build process is secure and follows best practices for software development.
