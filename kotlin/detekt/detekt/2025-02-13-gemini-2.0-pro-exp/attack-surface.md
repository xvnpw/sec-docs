# Attack Surface Analysis for detekt/detekt

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Attackers modify the detekt configuration to weaken or disable security checks.

**How detekt Contributes:** detekt's security effectiveness is entirely dependent on its configuration. A compromised configuration directly undermines its purpose.

**Example:** An attacker changes `detekt.yml` to disable the `SQLInjection` rule or sets `complexity.MaxCyclomaticComplexity` to an extremely high value, effectively disabling complexity checks.

**Impact:** Allows vulnerabilities to be introduced into the codebase without being detected by detekt, leading to potential security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement strict access control lists (ACLs) on the configuration file (e.g., `detekt.yml`) and the directory it resides in.
    *   Use a version control system (like Git) and enforce mandatory code reviews for *any* changes to the detekt configuration.  Treat configuration changes as code changes.
    *   Use a "deny-by-default" approach: Start with a strict, secure configuration and only loosen rules with explicit justification and review.
    *   Consider using a centralized, read-only configuration repository (e.g., a shared Git repository with restricted write access) to prevent unauthorized modifications.
*   **Users (Build/CI System Administrators):**
    *   Secure the build server and CI/CD pipeline to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   Implement configuration file integrity checks (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures) to detect tampering.  Fail the build if the configuration has been altered.
    *   Regularly audit the detekt configuration for unexpected or unauthorized changes.
    *   Consider using a configuration management tool to enforce a consistent and secure detekt configuration across all projects.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attack on detekt or Custom Rules](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attack_on_detekt_or_custom_rules.md)

**Description:** Attackers compromise the detekt library itself or any custom rule libraries used, injecting malicious code.

**How detekt Contributes:** detekt, like any software, relies on external dependencies (including custom rule libraries).  A compromised dependency becomes a vector for attack.

**Example:** An attacker publishes a malicious version of detekt to Maven Central or compromises a popular custom rule library, injecting code that exfiltrates sensitive data during the build process.

**Impact:** Compromise of the build server, CI/CD pipeline, and potentially the entire development environment.  Could lead to the introduction of backdoors or other malicious code into the application.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:**
    *   Use dependency verification mechanisms:
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Verify the SHA-256 or SHA-512 checksum of the downloaded detekt and custom rule JAR files against the official checksums published by the maintainers.
        *   **GPG Signature Verification:** If available, verify the GPG signatures of the artifacts to ensure they were signed by the legitimate maintainers.
        *   Use tools like `dependencyCheck` to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Pin dependency versions: Specify exact versions of detekt and custom rule libraries in your build configuration (e.g., Gradle or Maven) to prevent automatic upgrades to potentially compromised versions.
    *   Thoroughly vet and review any custom rule libraries before using them.  Treat them with the same level of scrutiny as your own application code.
*   **Users (Build/CI System Administrators):**
    *   Consider using a private artifact repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory) to control the source of dependencies and prevent the use of compromised artifacts from public repositories.
    *   Regularly scan the private artifact repository for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Report Tampering](./attack_surfaces/report_tampering.md)

**Description:** Attackers modify or delete detekt's reports to hide identified vulnerabilities.

**How detekt Contributes:** Detekt generates reports; these reports are the attack surface.

**Example:** An attacker with access to the build server deletes the detekt report XML file before developers can review it.

**Impact:** Developers are unaware of vulnerabilities, leading to insecure code deployment.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:**
    *   Integrate detekt results directly into the build process: Configure the build to fail if detekt finds issues above a certain severity level. This prevents reliance on post-build reports.
    *   Use a centralized reporting system: Send detekt reports to a secure, centralized system (e.g., a security dashboard) that is less susceptible to tampering.
*   **Users (Build/CI System Administrators):**
    *   Store reports in a secure location: Use a dedicated, access-controlled directory or storage service for detekt reports.
    *   Implement integrity checks: Calculate and verify checksums of the report files to detect tampering.
    *   Use audit logging: Enable audit logging to track access to and modifications of detekt reports.
