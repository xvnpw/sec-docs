## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Detekt Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_detekt_configuration.md)

*   **1.1. Inject Malicious Rule Configuration [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker modifies the Detekt configuration to include malicious rules or settings.
    *   **1.1.1.1. Rule uses a vulnerable custom rule implementation (if custom rules are allowed). [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  If Detekt allows custom rules, and those rules are not properly sandboxed, an attacker can inject code that executes with the privileges of the Detekt process.
        *   **1.1.1.1.1. Vulnerable custom rule allows arbitrary code execution via scripting (e.g., Groovy, Kotlin Script). [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker crafts a custom rule that leverages scripting capabilities (if available) to execute arbitrary code on the system running Detekt.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if code review is in place, otherwise Hard)
    *   **1.1.1.2. Rule exploits a vulnerability in Detekt's rule engine itself. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** This is a more severe, but less likely, scenario where the attacker exploits a bug within Detekt's core rule processing logic.
    *   **1.1.2.1. Compromise the Git repository hosting the Detekt configuration. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** If the Detekt configuration is stored in a version control system (like Git), compromising that repository allows the attacker to inject malicious configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Plugin Loading Mechanism [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_plugin_loading_mechanism__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker leverages Detekt's plugin system to load and execute malicious code.
*   **1.2.1. Load a malicious Detekt plugin. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** This is the primary attack vector for plugin-based exploits.
    *   **1.2.1.1. Social engineer developer to install a malicious plugin. [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker tricks a developer into installing a malicious plugin, perhaps by disguising it as a legitimate or useful tool.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if developers are aware of social engineering risks)
    *   **1.2.1.2. Compromise a plugin repository (e.g., a Maven repository). [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker gains control of a repository where Detekt plugins are hosted and replaces a legitimate plugin with a malicious one.
    *   **1.2.1.3. Exploit a vulnerability in Detekt's plugin loading mechanism (e.g., path traversal). [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker finds a flaw in how Detekt loads plugins, allowing them to load a plugin from an arbitrary location or bypass security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Detekt's Input Processing](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_detekt's_input_processing.md)

*   **2.1.1. Code triggers a vulnerability in Detekt's parser (e.g., ANTLR). [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker provides specially crafted source code that exploits a vulnerability in the parser used by Detekt (likely ANTLR).
*   **2.1.2.2. Rule uses regular expressions vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service). [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker provides code that triggers a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) vulnerability in a Detekt rule.  This causes excessive CPU consumption, leading to a DoS.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with ReDoS detection tools)

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Abuse Baseline File](./attack_tree_paths/4__abuse_baseline_file.md)

*   **2.2.1.1. Baseline file hides a critical security issue, allowing it to be merged into the codebase. [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker modifies the baseline file to suppress warnings about legitimate security vulnerabilities, effectively hiding them from developers.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (indirectly, by allowing vulnerable code)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with code review and baseline file diffing)
* **2.2.1.2 Baseline file contains crafted data that exploits a vulnerability in Detekt's baseline processing logic. [CRITICAL]**
    * **Description:** The attacker crafts a baseline file that, when processed by Detekt, triggers a vulnerability in the baseline processing logic itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Detekt's Dependencies [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_detekt's_dependencies__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker targets vulnerabilities in libraries that Detekt depends on.
*   **3.1.1. A compromised dependency (e.g., a library used by Detekt) contains malicious code. [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** A library that Detekt uses is compromised, and the attacker injects malicious code into that library.  When Detekt uses the compromised library, the malicious code executes.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Very High (for the attacker to compromise the dependency)
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires SCA and monitoring)
*   **3.1.2. Dependency confusion attack: trick Detekt into loading a malicious package with the same name as a legitimate dependency. [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name as a legitimate Detekt dependency to a public repository.  If Detekt is misconfigured, it might download and use the malicious package instead of the legitimate one.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires careful dependency management and private repositories)
