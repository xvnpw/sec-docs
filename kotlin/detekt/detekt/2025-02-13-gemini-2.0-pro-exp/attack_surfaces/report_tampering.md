Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Report Tampering" attack surface for an application using detekt, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Detekt Report Tampering

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Report Tampering" attack surface related to detekt, identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors, and propose concrete, actionable recommendations beyond the initial mitigation strategies.  We aim to move from general mitigations to specific implementation guidance.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack surface where an attacker manipulates or deletes detekt-generated reports.  It considers scenarios where the attacker has:

*   **Local access** to the build server or environment where detekt runs and reports are generated.
*   **Network access** to intercept reports being transmitted to a central system (if applicable).
*   **Compromised credentials** with sufficient privileges to modify or delete files.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities within detekt itself (e.g., a hypothetical vulnerability allowing code execution through a crafted code file).
*   Attacks targeting the source code *before* detekt analysis.
*   Attacks that exploit vulnerabilities *identified* by detekt, but ignored by developers.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Attack Vector Enumeration:**  Identify all plausible ways an attacker could tamper with detekt reports.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  For each attack vector, analyze the underlying vulnerabilities that enable it.
3.  **Implementation-Specific Mitigation:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies tailored to common CI/CD environments and tools.  This goes beyond the general "store securely" advice.
4.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the remaining risk after implementing the mitigations.
5.  **Monitoring and Detection:**  Suggest methods for detecting attempted or successful report tampering.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Report Tampering

### 2.1. Attack Vector Enumeration

Here are the primary ways an attacker could tamper with detekt reports:

1.  **Direct File Deletion:**  The attacker deletes the report file(s) (e.g., XML, HTML) from the build server's file system.
2.  **File Modification:** The attacker modifies the report file(s) to remove or alter vulnerability findings.  This could involve:
    *   Removing entire sections related to specific rules.
    *   Changing severity levels of reported issues.
    *   Adding false negatives (claiming a vulnerability is not present).
3.  **Interception and Modification (Man-in-the-Middle):** If reports are sent to a central system over a network, the attacker intercepts the transmission and modifies the report before it reaches its destination.
4.  **Prevention of Report Generation:** The attacker modifies the detekt configuration or build process to prevent the report from being generated in the first place.  This could involve:
    *   Disabling detekt entirely.
    *   Setting an extremely high threshold so no issues are reported.
    *   Redirecting the report output to `/dev/null` (or equivalent).
5.  **Tampering with Integrity Checks:** If integrity checks (e.g., checksums) are used, the attacker modifies both the report *and* the checksum to make the tampering appear legitimate.
6. **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** The attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline configuration (e.g., Jenkinsfile, GitLab CI YAML) and modifies it to disable detekt, alter its reporting, or prevent report uploads.

### 2.2. Vulnerability Analysis

The underlying vulnerabilities enabling these attack vectors are:

*   **Insufficient Access Control:**  The attacker has write/delete permissions to the directory where detekt reports are stored.  This could be due to:
    *   Overly permissive file system permissions.
    *   Weak or compromised user credentials.
    *   Lack of principle of least privilege (users have more access than needed).
*   **Lack of Network Security:**  Reports are transmitted over an insecure channel (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS) or without proper authentication/encryption, allowing interception.
*   **Weak or Absent Integrity Checks:**  No checksums or other integrity mechanisms are used, or the attacker has the ability to modify them.
*   **Insecure CI/CD Configuration:**  The CI/CD pipeline configuration is not protected against unauthorized modification, allowing attackers to disable or manipulate detekt.
*   **Lack of Auditing:**  No audit logs are generated or monitored, making it difficult to detect tampering attempts.

### 2.3. Implementation-Specific Mitigation Strategies

Here are specific, actionable mitigations, categorized by common CI/CD environments:

**General Recommendations (Applicable to all environments):**

*   **Fail the Build:**  Configure detekt to fail the build if any issues are found above a defined severity (e.g., `failThreshold` in detekt's configuration).  This is the *most crucial* mitigation, as it prevents reliance on post-build reports.  Use a low threshold during development and a stricter threshold for production builds.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that only the necessary CI/CD service accounts have write access to the report directory.  Developers should *not* have direct write access to this location.
*   **Short-Lived Reports:** If possible, treat detekt reports as ephemeral artifacts.  Consume them immediately within the build process (e.g., to fail the build or send data to a central system) and then discard them.  This reduces the window of opportunity for tampering.

**Specific Environment Recommendations:**

*   **Jenkins:**
    *   **Report Storage:** Use the Jenkins Artifact Archiver to store reports as build artifacts.  These are stored within Jenkins' internal storage and are subject to Jenkins' access control mechanisms.
    *   **Integrity Checks:** Use the `checksum` step in your Jenkinsfile to calculate and verify checksums of the report files *before* archiving them.  Store the checksums as build artifacts as well.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Enable Jenkins' audit logging to track access to build artifacts and configuration changes.
    *   **Pipeline Security:** Use Jenkins' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict who can modify pipeline configurations.
    *   **Credentials Management:** Use Jenkins' Credentials Plugin to securely store and manage credentials used to access external systems (e.g., a security dashboard).

*   **GitLab CI:**
    *   **Report Storage:** Use GitLab CI's `artifacts` keyword to store reports.  These are stored in GitLab's internal storage and are subject to GitLab's access control.
    *   **Integrity Checks:** Use a `script` step in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to calculate and verify checksums (e.g., using `sha256sum`).  Store the checksums as artifacts as well.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Enable GitLab's audit events to track access to artifacts and configuration changes.
    *   **Pipeline Security:** Use GitLab's project and group membership settings to control who can modify CI/CD configurations.  Use protected branches to prevent unauthorized changes to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Use GitLab CI's `variables` feature to securely store and manage secrets.

*   **GitHub Actions:**
    *   **Report Storage:** Use the `actions/upload-artifact` action to upload reports as workflow artifacts.  These are stored in GitHub's internal storage.
    *   **Integrity Checks:** Use a `run` step in your workflow file to calculate and verify checksums.  Upload the checksums as artifacts as well.
    *   **Audit Logging:** GitHub automatically logs workflow runs and actions.  Review these logs for suspicious activity.
    *   **Pipeline Security:** Use GitHub's branch protection rules to prevent unauthorized changes to workflow files.  Use repository collaborators and teams to manage access control.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Use GitHub Actions' secrets feature to securely store and manage secrets.

*   **Centralized Security Dashboard (e.g., SonarQube, DefectDojo):**
    *   **Secure API Communication:** Use HTTPS with strong TLS configurations for communication between the CI/CD system and the security dashboard.  Use API keys or other authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Input Validation:** Ensure the security dashboard properly validates and sanitizes the data received from detekt reports to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Access Control:** Implement RBAC within the security dashboard to control who can view and manage detekt results.

### 2.4. Residual Risk Assessment

Even with these mitigations in place, some residual risk remains:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  A zero-day vulnerability in detekt, the CI/CD system, or the security dashboard could be exploited to bypass security controls.
*   **Insider Threat:**  A malicious insider with legitimate access to the build system or security dashboard could still tamper with reports.
*   **Sophisticated Attacks:**  A highly skilled and determined attacker could potentially find ways to circumvent even the most robust security measures.

However, the implemented mitigations significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of successful report tampering.

### 2.5. Monitoring and Detection

To detect attempted or successful tampering, implement the following:

*   **Audit Log Review:** Regularly review audit logs from the CI/CD system, file system, and security dashboard for suspicious activity, such as:
    *   Unauthorized access to report files or directories.
    *   Modifications to CI/CD configurations related to detekt.
    *   Failed attempts to access or modify reports.
    *   Unexpected changes in report sizes or checksums.
*   **Integrity Check Failures:**  Configure alerts to trigger when integrity checks fail.  This indicates potential tampering.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate logs from the CI/CD system, file system, and security dashboard into a SIEM system to correlate events and detect suspicious patterns.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Use anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual activity related to detekt reports, such as a sudden drop in the number of reported issues or a significant change in report size.
* **Regular security audits and penetration testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the "Report Tampering" attack surface for detekt and offers concrete steps to mitigate the associated risks. By implementing these recommendations, development teams can significantly improve the security of their applications and ensure the integrity of their static analysis results.
