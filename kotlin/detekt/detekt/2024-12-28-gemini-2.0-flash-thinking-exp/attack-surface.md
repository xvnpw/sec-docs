### Key Attack Surface List: Detekt Integration (High & Critical, Detekt-Specific)

Here's a filtered list of key attack surfaces directly involving Detekt, with high or critical risk severity.

*   **Attack Surface: Exploitable Vulnerabilities in Detekt Core**
    *   **Description:** Detekt, like any software, might contain security vulnerabilities in its core code.
    *   **How Detekt Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By being included as a dependency and executed during the build process, any vulnerabilities within Detekt become potential entry points.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in Detekt's code parsing logic could be triggered by a specially crafted Kotlin file, potentially leading to remote code execution on the build server.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the build environment, potential for code injection into the final application artifact, data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Detekt Updated: Regularly update Detekt to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor Security Advisories: Subscribe to Detekt's security advisories or watch its GitHub repository for security-related announcements.

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Detekt's Dependencies**
    *   **Description:** Detekt relies on various third-party libraries, which themselves might contain vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Detekt Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By depending on these libraries, Detekt indirectly introduces the attack surface of its dependencies.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a logging library used by Detekt could be exploited to inject malicious log entries, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the severity of the dependency vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerable dependency)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Dependency Management: Use a dependency management tool (like Gradle's dependency management features) to track and update Detekt's dependencies.
        *   Vulnerability Scanning: Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) into the build process to identify vulnerable dependencies.
        *   Regularly Update Dependencies: Keep Detekt's dependencies updated to their latest secure versions.

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Custom Rules or Plugins**
    *   **Description:** If the project utilizes custom Detekt rules or plugins, these external components might contain security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Detekt Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Detekt executes these custom rules or plugins, inheriting any vulnerabilities they might possess.
    *   **Example:** A custom rule might have a code injection vulnerability that could be exploited during the analysis process, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the build server.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the severity of the vulnerability in the custom rule or plugin, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Careful Selection of Plugins: Only use reputable and well-maintained Detekt plugins.
        *   Security Review of Custom Rules: Thoroughly review and test any custom Detekt rules for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Sandboxing (If Possible): Explore options for sandboxing or isolating the execution of custom rules to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
