### High and Critical Detekt Threats

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection via Detekt Configuration
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker with write access to Detekt configuration files (e.g., `detekt.yml`) could inject malicious code snippets or commands. Detekt, during its execution, might interpret and execute this injected code. This could be achieved by manipulating configuration values that are later used in script execution or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Detekt parses configuration.
        *   **How:**  The attacker might leverage features in Detekt that allow for dynamic configuration or script execution based on configuration values.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server or developer's machine. This could lead to data breaches, malware installation, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** Configuration loading and parsing mechanism, potentially affecting the core `detekt-core` module or specific rule set modules that process configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict write access to Detekt configuration files.
        *   Implement version control and rigorous code review for all changes to Detekt configuration files.
        *   Sanitize and validate configuration inputs before processing.
        *   Avoid features that allow direct execution of arbitrary code based on configuration.
        *   Run Detekt in isolated environments with limited privileges.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Detekt Configuration
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Detekt configuration files that inadvertently contain sensitive information like API keys, internal paths, or credentials. This access could be through compromised version control systems, insecure storage, or insider threats.
        *   **How:** The attacker might directly access the configuration files or gain access to systems where these files are stored.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive data, unauthorized access to internal systems, or escalation of privileges.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** Configuration file storage and management practices, potentially affecting the core `detekt-core` module if it directly handles sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in Detekt configuration files.
        *   Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, environment variables provided by CI/CD systems).
        *   Implement access controls and encryption for configuration files.
        *   Regularly scan configuration files for potential secrets.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Custom Detekt Rules
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker with the ability to contribute or modify custom Detekt rules could introduce malicious code within these rules. This code could be designed to perform harmful actions during analysis, such as exfiltrating data, modifying files, or injecting vulnerabilities into the codebase being analyzed.
        *   **How:** The attacker might submit a pull request with a malicious rule, or if they have direct access to the rule codebase, they could directly inject the malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** Data breaches, code tampering, introduction of vulnerabilities, or compromise of the build environment.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** Custom rule execution framework within `detekt-core` and the specific malicious custom rule itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all custom Detekt rules and plugins.
        *   Ensure the source of third-party rules and plugins is trusted and reputable.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools on the Detekt rule codebase itself to detect potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Enforce code signing for custom rules.
        *   Run custom rules in isolated environments with limited privileges.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in Detekt or its Plugins
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in the external libraries that Detekt or its plugins depend on. This could be achieved if Detekt uses outdated or vulnerable versions of these dependencies.
        *   **How:** The attacker might target specific vulnerabilities in the dependencies to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the build environment, potential for arbitrary code execution, or denial of service. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:**  Dependency management system used by Detekt (e.g., Gradle dependencies) and the specific vulnerable dependency. This could affect any module within Detekt that relies on the vulnerable library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Detekt and its plugins to the latest versions, which often include updates to dependencies.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify and address vulnerabilities in Detekt's dependencies.
        *   Implement a process for monitoring and updating dependencies.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Detekt Distribution
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker compromises the official distribution channels or repositories for Detekt and replaces legitimate binaries with malicious ones. Developers unknowingly download and use the compromised version.
        *   **How:** The attacker might target the GitHub repository, Maven Central, or other distribution platforms.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:**  Installation of malware on developer machines and build servers, potential for data breaches, and compromise of the entire development pipeline.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:**  The distribution infrastructure for Detekt (e.g., GitHub releases, Maven Central repository).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use official and trusted sources for downloading Detekt.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded Detekt binaries using checksums or digital signatures provided by the Detekt team.
        *   Implement security measures on development machines to detect and prevent the execution of malicious software.
        *   Monitor official Detekt channels for announcements regarding security incidents or compromised releases.
