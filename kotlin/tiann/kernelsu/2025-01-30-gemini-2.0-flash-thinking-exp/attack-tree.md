## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Kernel Module Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Kernel Level Compromise]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_kernel_module_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_-_kernel_level_compromise_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.1. Memory Corruption in Kernel Module [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Memory Corruption in Kernel]:**
        *   **1.1.1. Buffer Overflow in Kernel Module [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Sending crafted input to the KernelSU kernel module interface that exceeds buffer boundaries, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution in the kernel.
        *   **1.1.2. Use-After-Free in Kernel Module [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Triggering a use-after-free condition by manipulating the state and timing of KernelSU kernel module operations, leading to memory corruption and potential code execution.
        *   **1.1.3. Heap Overflow in Kernel Module [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Allocating large objects or triggering specific allocation patterns via the KernelSU interface to cause a heap overflow in the kernel module's heap, leading to memory corruption and potential code execution.
    *   **1.2. Logic Bugs in Kernel Module [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Kernel Logic Flaws]:**
        *   **1.2.1. Privilege Escalation Flaw in Kernel Module [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Exploiting flaws in the permission checking or privilege management logic within the KernelSU kernel module to gain root privileges unexpectedly or bypass intended security boundaries.
        *   **1.2.3. Insecure System Call Handling in Kernel Module [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Abusing vulnerabilities in how the KernelSU kernel module intercepts or handles system calls, potentially allowing malicious code to be executed with elevated privileges or bypass security mechanisms.
    *   **1.3. Backdoor/Malicious Code in Kernel Module [CRITICAL NODE - Supply Chain Risk]:**  If the KernelSU development or release process is compromised, an attacker could inject malicious code directly into the kernel module. This would result in a pre-installed rootkit upon KernelSU installation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit User-Space Daemon (suservice) Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Root Daemon Compromise]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_user-space_daemon__suservice__vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_-_root_daem_7de806e7.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **2.1. Vulnerabilities in IPC Communication with suservice [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Insecure IPC]:**
        *   **2.1.1. Buffer Overflow in IPC Handling [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Sending crafted, oversized messages via Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to the `suservice` daemon, causing a buffer overflow in the daemon's IPC handling code and potentially leading to code execution within the root daemon.
        *   **2.1.2. Insecure Deserialization in IPC [HIGH RISK PATH]:** If `suservice` uses serialization for IPC messages, sending maliciously crafted serialized data that exploits deserialization vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the `suservice` daemon.
        *   **2.1.3. Lack of Authentication/Authorization in IPC [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Exploiting the absence or weakness of authentication and authorization mechanisms in the IPC communication with `suservice`. This could allow an attacker to spoof IPC messages and control the actions of the root daemon without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit `su` Binary Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - su Binary Compromise]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit__su__binary_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_-_su_binary_compromise_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **3.1. Vulnerabilities in `su` Binary Logic [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **3.1.1. Buffer Overflow in `su` Binary [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Providing excessively long arguments or inputs to the `su` binary that cause a buffer overflow in its processing logic, potentially leading to code execution with the privileges of the `su` binary (typically root).
        *   **3.1.3. Logic Bugs in Permission Handling in `su` Binary [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Exploiting flaws in the permission checking or user authentication logic within the `su` binary to bypass security checks and gain unauthorized root access.
    *   **3.2. Dependency Vulnerabilities in `su` Binary [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in libraries that the `su` binary depends on (e.g., glibc). If a vulnerable library is used, an attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities to execute code through the `su` binary.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Misuse of KernelSU by Malicious Applications [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Malicious App Misuse]](./attack_tree_paths/6__misuse_of_kernelsu_by_malicious_applications__high_risk_path___critical_node_-_malicious_app_misu_fe38662c.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **6.1. Malicious App Gains Root via KernelSU and Attacks Target Application [HIGH RISK PATH]:** A malicious application, either intentionally designed to be malicious or compromised after installation, could leverage KernelSU to gain root access (either legitimately through user consent or illegitimately through other vulnerabilities). Once root access is obtained, the malicious application can then attack other applications on the system, including the target application, performing actions like data theft, process manipulation, or further system compromise.

    This high-risk sub-tree and detailed breakdown provide a focused view of the most critical threats associated with KernelSU, allowing developers and security teams to prioritize their mitigation efforts effectively.
