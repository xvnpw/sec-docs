# Attack Surface Analysis for tiann/kernelsu

## Attack Surface: [Kernel Module Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/kernel_module_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws within the KernelSU kernel module code itself, such as buffer overflows, race conditions, or logic errors. These vulnerabilities are *introduced by* the addition of the KernelSU kernel module.
*   **KernelSU Contribution:** KernelSU *directly* introduces a custom kernel module, which is new code running at the kernel level and can contain vulnerabilities specific to its implementation. This is a *direct* increase in the kernel attack surface.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow in KernelSU's IPC message handling within the kernel module could allow a malicious app to gain arbitrary code execution in the kernel by sending a specially crafted IPC message.
*   **Impact:** Full kernel compromise, arbitrary code execution at the highest privilege level, system instability, data corruption, complete device takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Rigorous and independent security audits of the KernelSU kernel module code.
        *   Extensive static and dynamic analysis, including fuzzing, specifically targeting the kernel module.
        *   Adherence to strict secure kernel module development practices.
        *   Rapid patching and updates for any discovered kernel module vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Use only official KernelSU releases from verified and trusted sources.
        *   Apply KernelSU updates promptly when released.
        *   Monitor for security advisories specifically related to KernelSU kernel module vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Userspace Daemon (`su`) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/userspace_daemon___su___vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security weaknesses in the KernelSU `su` daemon, such as insecure IPC with the kernel module, authorization bypasses, or local privilege escalation flaws. These vulnerabilities are *specific to* the KernelSU `su` daemon implementation.
*   **KernelSU Contribution:** KernelSU *introduces* its own `su` daemon to manage root requests, which is a new userspace component and a potential source of vulnerabilities. This is a *direct* increase in the userspace attack surface related to privilege management.
*   **Example:** An attacker could exploit an authorization bypass vulnerability in the KernelSU `su` daemon to trick it into granting root access to a malicious application without user confirmation.
*   **Impact:** Local privilege escalation, unauthorized root access for malicious applications, information disclosure by the `su` daemon, potential for further kernel exploitation if the `su` daemon interacts insecurely with the kernel module.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Secure coding practices for the KernelSU `su` daemon, with a focus on secure IPC, robust authorization logic, and input validation.
        *   Regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the `su` daemon and its interactions with the kernel module.
        *   Implementation of strong authorization mechanisms with clear user prompts and controls for root access requests.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Grant root access only to applications that are fully trusted and only when absolutely necessary.
        *   Carefully review and understand permission requests presented by the KernelSU `su` daemon before granting root access.
        *   Utilize KernelSU's permission management features to revoke root access from applications when it is no longer needed.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Process Communication (IPC)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-process_communication__ipc_.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in the communication channel *specifically between* the KernelSU userspace `su` daemon and the KernelSU kernel module. This includes vulnerabilities like message spoofing, injection, or lack of proper authentication and encryption in this *KernelSU-specific* IPC channel.
*   **KernelSU Contribution:** KernelSU *relies* on IPC as the fundamental mechanism for communication between its userspace and kernel components.  The security of *this specific IPC channel* is critical and a direct attack surface introduced by KernelSU's architecture.
*   **Example:** Due to a lack of mutual authentication in the KernelSU IPC, a malicious process could potentially spoof messages from the legitimate `su` daemon to the kernel module, instructing the module to perform privileged operations without proper authorization.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized control over KernelSU kernel module functionality, bypass of authorization mechanisms, potential for escalating attacks to kernel level by manipulating the kernel module via insecure IPC.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust and secure IPC mechanisms *specifically for KernelSU's internal communication*, including mutual authentication and encryption of IPC messages.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data exchanged through the KernelSU IPC channel to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Minimize the complexity of the KernelSU IPC protocol to reduce the likelihood of implementation vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   No direct user mitigation for IPC implementation flaws. User security relies on developers implementing secure IPC within KernelSU.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Installation and Update Process](./attack_surfaces/insecure_installation_and_update_process.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities during the *KernelSU-specific* installation or update processes. This includes risks like downloading KernelSU components from insecure channels or lack of integrity checks on downloaded packages, potentially leading to malicious code injection *during KernelSU setup*.
*   **KernelSU Contribution:** KernelSU *requires* a specific installation process to inject its kernel module and install its userspace components. This installation process, if not secured, becomes a *direct* attack vector for compromising the system during KernelSU setup.
*   **Example:** An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack when a user downloads a KernelSU update, replacing the legitimate update package with a malicious one that installs a backdoor at the kernel level, effectively compromising the device through the *KernelSU update mechanism*.
*   **Impact:** Initial system compromise during KernelSU installation or update, installation of persistent backdoors or malware within the kernel via a compromised KernelSU package, long-term device compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Provide KernelSU installation and update packages only through secure channels (e.g., HTTPS).
        *   Implement strong integrity checks, such as digital signatures, for all KernelSU installation and update packages to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.
        *   Clearly document and communicate the secure installation and update procedures to users, emphasizing the importance of using official sources.
    *   **Users:**
        *   *Always* download KernelSU installation and update packages from official and verified sources only (e.g., official KernelSU GitHub repository, developer website).
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded KernelSU packages if possible, by checking digital signatures or checksums provided by the developers.
        *   Be extremely cautious about installing KernelSU from unofficial or untrusted sources, as these may contain malicious modifications.
        *   Use secure network connections when downloading and installing KernelSU to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
