# Threat Model Analysis for tiann/kernelsu

## Threat: [KernelSU Module Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/kernelsu_module_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability within a KernelSU kernel module. Exploitation could involve sending crafted input or triggering specific operations that expose the vulnerability, leading to arbitrary code execution in the kernel.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the kernel, complete device compromise, data theft from any application, kernel panic leading to denial of service, persistent malware installation at the kernel level, bypassing all application-level security measures.
*   **KernelSU Component Affected:** Specific KernelSU kernel modules (e.g., namespace isolation module, permission management module, core service module).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Kernel Module Development: Implement rigorous security testing and code reviews for all KernelSU modules.
    *   Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of KernelSU modules by independent security experts.
    *   Module Sandboxing/Isolation: Implement strong isolation and sandboxing for KernelSU modules.
    *   Minimize Module Complexity: Keep KernelSU modules as simple as possible.
    *   Timely Security Updates: Provide timely security updates for KernelSU modules.

## Threat: [Malicious Application Abuse of Root Privileges](./threats/malicious_application_abuse_of_root_privileges.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious application leverages KernelSU to gain root privileges without explicit user consent beyond the initial KernelSU setup. Once root access is obtained, the malicious application can perform any action on the device.
*   **Impact:** Data theft from all applications, installation of persistent malware, modification of system settings, device bricking, eavesdropping, financial fraud, identity theft.
*   **KernelSU Component Affected:** KernelSU core service, `su` binary, permission management system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Principle of Least Privilege in Application Design: Design applications to request root access only when absolutely necessary.
    *   Robust Permission Management within Application: Implement fine-grained permission control within the application.
    *   User Education and Awareness: Educate users about the risks of granting root access.
    *   Reputation and Trust Building: Developers should build trust with users.
    *   Code Audits and Transparency: Make application code auditable or undergo security audits.

## Threat: [Unintended Privilege Escalation via Application Vulnerability](./threats/unintended_privilege_escalation_via_application_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability exists in the application's code that interacts with KernelSU. An attacker exploits this application-level vulnerability to gain root privileges unintentionally, even if the application was not designed to grant such broad access.
*   **Impact:** Unintended root access for the attacker, potential for data theft, system modification, or further exploitation from within the compromised application with elevated privileges.
*   **KernelSU Component Affected:** KernelSU API interfaces used by applications, `su` binary interaction.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Application Development Practices: Implement secure coding practices, especially when interacting with KernelSU APIs.
    *   Input Validation and Sanitization: Strictly validate and sanitize all data used in KernelSU API calls.
    *   Regular Application Security Testing: Conduct regular security testing of the application.
    *   Minimize KernelSU API Usage: Use KernelSU APIs only when strictly necessary.
    *   Code Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews for code sections that interact with KernelSU.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Root Access](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_root_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, having gained root access through a compromised application or a KernelSU vulnerability, uses these privileges to access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the device.
*   **Impact:** Loss of sensitive user data, privacy breach, financial loss, identity theft, reputational damage.
*   **KernelSU Component Affected:** KernelSU's ability to bypass Android permission model, file system access granted by root privileges.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Data Encryption at Rest: Encrypt sensitive data at rest on the device.
    *   Minimize Data Storage: Reduce the amount of sensitive data stored locally.
    *   Network Security Measures: Implement strong network security measures to detect data exfiltration.
    *   Regular Security Monitoring: Implement security monitoring and logging.
    *   Data Access Auditing: Implement auditing mechanisms to track data access.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of KernelSU Distribution](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_kernelsu_distribution.md)

*   **Description:** The official distribution channels or build processes for KernelSU are compromised. Attackers inject malware or vulnerabilities into the KernelSU installation packages, leading to users unknowingly installing compromised KernelSU.
*   **Impact:** Widespread device compromise, kernel-level malware infection, data theft on a large scale, loss of trust in KernelSU.
*   **KernelSU Component Affected:** KernelSU distribution channels, build system, update mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Build and Release Processes: Implement highly secure build and release processes for KernelSU.
    *   Multiple Distribution Channels and Mirrors: Utilize multiple trusted distribution channels.
    *   Transparency and Open Source: Maintain transparency in the KernelSU development process.
    *   Verification Mechanisms: Provide users with mechanisms to verify the integrity of KernelSU packages.
    *   Community Monitoring and Vigilance: Foster a strong community around KernelSU for monitoring.
