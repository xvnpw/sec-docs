# Attack Surface Analysis for tiann/kernelsu

## Attack Surface: [Kernel Module Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/kernel_module_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the Kernelsu kernel module itself, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or logic flaws.
    *   **Kernelsu Contribution:** Kernelsu introduces a custom kernel module, which inherently adds new code to the kernel space that could contain vulnerabilities. This module operates with the highest privileges.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow in a function handling ioctl commands could allow an attacker to overwrite kernel memory and gain arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Full kernel compromise, leading to complete control over the device, data theft, malware installation, and system instability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Employ secure coding practices, perform thorough static and dynamic analysis, conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the kernel module. Utilize memory-safe languages where feasible for kernel development. Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the kernel module.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure User-Space Communication Channel](./attack_surfaces/insecure_user-space_communication_channel.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the communication mechanism between user-space applications and the Kernelsu kernel module (e.g., via ioctl, binder, or a custom interface).
    *   **Kernelsu Contribution:** Kernelsu establishes a communication channel to allow user-space applications to request and be granted root privileges. If this channel is not properly secured, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could spoof legitimate requests for root access if the authentication mechanism is weak or non-existent. Malicious data injected through this channel could trigger vulnerabilities in the kernel module.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized privilege escalation, allowing malicious applications to gain root access without proper authorization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for requests to the kernel module. Use secure inter-process communication (IPC) methods. Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received from user-space before processing it in the kernel module. Employ principle of least privilege when granting root access.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Compromise](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Risks associated with the development and distribution of Kernelsu, such as compromised source code, malicious dependencies, or a compromised build process.
    *   **Kernelsu Contribution:** As a piece of software, Kernelsu is susceptible to supply chain attacks. A compromised Kernelsu installation inherently introduces a significant attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject malicious code into the Kernelsu source code repository, which would then be included in official builds. A compromised dependency used by Kernelsu could introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of devices using the affected version of Kernelsu, granting attackers persistent and privileged access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement secure development practices, including code signing and verification. Carefully manage dependencies and ensure they are from trusted sources. Secure the build and release pipeline. Provide mechanisms for users to verify the integrity of the Kernelsu installation.
