## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Kernelsu (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_kernelsu__critical_node_.md)

* **Goal:** Directly compromise the Kernelsu daemon process to gain control over its privileged operations.
* **Attack Methods:**
    * **Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Trigger overflow via crafted IPC message:** The Kernelsu daemon likely uses Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to receive requests from applications. Crafted malicious IPC messages could exploit buffer overflows or other memory corruption vulnerabilities in the daemon's parsing or processing logic.
    * **Exploit Logic Errors in Privilege Handling (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Bypass capability checks:** Flaws in the daemon's code that manages capability checks could allow an attacker to bypass these checks, gaining unauthorized access.
        * **Escalate privileges beyond intended scope:** Errors in the daemon's logic could allow an attacker to gain more privileges than intended, even if initial checks are passed. This could involve manipulating internal state or exploiting conditional logic errors.
    * **Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Leverage vulnerabilities in libraries used by Kernelsu:** Kernelsu likely relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the daemon.

* **Attack Methods:**
    * **Application Misusing Granted Capabilities:**
        * **Granted capabilities are used for unintended malicious actions:** Even with legitimate capabilities, a compromised application could misuse them for malicious purposes. For example, a file management app with `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` could be used to modify system files beyond its intended scope.

* **Goal:** Exploit vulnerabilities in how the application integrates with and uses Kernelsu.
* **Attack Methods:**
    * **Improper Input Validation Before Requesting Capabilities:**
        * **Inject malicious data into capability requests:** If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate input before requesting capabilities from Kernelsu, an attacker could inject malicious data into the request, potentially leading to the granting of unintended privileges.
    * **Storing Sensitive Data Accessible by Kernelsu:**
        * **Kernelsu's access allows reading sensitive application data:** If the application stores sensitive data in a location accessible by processes running with Kernelsu's elevated privileges, a compromised application (or an attacker who has gained some level of access via Kernelsu) could read this data.
