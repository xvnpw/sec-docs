# Threat Model Analysis for tiann/kernelsu

## Threat: [Unauthorized Root Access via Kernel Module Vulnerability](./threats/unauthorized_root_access_via_kernel_module_vulnerability.md)

**Threat:** Unauthorized Root Access via Kernel Module Vulnerability
*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability within the KernelSU kernel module. This could involve sending specially crafted ioctl calls or triggering memory corruption bugs. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, including the ability to read and write any data, control hardware, install persistent malware, and potentially brick the device.
*   **Affected KernelSU Component:** Kernel Module (specifically vulnerable functions or code paths within the module).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update KernelSU to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Thoroughly audit the KernelSU source code for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the kernel module.
    *   Employ memory safety techniques in kernel module development.

## Threat: [User-Space Manager Privilege Escalation](./threats/user-space_manager_privilege_escalation.md)

**Threat:** User-Space Manager Privilege Escalation
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the KernelSU user-space manager application or daemon. This could involve exploiting insecure IPC mechanisms, buffer overflows, or logic flaws. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain root privileges from a less privileged context.
*   **Impact:** Ability to grant unauthorized root access to malicious applications, modify KernelSU configurations, and potentially compromise the entire system.
*   **Affected KernelSU Component:** User-Space Manager Application/Daemon (specific components handling IPC, permission management, or configuration).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in the user-space manager.
    *   Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.
    *   Regularly audit the user-space manager code for security flaws.

## Threat: [Malicious Application Granted Root Access](./threats/malicious_application_granted_root_access.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Application Granted Root Access
*   **Description:** A user unknowingly grants root access to a malicious application through the KernelSU manager. The malicious application then leverages its root privileges to perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact:** Data theft, installation of malware, modification of system settings, tracking user activity, and potentially financial loss.
*   **Affected KernelSU Component:** User-Space Manager Application (the permission granting mechanism).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Educate users about the risks of granting root access to untrusted applications.
    *   Implement clear and informative permission request dialogs in the KernelSU manager.
    *   Provide users with the ability to easily revoke root access from applications.
    *   Consider implementing reputation-based systems or warnings for applications requesting root.

## Threat: [Bypassing Application Security Measures](./threats/bypassing_application_security_measures.md)

**Threat:** Bypassing Application Security Measures
*   **Description:** An application with legitimate root access granted by KernelSU exploits this privilege to bypass standard Android security measures like SELinux policies or permission checks, accessing resources it shouldn't normally have access to.
*   **Impact:** Access to sensitive data belonging to other applications, modification of protected system files, and potential compromise of the entire system's security posture.
*   **Affected KernelSU Component:** Kernel Module (the mechanism that grants and enforces root privileges).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encourage developers to design applications with the least privilege principle in mind, even when root access is available.
    *   Implement application-level security measures to restrict actions even with root privileges.
    *   Consider providing granular control over the capabilities granted to root applications through KernelSU.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Root Access](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_root_access.md)

**Threat:** Data Exfiltration via Root Access
*   **Description:** An application with root access granted by KernelSU intentionally or unintentionally exfiltrates sensitive user data or application data without proper authorization.
*   **Impact:** Privacy violation, financial loss, reputational damage, and potential legal repercussions.
*   **Affected KernelSU Component:** Kernel Module (the underlying access control mechanism that allows root access).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict data access controls within applications, even with root privileges.
    *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious data transfers.
    *   Educate users about the data access practices of applications they grant root access to.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on KernelSU](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_kernelsu.md)

**Threat:** Supply Chain Attack on KernelSU
*   **Description:** The KernelSU repository or distribution channels are compromised, leading to the distribution of a malicious version of KernelSU containing backdoors or vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of devices using the malicious KernelSU version, potentially allowing attackers to gain root access and control over numerous devices.
*   **Affected KernelSU Component:** Entire KernelSU distribution (repository, build system, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Verify the integrity of KernelSU downloads using checksums and signatures.
    *   Only download KernelSU from trusted and official sources.
    *   The KernelSU development team should implement robust security measures for their development and distribution infrastructure.

## Threat: [Exploiting IPC Between Application and KernelSU Components](./threats/exploiting_ipc_between_application_and_kernelsu_components.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting IPC Between Application and KernelSU Components
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms used by an application to interact with KernelSU components. This could involve injecting malicious commands or data.
*   **Impact:** Gaining unauthorized control over KernelSU functionality or escalating privileges.
*   **Affected KernelSU Component:** IPC mechanisms (e.g., Binder interfaces, sockets) used by the KernelSU module and user-space manager.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure IPC channels using authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for data received through IPC.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing IPC interfaces.
