# Threat Model Analysis for tiann/kernelsu

## Threat: [Malicious Kernel Module Injection](./threats/malicious_kernel_module_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could trick the application or the user into loading a malicious kernel module *through KernelSU's module loading mechanism*. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application interacts with KernelSU's module loading API or by social engineering the user to install a malicious module that KernelSU then loads. Once loaded, the module runs with kernel privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, including data theft, device bricking, installation of persistent backdoors, and manipulation of system processes.
    *   **Affected KernelSU Component:** Module loading mechanism, specifically the functions or interfaces within KernelSU used for loading modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict verification of kernel modules before loading *through KernelSU*, such as signature checking enforced by KernelSU or the application.
        *   Avoid allowing the application to load arbitrary modules based on user input *via KernelSU's interfaces*.
        *   Educate users about the risks of installing untrusted kernel modules that KernelSU might load.
        *   Utilize KernelSU features to restrict module loading to specific, trusted paths.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Loaded Kernel Modules](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_loaded_kernel_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Even if the application loads legitimate kernel modules *using KernelSU*, those modules might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain kernel-level privileges, potentially by sending crafted input or triggering specific conditions that interact with the module loaded by KernelSU.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to malicious module injection, including system compromise, data theft, and privilege escalation. The scope depends on the specific vulnerability in the module.
    *   **Affected KernelSU Component:** The specific vulnerable kernel module loaded *via KernelSU*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only load kernel modules from trusted and reputable sources *through KernelSU*.
        *   Keep loaded kernel modules updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Implement sandboxing or isolation techniques to limit the impact of a compromised module loaded by KernelSU.
        *   Regularly audit and analyze the security of the kernel modules loaded by KernelSU.

## Threat: [Exploitation of KernelSU Daemon Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_kernelsu_daemon_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The KernelSU daemon itself might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass security checks *within KernelSU*, gain unauthorized root access, or disrupt the service. This could be done through local privilege escalation targeting the KernelSU daemon's processes.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, bypassing of KernelSU's intended security mechanisms, and potential denial of service for applications relying on KernelSU.
    *   **Affected KernelSU Component:** The KernelSU daemon process and its associated libraries and interfaces.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the KernelSU installation updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Monitor the KernelSU project for reported vulnerabilities and apply updates promptly.
        *   Limit access to the KernelSU daemon's interfaces.
        *   Consider using SELinux or other security mechanisms to further restrict the KernelSU daemon's capabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) with KernelSU](./threats/insecure_inter-process_communication__ipc__with_kernelsu.md)

*   **Description:** The application communicates with the KernelSU service to request privileged operations. If *KernelSU's IPC mechanism* is not secured properly, an attacker could potentially intercept or manipulate these requests. This could allow them to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges *by impersonating the application's legitimate requests to KernelSU*.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to perform actions as the root user *through KernelSU*, potentially leading to data theft, system modification, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected KernelSU Component:** The IPC mechanisms used by applications to communicate with the KernelSU daemon (e.g., sockets, Binder) and the KernelSU daemon's handling of these requests.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure KernelSU uses secure IPC mechanisms with authentication and authorization.
        *   Validate all input received *by KernelSU* from applications before performing privileged operations.
        *   Minimize the privileges granted to applications through the KernelSU interface.
        *   Avoid exposing the KernelSU IPC interface to untrusted processes.

## Threat: [Bypass of KernelSU's Security Mechanisms](./threats/bypass_of_kernelsu's_security_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might discover ways to bypass the security features implemented by KernelSU itself, such as permission controls or module verification. This could allow unauthorized access to privileged functionalities *managed by KernelSU*.
    *   **Impact:** Circumvention of intended security measures *within KernelSU*, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Affected KernelSU Component:** The core security mechanisms and enforcement points within the KernelSU framework, such as permission checks and module verification processes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay informed about the latest security research and potential bypass techniques for KernelSU.
        *   Encourage users to use the latest stable version of KernelSU with all security patches.
        *   Implement additional security layers on top of KernelSU's built-in mechanisms.
