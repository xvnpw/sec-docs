# Attack Surface Analysis for tiann/kernelsu

## Attack Surface: [Kernel Module Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/kernel_module_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **How KernelSU Contributes to the Attack Surface:** KernelSU introduces a new kernel module, which, like any kernel code, can contain vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities grants direct kernel-level access.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the KernelSU module's ioctl handler could allow an attacker to overwrite kernel memory by sending a specially crafted ioctl call.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, arbitrary code execution in kernel space, data corruption, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rigorous code reviews and security audits of the KernelSU module.
        *   Static and dynamic analysis during KernelSU development.
        *   Keeping the KernelSU module updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Implementing robust input validation and sanitization within the kernel module.

## Attack Surface: [User-Space Privilege Escalation via KernelSU's Granting Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/user-space_privilege_escalation_via_kernelsu's_granting_mechanism.md)

*   **How KernelSU Contributes to the Attack Surface:** KernelSU provides a mechanism for applications to request and be granted root privileges. Flaws in this mechanism can allow unauthorized applications or compromised applications to gain root access.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the user-space component that manages root grants could allow an attacker to bypass authentication checks and trick the system into granting root access to a malicious application.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the device, access to sensitive data, ability to install malware, modification of system settings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for granting root privileges.
        *   Principle of least privilege â€“ only grant necessary permissions.
        *   Secure inter-process communication (IPC) between the application and KernelSU's user-space components.
        *   Regularly review and audit the code responsible for granting root access.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure from Kernel Space](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_from_kernel_space.md)

*   **How KernelSU Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The KernelSU module interacts directly with the kernel and might inadvertently expose sensitive kernel information to user-space processes.
    *   **Example:** The KernelSU module might expose kernel memory addresses or internal data structures through its interfaces, which could be used by attackers to bypass security features or plan further attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), gaining insights into kernel internals for exploitation, leaking sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Careful design of the KernelSU module to minimize information leakage.
        *   Strict access control on the information exposed by the module.
        *   Thorough testing to identify and prevent unintended information disclosure.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) against the Kernel via KernelSU](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__against_the_kernel_via_kernelsu.md)

*   **How KernelSU Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Malicious or poorly designed applications using KernelSU could send malformed or excessive requests to the kernel module, potentially causing a denial of service.
    *   **Example:** An application could repeatedly send invalid ioctl calls to the KernelSU module, consuming kernel resources and leading to a system crash or unresponsiveness.
    *   **Impact:** System instability, crashes, temporary unavailability of the device.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rate limiting and input validation within the KernelSU module to prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   Robust error handling in the kernel module to gracefully handle invalid requests.
        *   Monitoring system resources to detect and mitigate potential DoS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of IPC Vulnerabilities in KernelSU Communication](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_ipc_vulnerabilities_in_kernelsu_communication.md)

*   **How KernelSU Contributes to the Attack Surface:** KernelSU relies on inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms between user-space components and the kernel module. Vulnerabilities in this communication channel can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the shared memory region used for communication could allow a malicious application to inject code or manipulate data intended for the kernel module.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution in kernel space, bypassing security checks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Using secure IPC mechanisms with authentication and integrity checks.
        *   Careful validation and sanitization of data exchanged through IPC.
        *   Limiting the access rights of processes communicating with KernelSU components.
