## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Root > Exploit KernelSU Core Vulnerabilities > Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_root__exploit_kernelsu_core_vulnerabilities__buffer_overflow__critical_.md)

*   **Node:** Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL]
    *   **Description:** A classic vulnerability where an attacker provides more input data than a buffer can handle, overwriting adjacent memory in the kernel. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the kernel context.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Malicious Module Request:** A specially crafted module request with oversized parameters sent to a KernelSU system call that lacks proper input validation.
        *   **Manipulated Configuration:**  A tampered KernelSU configuration file containing excessively long strings in fields that are not properly size-checked when loaded.
        *   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** If KernelSU uses IPC, a malicious application could send an oversized message to a KernelSU component.
        *   **Exploiting a Vulnerable Kernel Interface:** If KernelSU interacts with other kernel interfaces, a buffer overflow in *that* interface could be triggered through KernelSU.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Root > Exploit KernelSU Core Vulnerabilities > Race Condition [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_root__exploit_kernelsu_core_vulnerabilities__race_condition__critical_.md)

*   **Node:** Race Condition [CRITICAL]
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability where the outcome of a KernelSU operation depends on the unpredictable timing of multiple threads or processes within the kernel. Exploiting this can lead to privilege escalation or denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Permission Granting/Revocation Race:** Rapidly requesting and revoking permissions for a module or application, hoping to catch KernelSU in an inconsistent state where permissions are granted incorrectly.
        *   **Module Loading/Unloading Race:**  Attempting to load or unload a module while another process is interacting with it, potentially leading to a use-after-free or double-free vulnerability.
        *   **Resource Management Race:**  Exploiting a race condition in how KernelSU manages kernel resources (memory, file descriptors, etc.), potentially leading to resource exhaustion or corruption.
        *   **Signal Handling Race:** If KernelSU uses signal handlers, a race condition between the signal handler and the main thread could be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Root > Exploit KernelSU Module Vulnerabilities > Module Loading Bypass [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_root__exploit_kernelsu_module_vulnerabilities__module_loading_bypass__critical_.md)

*   **Node:** Module Loading Bypass [CRITICAL]
    *   **Description:** Bypassing KernelSU's security mechanisms to load a malicious, unsigned, or otherwise untrusted module. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Signature Forgery:**  Creating a fake digital signature that appears to be valid for a malicious module.
        *   **Signature Verification Bypass:**  Exploiting a vulnerability in the code that verifies module signatures, causing it to accept an invalid signature.
        *   **Checksum Bypass:**  Modifying a legitimate module and then finding a way to bypass the checksum verification that should detect the modification.
        *   **Loading from Untrusted Source:**  Tricking KernelSU into loading a module from an untrusted location (e.g., a malicious website or a compromised file share) instead of the designated module repository.
        *   **Exploiting a Vulnerability in the Module Loader:**  Finding a flaw in the code that loads modules, allowing it to load a module that should have been rejected.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Root > Abuse Legitimate KernelSU Features > Misuse SU Grant Logic [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_root__abuse_legitimate_kernelsu_features__misuse_su_grant_logic__high-risk_.md)

*   **Node:** Misuse SU Grant Logic [HIGH-RISK]
    *   **Description:** Tricking a user or another application into granting root access to a malicious application via KernelSU's intended functionality. This does not involve exploiting a technical vulnerability in KernelSU itself, but rather misusing its features.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Social Engineering:**  Creating a malicious application with a misleading name, icon, or description that requests root access, making the user believe it's a legitimate request.  For example, a fake "System Update" app.
        *   **Misleading Prompt:**  Crafting a prompt that obscures the true purpose of the root access request, making it seem less dangerous than it is.
        *   **Exploiting a Vulnerable Rooted Application:**  If another application already has root access (granted legitimately), a malicious application could exploit a vulnerability in *that* application to perform actions on its behalf, effectively gaining root access indirectly.
        *   **Clickjacking/Overlay Attack:**  Using a transparent overlay to trick the user into tapping the "Grant" button on the SU prompt when they think they are interacting with a different application.
        *   **Prompt Fatigue:** If the user is constantly bombarded with legitimate root access requests, they may become less cautious and grant access to a malicious request without careful consideration.
