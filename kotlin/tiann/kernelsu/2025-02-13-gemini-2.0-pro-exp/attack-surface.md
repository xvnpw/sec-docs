# Attack Surface Analysis for tiann/kernelsu

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Kernel Module Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_kernel_module_loading.md)

*   **Description:**  The ability to load arbitrary kernel modules is a fundamental feature of KernelSU, but it also presents the most significant risk.  Malicious or vulnerable modules can compromise the entire system.
*   **How KernelSU Contributes:** KernelSU *directly enables* the loading of kernel modules, bypassing standard Android restrictions.
*   **Example:** An attacker distributes a seemingly benign module (e.g., a "battery optimizer") that contains hidden code to exfiltrate data or disable security features.  A user installs this module via KernelSU.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft, denial of service, permanent device bricking.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Implement strict module verification using code signing and cryptographic hashes.  Maintain a whitelist of approved modules and/or a blacklist of known malicious ones.
        *   Design modules with the principle of least privilege, minimizing their access to kernel resources.
        *   Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing of all modules.
        *   Provide a secure and verifiable update mechanism for modules.
        *   Explore (if feasible) sandboxing techniques for modules, although this is extremely challenging at the kernel level.
    *   **User:**
        *   *Only* install modules from trusted sources.  Avoid modules from unknown developers or unofficial repositories.
        *   Carefully review the permissions requested by a module before installing it.
        *   Keep KernelSU and all modules updated to the latest versions.
        *   Use a security solution that can detect malicious kernel modules (if available).

## Attack Surface: [KernelSU Manager Application Compromise](./attack_surfaces/kernelsu_manager_application_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** The KernelSU manager application is the gatekeeper for root access and module management.  If compromised, an attacker gains full control over KernelSU's functionality.
*   **How KernelSU Contributes:** The manager application is a *necessary component* of KernelSU, providing the user interface and controlling access to the kernel module.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the KernelSU manager application to gain code execution, allowing them to load malicious modules or grant root access to arbitrary applications.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, equivalent to malicious module loading.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Adhere to secure coding practices (input validation, output encoding, memory safety, etc.) when developing the manager application.
        *   Minimize the attack surface of the manager by exposing only essential functionality.
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and validation to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing of the manager application.
        *   Implement tamper detection and prevention mechanisms.
        *   Provide a secure update mechanism for the manager application.
    *   **User:**
        *   Only install the KernelSU manager from the official source (e.g., the official GitHub repository).
        *   Keep the manager application updated to the latest version.
        *   Be cautious of any applications requesting unusual permissions that might interact with the KernelSU manager.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive or Unintended Root Access Grants](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_or_unintended_root_access_grants.md)

*   **Description:** KernelSU allows granting root access to applications.  If an application is granted root unnecessarily or with excessive privileges, a compromise of that application leads to a root compromise.
*   **How KernelSU Contributes:** KernelSU provides the *mechanism* for granting root access, and its configuration determines which applications receive it.
*   **Example:** A user grants root access to a seemingly harmless game, but the game contains a hidden vulnerability.  An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain root access via the game.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data theft, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Design applications to *avoid* requiring root access whenever possible.
        *   If root access is absolutely necessary, request only the *minimum* required permissions.
        *   Clearly document the reasons for requiring root access and the specific permissions needed.
    *   **User:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when granting root access to applications.  Only grant root to applications you *absolutely trust* and that have a clear and legitimate need for it.
        *   Regularly review the list of applications with root access and revoke access for any that no longer need it.
        *   Understand the risks associated with granting root access.

## Attack Surface: [Bypass of KernelSU's Access Control Mechanisms](./attack_surfaces/bypass_of_kernelsu's_access_control_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in KernelSU's internal logic for granting or denying root access could allow malicious applications to bypass these controls.
*   **How KernelSU Contributes:** KernelSU's core functionality *is* access control for root privileges; a flaw here directly undermines its purpose.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers a race condition in KernelSU's permission checking logic, allowing their application to gain root access before the check is completed.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized root access, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test the access control logic in both the KernelSU manager and the kernel module.
        *   Use formal verification techniques (if feasible) to prove the correctness of the access control mechanisms.
        *   Implement multiple, independent layers of access control checks.
        *   Regularly audit the code for potential bypass vulnerabilities.
    *   **User:**
        *   Keep KernelSU updated to the latest version to receive security patches.
        *   There is limited direct user mitigation for this beyond keeping the software updated.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** A compromised update mechanism for KernelSU or its modules could allow attackers to distribute malicious code.
*   **How KernelSU Contributes:** KernelSU relies on an update mechanism to deliver new features and security patches.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the KernelSU update server and replaces the legitimate KernelSU manager with a malicious version.
*   **Impact:** Widespread system compromise of devices using KernelSU.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Implement a secure update mechanism using code signing, cryptographic hashes, and HTTPS.
        *   Protect the update server with strong security measures.
        *   Regularly audit the update mechanism for vulnerabilities.
    *   **User:**
        *   Only install updates from the official KernelSU source.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded updates (if possible) before installing them.
