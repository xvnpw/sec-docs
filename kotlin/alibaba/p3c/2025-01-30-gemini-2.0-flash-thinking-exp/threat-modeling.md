# Threat Model Analysis for alibaba/p3c

## Threat: [Missed Security Vulnerabilities due to Incomplete P3C Coverage](./threats/missed_security_vulnerabilities_due_to_incomplete_p3c_coverage.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application code that were not detected by P3C. This happens because P3C is not a comprehensive security scanner and focuses primarily on coding style and best practices, potentially overlooking certain types of security flaws. Attackers can use common web attack techniques like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or business logic flaws that P3C might not flag.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, service disruption, reputational damage, financial loss due to exploitation of undetected vulnerabilities.

**P3C Component Affected:** Rule Engine, Static Analysis Core

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Combine P3C with dedicated security scanning tools.
* Conduct manual security code reviews.
* Penetration testing.
* Security training for developers.

## Threat: [Over-reliance on Automated Tools & Neglecting Manual Security Reviews](./threats/over-reliance_on_automated_tools_&_neglecting_manual_security_reviews.md)

**Description:** Teams rely solely on P3C and other automated tools for security checks, neglecting manual security code reviews and penetration testing. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities that are not detectable by automated tools like P3C but would be identified through manual security assessments. Attackers often target complex business logic flaws or subtle vulnerabilities that require human understanding and context to identify.

**Impact:** Critical vulnerabilities are missed, leading to increased risk of security incidents, potential for significant data breaches and system compromise. False sense of security leading to inadequate security posture.

**P3C Component Affected:** Overall Security Strategy, Development Process Integration

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Adopt a layered security approach.
* Prioritize manual security code reviews.
* Regular penetration testing.
* Security champions program.
