# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Alibaba P3C, is a static code analysis tool for Java.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Improve the quality and reliability of Java code.
  - Reduce the number of bugs and vulnerabilities in Java applications.
  - Enforce coding standards and best practices within development teams.
  - Increase developer productivity by providing automated code reviews.
  - Facilitate easier code maintenance and refactoring.

- Business Risks:
  - False positives in analysis results can lead to wasted developer time.
  - False negatives can lead to undetected vulnerabilities in code.
  - Performance overhead of running static analysis might slow down development workflows.
  - Integration challenges with existing development tools and pipelines.
  - Lack of adoption by developers if the tool is perceived as too noisy or difficult to use.
  - Potential for security vulnerabilities within the P3C tool itself, which could be exploited if widely adopted.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Community Review - The project is open source, allowing for community review of the code, which can help identify and address potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented and described in: GitHub repository and community contributions.
  - security control: Static Analysis Tooling - P3C itself is a static analysis tool, which is a security control for identifying potential vulnerabilities in user code. Implemented and described in: Project documentation and code.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security - Security of the project relies on the vigilance and contributions of the open-source community.
  - accepted risk: Potential Vulnerabilities in P3C - Like any software, P3C itself may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Implement automated scanning of P3C's dependencies to identify and address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Secure Development Practices - Follow secure coding practices during the development of P3C itself, including code reviews and security testing.
  - security control: Security Vulnerability Reporting Process - Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities found in P3C.
  - security control: Release Signing and Verification - Sign releases of P3C artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity, allowing users to verify they are using official and untampered versions.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to the core functionality of P3C as a static analysis tool. If a web-based reporting or management interface is added in the future, authentication would be required to control access.
  - Authorization:
    - Not directly applicable to the core functionality of P3C. Authorization might be relevant if user roles and permissions are introduced for managing configurations or analysis results in future extensions.
  - Input Validation:
    - P3C must perform robust input validation on the source code it analyzes to prevent code injection or other attacks that could be triggered by maliciously crafted code. This is critical to ensure the tool itself is not vulnerable when analyzing potentially untrusted code.
  - Cryptography:
    - Not directly applicable to the core functionality of P3C. Cryptography might be relevant if features like secure storage of configurations or encrypted communication are added in the future.

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
  - GitHub triggers a GitHub Actions workflow upon code commit.
  - The workflow executes build and test steps to compile and verify the P3C project.
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and dependency scanning are performed on the P3C codebase to identify vulnerabilities.
  - Build artifacts (JAR files for CLI, plugin archives) are packaged.
  - Artifacts are digitally signed to ensure authenticity and integrity.
  - Signed artifacts are published to distribution channels like GitHub Releases and Maven Central for users to download and use.

- Build Process Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Build Process - Using GitHub Actions ensures a consistent and repeatable build process, reducing manual errors.
  - security control: Source Code Version Control - GitHub manages source code and tracks changes, providing auditability and rollback capabilities.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrated SAST tools scan the P3C codebase for potential security vulnerabilities during the build process.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Automated dependency scanning identifies known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by P3C.
  - security control: Artifact Signing - Digitally signing build artifacts ensures their integrity and authenticity, preventing tampering and allowing users to verify the source.
  - security control: Secure Artifact Repository - Publishing artifacts to trusted repositories like Maven Central and GitHub Releases ensures secure distribution.
  - security control: Access Control to Build System - Restricting access to GitHub Actions workflows and secrets to authorized personnel.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes We Are Trying to Protect:
  - Software Development Lifecycle: P3C aims to improve the quality and security of software developed using Java. Protecting the SDLC means ensuring the tools used within it are reliable and secure.
  - Code Quality Assurance: P3C is a tool for ensuring code quality. Protecting this process means ensuring the tool accurately identifies code quality issues and doesn't introduce new risks.

- Data We Are Trying to Protect and Their Sensitivity:
  - Source Code (Indirectly): P3C analyzes source code, but doesn't store or manage it directly. The sensitivity of the source code depends on the projects being analyzed. P3C should not expose or leak the source code it analyzes. Sensitivity: Low to High (depending on the analyzed code).
  - Analysis Results: P3C generates analysis results and reports. These results might contain information about potential vulnerabilities or code quality issues, which could be sensitive if exposed. Sensitivity: Medium.
  - P3C Configuration: Configuration settings for P3C rules and analysis parameters. Misconfiguration could lead to ineffective analysis or false positives/negatives. Sensitivity: Low.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the primary target users for P3C? Individual developers, small teams, or large organizations?
  - What are the most common deployment scenarios for P3C? Local CLI usage, CI/CD pipeline integration, or centralized server deployment?
  - Are there any specific regulatory compliance requirements that P3C aims to help users meet (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)?
  - Are there plans to extend P3C with features beyond static code analysis, such as runtime monitoring or security vulnerability remediation guidance?
  - What is the process for users to report issues or request features for P3C?

- Assumptions:
  - P3C is primarily intended for use by Java developers and development teams.
  - The main deployment method is integration into existing development workflows, including local development environments and CI/CD pipelines.
  - P3C is distributed as an open-source tool and relies on community contributions for maintenance and improvement.
  - Security is a significant concern for P3C users, and they expect the tool to be reliable and not introduce new security risks.
  - P3C is designed to be integrated with existing development tools and infrastructure, rather than requiring a standalone deployment environment.
