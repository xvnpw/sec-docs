## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate P3C Configuration to Introduce Vulnerabilities (AND) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_p3c_configuration_to_introduce_vulnerabilities__and___critical_.md)

*   This represents a high-risk path because successfully manipulating the P3C configuration directly undermines the security checks performed by the tool. This can be achieved by either injecting malicious rules or disabling existing security-relevant checks. The impact is significant as it allows vulnerable code to pass unnoticed.
    *   **Inject Malicious Rules into P3C Configuration:**
        *   **Modify .p3c Configuration File [CRITICAL]:** An attacker gains access to the `.p3c` configuration file and inserts custom rules that, while seemingly valid, introduce vulnerabilities or enforce insecure coding practices. This could involve directly editing the file or using automated tools.
        *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Repository/Development Environment [CRITICAL]:**  An attacker compromises the source code repository or a developer's environment. This allows them to directly modify the `.p3c` file within the repository, ensuring the malicious configuration is used by all developers.
    *   **Disable Security-Relevant Checks:**
        *   **Modify .p3c Configuration File [CRITICAL]:**  The attacker modifies the `.p3c` file to disable rules that are crucial for identifying security vulnerabilities. This could involve commenting out rules, changing their severity levels, or removing them entirely.
        *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Repository/Development Environment [CRITICAL]:** Similar to injecting malicious rules, gaining access to the repository allows the attacker to disable security checks within the shared configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the P3C Execution Environment (AND) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_p3c_execution_environment__and___critical_.md)

*   This path is high-risk because controlling the environment where P3C is executed allows attackers to influence the analysis process itself, potentially leading to vulnerabilities being missed or even introducing vulnerabilities through the execution environment.
    *   **Inject Malicious Code into P3C Execution:**
        *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Developer Machines [CRITICAL]:**  An attacker compromises a developer's machine and modifies the P3C installation or related files. This could involve replacing P3C binaries with malicious versions or injecting code that runs during the analysis process.
    *   **Manipulate P3C Dependencies:** An attacker introduces vulnerable dependencies that P3C relies on. This could be done through dependency confusion attacks, compromising internal artifact repositories, or exploiting known vulnerabilities in existing dependencies. While not explicitly a critical node in the sub-tree structure, it's a critical aspect of this high-risk path.
    *   **Influence P3C Execution Parameters:**
        *   **Modify Build Scripts or IDE Configurations [CRITICAL]:** An attacker modifies build scripts (e.g., Maven `pom.xml`, Gradle `build.gradle`) or IDE configurations to alter how P3C is executed. This could involve disabling P3C execution, changing the ruleset used, or introducing malicious parameters.
            *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Repository/Development Environment [CRITICAL]:**  Access to the repository allows the attacker to modify the build scripts, ensuring the altered execution parameters are used during the build process for all developers.
