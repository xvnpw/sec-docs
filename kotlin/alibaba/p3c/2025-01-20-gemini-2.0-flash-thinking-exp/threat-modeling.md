# Threat Model Analysis for alibaba/p3c

## Threat: [Disabling Critical Security Checks via Configuration Tampering](./threats/disabling_critical_security_checks_via_configuration_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the P3C configuration files (e.g., `.p3c` files) and modifies them to disable rules that detect critical security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting). This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in systems where these files are stored or through compromised accounts with access to these files.

**Impact:** Critical security vulnerabilities are no longer detected during static analysis, leading to their potential introduction into the production application. This could result in data breaches, unauthorized access, or other severe security incidents.

**Affected P3C Component:** Configuration Loading Module, Rule Execution Engine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict access controls and permissions on P3C configuration files.
*   Store configuration files in secure locations with appropriate access restrictions.
*   Utilize version control for P3C configuration files to track changes and enable rollback.
*   Implement integrity checks or signing for configuration files to detect unauthorized modifications.
*   Regularly audit P3C configuration settings.

## Threat: [Exploiting Outdated P3C Rules to Bypass Detection](./threats/exploiting_outdated_p3c_rules_to_bypass_detection.md)

**Description:** An attacker is aware that the P3C rule set used by the development team is outdated and does not cover newly discovered vulnerabilities or attack patterns. They craft code containing these vulnerabilities, knowing that P3C will not flag them.

**Impact:** The application becomes vulnerable to attacks that would be detected by a more up-to-date P3C rule set. This can lead to various security breaches depending on the nature of the bypassed vulnerability.

**Affected P3C Component:** Rule Database, Rule Matching Engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Establish a process for regularly updating the P3C rule set to the latest version.
*   Subscribe to P3C release notes and security advisories.
*   Consider contributing to the P3C rule set or creating custom rules for specific organizational needs.
*   Implement a mechanism to automatically check for and notify about available rule updates.

## Threat: [False Negatives Leading to Undetected Vulnerabilities](./threats/false_negatives_leading_to_undetected_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Due to limitations in the P3C rule set or the complexity of the code, P3C might fail to identify certain types of vulnerabilities present in the application.

**Impact:**  Vulnerabilities remain undetected and can be exploited by attackers.

**Affected P3C Component:** Rule Database, Rule Matching Engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Combine P3C with other security testing methodologies, such as dynamic application security testing (DAST) and manual code reviews.
*   Understand the limitations of P3C and the types of vulnerabilities it may not detect.
*   Continuously evaluate and integrate new security analysis tools and techniques.
