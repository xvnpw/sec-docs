# Attack Surface Analysis for alibaba/p3c

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Vulnerability - Compromised P3C Dependency](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_vulnerability_-_compromised_p3c_dependency.md)

* **Description:** The risk of using a compromised version of the P3C library itself.
    * **How P3C Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Introducing P3C as a dependency inherently relies on the security of the dependency management system. A compromised P3C library, if included, directly injects malicious code into the application's build or runtime.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains control of the P3C repository or a mirror and uploads a backdoored version of the library. Developers unknowingly include this malicious version in their project.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the build process or even the application runtime, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        * Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies using checksums or signatures.
        * Utilize private or trusted artifact repositories with strict access controls.
        * Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Vulnerability - Dependency Confusion/Substitution](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_vulnerability_-_dependency_confusionsubstitution.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits the dependency resolution process to substitute a legitimate P3C dependency with a malicious one.
    * **How P3C Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Like any external dependency, the process of including P3C makes it susceptible to dependency confusion attacks if not managed carefully.
    * **Example:** An attacker creates a malicious library with the same name as P3C but a higher version number on a public repository. If the project's dependency management is not configured correctly, it might pull the malicious version instead of the legitimate one.
    * **Impact:** Inclusion of malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution, data theft, or other malicious actions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Configure dependency management tools to prioritize trusted repositories.
        * Utilize namespace prefixes or group IDs to avoid naming collisions.
        * Implement dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent dependency versions.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Custom Rule Sets](./attack_surfaces/malicious_custom_rule_sets.md)

* **Description:** The risk of loading and using maliciously crafted custom rule sets for P3C analysis.
    * **How P3C Contributes to the Attack Surface:** P3C's functionality includes the ability to load and execute custom rule sets. If an attacker can influence the configuration to load a malicious rule set, it can lead to arbitrary code execution during the analysis phase.
    * **Example:** An attacker convinces a developer to use a custom rule set from an untrusted source. This rule set contains code that executes malicious commands when P3C analyzes the project.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution during the static analysis phase, potentially compromising the build environment or developer machines.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only use custom rule sets from trusted and verified sources.
        * Implement code review for custom rule sets before integrating them.
        * Restrict access to P3C configuration files and rule set locations.
        * Consider using a "sandbox" environment for testing new or untrusted rule sets.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of P3C Analysis Results](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_p3c_analysis_results.md)

* **Description:** Attackers manipulate the output of P3C analysis to conceal vulnerabilities or falsely report a secure state.
    * **How P3C Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The integrity of P3C's output is crucial for its effectiveness. If an attacker can tamper with these results, it undermines the security checks provided by P3C.
    * **Example:** In a compromised CI/CD pipeline, an attacker modifies the P3C report to remove findings of critical vulnerabilities, allowing vulnerable code to be deployed without raising alarms.
    * **Impact:** Deployment of vulnerable code, leading to potential exploitation in production.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the build environment to prevent unauthorized modifications.
        * Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of P3C analysis reports (e.g., digital signatures).
        * Combine P3C analysis with other security testing methods for a more comprehensive approach.
        * Store P3C reports securely and control access to them.
