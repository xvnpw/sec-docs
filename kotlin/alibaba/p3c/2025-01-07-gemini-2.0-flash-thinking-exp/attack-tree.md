## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in P3C Configuration or Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_p3c_configuration_or_usage.md)

*   Attack Vector: Supply Malicious or Incorrect P3C Rule Set [HIGH RISK]
    *   Goal: Cause P3C to overlook vulnerabilities or introduce false positives, leading to insecure code being deployed.
    *   How:
        *   Compromise the repository where P3C rules are stored (e.g., Git) [HIGH RISK]
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High (widespread undetected vulnerabilities)
            *   Effort: Medium (requires access to the repository)
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate (understanding of version control)
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (requires monitoring of rule changes)
    *   Impact:
        *   Undetected vulnerabilities in the application.
        *   Developers become desensitized to P3C warnings due to false positives.
    *   Actionable Insights:
        *   Implement strict access control and code review for P3C rule changes.
        *   Regularly audit P3C rule sets for correctness and potential malicious additions.
        *   Use a version control system for P3C rules and track changes.

*   Attack Vector: Manipulate P3C Configuration to Exclude Vulnerable Code or Paths [HIGH RISK]
    *   Goal: Prevent P3C from analyzing critical sections of the code containing vulnerabilities.
    *   How:
        *   Gain access to the P3C configuration file (e.g., .p3c) [HIGH RISK]
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Medium to High (specific vulnerabilities missed)
            *   Effort: Low to Medium (depending on file access)
            *   Skill Level: Basic to Intermediate (file system access)
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (requires monitoring configuration changes)
    *   Impact:
        *   Vulnerable code is deployed without being analyzed by P3C.
    *   Actionable Insights:
        *   Secure the P3C configuration file with appropriate permissions.
        *   Implement code review for changes to P3C configuration.
        *   Monitor P3C configuration for unexpected exclusions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in P3C Tool Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_p3c_tool_itself.md)

*   Attack Vector: Supply Malicious Input to P3C Analyzer
    *   Goal: Cause P3C to crash, malfunction, or produce incorrect results by providing specially crafted code.
    *   How:
        *   Introduce code that exploits parsing vulnerabilities or resource exhaustion in the P3C analyzer.
            *   Likelihood: Low
            *   Impact: Medium (build process disruption, potential for missed vulnerabilities)
            *   Effort: Medium to High (requires understanding of P3C internals or fuzzing)
            *   Skill Level: Advanced
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (may cause obvious errors in the build process)
    *   Impact:
        *   P3C fails to analyze the code, leading to undetected vulnerabilities.
        *   Potential denial-of-service of the build process if P3C crashes.
    *   Actionable Insights:
        *   Keep P3C updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Isolate the P3C execution environment to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

*   Attack Vector: Exploit Dependencies of P3C
    *   Goal: Compromise the application indirectly by exploiting vulnerabilities in P3C's dependencies.
    *   How:
        *   Identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the libraries used by P3C.
            *   Likelihood: Low to Medium (depending on the dependencies)
            *   Impact: Medium to High (depending on the vulnerability)
            *   Effort: Medium (using known exploits) to High (finding new ones)
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced (vulnerability exploitation)
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (requires dependency scanning)
        *   Supply a malicious dependency that gets incorporated into the P3C build process (if applicable).
            *   Likelihood: Very Low
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: High (requires compromising dependency repositories)
            *   Skill Level: Advanced
            *   Detection Difficulty: High (requires strict dependency verification)
    *   Impact:
        *   Potential for remote code execution or other compromises within the build environment.
    *   Actionable Insights:
        *   Regularly scan P3C's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement dependency management best practices.
