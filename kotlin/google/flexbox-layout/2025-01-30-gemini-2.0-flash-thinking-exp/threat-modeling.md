# Threat Model Analysis for google/flexbox-layout

## Threat: [Client-Side DoS via Layout Complexity](./threats/client-side_dos_via_layout_complexity.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts or injects excessively complex layout configurations (e.g., deeply nested flex items, extremely large number of items, computationally expensive flexbox properties) into the application's UI. The `flexbox-layout` engine attempts to render this complex layout, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources on the user's browser. This can lead to browser slowdown, unresponsiveness, or crashes. Attackers might achieve this by manipulating URL parameters, form inputs, or by injecting malicious code that dynamically generates complex layouts.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service for the application user. Users experience degraded performance, application unresponsiveness, or browser crashes, making the application unusable. This can lead to user frustration, abandonment, and reputational damage for the application. In a wider context, this could be part of a larger DoS attack targeting client-side resources.
*   **Affected Component:** `flexbox-layout` core layout engine, specifically the layout calculation and rendering functions. The vulnerability lies in the library's potential inefficiency in handling extremely complex layout inputs.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize any user-provided data that influences layout configurations to prevent injection of malicious or overly complex layouts.
    *   **Layout Complexity Limits:** Implement limits on layout complexity, such as maximum number of flex items, nesting depth, or usage of specific resource-intensive flexbox properties.
    *   **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor client-side performance metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption) in areas using `flexbox-layout` to detect potential DoS conditions.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Review code that generates or processes layout configurations to identify potential areas for optimization and prevent unintended complexity.
    *   **Rate Limiting (if applicable):** If layout configurations are generated based on user actions, consider rate limiting requests to prevent rapid-fire attempts to overload the client.
