# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project provides a flexible layout library, aiming to simplify the creation of complex user interfaces across different platforms. The primary business priority is to empower developers to build sophisticated and responsive UIs more efficiently, reducing development time and improving UI consistency. This can lead to faster product iterations and a better user experience for applications utilizing the library.

Key business goals include:
- Increasing developer productivity in UI development.
- Enabling creation of more adaptable and responsive user interfaces.
- Reducing UI development complexity and maintenance overhead.
- Fostering innovation in UI design by providing a powerful layout tool.

The most important business risks associated with this project are:
- Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited in applications using it, leading to data breaches or application malfunctions.
- Performance issues within the layout library could negatively impact the performance of applications, resulting in poor user experience and potential user churn.
- Compatibility problems with different platforms or devices could lead to inconsistent UI rendering or application crashes, damaging user trust and brand reputation.
- Lack of adoption by the developer community would negate the benefits of the library and represent a wasted investment.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Public code repository on GitHub, allowing for community security review. Implemented in: GitHub platform.
- security control: Google's internal code review processes before code is published. Implemented in: Google's internal development workflow.
- security control: Use of standard build tools and potentially CI/CD pipelines with basic security checks (linters, static analysis). Implemented in: Project's build and release process (details not publicly available).
- accepted risk: Open-source nature implies reliance on community for vulnerability discovery and reporting, which might have delays.
- accepted risk:  Potential for supply chain vulnerabilities if dependencies are not carefully managed.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerable dependencies.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the library, even as an open-source project.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and patching process, with public communication of security advisories.
- security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a layout library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of applications using the library.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a layout library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using the library.
- Input validation: While the library primarily deals with layout specifications, ensure robust input validation for any configuration parameters or APIs that accept external input to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. Focus on validating layout properties and style attributes.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for a layout library. However, if the library were to handle or process any sensitive data (which is not expected in a layout library), appropriate cryptographic measures would be necessary in those specific areas.

3. Build System checks out the latest code from Version Control.
4. Build System resolves dependencies using a Dependency Manager (e.g., Maven, npm).
5. Build System compiles and tests the code using Build Tools (e.g., Gradle, npm scripts).
6. Build System performs Security Checks, including Static Application Security Testing (SAST), linters, and dependency scanning to identify potential vulnerabilities.
7. Build System packages the build artifacts into distributable packages.
8. Build System publishes the Package Artifacts to the Package Repository (e.g., Maven Central, npm registry).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Secure and reliable distribution of the Flexbox Layout Library to developers.
- Maintaining the integrity and availability of the library to ensure developers can build applications effectively.
- Protecting applications that use the library from vulnerabilities originating from the library itself.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code of the Flexbox Layout Library: Intellectual property, public but modifications should be controlled. Sensitivity: Medium.
- Build artifacts (packages):  Should be protected from tampering to ensure integrity for developers using the library. Sensitivity: Medium.
- Vulnerability reports: Information about security weaknesses in the library. Should be handled confidentially until patches are released. Sensitivity: High (initially), Medium (after patch).
