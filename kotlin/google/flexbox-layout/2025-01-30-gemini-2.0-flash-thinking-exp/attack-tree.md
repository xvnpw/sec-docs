                * Manipulate flexbox properties to distort or hide legitimate content.
                * Present misleading or spoofed content to the user by altering the intended layout.
        * [OR] **[HIGH RISK PATH] Resource Intensive Layouts for Client-Side DoS [HIGH RISK PATH]**
            * Deliver extremely complex layout specifications to the client.
            * Cause client-side browser or application to become unresponsive due to heavy layout processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application using flexbox-layout [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_application_using_flexbox-layout__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate attacker goal. Success means the attacker has achieved their objective by exploiting flexbox-layout.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in flexbox-layout Library [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical_node__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_flexbox-layout_library__critical_node_.md)

This node represents a direct attack on the flexbox-layout library itself. While code execution vulnerabilities are less likely in a mature library, DoS vulnerabilities are a more probable and impactful sub-path within this node.
