### 5. Impact Assessment and Justification

The mitigation strategy is assessed to have a **"Medium reduction"** impact on "All Threats Related to flexbox-layout Usage". This assessment is justified as follows:

*   **Code reviews are a highly effective preventative control:** They provide human oversight and can catch a wide range of security issues, including those related to logic flaws, insecure configurations, and improper data handling, which are relevant to `flexbox-layout` usage.
*   **Targeted focus enhances effectiveness:** By specifically focusing on `flexbox-layout` and layout data handling, the code reviews become more targeted and efficient in identifying relevant security risks compared to generic code reviews.
*   **Multi-layered approach:** The strategy incorporates multiple components (training, focused review, secure patterns, static analysis, documentation) which strengthens its overall effectiveness and provides a more robust defense.
*   **Human element limitations:** Code reviews are still subject to human error, reviewer expertise limitations, and time constraints.  They are not a foolproof solution and may not catch all vulnerabilities, especially subtle or complex ones.
*   **Static analysis complements but is not a panacea:** Static analysis can automate vulnerability detection but may produce false positives/negatives and might not cover all types of vulnerabilities related to `flexbox-layout` usage.
*   **Dependency on consistent implementation:** The effectiveness of this strategy heavily relies on consistent and diligent implementation of all its components, including training, focused reviews, and documentation maintenance.  Inconsistent application can significantly reduce its impact.

Therefore, while code reviews focusing on `flexbox-layout` offer a significant improvement in security posture and can effectively mitigate many risks, they are not a complete solution and should be considered as part of a broader security strategy. The "Medium reduction" impact reflects the substantial preventative capabilities of code reviews while acknowledging their inherent limitations and the need for complementary security measures.
