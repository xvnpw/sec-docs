# Threat Model Analysis for google/flexbox-layout

## Threat: [Malicious Layout Input Leading to Integer Overflow](./threats/malicious_layout_input_leading_to_integer_overflow.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides crafted layout input with extremely large values for dimensions, flex factors, or other properties. The `flexbox-layout` library's internal calculations might not properly handle these large values, leading to integer overflows within the library's code. This can result in incorrect memory allocation sizes or incorrect calculations by the library.

**Impact:** Memory corruption within the application's memory space (due to the library's actions), potentially leading to crashes or exploitable vulnerabilities. Incorrect layout calculations by the library could lead to unexpected application behavior or denial of service if the application relies on correct layout information provided by the library.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Malicious Layout Input Causing Excessive Memory Allocation](./threats/malicious_layout_input_causing_excessive_memory_allocation.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts layout input with a very large number of flex items, deeply nested structures, or extremely large dimensions. When `flexbox-layout` processes this input, its internal memory allocation routines attempt to allocate excessive memory to represent and process this complex layout.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion within the application's process. The application or the system it runs on may become unresponsive or crash because of the library's resource consumption.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Malicious Layout Input Triggering Infinite Loops or Excessive Computation](./threats/malicious_layout_input_triggering_infinite_loops_or_excessive_computation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides specific combinations of layout properties (e.g., conflicting constraints, circular dependencies) that trigger algorithmic inefficiencies or infinite loops within the `flexbox-layout` library's layout calculation engine. The library gets stuck in a computationally intensive loop.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to CPU exhaustion. The application becomes unresponsive as the CPU is consumed by the `flexbox-layout` library's layout calculation process.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Use-After-Free or Double-Free Vulnerabilities in `flexbox-layout`](./threats/use-after-free_or_double-free_vulnerabilities_in__flexbox-layout_.md)

**Description:** Bugs within the `flexbox-layout` library's memory management logic could lead to attempts to access memory that has already been freed (use-after-free) or to free the same memory multiple times (double-free). These are memory safety errors within the library's implementation.

**Impact:** Crashes, unpredictable behavior, and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities that could allow for arbitrary code execution within the context of the application using the library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical
