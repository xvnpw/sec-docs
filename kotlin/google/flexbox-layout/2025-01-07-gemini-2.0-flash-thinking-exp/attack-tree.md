## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Trigger Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Rendering Bugs](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_trigger_cross-site_scripting__xss__through_rendering_bugs.md)

*   Attack Vector: Craft Flexbox Layout that Causes Injected Script to Execute Due to Rendering Logic Flaws
    *   Likelihood: Low (Requires specific browser rendering bugs)
    *   Impact: Critical (Full compromise of the application within the user's browser)
    *   Effort: High
    *   Skill Level: Advanced
    *   Detection Difficulty: Moderate (Can be detected by CSP, careful code review)
    *   Description: This attack involves exploiting a flaw in the browser's flexbox rendering engine that allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts. This could occur if the browser incorrectly handles specific combinations of flexbox properties or malformed CSS, leading to the execution of injected HTML or JavaScript.
    *   Attacker Steps:
        1. Identify a specific browser rendering bug related to flexbox.
        2. Craft a malicious flexbox layout (HTML and CSS) that triggers the bug.
        3. Embed the malicious layout in a context that the target application renders (e.g., a user-generated content field, a malicious advertisement).
        4. When the user's browser renders the malicious layout, the injected script executes within the application's origin.
    *   Potential Damage: Full compromise of the user's session, access to sensitive data, ability to perform actions on behalf of the user, redirection to malicious sites.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Trigger Buffer Overflow in Layout Calculation](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_trigger_buffer_overflow_in_layout_calculation.md)

*   Attack Vector: Trigger Buffer Overflow in Layout Calculation
    *   Likelihood: Very Low (Requires a specific browser vulnerability)
    *   Impact: Critical (Potential for arbitrary code execution)
    *   Effort: Very High
    *   Skill Level: Expert
    *   Detection Difficulty: Very Difficult
    *   Description: This attack exploits a vulnerability where the browser's layout engine writes data beyond the allocated buffer during flexbox calculations. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
    *   Attacker Steps:
        1. Identify a buffer overflow vulnerability in the browser's flexbox layout calculation logic.
        2. Craft a specific flexbox scenario (HTML and CSS) that triggers the overflow.
        3. Carefully craft the malicious input to overwrite specific memory locations with attacker-controlled code.
        4. Trigger the rendering of the malicious layout.
    *   Potential Damage: Arbitrary code execution on the user's system, complete system compromise, data theft, installation of malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Integer Overflow in Size/Position Calculations](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_integer_overflow_in_sizeposition_calculations.md)

*   Attack Vector: Exploit Integer Overflow in Size/Position Calculations
    *   Likelihood: Very Low (Requires a specific browser vulnerability)
    *   Impact: Critical (Potential for arbitrary code execution)
    *   Effort: Very High
    *   Skill Level: Expert
    *   Detection Difficulty: Very Difficult
    *   Description: This attack leverages integer overflow vulnerabilities in the browser's handling of flexbox size or position calculations. By manipulating flexbox properties, an attacker can cause an integer overflow, leading to incorrect memory addressing and potentially allowing for memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.
    *   Attacker Steps:
        1. Identify an integer overflow vulnerability in the browser's flexbox size or position calculation logic.
        2. Craft a specific flexbox scenario (HTML and CSS) that triggers the overflow.
        3. Manipulate flexbox properties to cause the integer overflow, leading to predictable memory corruption.
        4. Inject and execute malicious code through the corrupted memory.
    *   Potential Damage: Arbitrary code execution on the user's system, complete system compromise, data theft, installation of malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Browser Sandbox Escape](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_browser_sandbox_escape.md)

*   Attack Vector: Exploit Browser Sandbox Escape
    *   Likelihood: Very Low (Requires multiple chained vulnerabilities)
    *   Impact: Critical (Full system compromise)
    *   Effort: Extremely High
    *   Skill Level: Expert
    *   Detection Difficulty: Very Difficult
    *   Description: This highly advanced attack involves chaining a vulnerability in the flexbox rendering engine with other browser vulnerabilities to escape the browser's security sandbox. This allows the attacker to execute code outside the browser's restricted environment, gaining full access to the user's system.
    *   Attacker Steps:
        1. Identify a vulnerability within the flexbox rendering engine.
        2. Identify one or more other vulnerabilities in the browser's architecture or other components.
        3. Develop an exploit chain that leverages the flexbox vulnerability as a stepping stone to bypass sandbox restrictions.
        4. Execute arbitrary code on the user's operating system.
    *   Potential Damage: Full control of the user's system, installation of persistent malware, data theft, surveillance, and other malicious activities.
