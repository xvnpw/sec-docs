## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) / Performance Degradation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos___performance_degradation__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This category encompasses attacks that aim to make the application unusable or significantly slower by exploiting weaknesses in the flexbox layout engine or its interaction with the application.
    *   **Overall Risk:** High. These attacks are relatively easy to execute and can have a significant impact on user experience and application availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Exploit Algorithmic Complexity](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__exploit_algorithmic_complexity.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Craft Deeply Nested Flexbox Structures](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__craft_deeply_nested_flexbox_structures.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Trigger Exponential Layout Calculation Time [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__trigger_exponential_layout_calculation_time__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker crafts HTML/CSS with deeply nested flexbox containers.  The complexity of calculating the layout for deeply nested structures can grow exponentially, leading to excessive CPU usage and potentially a denial-of-service.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on application design and whether user input can influence nesting depth).
                *   **Impact:** High (Potential for complete DoS).
                *   **Effort:** Low (Relatively easy to create nested HTML).
                *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic HTML/CSS knowledge).
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires performance monitoring and analysis of layout structure).
                * **Mitigation:** Limit nesting depth, use Angular CDK, monitor performance.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__resource_exhaustion__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This category focuses on attacks that consume excessive system resources (memory or CPU) by manipulating the flexbox layout.
        *   **Overall Risk:** High. These attacks are often easy to execute and can lead to browser crashes or DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Allocate Excessive Memory via Large Number of Flex Items [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__allocate_excessive_memory_via_large_number_of_flex_items__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker forces the application to render a very large number of flex items simultaneously.  Each DOM element consumes memory, and a sufficiently large number can exhaust available memory, leading to a browser crash or DoS.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on whether the application renders large datasets without virtualization or pagination).
            *   **Impact:** High (Browser crash, DoS).
            *   **Effort:** Low (Can be achieved by manipulating data input or URL parameters).
            *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic understanding of web applications).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires memory monitoring and analysis of rendered content).
            * **Mitigation:** Implement pagination or virtualization, use Angular CDK.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Trigger Excessive CPU Usage (overlaps with 1.1)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__trigger_excessive_cpu_usage__overlaps_with_1_1_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack is closely related to exploiting algorithmic complexity.  By creating complex layouts or forcing frequent recalculations, an attacker can consume excessive CPU resources, leading to performance degradation or DoS.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (See 1.1).
            *   **Impact:** High (DoS).
            *   **Effort:** Low.
            *   **Skill Level:** Low.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (CPU monitoring).
            * **Mitigation:** See mitigations for 1.1.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Leverage Archived Status (Lack of Updates) [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__leverage_archived_status__lack_of_updates___critical___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the *most critical* vulnerability.  Because `google/flexbox-layout` is archived, it will not receive security updates.  Any discovered vulnerabilities will remain unpatched, making the application a permanent target.
        *   **Overall Risk:** Critical and High. This is a fundamental weakness that significantly increases the risk of all other attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1. Exploit Known (but unpatched) Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__exploit_known__but_unpatched__vulnerabilities__critical___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits publicly known vulnerabilities in `google/flexbox-layout` that have not been (and will not be) patched.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (Archived library = no patches).
            *   **Impact:** High (Potentially severe, depending on the specific vulnerability. Could range from DoS to information leakage or even code execution, although code execution is less likely with a layout library).
            *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding and understanding known vulnerabilities).
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium (Requires understanding of vulnerability reports and potentially exploit development).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Publicly known vulnerabilities are often documented).
            * **Mitigation:** *Immediately* migrate to a supported layout solution like Angular CDK Layout. This is the highest priority.
