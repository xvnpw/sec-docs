# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a robust and flexible CSS layout system (Flexbox) that simplifies web development.
*   Offer a cross-browser compatible solution, reducing development time and effort.
*   Maintain a lightweight and performant library to minimize impact on website loading times.
*   Provide clear and comprehensive documentation to facilitate easy adoption and usage.
*   Foster a community-driven project with active maintenance and support.

Business Risks:

*   Inconsistent behavior across different browsers could lead to layout issues and increased development costs.
*   Performance bottlenecks in the library could negatively impact website loading times and user experience.
*   Lack of proper documentation or support could hinder adoption and lead to developer frustration.
*   Security vulnerabilities, although unlikely in a CSS layout library, could potentially be exploited if present.
*   Lack of updates and maintenance could lead to the library becoming obsolete and incompatible with future web standards.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The library itself is primarily focused on layout and presentation, and does not directly handle sensitive data or user authentication. Therefore, inherent security risks are minimal.
*   security control: The project is hosted on GitHub, which provides a secure platform for code hosting, version control, and collaboration. (Described in GitHub documentation)
*   security control: The project likely benefits from Google's internal code review and security testing processes, although this is not explicitly stated in the repository. (Assumed based on Google's general security practices)
*   accepted risk: The library does not implement specific security controls related to authentication, authorization, or input validation, as these are not within its scope.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Regularly update dependencies to address any potential security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, although the library's direct exposure to XSS is low.
*   security control: Conduct periodic security audits and code reviews to identify and address any potential security concerns.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not applicable, as the library does not handle user authentication.
*   Authorization: Not applicable, as the library does not manage user permissions or access control.
*   Input Validation: Not applicable, as the library does not directly process user input.
*   Cryptography: Not applicable, as the library does not handle encryption or decryption.

## BUILD

The build process for Flexbox is relatively simple, primarily involving compilation and minification of the CSS.  The repository doesn't specify a build system, but common tools for this type of project would include tools like PostCSS, Sass, or simply a minifier.  There is no automated build system visible in the repository.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- Writes --> SourceCode["Source Code (.css, .scss)"]
    SourceCode -- Processed by --> BuildTools["Build Tools (e.g., PostCSS, Sass, Minifier)"]
    BuildTools -- Generates --> CompiledCSS["Compiled & Minified CSS"]
    CompiledCSS -- Deployed to --> CDN["CDN"]
    CompiledCSS -- or included in --> HTML["HTML File"]

```

Build Process Security:

*   security control: Use of reputable build tools (PostCSS, Sass, etc.) that are regularly updated.
*   security control: Minification of the CSS reduces the attack surface by removing unnecessary characters and comments.
*   security control: If a package manager (npm, yarn) is used, regularly audit and update dependencies to mitigate supply chain risks.
*   security control: Implement linting (e.g., Stylelint) to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Website rendering and layout: The library is directly responsible for the visual presentation of websites. Any issues with the library can directly impact the user experience.

Data Protection:

*   Data Sensitivity: The library itself does not handle any sensitive data. It primarily deals with CSS layout rules. Therefore, data protection is not a primary concern *for the library itself*. However, websites *using* the library may handle sensitive data, and the overall security of the website is crucial.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific performance requirements or benchmarks for the library?
*   What is the intended level of browser support (specific versions)?
*   Are there any plans to integrate with specific JavaScript frameworks or libraries?
*   Is there a formal process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by external researchers?
*   What is process of updating library?
*   What is process of testing library?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a reliable and efficient CSS layout solution.
*   BUSINESS POSTURE: Google's internal security practices are applied to the project, even if not explicitly documented in the repository.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The library does not directly handle sensitive data or user authentication.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Developers using the library are responsible for implementing appropriate security measures in their own applications.
*   DESIGN: The library is primarily used by including the compiled CSS file in web pages.
*   DESIGN: The build process involves compilation and minification of CSS.
*   DESIGN: No specific CI/CD pipeline is defined in the public repository.
