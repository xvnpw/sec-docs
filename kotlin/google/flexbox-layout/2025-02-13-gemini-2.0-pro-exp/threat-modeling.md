# Threat Model Analysis for google/flexbox-layout

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Layout Calculation](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_layout_calculation.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Layout Calculation

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted input (e.g., extremely large numbers for dimensions, deeply nested flex containers, or conflicting flex properties) designed to exploit inefficiencies in the `flexbox-layout` library's layout algorithm.  This input causes the library to enter a computationally expensive state, consuming excessive CPU resources in the user's browser. The attacker might repeatedly submit this input or embed it in a way that triggers repeated layout recalculations.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side denial of service; the user's browser tab or entire browser becomes unresponsive.  Potential data loss if unsaved work is present.  The attack degrades the user experience and can prevent legitimate use of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core layout calculation engine within `flexbox-layout`. This likely involves functions responsible for resolving flex item sizes and positions (e.g., hypothetical functions like `calculateLayout`, `resolveFlexItemSize`, etc. â€“ specific names are speculative without deep code analysis). The library's style update and change detection mechanisms could also be contributing factors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential for complete browser unresponsiveness, the ease of triggering the attack with malicious input, and the library's *deprecated* status, meaning no patches will be released).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary and Essential:** Migrate to native CSS Flexbox. This is the *only* truly effective long-term solution, as it leverages the browser's optimized and actively maintained layout engine.
        *   **If Migration is *Temporarily* Delayed (Strongly Discouraged):**
            *   Implement *strict* validation and sanitization of *all* user input that can influence layout properties (e.g., `width`, `height`, `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `order`, and any custom properties used by the library). Enforce very restrictive limits on values.  This is crucial.
            *   Severely limit the nesting depth of flex containers that are controlled by user input.
            *   Restrict the number of flex items within a container that are based on user input.
            *   Implement client-side rate limiting or debouncing to prevent rapid, repeated changes to layout-affecting properties. This helps prevent an attacker from flooding the layout engine with requests.
            *   Actively monitor client-side performance metrics (CPU usage, rendering times) to detect potential DoS attempts. This requires client-side instrumentation.

**Overarching Recommendation (Critical):**

The `google/flexbox-layout` library is **deprecated and unmaintained**.  This significantly increases the risk of all threats, especially the DoS threat.  **Immediate migration to native CSS Flexbox is absolutely essential for security and performance.**  Any other mitigations are temporary workarounds and should *not* be considered a long-term solution. The continued use of this deprecated library represents a significant security risk.
