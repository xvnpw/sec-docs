# Attack Surface Analysis for google/flexbox-layout

## Attack Surface: [CSS Injection](./attack_surfaces/css_injection.md)

**Description:** Injection of malicious CSS code into the application, allowing attackers to manipulate styling and potentially other aspects of the application.

**How `flexbox-layout` Contributes:** The library's core mechanism of using JavaScript objects to define CSS styles provides the *direct* pathway for this attack.  If user-supplied data is incorporated into these style objects without proper sanitization or escaping, CSS injection becomes possible. This is the *defining characteristic* of how `flexbox-layout` contributes to this vulnerability.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Vulnerable Code:
const userProvidedWidth = "100%;} body {background-image: url('https://attacker.com/evil.jpg');} .container {width: "; // Malicious input
const styles = {
  container: {
    width: userProvidedWidth, // Directly using unsanitized input
    display: 'flex',
    // ... other flexbox properties
  }
};
// ... use styles with flexbox-layout
```
 Even a seemingly small injection like manipulating the `width` property can be leveraged to inject a complete CSS rule that affects other parts of the page. The attacker doesn't need to inject a full `<style>` tag; they can "break out" of the intended property value.

**Impact:**
*   Defacement of the application.
*   Data exfiltration (e.g., cookies, session tokens, or content rendered on the page) via CSS techniques (e.g., `background-image` URLs, attribute selectors).
*   Potential for *indirect* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the injected CSS can manipulate the DOM structure (e.g., hiding legitimate elements and inserting attacker-controlled ones), creating opportunities for subsequent JavaScript execution.
*   Phishing attacks by altering the application's appearance to mimic legitimate sites.

**Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if it leads to XSS)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Input Validation:** *Never* directly embed user input into style objects. Implement rigorous input validation using a whitelist approach whenever possible. Allow only known-safe values and patterns for CSS properties. Reject or strictly sanitize any input containing potentially dangerous characters or CSS keywords.
*   **CSS Sanitization:** Employ a dedicated CSS sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify with the `FOR_CSS` option, or a specialized CSS sanitizer) to remove or escape potentially dangerous CSS properties and values. This is *crucial* if you must allow *any* degree of user-controlled styling.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP with a restrictive `style-src` directive. Ideally, use `style-src 'self'` (or a specific, trusted origin) and *avoid* `'unsafe-inline'`. This prevents the execution of inline styles and styles from untrusted sources, significantly limiting the impact of a successful CSS injection.
*   **Avoid Direct User Input:** Whenever feasible, avoid directly using user input in style objects. Instead, use user input to select from a predefined set of safe styles or options. For example, provide a dropdown list of allowed colors rather than allowing users to enter an arbitrary color value.
*   **Context-Aware Output Encoding (Supplementary):** While not a primary defense, context-aware output encoding *can* provide an additional layer of protection in *specific* situations. For example, if you *must* insert a user-provided string into a CSS property value, you might use JavaScript's string escaping functions. However, this is *not* sufficient on its own and should *never* be relied upon as the sole defense against CSS injection. It's a supplementary measure, *not* a replacement for sanitization.
* **Escape user input:** Escape any user input that is used in style objects.
