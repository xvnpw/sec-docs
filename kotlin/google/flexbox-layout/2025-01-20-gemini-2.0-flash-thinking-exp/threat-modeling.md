# Threat Model Analysis for google/flexbox-layout

## Threat: [Client-Side Resource Exhaustion via Complex Layouts](./threats/client-side_resource_exhaustion_via_complex_layouts.md)

*   **Threat:** Client-Side Resource Exhaustion via Complex Layouts
    *   **Description:** Maliciously crafted or excessively complex layout configurations, when processed by the `flexbox-layout` library's core algorithms, consume excessive CPU and memory resources in the user's browser. This is a direct consequence of the library's internal processing of complex layout instructions.
    *   **Impact:** The user's browser tab or the entire browser could become unresponsive or crash, leading to a denial of service for the user.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core layout calculation engine of the `flexbox-layout` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the complexity of layout configurations handled by the application.
        *   Monitor client-side performance metrics to detect potential resource exhaustion.

## Threat: [Unexpected Rendering due to Library Bugs](./threats/unexpected_rendering_due_to_library_bugs.md)

*   **Threat:** Unexpected Rendering due to Library Bugs
    *   **Description:** Bugs or edge cases within the `flexbox-layout` library's implementation directly cause elements to be rendered incorrectly. This is a vulnerability within the library's code itself, leading to unexpected visual outcomes.
    *   **Impact:** The application's user interface could be rendered in a way that is confusing, misleading, or prevents users from accessing information or functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific functions or modules within the `flexbox-layout` library responsible for calculating element positions and sizes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium *(Note: While the impact can be significant, the likelihood of a critical bug in a mature library like this is lower, often making it a high rather than critical risk. However, if the rendering error leads to a security vulnerability, it could be critical. For this filtered list focusing on direct library involvement, we'll keep it as high based on potential impact.)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `flexbox-layout` library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes.
        *   Conduct thorough cross-browser testing of the application's layout.
        *   Implement visual regression testing.
        *   Report any discovered rendering inconsistencies or bugs to the `flexbox-layout` project.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Infinite Loops or Recursion](./threats/denial_of_service_through_infinite_loops_or_recursion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service through Infinite Loops or Recursion
    *   **Description:** Specific layout configurations trigger infinite loops or excessive recursion within the `flexbox-layout` library's calculation logic. This is a flaw in the library's algorithm that can be exploited to cause a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** The user's browser tab or the entire browser could freeze or crash.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core layout calculation algorithms within the `flexbox-layout` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement safeguards in the application to prevent the generation of excessively complex or potentially problematic layout configurations.
        *   Review the `flexbox-layout` library's code for potential infinite loop or recursion vulnerabilities (less likely in a mature library, but possible).
        *   Monitor client-side performance and identify patterns that might indicate such issues.
