# Attack Tree Analysis for google/flexbox-layout

Objective: Compromise application by executing arbitrary JavaScript within the application's context by exploiting weaknesses in the `flexbox-layout` library.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   Exploit Polyfill Logic Errors [CRITICAL]
    *   Trigger Incorrect Layout Calculation
        *   Provide Malicious CSS Properties
            *   Inject CSS with extreme or unexpected flexbox values (e.g., very large flex-grow, negative values where not expected)
        *   Craft Specific DOM Structure
            *   Create nested or complex DOM structures that expose edge cases in the polyfill's layout algorithm
*   Trigger Behavior Differences [CRITICAL if used for security]
    *   Craft CSS/DOM that behaves differently in polyfilled vs. native environments
        *   Exploit these differences to bypass client-side validation or security checks relying on native behavior
*   Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]
    *   Trigger Unexpected JavaScript Execution [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]
        *   Leverage Polyfill's JavaScript Implementation
            *   Find vulnerabilities in the polyfill's JavaScript code itself (e.g., prototype pollution, DOM clobbering) [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]
    *   Cause Denial of Service (Client-Side) [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        *   Overload Polyfill Processing
            *   Inject a large number of elements or complex flexbox rules that overwhelm the polyfill's processing capabilities

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Polyfill Logic Errors [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_polyfill_logic_errors__critical_.md)

**Trigger Incorrect Layout Calculation:**
*   **Provide Malicious CSS Properties:**
    *   Inject CSS with extreme or unexpected flexbox values (e.g., very large flex-grow, negative values where not expected)
        *   Likelihood: Medium (Requires ability to inject or influence CSS)
        *   Impact: Low (Primarily visual disruption, potential for UI confusion)
        *   Effort: Low (Basic understanding of CSS)
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires monitoring CSS changes or unexpected layout behavior)
*   **Craft Specific DOM Structure:**
    *   Create nested or complex DOM structures that expose edge cases in the polyfill's layout algorithm
        *   Likelihood: Medium (Requires understanding of the application's DOM structure and flexbox intricacies)
        *   Impact: Low (Primarily visual disruption, potential for UI confusion)
        *   Effort: Medium (Requires more in-depth knowledge of flexbox and DOM manipulation)
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to High (May require monitoring DOM manipulations and layout calculations)

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Behavior Differences [CRITICAL if used for security]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_behavior_differences__critical_if_used_for_security_.md)

**Craft CSS/DOM that behaves differently in polyfilled vs. native environments:**
*   **Exploit these differences to bypass client-side validation or security checks relying on native behavior:**
    *   Likelihood: Low to Medium (Depends on the application's reliance on specific flexbox behavior for security)
    *   Impact: Medium (Bypass of client-side security measures, potential for further exploitation)
    *   Effort: Medium (Requires understanding of both native and polyfilled flexbox behavior)
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to High (Requires understanding of the expected behavior in different environments)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Trigger Unexpected JavaScript Execution [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
*   **Leverage Polyfill's JavaScript Implementation:**
    *   **Find vulnerabilities in the polyfill's JavaScript code itself (e.g., prototype pollution, DOM clobbering) [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Likelihood: Low (Requires finding specific vulnerabilities in a widely used library, but possible)
        *   Impact: High (Arbitrary JavaScript execution, full application compromise)
        *   Effort: High (Requires reverse engineering and deep understanding of JavaScript and browser internals)
        *   Skill Level: High
        *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (May trigger security alerts if malicious scripts are executed)

**Cause Denial of Service (Client-Side) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
*   **Overload Polyfill Processing:**
    *   **Inject a large number of elements or complex flexbox rules that overwhelm the polyfill's processing capabilities:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium (Relatively easy to inject large amounts of data or complex CSS)
        *   Impact: Medium (Client-side Denial of Service, browser freeze)
        *   Effort: Low to Medium (Requires basic understanding of how to generate large amounts of HTML/CSS)
        *   Skill Level: Low to Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (May be detectable through performance monitoring or user reports of unresponsiveness)
