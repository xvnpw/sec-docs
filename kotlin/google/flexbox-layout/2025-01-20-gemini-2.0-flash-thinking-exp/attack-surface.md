# Attack Surface Analysis for google/flexbox-layout

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) through Complex Layouts](./attack_surfaces/client-side_denial_of_service__dos__through_complex_layouts.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) through Complex Layouts**
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious CSS that, when processed by the browser and the `flexbox-layout` library, results in extremely resource-intensive layout calculations, leading to the user's browser becoming unresponsive or crashing.
    *   **How flexbox-layout Contributes:** The `flexbox-layout` library is responsible for interpreting and rendering CSS rules related to flexbox. Maliciously crafted CSS leveraging flexbox features (e.g., deeply nested flex containers, a large number of flex items, complex `flex-grow`/`flex-shrink` combinations) can create computationally expensive layouts that the library must process.
    *   **Example:** Injecting CSS that creates thousands of nested flex containers or a single flex container with an extremely large number of items, forcing the browser to perform a massive number of layout calculations specifically handled by the `flexbox-layout` engine.
    *   **Impact:** The user's browser becomes unresponsive, potentially leading to data loss if they were in the middle of a task. In severe cases, it could crash the browser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **CSS Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which CSS can be loaded, reducing the risk of injecting malicious CSS that targets `flexbox-layout`.
        *   **Thorough Testing of Layouts:**  Test the application with a wide range of data and edge cases, including scenarios with a large number of elements, to identify potential performance bottlenecks specifically within the `flexbox-layout` rendering.
        *   **Resource Monitoring (Client-Side):** While challenging, consider implementing client-side monitoring to detect unusually high CPU or memory usage that might indicate a DoS attempt specifically triggered by complex `flexbox-layout` calculations.

## Attack Surface: [CSS Injection Exploitation Targeting Flexbox Layout](./attack_surfaces/css_injection_exploitation_targeting_flexbox_layout.md)

*   **Attack Surface: CSS Injection Exploitation Targeting Flexbox Layout**
    *   **Description:** If the application is vulnerable to CSS injection (e.g., through user-provided styles or unsanitized data influencing CSS), attackers can inject malicious CSS that specifically targets the `flexbox-layout` library's behavior to disrupt the UI or potentially cause other issues.
    *   **How flexbox-layout Contributes:** The `flexbox-layout` library is the engine that interprets and applies CSS flexbox rules. Injected malicious CSS leveraging flexbox properties will be directly processed by this library, leading to the intended (malicious) layout changes.
    *   **Example:** Injecting CSS that uses `order` or `align-items` properties to rearrange elements in a way that hides critical information or makes the application unusable, relying on `flexbox-layout` to apply these changes. Injecting CSS that sets extreme `flex-grow` values to disproportionately size elements, obscuring other content through the `flexbox-layout` rendering mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** UI disruption, information hiding, defacement of the application, potential for phishing attacks by manipulating the visual layout through `flexbox-layout` control.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prevent CSS Injection:** The primary mitigation is to prevent CSS injection vulnerabilities in the application. This directly prevents attackers from manipulating `flexbox-layout` through malicious CSS. This involves:
            *   **Sanitizing User Input:**  Thoroughly sanitize any user-provided data that could influence CSS styles.
            *   **Using a Strict CSP:** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to restrict the sources of CSS and prevent inline styles that could target `flexbox-layout`.
            *   **Avoiding Dynamic CSS Generation with Untrusted Data:** Be cautious when dynamically generating CSS based on user input that could be used to manipulate `flexbox-layout`.
