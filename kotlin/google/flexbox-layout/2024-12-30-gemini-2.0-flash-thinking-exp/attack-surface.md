* **Memory Safety Issues (Indirectly through flexbox-layout)**
    * **Description:**  Potential memory safety vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows or use-after-free) within the `flexbox-layout` library itself.
    * **How flexbox-layout Contributes:** As a C++ library, `flexbox-layout` is susceptible to memory management errors if not implemented carefully.
    * **Example:** A carefully crafted combination of layout properties and content could trigger a bug within `flexbox-layout` that leads to a buffer overflow when calculating element sizes or positions.
    * **Impact:**  Potentially critical vulnerabilities leading to crashes, arbitrary code execution (though highly dependent on the browser's security model and sandboxing).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Crucially:** Keep the `flexbox-layout` library updated. Google actively maintains and patches this library.
        * Rely on the security measures implemented by the browser or rendering engine that uses `flexbox-layout`.
        * While direct mitigation within the application might be limited, awareness of this potential risk is important.
