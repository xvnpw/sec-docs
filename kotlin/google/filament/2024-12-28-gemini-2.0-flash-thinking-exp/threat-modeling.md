Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving Filament:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Model Loading - Code Execution (Potentially)
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a 3D model file that exploits a vulnerability in Filament's model parsing logic (e.g., a buffer overflow or integer overflow). When Filament attempts to parse this malicious model, it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the application. This is a less likely scenario but a severe potential consequence of unhandled parsing errors.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the user's system, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, steal data, or install malware.
    *   **Affected Filament Component:** `ModelLoader` module, specifically the functions responsible for parsing binary data within model files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Filament updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Implement robust error handling and boundary checks during model parsing.
        *   Consider running the model loading process in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
        *   Perform static analysis and fuzzing of the application's model loading code.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Shader Injection/Manipulation
    *   **Description:** If the application allows users to provide or modify shader code (directly or indirectly, e.g., through material customization features), an attacker could inject malicious shader code. This code could perform unintended operations on the GPU, such as causing rendering artifacts, consuming excessive GPU resources leading to DoS, or potentially even exploiting driver vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Rendering errors, application instability, denial of service due to GPU overload, potential system instability if driver vulnerabilities are exploited.
    *   **Affected Filament Component:** `ShaderCompiler` module, `Material` system, `Renderer` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid allowing users to directly provide arbitrary shader code if possible.
        *   If shader customization is necessary, provide a limited and well-defined set of parameters or a visual shader editor that restricts the complexity and potential for malicious code.
        *   Implement server-side validation and sanitization of any user-provided shader parameters or code snippets.
        *   Use pre-compiled shaders where possible.
        *   Implement timeouts or resource limits for shader compilation.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Model Loading - Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted 3D model file (e.g., glTF, OBJ) with excessive geometric complexity, extremely large textures, or triggers a resource-intensive parsing path within Filament's model loading process. The application attempts to load this model, leading to excessive CPU and/or GPU usage, potentially freezing or crashing the application or even the user's system.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, leading to a denial of service for the user. In severe cases, it could crash the user's operating system.
    *   **Affected Filament Component:** `ModelLoader` module, specifically the functions responsible for parsing and processing model data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file size limits for uploaded or loaded model files.
        *   Implement timeouts for model loading operations.
        *   Perform basic validation of model file structure before passing it to Filament.
        *   Consider using a separate process or thread for model loading to prevent blocking the main application thread.
        *   Sanitize or simplify complex models on the server-side before serving them to the client.
