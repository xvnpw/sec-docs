# Attack Surface Analysis for google/filament

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Processing (glTF, KTX2, etc.)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_processing__gltf__ktx2__etc__.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Filament's parsing and processing of 3D model and texture formats (primarily glTF and KTX2, but also others it supports).
*Filament Contribution:* Filament is *directly responsible* for parsing and interpreting these file formats. The complexity of these formats and the potential for edge cases create a large attack surface within Filament's code.
*Example:* An attacker crafts a glTF file with a maliciously formed buffer view or accessor that triggers a buffer overflow in Filament's parsing code.  Another example: a KTX2 file with invalid compression parameters leading to a denial of service *within Filament*.
*Impact:*
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) - *Less likely, but possible within Filament's parsing logic*
    *   Information Disclosure (potentially, depending on the vulnerability)
*Risk Severity:* **High** (Potentially Critical if ACE is possible)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developer (Filament):**
        *   **Robust Input Validation:** Implement comprehensive validation of *all* fields and data structures within the asset files. Check for valid ranges, sizes, and relationships between data elements *within Filament's parsing routines*.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Conduct extensive fuzz testing of Filament's parsing and processing code with a wide variety of malformed inputs. This is *crucial* for Filament.
        *   **Memory Safety:** Leverage Rust's memory safety features to the fullest extent. Minimize and *very carefully* audit any `unsafe` code within Filament's asset processing.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Perform regular, focused security audits of the asset processing code within Filament.
    *   **Developer (Application using Filament):**
        *   **Pre-Validation:**  While helpful, pre-validation *cannot* replace Filament's internal validation. It can reduce the load, but Filament *must* still validate.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Impose limits on asset size/complexity. This mitigates DoS, but doesn't address code execution vulnerabilities.
        *   **Sandboxing:**  Consider running Filament (or the asset loading part) in a sandbox. This *contains* the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   **User:**
        *   **Source Assets Carefully:** Obtain assets from trusted sources. This reduces the *likelihood* of encountering malicious assets.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Shader Code (Impacting Filament and Driver)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_shader_code__impacting_filament_and_driver_.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities through crafted shader code, targeting either Filament's shader handling or, more critically, the underlying graphics driver.
*Filament Contribution:* Filament compiles GLSL shaders to SPIR-V and is the *direct interface* to the graphics driver. While the driver is external, Filament's interaction with it is a key part of the attack surface.
*Example:* An attacker provides a GLSL shader that, after being processed by Filament and passed to the driver, triggers a known vulnerability in the graphics driver, leading to a system crash or privilege escalation.  Another example: a shader designed to cause an infinite loop on the GPU, hanging the rendering process managed by Filament.
*Impact:*
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Affecting Filament and potentially the entire system.
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) - *Potentially, through driver exploits initiated via Filament*.
    *   System Instability - Directly caused by Filament's interaction with the driver.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (Potentially Critical if driver exploits lead to ACE)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developer (Filament):**
        *   **Shader Validation:** Use a robust, *up-to-date* shader validator (like glslangValidator). This is Filament's responsibility.
        *   **SPIR-V Validation:** Validate the generated SPIR-V code *before* passing it to the driver. This is a critical step for Filament.
        *   **Safe API Usage:** Ensure Filament uses the graphics API in a safe, secure, and *correct* manner.  Incorrect API usage by Filament can create vulnerabilities.
        *   **Minimize Attack Surface:** Explore ways to limit the capabilities exposed to shaders through Filament's API, if feasible.
    *   **Developer (Application using Filament):**
        *   **Shader Sanitization/Whitelisting:** *If possible*, restrict shader features. This is often very difficult in practice, but can reduce risk if feasible.
        *   **GPU Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for shader execution. This is a crucial defense against DoS attacks, and should be handled in conjunction with Filament.
    *   **User:**
        *   **Driver Updates:** Keep graphics drivers up-to-date. This is *essential* for mitigating driver-level vulnerabilities, which Filament can trigger.
        *   **Trusted Sources:** If the application allows user-provided shaders, *only* allow this from highly trusted sources.
