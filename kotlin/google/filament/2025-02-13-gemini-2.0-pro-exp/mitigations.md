## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Quotas](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_quotas.md)

**1. Resource Limits and Quotas**

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement strict limits on the complexity of loaded assets and rendering operations *within Filament*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Limits:** Establish concrete, numerical limits for Filament-specific resources:
        *   Maximum vertex count per mesh (using Filament's mesh representation).
        *   Maximum texture dimensions (width, height) and file size (using Filament's texture loading).
        *   Maximum number of materials (Filament `Material` instances).
        *   Maximum number of lights (Filament `Light` instances).
        *   Maximum number of draw calls per frame (within Filament's rendering loop).
        *   Maximum number of instances of a single mesh (within Filament's scene management).
        *   Maximum shader complexity (if using custom materials, limit instruction count, texture samples *within the Filament material system*).
    2.  **Pre-Loading Validation:** Before passing asset data to Filament API calls (e.g., `createVertexBuffer`, `createTexture`, `createMaterialInstance`), perform validation checks against these limits.
    3.  **Rejection Mechanism:** If an asset exceeds any limit, reject it *before* calling Filament's creation functions. Provide a clear error.
    4.  **Configuration:** Make these limits configurable, potentially through a Filament `Engine` configuration or a separate configuration file read during Filament initialization.
    5.  **Progressive Loading (Filament's LOD):** Utilize Filament's built-in Level of Detail (LOD) features. Load lower-resolution versions of assets first, then progressively load higher-resolution versions if resources permit, *using Filament's API for LOD management*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion DoS (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from crashing the application or making it unresponsive by providing overly complex assets *that Filament attempts to process*.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):** Ensures consistent performance by preventing Filament from rendering excessively complex scenes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk. The application will reject malicious assets *before* Filament can be affected.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Reduces the risk of unexpected performance drops.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Vertex count limits are enforced *before* calling `Engine::createVertexBuffer` in `AssetLoader::validateMesh()`.
    *   Example: Texture size limits are checked *before* calling `Texture::Builder::build()` in `TextureManager::validateTexture()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Limits on the number of draw calls per frame are not currently enforced within Filament's rendering loop.
    *   Example: Shader complexity limits are not enforced within the Filament material system.
    *   Example: Limits on the number of Filament `Light` instances are not enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout Mechanisms (Filament API Calls)](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_mechanisms__filament_api_calls_.md)

**2. Timeout Mechanisms (Filament API Calls)**

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement timeouts for *Filament API calls*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Long-Running Filament Calls:** Identify Filament API calls that could potentially take a long time:
        *   `Engine::create()`
        *   `AssetLoader::createAsset()` (and related functions)
        *   `Texture::Builder::build()`
        *   `Material::Builder::build()`
        *   Shader compilation (often implicit in `Material` creation)
        *   `Renderer::render()` (for very complex scenes, interacting directly with the Filament `Renderer`).
    2.  **Set Timeouts:** For each identified *Filament API call*, set a reasonable timeout.
    3.  **Implement Timeout Logic:** Wrap the *Filament API calls* in code that enforces the timeout. This might involve asynchronous operations or threading, but the key is to monitor and potentially interrupt the *Filament function call* itself.
    4.  **Handle Timeout Events:** If a timeout occurs while waiting for a *Filament API call* to complete, gracefully handle the situation (terminate, fallback, error message, log).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion DoS (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from hanging the application indefinitely by causing Filament operations to take an extremely long time.
    *   **Application Unresponsiveness (Medium Severity):** Ensures that the application remains responsive even if some Filament operations are slow.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk of indefinite hangs caused by Filament.
    *   **Application Unresponsiveness:** Improves responsiveness by preventing long waits on Filament calls.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Timeouts are implemented for asset loading *around* calls to `AssetLoader::createAsset()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Timeouts are not implemented for shader compilation within Filament's material system.
    *   Example: Timeouts are not implemented for the `Renderer::render()` call itself.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Shader Validation and Sanitization (Filament Materials)](./mitigation_strategies/shader_validation_and_sanitization__filament_materials_.md)

**3. Shader Validation and Sanitization (Filament Materials)**

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Validate and sanitize any custom shader code *used within Filament materials*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Custom Shaders (Ideal):** If possible, use only Filament's pre-built materials and shaders.
    2.  **Whitelist (Filament Material System):** If custom materials are necessary, use a whitelist approach *within the Filament material definition*. Restrict:
        *   Allowed shader functions.
        *   Allowed inputs and outputs.
        *   Allowed control flow (no unbounded loops).
        *   *Specifically limit features exposed by the Filament material system*.
    3.  **Shader Parser/Validator (Pre-Filament):** Implement a parser and validator that analyzes the shader code *before* it is used to create a Filament `Material`. This validator should:
        *   Enforce the whitelist.
        *   Check for syntax errors.
        *   Check for dangerous constructs.
        *   Reject any shader code that does not conform.
    4.  **Static Analysis:** Consider static analysis tools, but focus on the interaction with Filament's material system.
    5.  **Runtime Checks (Filament Material Parameters):** While most validation is static, some runtime checks on *material parameters* passed to Filament might be needed (e.g., checking for division by zero in parameter values).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion DoS (High Severity):** Prevents malicious shaders from consuming excessive GPU resources *through Filament*.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical Severity):** (If custom shaders are allowed) Prevents code injection *into the Filament rendering pipeline*.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of shaders leaking information *via Filament*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Essential for prevention.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: The application only uses Filament's pre-built materials. No custom shader support is provided.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: If custom material support were added, a full shader validator and sanitizer, specifically targeting the Filament material system, would be required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation (Direct Filament API Parameters)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation__direct_filament_api_parameters_.md)

**4. Input Validation (Direct Filament API Parameters)**

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Validate all data passed *directly* to Filament API functions.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points:** Identify all points where data is passed to *Filament API calls*, including:
        *   `Engine::createVertexBuffer` (vertex data).
        *   `Engine::createIndexBuffer` (index data).
        *   `Texture::Builder::build()` (pixel data, dimensions, format).
        *   `MaterialInstance::setParameter` (material parameters).
        *   `Camera::setProjection`, `Camera::lookAt` (camera parameters).
        *   `LightManager::Builder::build()` (light parameters).
        *   Functions that modify the Filament scene graph (adding/removing entities, components).
    2.  **Data Type Validation:** Ensure data types match Filament's expected types.
    3.  **Range Validation:** Check numerical values are within reasonable ranges *expected by Filament*.
    4.  **Sanity Checks:** Perform checks specific to Filament's requirements (e.g., index bounds, texture dimensions, valid enum values for Filament enums).
    5.  **Reject Invalid Data:** If validation fails, reject the data *before* calling the Filament API.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Buffer Overflows (High Severity):** Prevents exploitation of buffer overflows *within Filament* due to bad input.
    *   **Integer Overflows (High Severity):** Prevents integer overflows *within Filament*.
    *   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Prevents unexpected Filament behavior.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Helps prevent some resource exhaustion by rejecting invalid data early.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Buffer/Integer Overflows:** Essential for preventing these vulnerabilities *within Filament*.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Reduces unexpected Filament behavior.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Provides some protection.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Vertex data is validated *before* calling `Engine::createVertexBuffer`.
    *   Example: Texture data is validated *before* calling `Texture::Builder::build()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: More comprehensive range validation for camera parameters passed to Filament's `Camera` component.
    *   Example: Validation of scene graph modifications made through Filament's API.
