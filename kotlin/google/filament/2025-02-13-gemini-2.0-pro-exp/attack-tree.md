## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Filament's Material System [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_filament's_material_system__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Malicious Material Definition (e.g., .mat file) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers provide a crafted material file that exploits vulnerabilities in how Filament processes materials.
    *   **1.1.1 Shader Code Injection (GLSL, SPIR-V, MSL) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The core of this attack is injecting malicious code into the shaders that Filament uses for rendering.
        *   **1.1.1.1 Bypass Shader Validation (if any)**
            *   **Description:**  Filament likely has some form of shader validation to prevent obviously malicious code.  This step involves circumventing that validation.
            *   **1.1.1.1.1 Exploit parser vulnerabilities in Filament's shader compiler. [CRITICAL]**
                *   **Description:**  The attacker crafts a shader that, while appearing valid on the surface, exploits a bug in Filament's shader compiler (e.g., a buffer overflow, an integer overflow, a logic error) to bypass validation checks.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** High
                *   **Effort:** High
                *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **1.1.1.2 Achieve Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) via shader. [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  Once shader code injection is successful, the attacker aims to achieve ACE, allowing them to run arbitrary code on the system.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Very High
            *   **Skill Level:** Expert
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Filament's Asset Loading (glTF, KTX2, HDR, etc.) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_filament's_asset_loading__gltf__ktx2__hdr__etc____high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Malicious Asset Files [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers provide crafted asset files (models, textures, etc.) that exploit vulnerabilities in Filament's asset loading process.
    *   **2.1.1 Buffer Overflow/Underflow in Asset Parsers [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker provides a malformed asset file (e.g., glTF, KTX2) with data chunks that are larger or smaller than expected, causing a buffer overflow or underflow in the parser. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially ACE.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **2.1.4 Path Traversal in Asset Loading [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker crafts an asset file or modifies the asset loading process to include path traversal sequences (e.g., "../") in file paths. This allows them to access files outside the intended asset directory, potentially reading sensitive data or overwriting critical system files.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **2.1.5 Resource Exhaustion (DoS) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker provides an extremely large or complex asset file (e.g., a glTF model with millions of polygons or a very high-resolution texture) that consumes excessive memory or processing time when Filament attempts to load it. This leads to a denial-of-service condition.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Filament's Rendering Pipeline [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_filament's_rendering_pipeline__high_risk_.md)

*    **3.3 Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can cause a denial of service by exploiting the rendering pipeline.
    *   **3.3.1 Excessive Resource Consumption [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker configures the scene or provides input that forces Filament to consume excessive GPU or CPU resources. This could involve an extremely large number of lights, very complex materials, or extremely high-resolution textures, leading to a denial of service.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
