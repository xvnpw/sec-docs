            *   Buffer overflows and out-of-bounds access (especially in texture and buffer operations).
            *   Integer overflows and underflows (in calculations and indexing).
            *   Division by zero.
            *   Infinite loops and excessive resource consumption.
            *   Unvalidated input from textures or uniforms.
            *   Shader injection vulnerabilities (if shaders are dynamically generated or modified based on external input - less common in typical Filament usage but worth considering).
            *   Data leaks through shader outputs.
        *   **Filament Specificity:** Tailor the checklist to the specific features and constraints of Filament's rendering pipeline and shader language support.

        *   **Independent Security Assessment:**  Provides an independent security assessment of the shader codebase, potentially uncovering issues that internal teams might overlook.
        *   **Verification of Mitigation Effectiveness:**  Audits can verify the effectiveness of the other mitigation components (code review, static analysis, checklist) and identify areas where they might be failing.
        *   **Adaptation to Changes:**  Ensures that security measures remain effective as shaders and the Filament rendering pipeline are updated or modified.

    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   **Resource Intensive:**  Security audits, especially comprehensive ones, can be resource-intensive, requiring specialized security expertise and time.
        *   **Point-in-Time Assessment:**  Audits provide a snapshot of security at a specific point in time. Continuous monitoring and ongoing security practices are still necessary.
        *   **Potential Disruption:**  Depending on the audit scope and methodology, audits might cause some disruption to the development workflow.

    *   **Implementation Details & Recommendations:**
        *   **Define Audit Scope and Frequency:**  Determine the scope and frequency of audits based on risk assessment, project size, and the rate of shader changes. Prioritize audits after major releases or significant shader modifications.
        *   **Independent Auditors:**  Consider engaging independent security experts for audits to provide an unbiased perspective.
        *   **Focus on High-Risk Areas:**  Focus audit efforts on shaders that are critical to security, handle sensitive data, or are exposed to external inputs.
        *   **Actionable Reporting and Remediation:**  Ensure that audit findings are documented in clear and actionable reports, and establish a process for promptly remediating identified vulnerabilities.
        *   **Integration with Development Lifecycle:**  Integrate regular audits into the overall security development lifecycle to ensure continuous security improvement.
