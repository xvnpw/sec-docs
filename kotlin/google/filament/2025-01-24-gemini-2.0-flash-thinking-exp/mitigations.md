## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Asset File Format Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_asset_file_format_validation.md)

### 1. Strict Asset File Format Validation

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Asset File Format Validation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Supported Formats:** Clearly define the allowed 3D asset file formats that Filament is designed to handle (e.g., glTF 2.0, texture formats supported by Filament).
    2.  **Implement Header Checks:**  Before parsing any asset file intended for Filament, read and verify the file header or "magic number" to confirm it matches the expected format. For example, check for the glTF magic number (`0x46546C67`) for glTF files loaded by Filament.
    3.  **Utilize Robust Parsing Libraries:** Employ well-vetted and actively maintained parsing libraries specifically used by or compatible with Filament for each supported format. Ensure these libraries are known for their security and resistance to common parsing vulnerabilities in the context of 3D asset formats Filament uses.
    4.  **Schema Validation (for glTF):** For glTF assets loaded into Filament, use a schema validator to enforce the glTF specification and reject assets that deviate from the expected structure and data types that Filament expects.
    5.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling within the Filament asset loading pipeline for invalid file formats. Log errors and gracefully reject invalid assets without crashing the Filament-based application.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious File Injection (High Severity):** Attackers could attempt to inject files disguised as valid assets for Filament but containing malicious code or exploits that could be triggered during Filament's asset processing.
    *   **Buffer Overflow during Parsing (High Severity):**  Malformed files could trigger buffer overflows in parsing libraries used by Filament, leading to crashes or remote code execution within the Filament rendering context.
    *   **Denial of Service (Medium Severity):**  Processing extremely large or malformed files by Filament could consume excessive resources and lead to application slowdown or crashes specifically within the rendering engine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious File Injection (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing Filament from even attempting to process potentially harmful files.
    *   **Buffer Overflow during Parsing (High Impact):**  Reduces the risk by ensuring only files conforming to expected formats are parsed by robust libraries used by Filament.
    *   **Denial of Service (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk by preventing Filament from processing obviously invalid or oversized files.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Header checks are in place for glTF files in the asset loading module (`asset_loader.cpp`) within the Filament integration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Schema validation for glTF assets loaded by Filament is not yet implemented.
    *   Header checks and robust parsing are not fully implemented for all texture formats (PNG, JPEG) used by Filament.
    *   Error handling within Filament's asset loading needs to be improved to provide more informative logging and prevent potential crashes specifically related to asset processing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Asset Data Sanitization and Complexity Limits](./mitigation_strategies/asset_data_sanitization_and_complexity_limits.md)

### 2. Asset Data Sanitization and Complexity Limits

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Asset Data Sanitization and Complexity Limits
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Complexity Limits (Filament Specific):** Establish reasonable limits for asset complexity metrics relevant to Filament's rendering capabilities and performance, such as:
        *   Maximum polygon count for models rendered by Filament.
        *   Maximum texture resolution (width and height) for textures used in Filament materials.
        *   Maximum number of materials per model rendered by Filament.
        *   Maximum shader instruction count for custom shaders used in Filament.
    2.  **Implement Complexity Checks (Filament Integration):** During asset loading into Filament, parse the asset data and extract relevant complexity metrics. Compare these metrics against the defined Filament-specific limits.
    3.  **Metadata Stripping (Filament Context):** Remove unnecessary metadata from asset files before loading them into Filament. This can include author information, creation dates, or other non-rendering data that is not used by Filament and could be exploited.
    4.  **Texture Validation (Filament Usage):** For textures intended for use in Filament, validate image dimensions and format against allowed values within Filament's texture system. Ensure texture data is within expected ranges and does not contain unexpected or malicious data that could cause issues in Filament's texture processing.
    5.  **Rejection or Downscaling (Filament Handling):** If an asset exceeds complexity limits defined for Filament, either reject the asset entirely and log an error within the Filament asset loading system, or implement downscaling or simplification techniques (e.g., texture resizing, mesh simplification) to bring the asset within acceptable limits for Filament rendering.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (High Severity):** Attackers could provide extremely complex assets designed to overwhelm Filament's GPU or CPU resources, leading to application slowdown or crashes specifically within the rendering engine.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Loading excessively large textures or models into Filament can lead to memory exhaustion and Filament application instability.
    *   **Information Leakage (Low Severity):** Metadata within assets loaded by Filament might inadvertently reveal sensitive information about the application or development process related to Filament usage.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing Filament from loading assets that exceed resource limits.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk by limiting the overall resource footprint of assets used by Filament.
    *   **Information Leakage (Low Impact):** Minimally reduces the risk by removing potentially sensitive metadata from assets used by Filament.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic texture resolution limits are enforced in the texture loading module (`texture_loader.cpp`) within the Filament integration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Polygon count limits for models rendered by Filament are not yet implemented.
    *   Material and shader complexity limits relevant to Filament are not enforced.
    *   Metadata stripping is not consistently applied to all asset types loaded by Filament.
    *   Downscaling or simplification techniques for exceeding assets within Filament are not implemented.

### 3. Shader Code Review and Static Analysis

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Shader Code Review and Static Analysis
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Review Process (Filament Shaders):** Establish a mandatory code review process for all custom shaders written for use with Filament. Reviews should be conducted by experienced developers with security awareness, specifically focusing on shader vulnerabilities within the GLSL/MetalSL/HLSL context used by Filament.
    2.  **Static Analysis Tools (Shader Specific):** Integrate static analysis tools into the shader development workflow for Filament. These tools should be capable of automatically scanning shader code (GLSL/MetalSL/HLSL) for potential security vulnerabilities and coding errors relevant to GPU execution and Filament's rendering pipeline.
    3.  **Security Checklist (Shader Focused):** Develop a shader security checklist specifically tailored to shader vulnerabilities in the context of Filament and its supported shader languages. This checklist should cover common shader vulnerabilities and best practices for secure shader development within Filament.
    4.  **Regular Audits (Filament Shaders):** Conduct periodic security audits of all shader code used in Filament, especially after major updates or changes to shaders or the Filament rendering pipeline.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Shader Exploits (High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in shader code used by Filament could be exploited to cause crashes, denial of service, or potentially even GPU-level exploits within the Filament rendering environment.
    *   **Denial of Service (Medium Severity):** Malicious or poorly written shaders for Filament could consume excessive GPU resources when rendered by Filament, leading to application slowdown or crashes specifically within the rendering engine.
    *   **Rendering Errors (Low Severity):** Shader bugs in Filament shaders can lead to unexpected rendering artifacts or incorrect visual output within Filament, which while not directly a security threat, can impact user experience and potentially be exploited in social engineering attacks related to the visual output of the Filament application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Shader Exploits (High Impact):** Code review and static analysis significantly reduce the risk of introducing exploitable vulnerabilities in shaders used by Filament.
    *   **Denial of Service (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of DoS by identifying and fixing shaders that consume excessive resources when rendered by Filament.
    *   **Rendering Errors (Low Impact):** Reduces the risk of rendering errors caused by shader bugs in Filament shaders, improving application stability and user experience within the Filament rendered scenes.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Code reviews are conducted for major shader changes in Filament, but not systematically for all shader updates.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Static analysis tools for shader code (GLSL/MetalSL/HLSL) used in Filament are not yet integrated into the development workflow.
    *   A formal shader security checklist specific to Filament shaders is not yet defined.
    *   Regular security audits of shader code used in Filament are not consistently performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Shader Compilation Security and Offline Compilation](./mitigation_strategies/shader_compilation_security_and_offline_compilation.md)

### 4. Shader Compilation Security and Offline Compilation

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Shader Compilation Security and Offline Compilation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Latest Stable Filament and `matc`:** Always use the latest stable version of the Filament rendering engine and its shader compiler (`matc`). Regularly update to benefit from security patches and bug fixes specifically related to Filament and its tools.
    2.  **Offline Shader Compilation (Filament Workflow):** Compile shaders offline during the build process using `matc` as part of the Filament asset pipeline. Distribute pre-compiled shader binaries that are ready for Filament to load with the application instead of compiling shaders at runtime within the Filament application. This reduces the attack surface at runtime related to shader compilation and can improve Filament application performance.
    3.  **Secure Compilation Environment (Filament Build):** Ensure the environment used for shader compilation with `matc` is secure and trusted. Prevent unauthorized access to the compilation tools and build pipeline used for Filament assets.
    4.  **Input Validation for `matc` (If Applicable - Filament Context):** If you are dynamically generating shader code and using `matc` programmatically within your Filament workflow, carefully validate the input shader code before passing it to the compiler to prevent injection attacks that could target the shader compilation process used by Filament.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Shader Compiler Exploits (High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in the Filament shader compiler (`matc`) could be exploited if shaders are compiled at runtime in a potentially hostile environment within a Filament application.
    *   **Code Injection via Shader Compilation (Medium Severity):** If shader code is dynamically generated and compiled at runtime for Filament without proper input validation, attackers could potentially inject malicious code through shader code manipulation targeting Filament's shader compilation process.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):** Using outdated or compromised versions of Filament or `matc` could introduce vulnerabilities from the supply chain directly into the Filament rendering engine and its asset pipeline.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Shader Compiler Exploits (High Impact):** Offline compilation eliminates the risk of runtime shader compiler exploits within Filament applications. Using the latest stable versions mitigates known vulnerabilities in `matc`.
    *   **Code Injection via Shader Compilation (Medium Impact):** Offline compilation and input validation (if dynamic compilation is necessary for Filament features) reduce the risk of code injection targeting Filament's shader compilation.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Impact):** Regularly updating Filament and `matc` mitigates the risk of using vulnerable dependencies within the Filament ecosystem.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Shaders for Filament are generally compiled offline during the build process.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal process for regularly updating Filament and `matc` is not fully established.
    *   Security of the shader compilation environment used for Filament assets is not formally audited.
    *   Input validation for dynamic shader generation (if used in specific Filament features) needs to be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_rate_limiting.md)

### 5. Resource Limits and Rate Limiting

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Limits and Rate Limiting
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Resource Limits (Filament Specific):** Establish clear limits for various resources used by the Filament application, focusing on resources directly managed by or impacting Filament, including:
        *   Maximum number of loaded assets (models, textures, materials) within a Filament scene.
        *   Maximum scene complexity (number of entities, lights, etc.) rendered by Filament.
        *   Maximum texture memory usage by Filament.
        *   Maximum shader complexity (instruction count, resource usage) for shaders used in Filament.
    2.  **Implement Resource Monitoring (Filament Context):** Monitor resource usage within the Filament application during runtime. Track the number of loaded assets in Filament scenes, scene complexity metrics relevant to Filament rendering, and memory consumption by Filament.
    3.  **Enforce Limits (Filament Management):** Implement mechanisms to enforce the defined resource limits within the Filament application. When limits are approached or exceeded in Filament, take appropriate actions such as:
        *   Reject loading new assets into Filament scenes.
        *   Reduce scene complexity in Filament (e.g., level-of-detail techniques managed by Filament or application logic interacting with Filament).
        *   Garbage collect unused resources managed by Filament more aggressively.
        *   Gracefully degrade rendering quality within Filament.
    4.  **Rate Limiting Asset Loading (Dynamic Loading for Filament):** If assets are loaded dynamically from external sources for use in Filament, implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from overwhelming the Filament system with asset loading requests. Limit the number of asset requests per time interval from a single IP address or user that are intended for Filament.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (High Severity):** Attackers could attempt to exhaust server or client resources by requesting or providing excessively complex assets for Filament or making a large number of asset requests intended for Filament rendering.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Uncontrolled resource consumption by Filament can lead to application slowdown, crashes, or instability specifically within the Filament rendering engine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (High Impact):** Resource limits and rate limiting significantly reduce the risk of DoS attacks targeting Filament by preventing resource exhaustion within the rendering engine.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (High Impact):** Resource limits prevent uncontrolled resource consumption by Filament and improve application stability specifically related to Filament rendering.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic limits on texture memory usage within Filament are in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive resource limits for model complexity, scene complexity, and number of assets within Filament are not yet implemented.
    *   Rate limiting for dynamic asset loading intended for Filament is not implemented.
    *   Resource monitoring and enforcement mechanisms need to be expanded to cover all relevant resource types managed by Filament.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Filament and Dependency Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_filament_and_dependency_updates.md)

### 6. Regular Filament and Dependency Updates

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Filament and Dependency Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Update Process (Filament Focused):** Define a process for regularly checking for and applying updates to the Filament rendering engine and its direct dependencies. This should include:
        *   Monitoring Filament release notes and security advisories specifically from the Google Filament GitHub repository.
        *   Subscribing to security mailing lists or monitoring security advisories related to Filament's direct dependencies (e.g., glTF loader libraries used by Filament, image libraries used by Filament).
        *   Using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Filament's direct dependencies.
    2.  **Prioritize Security Updates (Filament and Dependencies):** Prioritize applying security updates and bug fixes for Filament and its dependencies. Schedule updates promptly after they are released by the Filament team or dependency maintainers.
    3.  **Testing After Updates (Filament Integration):** Thoroughly test the application's Filament integration after applying updates to ensure compatibility and that the updates have not introduced new issues within the Filament rendering pipeline.
    4.  **Dependency Management Tools (Filament Ecosystem):** Utilize dependency management tools (e.g., package managers, dependency scanners) to streamline the update process for Filament and track its dependencies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Using outdated versions of Filament or its dependencies exposes the application to known security vulnerabilities within the Filament rendering engine that have been patched in newer versions.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Compromised dependencies of Filament can introduce vulnerabilities into the application's rendering pipeline. Keeping Filament and its dependencies updated reduces the window of opportunity for exploiting known vulnerabilities in the supply chain related to Filament.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Regular updates of Filament significantly reduce the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities within the rendering engine.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of supply chain attacks by minimizing the use of vulnerable dependencies within the Filament ecosystem.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Filament and dependencies are updated periodically, but not on a strict schedule.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal process for regular Filament and dependency updates is not fully defined.
    *   Dependency scanning tools are not yet integrated into the development workflow for Filament dependencies.
    *   Security advisory monitoring specifically for Filament and its ecosystem is not fully automated.
