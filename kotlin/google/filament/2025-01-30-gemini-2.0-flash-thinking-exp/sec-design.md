# BUSINESS POSTURE

Filament is a real-time physically based rendering engine for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, WebGL, Vulkan, Metal, and OpenGL. The primary business goal for Filament is to provide a high-quality, cross-platform rendering solution that can be used in a variety of applications, potentially both internally within Google and externally by the wider developer community.

Business priorities for Filament are likely to include:

*   Performance: Rendering needs to be fast and efficient across all supported platforms.
*   Quality: The rendering engine should produce visually appealing and physically accurate results.
*   Cross-platform compatibility:  Filament must function correctly and consistently on all target platforms and graphics APIs.
*   Feature richness:  Providing a comprehensive set of rendering features to meet the needs of diverse applications.
*   Developer experience:  The API should be well-documented, easy to use, and integrate smoothly into existing development workflows.
*   Open Source Adoption: Encouraging a community around Filament to drive adoption, contributions, and improvements.

Key business risks associated with Filament include:

*   Performance bottlenecks: Inefficient rendering could lead to poor user experiences in applications using Filament.
*   Rendering inaccuracies: Visual defects or physically incorrect rendering could negatively impact the quality of applications.
*   Platform compatibility issues: Bugs or inconsistencies across platforms could limit Filament's usability and adoption.
*   Security vulnerabilities:  Security flaws in the rendering engine could be exploited by malicious actors in applications using Filament, potentially leading to crashes, data breaches, or other security incidents.
*   Lack of adoption: If Filament fails to meet developer needs or faces strong competition, it may not achieve widespread adoption, reducing its business value.
*   Maintenance burden:  Maintaining a complex, cross-platform rendering engine requires significant ongoing effort and resources.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Filament, being an open-source project hosted on GitHub, likely incorporates standard open-source development security practices.

Existing security controls:

*   security control: Code reviews are implicitly part of the development process through GitHub pull requests. This is standard practice for collaborative software development and helps to catch potential issues, including security vulnerabilities, before code is merged. Implemented in: GitHub Pull Request workflow.
*   security control: Static analysis tools are likely used by developers locally and potentially integrated into pre-commit hooks or CI pipelines, although not explicitly documented. These tools help identify potential code quality and security issues early in the development cycle. Implemented in: Developer local environment, potentially CI pipelines.
*   security control: Dependency scanning is likely used, potentially through GitHub Dependabot or similar tools, to monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities. This helps to manage the risk of using vulnerable third-party libraries. Implemented in: GitHub Dependabot or similar dependency scanning services.
*   security control: Open source licensing (Apache 2.0) promotes transparency and community scrutiny, which can indirectly contribute to security by allowing wider review and identification of potential issues. Implemented in: Project licensing.

Accepted risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching. The open-source model relies on the community to report and contribute fixes for security issues. The speed and completeness of these responses can vary.
*   accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. Filament, like most software projects, relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can introduce security risks. While dependency scanning helps, it's not a complete solution, and zero-day vulnerabilities can still pose a risk.

Recommended security controls:

*   security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. This will automatically scan code changes for security vulnerabilities before they are merged, providing an additional layer of security beyond code reviews and local static analysis.
*   security control: Conduct regular Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) or fuzzing of the rendering engine. This involves testing the running application with various inputs, including potentially malicious ones, to identify vulnerabilities that might not be apparent through static analysis.
*   security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process. This includes having a security policy that outlines how security vulnerabilities should be reported and how the project will respond to and fix them.
*   security control: Generate and maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for each release. This provides a comprehensive list of all components used in Filament, including dependencies, which is crucial for vulnerability management and supply chain security.
*   security control: Implement code signing for release artifacts. This helps ensure the integrity and authenticity of Filament releases, protecting users from potentially malicious modifications.

Security requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to a rendering engine library. Filament itself does not handle user authentication. Applications using Filament are responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to a rendering engine library. Filament does not enforce authorization. Applications using Filament are responsible for their own authorization logic and access control.
*   Input Validation: Critical. Filament must perform robust input validation on all data it processes, including 3D models, textures, shaders, and rendering commands. This is essential to prevent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection attacks, and denial-of-service attacks that could arise from processing maliciously crafted input data. Input validation should be implemented at the API boundaries of Filament, ensuring that all external data is checked before being used by the rendering engine.
*   Cryptography:  Potentially relevant for features like secure asset loading or content protection, but not a core requirement for the rendering engine itself in its basic functionality. If cryptographic operations are used, they must be implemented using well-vetted cryptographic libraries and best practices to avoid introducing vulnerabilities through weak or incorrect cryptography.

# DESIGN

Filament is designed as a modular, cross-platform rendering engine. It provides a comprehensive suite of rendering features while abstracting away the complexities of different graphics APIs and operating systems.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:

*   Secure and correct rendering of 3D graphics in applications using Filament.  This is critical because vulnerabilities in the rendering engine could be exploited to compromise applications, leading to crashes, data breaches, or other security incidents. Incorrect rendering could lead to application malfunction and poor user experience.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

*   Filament Source Code: Sensitivity: Publicly available (open source), but integrity and availability are important to ensure the project's continued development and trustworthiness. Modifications by unauthorized parties or introduction of malicious code would be a significant risk.
*   Build Artifacts (Libraries, Headers): Sensitivity: Publicly distributed, but integrity and authenticity are crucial. Compromised build artifacts could be distributed to users, leading to widespread security issues in applications using Filament.
*   User Data (Indirectly): Filament itself does not directly handle user data. However, applications using Filament will handle user data. Vulnerabilities in Filament could potentially be exploited to indirectly access or compromise user data within those applications. The sensitivity of user data depends on the specific application using Filament.
*   Rendering Assets (Models, Textures, Shaders): Sensitivity: Varies depending on the application and the nature of the assets. Some assets might be proprietary or contain sensitive information. Filament needs to handle assets securely to prevent unauthorized access or modification within the rendering pipeline.
