# Threat Model Analysis for google/filament

## Threat: [Malicious GLTF Asset Injection](./threats/malicious_gltf_asset_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted GLTF file to the application. Filament's GLTF loader parses this file. The malicious GLTF exploits a vulnerability in the GLTF parser (e.g., buffer overflow, integer overflow) to execute arbitrary code or cause a crash. This is achieved by embedding malicious data within the GLTF file structure that triggers parsing errors leading to exploitable conditions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or client machine running the application, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to application crash, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Filament Component Affected:** `filament::gltfio` module, specifically the GLTF loader functions responsible for parsing and processing GLTF files.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust validation of GLTF files before loading them with Filament. This includes schema validation, checking for unexpected data types, sizes, and structural anomalies within the GLTF file.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Process GLTF loading and parsing in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to contain potential exploits and prevent them from affecting the wider system.
    *   **Regular Filament Updates:**  Maintain Filament library at the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address known and newly discovered vulnerabilities in asset parsing.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** For web-based applications, utilize CSP to restrict the capabilities of loaded assets, limiting the potential damage from RCE by controlling script execution and resource access.
    *   **Static Analysis and Fuzzing:** Employ static analysis tools and fuzzing techniques on the application code and Filament integration points to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities in GLTF handling.

## Threat: [Malicious Texture Injection](./threats/malicious_texture_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted texture file (e.g., PNG, JPG, KTX, DDS) to the application. Filament's texture loading functions process this file. The malicious texture exploits a vulnerability in the image decoding libraries used by Filament (or potentially in Filament's own texture processing logic) to cause memory corruption or DoS. This could involve crafted image headers, malformed pixel data, or exploits targeting specific image format vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Memory Corruption, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the attacker can control program execution flow after corrupting memory.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to application crash caused by memory corruption or excessive resource consumption during image decoding.
*   **Filament Component Affected:** `filament::Engine` texture loading functions, and underlying image decoding libraries (e.g., libraries for PNG, JPEG, KTX, DDS decoding) that Filament relies upon.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate texture files for expected formats, sizes, and basic integrity before loading. Sanitize or re-encode textures using trusted libraries to remove potentially malicious embedded data.
    *   **Secure Image Decoding Libraries:** Ensure that the image decoding libraries used by Filament are up-to-date and patched against known security vulnerabilities. Consider using hardened or memory-safe image decoding libraries if available.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement limits on texture sizes and resolutions to prevent excessive memory allocation and potential buffer overflows during decoding.
    *   **Regular Filament Updates:** Keep Filament library updated to receive security fixes and improvements in texture handling and dependency management.
    *   **Memory Safety Practices:** Employ memory-safe programming practices in the application code that interacts with Filament's texture loading API to minimize the risk of memory corruption vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Filament Engine Bug Exploitation](./threats/filament_engine_bug_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a bug in the core Filament rendering engine code itself. This could be a memory safety vulnerability, a logic error, or any other flaw that can be triggered by specific scene configurations, rendering commands, or asset types. Exploitation might involve crafting specific scenes or assets that trigger the bug during rendering.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the bug is a memory safety vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, use-after-free), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to application crash, hang, or unexpected termination caused by the bug.
    *   Information Disclosure (less likely, but theoretically possible in some scenarios) if the bug allows access to sensitive data in memory.
*   **Filament Component Affected:** Core Filament rendering engine code, potentially affecting various modules such as the renderer, material system, shader system, scene management, and asset loading.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (Can be Critical or High depending on the specific bug and its exploitability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Filament Updates:**  Crucially, keep Filament library updated to the latest stable version. Filament developers actively work on bug fixes and security patches, and updates are the primary way to mitigate known engine vulnerabilities.
    *   **Bug Reporting and Community Engagement:**  If you encounter suspicious behavior or potential bugs in Filament, report them to the Filament development team through their issue tracker or community channels. This helps in identifying and fixing vulnerabilities proactively.
    *   **Fuzzing and Testing (for Filament Developers/Advanced Users):** For developers deeply integrating with or extending Filament, consider using fuzzing and rigorous testing techniques to proactively identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities in Filament itself or in your integration code.
    *   **Code Reviews (for Filament Integration Code):** Conduct thorough code reviews of the application code that interacts with Filament's API to ensure correct and secure usage, minimizing the chance of triggering engine bugs through improper API calls or data handling.
    *   **Sandboxing (Application Level):** While not directly mitigating Filament bugs, running the application in a sandboxed environment can limit the impact of a successful exploit, even if it originates from a Filament engine bug.
