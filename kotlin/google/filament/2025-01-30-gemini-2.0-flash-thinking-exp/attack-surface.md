# Attack Surface Analysis for google/filament

## Attack Surface: [3D Model Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/3d_model_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within Filament's 3D model parsers (e.g., glTF parser). Maliciously crafted model files can exploit these weaknesses during the parsing process.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament directly incorporates and utilizes parsers to load and interpret 3D model file formats. Bugs in these parsers become a direct attack vector within Filament's attack surface.
*   **Example:** A specifically crafted glTF file containing an oversized buffer length field could trigger a buffer overflow within Filament's glTF parsing logic upon loading. This could lead to application crashes or, more critically, arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Crash (Denial of Service):** Application termination and unavailability.
    *   **Memory Corruption:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, allowing attackers to gain control of the application or system.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (Severity depends on the specific vulnerability and exploitability for code execution. Buffer overflows are generally considered Critical).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Filament:** Keep Filament updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the parsers.
    *   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement strict size limits on 3D model files. Consider pre-processing or using secure sanitization techniques on model files before loading with Filament, although this is complex for binary formats.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run the application utilizing Filament within a sandboxed environment. This limits the potential damage if a parser vulnerability is exploited, restricting the attacker's access and capabilities.
    *   **Fuzzing & Security Testing:** Employ fuzzing tools specifically designed to test parsers with malformed or malicious model files. This proactive approach can help identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited in the wild.

## Attack Surface: [Image Parsing Vulnerabilities (Textures)](./attack_surfaces/image_parsing_vulnerabilities__textures_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in the image decoding libraries that Filament relies on to load textures (e.g., PNG, JPEG libraries). Maliciously crafted image files can exploit these vulnerabilities during texture loading.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament depends on external or bundled image decoding libraries to handle texture loading. Any vulnerabilities within these libraries directly extend Filament's attack surface when processing textures.
*   **Example:** A manipulated PNG file with a malformed header could trigger a buffer overflow within the image decoding library used by Filament. This could result in application crashes or, in severe cases, arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Crash (Denial of Service):** Application termination and service disruption.
    *   **Memory Corruption:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, granting attackers control over the application or system.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (Severity depends on the specific vulnerability and exploitability for code execution. Image parsing vulnerabilities are often highly exploitable).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Filament:** Ensure Filament is updated to benefit from any updates or patches to its image decoding dependencies.
    *   **Trusted Image Sources:**  Restrict texture loading to only originate from trusted and verified sources. Avoid loading textures from untrusted or user-uploaded content without thorough validation.
    *   **Input Validation & Format Checks:** Implement size limits on image files and enforce strict format checks to reject potentially malicious or malformed image files before they are processed by Filament.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run the application using Filament in a sandboxed environment to contain the impact of potential exploits originating from image parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:**  If feasible, conduct audits of the image decoding libraries used by Filament to identify and address any known vulnerabilities proactively.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service) via Malicious Assets](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service__via_malicious_assets.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can provide excessively large or complex 3D models or textures designed to consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, GPU memory) when processed by Filament, leading to a Denial of Service condition.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament's rendering pipeline is responsible for processing and loading assets. Without proper resource management and limits, it can be forced to handle overly large assets, leading to resource exhaustion.
*   **Example:** Loading an extremely high-polygon 3D model or a vast number of high-resolution textures can rapidly exhaust GPU memory, causing the application to become unresponsive, crash, or consume excessive system resources, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** **Denial of Service (DoS):** Application becomes unusable, unresponsive, or crashes, disrupting service availability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (DoS attacks can significantly impact application availability and user experience, especially in real-time or critical applications).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits & Quotas:** Implement strict limits and quotas on the size and complexity of assets that can be loaded and processed by Filament. This includes maximum polygon counts, texture resolutions, and file sizes.
    *   **Streaming & Level of Detail (LOD):** Employ techniques like asset streaming and Level of Detail rendering. This ensures that only necessary assets are loaded and that detail levels are dynamically adjusted based on viewing distance, reducing resource consumption.
    *   **Asynchronous Loading:** Implement asynchronous asset loading to prevent blocking the main rendering thread. This improves responsiveness even under heavy asset loading and allows for cancellation of loading if resource limits are exceeded.
    *   **Memory Monitoring & Management:** Implement robust memory monitoring to track resource usage. Implement safeguards to prevent excessive memory consumption and gracefully handle situations where resource limits are approached or exceeded.
    *   **Content Delivery Network (CDN) & Caching:** For web-based applications, utilize CDNs and caching mechanisms to efficiently deliver assets and reduce the load on the server and client when serving 3D content.
