## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Filament and its Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_filament_and_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Implement a dependency management system relevant to Filament's build environment (e.g., Conan for C++ Filament projects, npm/yarn for web-based Filament projects).
    *   Step 2: Regularly check for new Filament releases and updates to its *specific* dependencies (e.g., through Filament's GitHub releases page, security advisories related to Filament's ecosystem).
    *   Step 3: Test new Filament versions in a staging environment before deploying to production to ensure compatibility and stability *with Filament rendering*.
    *   Step 4: Automate the update process where possible, using CI/CD pipelines to build and test with updated Filament and its dependencies.
    *   Step 5: Establish a schedule for regular Filament updates (e.g., aligned with Filament release cycles) and prioritize security updates related to Filament.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in Filament or its *direct* dependencies: Attackers can exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in outdated versions of Filament or libraries *specifically used by Filament* to gain unauthorized access, cause rendering issues, or potentially execute code within the rendering context. (Severity: High)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in Filament or its direct dependencies: Significantly reduces the risk by patching known security flaws *within Filament and its immediate ecosystem*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, dependency management is implemented using `npm` for web components and Conan for the core C++ Filament integration. Automated dependency checks include Filament-related packages.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated testing of Filament version updates in a dedicated staging environment *specifically focused on rendering functionality* is not fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Shader Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/shader_validation_and_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Implement shader compilation and validation using Filament's shader compiler (`shaderc`) during the asset build process to catch syntax and semantic errors *before runtime*.
    *   Step 2:  For shaders derived from user input or external sources, implement input sanitization to prevent injection attacks *targeting Filament's shader processing*. This might involve:
        *   Whitelisting allowed shader keywords and functions *relevant to Filament's shading language*.
        *   Using regular expressions to validate shader syntax *according to Filament's shader language specifications*.
        *   Parameterizing shaders instead of directly injecting code *into shader source strings*.
    *   Step 3: Set resource limits for shader compilation and execution *within Filament's rendering pipeline* to prevent denial-of-service attacks. This could involve limiting shader complexity or execution time *as measured by Filament's performance metrics*.
    *   Step 4: Implement error handling for shader compilation and execution *within Filament* to gracefully handle invalid or malicious shaders without crashing the rendering engine.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Shader injection attacks: Attackers could inject malicious shader code to manipulate rendering behavior *within Filament*, potentially leading to visual anomalies, information disclosure through rendering artifacts, or denial of service by overloading the GPU. (Severity: Medium)
    *   Denial of Service through complex shaders: Maliciously crafted shaders could consume excessive GPU resources *managed by Filament*, leading to application slowdown or crashes *during rendering*. (Severity: Medium)
    *   Application crashes due to invalid shaders:  Malformed shaders can cause Filament's rendering engine to crash, impacting application availability. (Severity: Medium)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Shader injection attacks: Moderately reduces the risk by preventing direct code injection and validating shader syntax *specifically for Filament shaders*.
    *   Denial of Service through complex shaders: Moderately reduces the risk by implementing resource limits and validation *within Filament's rendering context*.
    *   Application crashes due to invalid shaders: Significantly reduces the risk by validating shaders and implementing error handling *in Filament's shader pipeline*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial implementation. Shader compilation using `shaderc` is part of the asset pipeline. Basic syntax checks are performed *using Filament's compiler*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Input sanitization for shader parameters derived from external sources *specifically for Filament shaders* is not implemented. Resource limits for shader compilation and execution *within Filament* are not explicitly set. Error handling for shader compilation *in Filament* is basic and could be improved.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Asset Validation and Integrity Checks](./mitigation_strategies/asset_validation_and_integrity_checks.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Implement file format validation for all assets loaded by Filament (models, textures, materials, etc.) to ensure they conform to expected formats *supported by Filament* (e.g., glTF, PNG, JPEG).
    *   Step 2: Generate and store checksums (e.g., SHA-256) for all assets *used by Filament* during the build process.
    *   Step 3: Before loading an asset *into Filament*, recalculate its checksum and compare it to the stored checksum to verify integrity and detect tampering.
    *   Step 4: Implement content sanitization for assets *loaded by Filament*, especially those from untrusted sources, to remove potentially malicious embedded scripts or data *that could be interpreted by Filament or related libraries*. This might involve using specialized libraries to parse and sanitize asset formats *relevant to Filament*.
    *   Step 5: Implement robust error handling for asset loading failures *within Filament* due to validation or integrity checks.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Asset tampering: Attackers could modify asset files *used by Filament* to inject malicious content, alter rendering behavior, or cause denial of service *within the Filament application*. (Severity: Medium)
    *   Malicious asset injection: Attackers could replace legitimate assets *used by Filament* with malicious ones to compromise the application's rendering or behavior. (Severity: Medium)
    *   Parsing vulnerabilities in asset loaders *used by Filament*:  Exploiting vulnerabilities in asset parsing libraries *integrated with Filament* could lead to crashes or code execution *within the Filament rendering process*. (Severity: Medium)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Asset tampering: Significantly reduces the risk by detecting unauthorized modifications to assets *used by Filament*.
    *   Malicious asset injection: Significantly reduces the risk by verifying asset integrity and preventing the use of tampered assets *in Filament*.
    *   Parsing vulnerabilities in asset loaders used by Filament: Moderately reduces the risk by validating file formats and sanitizing content, but might not prevent all parsing vulnerabilities *within Filament's asset loading pipeline*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial implementation. File format validation is performed for some asset types *loaded by Filament*. Checksums are generated for some critical assets *used in Filament scenes* during the build process.

    *   Step 3: Implement timeouts for asset loading operations *within Filament* to prevent indefinite loading attempts.
    *   Step 4: Monitor resource usage *by Filament* during asset loading and implement mechanisms to gracefully handle resource exhaustion (e.g., display error messages, fallback to lower-resolution assets *within Filament scenes*).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service through excessive asset loading: Attackers could attempt to overload the application by requesting the loading of extremely large or numerous assets *into Filament*, leading to resource exhaustion and application slowdown or crashes *during rendering*. (Severity: Medium)
    *   Memory exhaustion: Loading excessively large assets *into Filament* can lead to memory exhaustion and application crashes. (Severity: Medium)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service through excessive asset loading: Moderately reduces the risk by limiting the impact of malicious asset loading attempts *on Filament*, but might not fully prevent all forms of resource exhaustion.
    *   Memory exhaustion: Moderately reduces the risk by limiting asset sizes and numbers *loaded by Filament*, but depends on the specific resource limits and Filament's overall memory management.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial implementation. Limits on individual asset sizes are in place for textures *used by Filament*, but not for all asset types.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Limits on the total number of concurrently loaded assets *by Filament* and timeouts for asset loading *within Filament* are not implemented. Resource monitoring *of Filament's asset loading* during asset loading is basic and could be improved.
