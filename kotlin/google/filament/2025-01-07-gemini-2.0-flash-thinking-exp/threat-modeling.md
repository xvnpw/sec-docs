# Threat Model Analysis for google/filament

## Threat: [Malformed Model Data Injection](./threats/malformed_model_data_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malformed Model Data Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious 3D model file (e.g., glTF, OBJ) containing unexpected or invalid data structures, oversized buffers, or intentionally crafted edge cases. The application loads this model using Filament. Filament's parsing logic attempts to process this malformed data.
    *   **Impact:**  Loading the malformed model can cause Filament to crash due to unexpected data, exhaust system resources (memory, CPU), or potentially trigger vulnerabilities leading to code execution within the Filament library itself.
    *   **Affected Filament Component:** Model Loader (e.g., `Filament.EntityManager`, `Filament.gltfio` if using glTF).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Filament's built-in validation mechanisms or external libraries specifically designed for validating 3D model formats *before* passing them to Filament's loaders.
        *   Implement resource limits and monitoring to prevent resource exhaustion during Filament's model loading process.
        *   Consider loading models in a separate, sandboxed process to isolate potential crashes within Filament.
        *   Keep Filament updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in its model loading components.

## Threat: [Bugs and Vulnerabilities within Filament Itself](./threats/bugs_and_vulnerabilities_within_filament_itself.md)

*   **Threat:** Bugs and Vulnerabilities within Filament Itself
    *   **Description:** Filament, like any complex software library, might contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities in its core rendering logic, data handling, or other internal components. An attacker could exploit these flaws by providing specific inputs or triggering certain code paths within Filament.
    *   **Impact:** The impact can vary widely, from application crashes and unexpected rendering behavior to potential remote code execution within the context of the application using Filament, or even memory corruption.
    *   **Affected Filament Component:** Any component of Filament, depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., Renderer, Material System, Shader Compiler, Animation System).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the nature of the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest Filament releases and security patches provided by the Google Filament team.
        *   Monitor Filament's official issue tracker and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities and recommended mitigations.
        *   If possible, contribute to the Filament project by reporting any discovered vulnerabilities responsibly.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Filament's Image Loading (Directly within Filament)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_filament's_image_loading__directly_within_filament_.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Filament's Image Loading (Directly within Filament)
    *   **Description:** If Filament directly handles image loading for textures (e.g., through an internal library or its own implementation), vulnerabilities in this image loading code could be exploited by providing maliciously crafted image files.
    *   **Impact:**  Could lead to buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads/writes, or other memory corruption issues within Filament's image processing routines, potentially leading to crashes or remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Filament Component:** Texture System (`Filament.Texture`), potentially internal image decoding libraries used by Filament.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Filament is updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for vulnerabilities in image loading libraries.
        *   If possible, pre-process and validate image files before they are loaded by Filament.
        *   Be cautious about loading images from untrusted sources.
