## Attack Surface: [Malicious Shader Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_shader_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into shader programs (vertex or fragment shaders) that are then compiled and executed by Filament.
*   **How Filament Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Filament provides mechanisms for applications to load and use custom shaders. If the application allows user-provided or influenced shader code without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A game allows users to create custom visual effects by providing shader snippets. A malicious user injects code that causes an infinite loop on the GPU, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (GPU lock-up, application crash), potential exploitation of driver vulnerabilities leading to system instability or even code execution on the GPU.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided shader code.
    *   Use a safe subset of shader language features if possible.
    *   Implement robust error handling during shader compilation and execution.
    *   Consider static analysis tools for shader code.
    *   Limit user influence over shader generation to predefined parameters or a curated library of effects.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Model Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_model_files.md)

*   **Description:** Loading and parsing 3D model files (e.g., glTF, OBJ) from untrusted sources can introduce vulnerabilities through specially crafted files.
*   **How Filament Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Filament provides functionalities to load and parse various 3D model formats. Vulnerabilities in these parsing routines can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A user uploads a seemingly harmless 3D model. However, the model file contains excessively large data chunks or deeply nested structures that trigger buffer overflows or excessive memory consumption during parsing by Filament.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (memory exhaustion, application crash), potential arbitrary code execution if buffer overflows are exploitable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate all model files against a strict schema or specification.
    *   Implement robust error handling during model parsing.
    *   Set limits on resource consumption during model loading (e.g., maximum vertex count, triangle count).
    *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for model parsing.
    *   Scan uploaded model files with security tools if feasible.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Texture Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_texture_files.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to model files, loading texture files (e.g., PNG, JPEG, KTX) from untrusted sources can lead to vulnerabilities during image decoding.
*   **How Filament Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Filament utilizes image decoding libraries to load textures. Vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries *within Filament's integration* can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An application loads a user-provided texture for a material. A malicious actor provides a specially crafted PNG file that exploits a buffer overflow in the image decoding library used by Filament, potentially leading to a crash or code execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate texture file headers and formats.
    *   Use well-vetted and regularly updated image decoding libraries.
    *   Implement robust error handling during texture loading and decoding.
    *   Set limits on texture dimensions and file sizes.
    *   Consider re-encoding textures using known-safe libraries or formats.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflows in Resource Handling](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflows_in_resource_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Integer overflows can occur when calculating sizes or offsets related to resources (models, textures, buffers) if input data is not properly validated.
*   **How Filament Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Filament manages memory and resources for rendering. If size calculations during resource loading or manipulation overflow, it can lead to memory corruption or unexpected behavior.
*   **Example:** A malicious model file specifies an extremely large number of vertices, causing an integer overflow when calculating the required buffer size. This could lead to allocating a smaller-than-expected buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow when the model data is loaded.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, denial of service, potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate all input data related to resource sizes and counts.
    *   Use data types large enough to accommodate the maximum possible values.
    *   Implement checks for potential integer overflows before performing size calculations.
    *   Utilize safe arithmetic functions that detect overflows.
