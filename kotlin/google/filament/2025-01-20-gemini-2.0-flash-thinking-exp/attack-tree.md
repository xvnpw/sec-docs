## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Filament API/Logic -> Malicious API Calls -> Overflow Buffers in API Calls](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_filament_apilogic_-_malicious_api_calls_-_overflow_buffers_in_api_calls.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies Filament API calls that accept data buffers or size parameters. They then provide input data exceeding the expected buffer size without proper bounds checking within Filament.
*   **Mechanism:** This overflow can overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially corrupting program data, control flow structures, or even injecting malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's process, allowing the attacker to gain full control, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Filament API/Logic -> Shader Exploits -> Inject Malicious Shaders](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_filament_apilogic_-_shader_exploits_-_inject_malicious_shaders.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application allows users to provide custom shaders or loads shaders from untrusted sources, an attacker can inject specially crafted shader code.
*   **Mechanism:** Malicious shaders can contain code designed to crash the GPU driver, leading to a denial of service. They might also exploit vulnerabilities in the shader compiler or GPU hardware to leak sensitive information or even achieve code execution on the GPU (which could potentially be leveraged further).
*   **Impact:**  Can cause application crashes and denial of service. In more severe scenarios, it could lead to information disclosure or potentially even compromise the system through GPU vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Trigger Use-After-Free](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_trigger_use-after-free.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates the lifecycle of objects managed by Filament. They trigger a scenario where a pointer to an object is still being used (dereferenced) after the memory it points to has been freed.
*   **Mechanism:** Accessing freed memory can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes, data corruption, or, critically, the ability to overwrite memory that has been reallocated for a different purpose. This can be exploited to gain control of the program's execution flow.
*   **Impact:** This is a critical memory corruption vulnerability that can often be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Trigger Double-Free](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_trigger_double-free.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker finds a way to cause Filament to attempt to free the same memory region twice.
*   **Mechanism:**  Freeing the same memory twice corrupts the memory management structures (like the heap), leading to unpredictable behavior and potential crashes. In some cases, it can be exploited to gain control over memory allocation and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:**  Similar to use-after-free, this is a critical memory corruption vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Heap Overflow/Underflow](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_heap_overflowunderflow.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input that causes Filament to write data beyond the allocated boundaries of a heap buffer (overflow) or before the beginning of the allocated buffer (underflow).
*   **Mechanism:** Heap overflows can overwrite adjacent memory regions, corrupting data or control flow information. Heap underflows are less common but can also lead to memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** This is a critical memory corruption vulnerability that can be exploited for arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Dependencies -> Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_dependencies_-_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Filament relies on various third-party libraries (e.g., gltfio, mathfu). Attackers can identify known vulnerabilities in these dependencies.
*   **Mechanism:** Once a vulnerability is identified, attackers can craft specific inputs or trigger specific conditions that exploit the flaw within the dependency's code.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from denial of service and information disclosure to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Dependencies -> Supply Malicious Input to Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_dependencies_-_supply_malicious_input_to_vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Even if no publicly known vulnerabilities exist, attackers can analyze the source code or behavior of Filament's dependencies to find potential weaknesses or edge cases.
*   **Mechanism:** They then craft specific, potentially malformed, input data that is passed to these dependencies during asset loading or processing. This malicious input can trigger unexpected behavior, crashes, or even memory corruption within the dependency.
*   **Impact:** Similar to exploiting known vulnerabilities, this can lead to a range of impacts, including denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.
