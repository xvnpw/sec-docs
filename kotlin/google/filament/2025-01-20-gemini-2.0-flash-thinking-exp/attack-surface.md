# Attack Surface Analysis for google/filament

## Attack Surface: [Malicious 3D Model Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_3d_model_injection.md)

* **Description:** The application loads and renders 3D models provided by users or external sources. A maliciously crafted model can exploit vulnerabilities in Filament's parsing or rendering pipeline.
* **How Filament Contributes:** Filament is responsible for parsing various 3D model formats (e.g., glTF, OBJ) and processing the geometry data for rendering. Bugs in its parsing logic or handling of complex/malformed data can be exploited.
* **Example:** A user uploads a specially crafted glTF file with excessively large vertex counts or deeply nested hierarchies, causing Filament to consume excessive memory and crash the application.
* **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential memory corruption leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. In extreme cases, although less likely, potential for remote code execution if vulnerabilities in parsing are severe.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation on uploaded model files, checking for file size limits, complexity limits (e.g., polygon count, node count), and adherence to format specifications.
    * **Resource Limits:** Configure Filament or the application to limit the resources (memory, processing time) allocated for model loading and rendering.
    * **Sandboxing:** If feasible, process model loading and rendering in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
    * **Regular Updates:** Keep Filament updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Texture Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_texture_injection.md)

* **Description:** The application loads and uses image textures for rendering. Maliciously crafted textures can exploit vulnerabilities in Filament's image decoding or processing.
* **How Filament Contributes:** Filament uses libraries to decode various image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries or in Filament's handling of image data can be exploited.
* **Example:** A user uploads a specially crafted PNG file that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the image decoding library used by Filament, potentially leading to a crash or code execution.
* **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential memory corruption, potential for remote code execution.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Validation:** Validate uploaded image files, checking file size, format, and potentially using image sanitization techniques.
    * **Secure Decoding Libraries:** Ensure the image decoding libraries used by Filament are up-to-date and have known vulnerabilities patched. Consider using libraries with a strong security track record.
    * **Regular Updates:** Keep Filament and its dependencies updated.

## Attack Surface: [Shader Vulnerabilities (If User-Provided Shaders are Allowed)](./attack_surfaces/shader_vulnerabilities__if_user-provided_shaders_are_allowed_.md)

* **Description:** If the application allows users to provide or modify shaders (GLSL or similar), malicious shaders can be injected to cause harm.
* **How Filament Contributes:** Filament compiles and executes shader code. If this code is provided by an untrusted source, it can contain malicious logic.
* **Example:** A user provides a shader that contains an infinite loop, causing the GPU to lock up and the application to become unresponsive. Alternatively, a shader could attempt to access memory it shouldn't, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.
* **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential information disclosure (though less likely in typical shader environments), rendering artifacts or manipulation.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Avoid User-Provided Shaders:** If possible, avoid allowing users to provide arbitrary shader code.
    * **Shader Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust validation and sanitization of user-provided shader code before compilation. This is a complex task and may not be fully effective against sophisticated attacks.
    * **Resource Limits:** Impose limits on shader complexity and execution time.
    * **Sandboxing:** Execute shader compilation and execution in a sandboxed environment.
