# Attack Surface Analysis for google/ksp

## Attack Surface: [Malicious KSP Processor Dependency](./attack_surfaces/malicious_ksp_processor_dependency.md)

**Description:**  A third-party KSP processor dependency is compromised or intentionally malicious.

**How KSP Contributes:** KSP relies on external processors to perform code generation and analysis during the build. If a processor is malicious, it can execute arbitrary code within the build environment.

**Example:**  A seemingly useful annotation processing library, distributed as a KSP processor, contains code that exfiltrates environment variables or injects backdoor code into generated files.

**Impact:**  Critical. Could lead to complete compromise of the build environment, supply chain attacks affecting downstream users, and injection of malicious code into the final application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Dependency Scanning:** Implement dependency scanning tools that identify known vulnerabilities in KSP processors.
* **Source Code Review:**  If feasible, review the source code of third-party KSP processors before including them.
* **Reputable Sources:**  Prefer KSP processors from well-established and trusted sources.
* **Checksum Verification:** Verify the integrity of downloaded KSP processor artifacts using checksums.
* **Limited Permissions:**  Run the build process with the least necessary privileges to limit the impact of a compromised processor.

## Attack Surface: [Internally Developed Malicious KSP Processor](./attack_surfaces/internally_developed_malicious_ksp_processor.md)

**Description:** A developer with malicious intent or a compromised internal account introduces a malicious KSP processor within the project.

**How KSP Contributes:** KSP allows developers to create custom processors. This flexibility can be abused to introduce malicious functionality during the build.

**Example:** An insider creates a KSP processor that injects telemetry code into the application without authorization or modifies build outputs to introduce vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Critical. Can lead to the same severe consequences as a malicious external dependency, potentially with more targeted and sophisticated attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews for all internally developed KSP processors.
* **Access Control:** Restrict access to the codebase and build system to authorized personnel.
* **Security Training:** Educate developers about the risks associated with KSP and secure development practices.
* **Monitoring and Auditing:** Monitor build processes for unusual activity and audit changes to KSP processor code.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable KSP Processor Exploitation via Crafted Input](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_ksp_processor_exploitation_via_crafted_input.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability exists within a KSP processor that can be triggered by specially crafted Kotlin code within the project.

**How KSP Contributes:** KSP processors analyze the project's Kotlin code. If a processor has vulnerabilities in its parsing or processing logic, malicious code can exploit these flaws.

**Example:** A KSP processor has a buffer overflow vulnerability when processing certain annotation parameters. An attacker crafts Kotlin code with excessively long parameters to trigger the overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code within the build process.

**Impact:** High. Could lead to arbitrary code execution within the build environment, potentially compromising the build process or injecting malicious code.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regular Updates:** Keep KSP and its processors updated to the latest versions, which often include security fixes.
* **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools on the codebase to identify potentially problematic code that might trigger vulnerabilities in KSP processors.
* **Fuzzing:**  Consider fuzzing KSP processors with various Kotlin code inputs to uncover potential vulnerabilities.
* **Input Validation in Processors:**  Developers of KSP processors should implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent exploitation of crafted input.

## Attack Surface: [Build Environment Compromise via KSP Processor Actions](./attack_surfaces/build_environment_compromise_via_ksp_processor_actions.md)

**Description:** A compromised or malicious KSP processor leverages its access to the build environment to perform unauthorized actions.

**How KSP Contributes:** KSP processors have access to the file system and potentially network resources during the build process.

**Example:** A malicious KSP processor reads sensitive configuration files containing API keys or credentials, or it initiates unauthorized network requests to exfiltrate data.

**Impact:** High. Could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, unauthorized access to external systems, or further compromise of the development infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the build process with the minimum necessary permissions.
* **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the build environment from sensitive internal networks.
* **Monitoring Network Activity:** Monitor network traffic originating from the build environment for suspicious activity.
* **File System Permissions:** Restrict file system access for the build process and KSP processors to only necessary directories.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection in Generated Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_in_generated_files.md)

**Description:** A compromised or malicious KSP processor injects malicious code directly into the files it generates.

**How KSP Contributes:** KSP's primary function is code generation. This makes it a direct pathway for injecting malicious code into the application's source code or resources.

**Example:** A malicious KSP processor modifies generated Kotlin code to include a backdoor or injects malicious JavaScript into generated web assets.

**Impact:** High. The injected malicious code becomes part of the application, potentially leading to various security vulnerabilities in the final product.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Output Verification:** Implement post-build verification steps to check generated files for unexpected or malicious content.
* **Secure Code Generation Practices:**  Developers of KSP processors should follow secure coding practices to prevent unintentional injection vulnerabilities.
* **Code Signing:**  Sign generated artifacts to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
