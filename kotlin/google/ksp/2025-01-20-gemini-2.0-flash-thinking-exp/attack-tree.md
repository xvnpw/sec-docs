## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious KSP Processor [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_ksp_processor__high_risk_path_.md)

**Goal:** Introduce a KSP processor that contains malicious code, allowing for arbitrary code execution during compilation or the generation of vulnerable code.

* **Introduce Malicious Processor as Dependency [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Gain Control of Dependency Management:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker could compromise a public or private artifact repository used by the project. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository software, using stolen credentials, or social engineering.
        * **Attack Vector:** A dependency confusion attack involves publishing a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency on a public repository. If the project's build configuration is not properly secured, it might download the malicious package instead of the intended internal one.
    * **Inject Malicious Processor Dependency:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Once control over dependency management is achieved, the attacker can add the malicious processor as a dependency in the project's `build.gradle.kts` or similar build files. This could involve directly modifying the build file if access is gained, or by manipulating the repository metadata.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in KSP Library](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_ksp_library.md)

* **Trigger Code Execution via Input [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Goal:** Exploit a vulnerability within the KSP library itself by providing specially crafted input, leading to arbitrary code execution during the compilation phase.
    * **Provide Malicious Input to KSP:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker with a deep understanding of KSP's internal workings could craft specific annotations or code structures that exploit parsing or processing vulnerabilities within the KSP library. This might involve exceeding buffer limits, providing unexpected data types, or exploiting flaws in the symbol resolution process.
    * **KSP Processes Input Vulnerably:**
        * **Attack Vector:** If a vulnerability exists in KSP's input processing logic, the malicious input will trigger the vulnerability, leading to code execution within the context of the compilation process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit KSP Configuration/Usage [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ksp_configurationusage__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Manipulate Build Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Goal:** Modify the project's build configuration to introduce malicious processors, alter KSP's behavior, or disable security features.
    * **Gain Access to Build Files:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker could compromise a developer's machine through malware, phishing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in software used by the developer.
        * **Attack Vector:**  Compromising the CI/CD pipeline by exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD software, using stolen credentials, or through misconfigurations can grant access to build files.
    * **Modify KSP Configuration:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Once access to build files is gained, the attacker can directly modify the `build.gradle.kts` or similar files to introduce malicious processor options or arguments, causing unintended processors to be executed during compilation.
        * **Attack Vector:** If KSP offers configuration options related to security (e.g., disabling certain checks), an attacker could disable these features to increase the attack surface.
