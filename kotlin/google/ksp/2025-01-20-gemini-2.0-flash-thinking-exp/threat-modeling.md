# Threat Model Analysis for google/ksp

## Threat: [Malicious KSP Processor Code Injection](./threats/malicious_ksp_processor_code_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts or compromises a KSP processor. When the build process executes this processor, it injects malicious code directly into the application's source code or generated files. This could involve adding backdoors, modifying existing logic, or introducing new vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  The application's integrity is compromised. The injected code could allow for remote code execution, data breaches, or other malicious activities once the application is deployed.

**Affected KSP Component:** `KSP Processors`

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully vet and audit all KSP processor dependencies.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in processor dependencies.
*   Employ a secure dependency management strategy, such as using a private artifact repository with access controls.
*   Consider using checksum verification for processor dependencies.
*   Regularly review the source code of KSP processors used in the project.

## Threat: [Malicious KSP Processor Data Exfiltration](./threats/malicious_ksp_processor_data_exfiltration.md)

**Description:** A compromised KSP processor is designed to extract sensitive information from the build environment during the compilation process. This could include environment variables containing secrets, API keys, or other confidential data. The processor could then transmit this data to an external attacker-controlled server.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information can lead to unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, and financial loss.

**Affected KSP Component:** `KSP Processors`, `Symbol Processing API` (accessing project metadata)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize the amount of sensitive information available in the build environment.
*   Implement strict access controls for the build environment.
*   Monitor network activity during builds for unusual outbound connections.
*   Use ephemeral build environments that are destroyed after each build.
*   Regularly review the permissions and data access patterns of KSP processors.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on KSP Processor Dependency](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_ksp_processor_dependency.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the repository or distribution channel of a legitimate KSP processor. Users unknowingly download and execute the compromised version, which contains malicious code.

**Impact:**  The impact is similar to using a directly malicious processor, potentially leading to code injection, data exfiltration, or build process manipulation. This can affect a large number of projects relying on the compromised dependency.

**Affected KSP Component:** `Dependency Resolution`, `KSP Plugin` (downloading and applying processors)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Pin specific versions of KSP processor dependencies to avoid automatically pulling in compromised updates.
*   Use dependency scanning tools that check against known compromised packages.
*   Monitor for security advisories related to KSP processors used in the project.
*   Prefer processors from reputable and well-maintained sources.
*   Consider using a private artifact repository to host and control access to KSP processor dependencies.

## Threat: [Generation of Vulnerable Code by KSP Processor](./threats/generation_of_vulnerable_code_by_ksp_processor.md)

**Description:** A KSP processor, even if not intentionally malicious, might contain bugs or design flaws that lead to the generation of code with security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, insecure defaults).

**Impact:**  The generated code introduces security vulnerabilities into the application, which can be exploited by attackers after deployment.

**Affected KSP Component:** `KSP Processors`, `Code Generation API`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test the application, including the code generated by KSP processors.
*   Review the source code of KSP processors to understand their code generation logic.
*   Use static analysis security testing (SAST) tools on the generated code.
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing KSP processors.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Build Artifacts by Malicious KSP Processor](./threats/manipulation_of_build_artifacts_by_malicious_ksp_processor.md)

**Description:** A compromised KSP processor modifies the final build artifacts (e.g., JAR files, APKs) in a malicious way after code generation. This could involve adding backdoors, replacing legitimate files, or injecting malware.

**Impact:**  The distributed application is compromised, potentially leading to severe security breaches on user devices or servers.

**Affected KSP Component:** `KSP Processors`, `Code Generation API`, `Build System Integration`

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement integrity checks for build artifacts after the build process.
*   Sign build artifacts to ensure their authenticity and prevent tampering.
*   Secure the build environment to prevent unauthorized modification of build outputs.
