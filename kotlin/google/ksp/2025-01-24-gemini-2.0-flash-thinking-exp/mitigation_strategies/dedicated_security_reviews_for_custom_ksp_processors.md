#### 4.2. Analysis of Threats Mitigated and Impact:

*   **Threats Mitigated: Broad Spectrum of Processor-Related Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** The strategy correctly identifies that dedicated security reviews mitigate a wide range of vulnerabilities. This is accurate because KSP processors, if not developed securely, can introduce various security flaws, from minor logic errors to critical injection vulnerabilities. Regular reviews act as a safety net to catch these issues.
*   **Impact: Broad Spectrum of Processor-Related Vulnerabilities: Medium to High reduction.** The impact assessment is also reasonable.  The effectiveness of security reviews is directly tied to their quality, frequency, and the expertise of the reviewers.  Well-executed, regular security reviews can significantly reduce the risk of vulnerabilities. However, "Medium to High" acknowledges that no mitigation is perfect, and residual risk will always exist. The "Partially Implemented" status further reinforces that the current impact is likely closer to "Medium" and can be elevated to "High" with full implementation.

#### 4.3. Analysis of Current and Missing Implementation:

*   **Currently Implemented: Partially Implemented. We conduct general code reviews for all code changes, including modifications to KSP processors. However, security is not consistently the primary focus in these general code reviews, and we lack dedicated, scheduled security audits specifically targeting our custom KSP processors.** This accurately reflects a common scenario where security is considered but not prioritized or systematically addressed for specific components like KSP processors. General code reviews are helpful but often lack the depth and focus needed for security-critical components.
*   **Missing Implementation: We need to establish a formal process for regular, dedicated security audits of our custom KSP processors. We should also enhance our existing code review process to explicitly incorporate security checklists and guidelines tailored for KSP processor code, ensuring that security is a central consideration in all KSP processor development and maintenance activities.** This clearly outlines the necessary steps to move from partial to full implementation.  Formalizing dedicated security audits and enhancing code reviews with security-specific checklists are crucial for realizing the full potential of this mitigation strategy.
