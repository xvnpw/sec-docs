## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via KSP Exploitation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_ksp_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved their objective by leveraging vulnerabilities related to KSP.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in KSP Processors (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_ksp_processors__critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting flaws within the custom KSP processors developed for the application.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Code Injection in Generated Code:** Attackers aim to inject malicious code into the code generated by the KSP processor.
        * **Logic Errors in Processor Leading to Insecure Code:** Flaws in the processor's logic can result in the generation of insecure code, even without direct injection.
        * **Resource Exhaustion During Code Generation:**  Attackers can provide inputs that cause the processor to consume excessive resources, leading to build failures or delays.
        * **Information Disclosure During Code Generation:** The processor might inadvertently expose sensitive information during the code generation process.
        * **Dependency Vulnerabilities in Processor Dependencies:** Vulnerabilities in libraries used by the KSP processor can be exploited.
        * **Denial of Service on Build System:** Exploiting processor vulnerabilities can cause the build process to crash or hang.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Code Injection in Generated Code (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__code_injection_in_generated_code__critical_node_.md)

This specific path details how attackers can inject malicious code through the KSP processor.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Supply Malicious Input to Processor Leading to Code Generation:**
            * Inject Malicious Strings/Data into Processor Annotations or Configuration: Injecting malicious code snippets within strings used by the processor for code generation.
            * Influence Processor Logic to Generate Unsafe Code Constructs: Manipulating input data to trick the processor into generating code with vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise the Build Environment to Manipulate KSP (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__compromise_the_build_environment_to_manipulate_ksp__critical_node_.md)

This path involves compromising the environment where the application is built to manipulate the KSP process.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Modify KSP Processor Code Directly:**
            * Gain Access to the Processor's Source Code Repository: Accessing and modifying the processor's source code.
            * Compromise Developer Machine with Access: Gaining access to a developer's machine that has access to the processor's code.
        * **Replace KSP Processor with a Malicious Version:**
            * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependency Management Systems: Exploiting weaknesses in package managers to substitute the legitimate processor.
            * Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Dependency Resolution: Intercepting and altering the download of the KSP processor.
        * **Tamper with KSP Configuration:**
            * Modify Build Scripts or Gradle Files to Alter Processor Behavior: Changing build configurations to influence the processor's execution.
            * Introduce Malicious Processor Options or Arguments: Adding harmful options to the processor's invocation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Modify KSP Processor Code Directly](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__modify_ksp_processor_code_directly.md)

This path focuses on directly altering the code of the KSP processor.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Gain Access to the Processor's Source Code Repository:
            * Compromise Developer Machine with Access:  Gaining control of a developer's machine to access the repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Developer Machine with Access](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_developer_machine_with_access.md)

A compromised developer machine provides a direct route to modifying the KSP processor code and potentially other sensitive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Misuse or Misconfiguration of KSP Leading to Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__misuse_or_misconfiguration_of_ksp_leading_to_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This path highlights vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure usage of KSP.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Using KSP to Generate Code Based on Untrusted Input:**
            * Allow User-Provided Data to Influence Code Generation Logic: Using user-provided data without proper sanitization in the code generation process.
            * Fail to Sanitize Input Before Passing to the Processor: Not properly sanitizing user input before it's used by the KSP processor.
        * **Insecure Code Generation Practices in Processors:**
            * Hardcoding Secrets or Credentials in Generated Code: Embedding sensitive information directly in the generated code.
            * Generating Code with Known Vulnerable Patterns (e.g., SQL injection): Creating code that is susceptible to common vulnerabilities.
        * **Overly Permissive Access Granted to KSP Processors:** Giving the processor more permissions than necessary.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Using KSP to Generate Code Based on Untrusted Input](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__using_ksp_to_generate_code_based_on_untrusted_input.md)

This path details the risks of using external, potentially malicious data in the code generation process.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Allow User-Provided Data to Influence Code Generation Logic:
            * Fail to Sanitize Input Before Passing to the Processor: Not cleaning or validating user input before the processor uses it to generate code.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Fail to Sanitize Input Before Passing to the Processor](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__fail_to_sanitize_input_before_passing_to_the_processor.md)

This is a critical point where the lack of input sanitization directly leads to potential vulnerabilities in the generated code.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Code Generation Practices in Processors](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insecure_code_generation_practices_in_processors.md)

This path focuses on flaws in how the KSP processor itself generates code.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Hardcoding Secrets or Credentials in Generated Code: Embedding sensitive information directly into the generated code.
        * Generating Code with Known Vulnerable Patterns (e.g., SQL injection):  Creating code that is inherently susceptible to common security flaws.
