# Threat Model Analysis for google/ksp

## Threat: [Malicious Processor Implementation](./threats/malicious_processor_implementation.md)

**Description:** An attacker introduces a deliberately malicious KSP processor as a dependency to the project. This processor, during the annotation processing phase, executes arbitrary code. This could involve reading sensitive files from the build environment (e.g., `.env` files, SSH keys), modifying source code, injecting malicious code into generated files, or even attempting to compromise the build server itself. The attacker might achieve this by compromising a legitimate library and injecting the malicious processor or by creating a seemingly useful but ultimately harmful processor.

**Impact:** Critical. This could lead to complete compromise of the build environment, exfiltration of sensitive data, injection of malware into the application, and supply chain attacks affecting downstream users.

**Affected KSP Component:** `KSP Compiler Plugin`, specifically the `SymbolProcessorProvider` interface and the lifecycle methods of the `SymbolProcessor`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet and audit all KSP processor dependencies.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in processor dependencies.
*   Implement a process for reviewing and approving new KSP processor dependencies.
*   Consider using a private artifact repository with security scanning for dependencies.
*   Monitor build logs for suspicious activity during the KSP processing phase.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Processor Implementation Leading to Code Injection](./threats/vulnerable_processor_implementation_leading_to_code_injection.md)

**Description:** A KSP processor, while not intentionally malicious, contains vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the generated Kotlin code. This could occur if the processor dynamically generates code based on untrusted input (e.g., annotation parameters) without proper sanitization or escaping. An attacker could craft specific annotation values to inject malicious logic into the final application.

**Impact:** High. This can lead to various runtime vulnerabilities in the application, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection (if the generated code interacts with databases), or remote code execution depending on the injected code's capabilities.

**Affected KSP Component:** `SymbolProcessor` implementation, specifically the code generation APIs (`CodeGenerator`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing KSP processors, especially when generating code based on external input.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the processor.
*   Avoid dynamic code generation based on untrusted input where possible.
*   Conduct thorough code reviews of KSP processor implementations.
*   Utilize static analysis tools to identify potential code injection vulnerabilities in processors.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attack on Processor Dependencies](./threats/dependency_confusion_attack_on_processor_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker could upload a malicious package to a public repository with the same name as an internal dependency used by a KSP processor. If the build system is not configured correctly to prioritize internal repositories, the malicious package could be downloaded and used during the build process, potentially leading to the "Malicious Processor Implementation" threat.

**Impact:** High. Can lead to the execution of malicious code during the build, potentially compromising the build environment and the application itself.

**Affected KSP Component:**  While not directly a KSP component, it affects the dependency resolution process used by the build system to fetch processor dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure the build system to prioritize internal or private artifact repositories.
*   Implement dependency verification mechanisms (e.g., checksum verification).
*   Use namespace prefixes for internal dependencies to avoid naming collisions.
*   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Compromised Build Environment Injecting Malicious Processors](./threats/compromised_build_environment_injecting_malicious_processors.md)

**Description:** If the build environment itself is compromised (e.g., a developer's machine or the CI/CD server), an attacker could directly inject malicious KSP processors into the project's dependency configuration or replace legitimate processor artifacts.

**Impact:** Critical. Complete compromise of the build process, leading to potentially undetectable injection of malicious code into the application.

**Affected KSP Component:** All KSP components are vulnerable as the attacker has control over the environment where they are executed.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong security measures for the build environment (e.g., access controls, regular security audits, vulnerability scanning).
*   Use secure CI/CD pipelines with proper authentication and authorization.
*   Educate developers about the risks of compromised development environments.
*   Implement integrity checks for build artifacts and dependencies.
