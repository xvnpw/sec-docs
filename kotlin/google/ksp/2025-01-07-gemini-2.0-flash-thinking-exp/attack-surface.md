# Attack Surface Analysis for google/ksp

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Compromised KSP Processors](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_compromised_ksp_processors.md)

**Description:** The application uses a KSP processor that is intentionally malicious or has been compromised, leading to the injection of harmful code during compilation.

**How KSP Contributes:** KSP's core functionality is to execute processors that generate code. If a processor is malicious, KSP provides the execution environment for it to inject arbitrary code into the project's source.

**Example:** A compromised processor could inject code that creates a backdoor allowing remote access to the application or exfiltrates sensitive data during runtime.

**Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the application, potential data breach, and loss of control.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Carefully vet and select KSP processors from trusted sources.
    * Review the source code of processors before including them in the project.
    * Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in processor dependencies.
    * Implement a process for verifying the integrity of processor artifacts (e.g., using checksums or signatures).

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in KSP Processors](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_ksp_processors.md)

**Description:** A KSP processor relies on vulnerable third-party libraries, and these vulnerabilities are exploitable during the build process or in the generated code.

**How KSP Contributes:** KSP processors, like any software, have dependencies. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, a malicious actor could exploit them through the processor during the build.

**Example:** A processor uses an outdated logging library with a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability during the build process or by manipulating inputs that the generated code processes.

**Impact:** High - Potential for remote code execution during build or runtime, data compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Regularly update KSP processors and their dependencies to the latest versions.
    * Use dependency management tools that provide vulnerability scanning and alerts.
    * Encourage processor developers to maintain their dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Build Script Manipulation to Introduce Malicious Processors](./attack_surfaces/build_script_manipulation_to_introduce_malicious_processors.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the project's build scripts (e.g., `build.gradle.kts`) and modifies them to include malicious KSP processors.

**How KSP Contributes:** KSP processors are declared and applied within the build scripts. Compromising these scripts allows attackers to inject arbitrary processors into the build process.

**Example:** An attacker adds a malicious processor to the `plugins` block in the build script. This processor then injects code that steals environment variables containing sensitive credentials during the build.

**Impact:** High - Introduction of malicious code into the build process, potentially leading to compromised artifacts.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Secure access to build scripts and version control systems.
    * Implement code review processes for changes to build scripts.
    * Use access control mechanisms to restrict who can modify build configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Build Environment Compromise Affecting KSP Execution](./attack_surfaces/build_environment_compromise_affecting_ksp_execution.md)

**Description:** If the build environment itself is compromised, an attacker could manipulate the KSP processor artifacts or their dependencies before they are used in the build process.

**How KSP Contributes:** KSP relies on the integrity of the environment where it executes. If this environment is compromised, KSP will execute potentially malicious processors or use tampered dependencies.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD server and replaces a legitimate processor artifact with a malicious one. Subsequent builds will then use this malicious processor.

**Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the build process, leading to potentially widespread distribution of compromised applications.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Harden the build environment and implement strong access controls.
    * Regularly scan the build environment for malware and vulnerabilities.
    * Use secure CI/CD pipelines with proper authentication and authorization.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting KSP Processor Distribution](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_ksp_processor_distribution.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor compromises the distribution channel of a KSP processor, replacing a legitimate processor with a malicious one.

**How KSP Contributes:** KSP relies on developers fetching and using processors from external sources. If these sources are compromised, KSP becomes a vector for distributing malicious code.

**Example:** An attacker compromises a public Maven repository and replaces a popular KSP processor with a backdoored version. Developers unknowingly download and use the malicious processor.

**Impact:** Critical - Wide-scale compromise of applications using the affected processor.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Use trusted and reputable sources for KSP processors.
    * Verify the integrity of downloaded processor artifacts (e.g., using checksums or signatures).
    * Consider using private or internal repositories for managing KSP processors.
