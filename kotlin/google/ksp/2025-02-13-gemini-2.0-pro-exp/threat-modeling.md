## Threat: [Malicious Processor Injection](./threats/malicious_processor_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Processor Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious KSP processor and injects it into the build process.  This is achieved by compromising a dependency repository, manipulating build scripts, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the build environment. The malicious processor executes arbitrary code *during the compilation phase*, leveraging KSP's access to the source code and build context.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Code execution on the build server (with the privileges of the build process).
        *   Injection of malicious code into the compiled application (potentially bypassing later security checks).
        *   Data exfiltration (source code, build artifacts, credentials available to the build process).
        *   Compromise of the entire build pipeline.
    *   **KSP Component Affected:** `SymbolProcessorProvider`, `SymbolProcessor`, the entire KSP processing pipeline. The attacker's malicious code replaces or wraps legitimate KSP API implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management system (Gradle, Maven) with:
            *   Explicit, *pinned* versions (no ranges or `latest`).
            *   Cryptographic checksum verification (e.g., `sha256`).
            *   Signed artifacts (if supported by the repository and tooling).
        *   **Secure Build Environment:**
            *   Harden build servers and CI/CD pipelines against unauthorized access.
            *   Restrict network access to/from build servers.
            *   Regularly update build tools and all dependencies.
        *   **Build Script Integrity:**
            *   Use version control for build scripts (e.g., `build.gradle.kts`).
            *   Mandatory code review for *all* build script changes.
            *   Consider build script signing (if a practical mechanism is available).
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the build process with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges. Avoid running builds as root or with administrative access.

## Threat: [Processor Code Tampering](./threats/processor_code_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Processor Code Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the bytecode of a legitimate KSP processor *after* it has been downloaded (and potentially verified) but *before* it is executed by the KSP runtime. This requires write access to the build cache or the ability to intercept the processor's execution. The tampered processor then executes malicious code within the KSP context.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to Malicious Processor Injection, but potentially more insidious as it targets a seemingly trusted processor.
        *   Code execution on the build server.
        *   Injection of malicious code into the application.
        *   Data exfiltration.
    *   **KSP Component Affected:** The compiled `.jar` file of a `SymbolProcessor` or `SymbolProcessorProvider`. The attack targets the *binary* of the processor, not its source.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immutable Build Artifacts:** Treat downloaded processor JARs as *completely immutable*. Any modification, no matter how small, should trigger an immediate build failure and a security investigation.
        *   **Checksum Verification (Post-Download, Pre-Execution):** Verify the checksum of the processor JAR *immediately before* execution, *not just* at download time. This verification should be performed within the build script itself, ideally as close as possible to the point where the processor is loaded.
        *   **Secure Build Cache:** Protect the build cache directory with *strict* file system permissions. Only the build process itself should have write access.  Consider using a dedicated, isolated cache for KSP processors.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Employ file integrity monitoring tools (e.g., Tripwire, AIDE, OS-specific equivalents) to detect any unauthorized modifications to the build cache and other critical directories related to KSP.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Processor](./threats/information_disclosure_via_processor.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Processor

    *   **Description:** A KSP processor (either intentionally malicious or unintentionally vulnerable) reads sensitive information present in the source code being processed (API keys, hardcoded credentials, internal network details) and leaks it.  This leakage occurs *during the KSP processing phase* and could be through logging, error messages, writing to insecure files, or even network communication (if the processor has such access). This is a *direct* threat because KSP provides the processor with access to the source code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to account compromise or system breaches.
        *   Reputational damage.
        *   Compliance violations.
    *   **KSP Component Affected:** `SymbolProcessor.process()`, and any code within the processor that interacts with `KSNode` instances (which represent the parsed source code). The vulnerability lies in *how* the processor handles the information provided by KSP.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review (Processor Source):** *Mandatory*, thorough code review of the source code of *all* KSP processors, focusing on:
            *   Secure handling of any sensitive data encountered.
            *   Avoidance of unnecessary logging of sensitive information.
            *   Proper, secure error handling that does *not* expose secrets.
        *   **Strictly No Hardcoded Secrets:**  Enforce a strict policy against hardcoding *any* secrets in the source code that KSP will process. Use:
            *   Environment variables.
            *   Configuration files (loaded at *runtime*, not during compilation).
            *   Dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager).
        *   **Input Validation (Conceptual):** While KSP deals with source code, the principle of input validation is relevant. Be mindful of what data the processor is accessing and avoid processing unnecessary files or code sections.
        *   **Restrict Processor Capabilities (If Possible):** Ideally, limit the processor's access to the file system and network. This is often difficult to achieve in practice with current KSP implementations, but any restrictions can help.
