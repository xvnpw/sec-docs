## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Dependency Management and Vetting (of KSP Processors)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_dependency_management_and_vetting__of_ksp_processors_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify all KSP Processors:** List all KSP processors, their sources, and versions.
2.  **Research Each Processor:** Investigate reputation, maintainer, activity, and security issues.
3.  **Pin Dependencies:** In `build.gradle.kts` (or equivalent), specify the *exact* version of each KSP processor.  Use `implementation("com.example:my-processor:1.2.3")`, not `implementation("com.example:my-processor:+")`.
4.  **Calculate Checksums:** Calculate SHA-256 checksums (or similar) for each processor JAR.
5.  **Configure Dependency Verification:** Configure your build system (Gradle, Maven) to verify dependencies using checksums.
6.  **Regular Audits:** Schedule regular audits of all KSP processor dependencies. Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
7.  **Private Repository (Optional):** Consider a private repository manager (Nexus, Artifactory) for pre-vetted KSP processors.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious KSP Processor (Supply Chain Attack):** *Severity: Critical*.
    *   **Vulnerable KSP Processor (Known Vulnerabilities):** *Severity: High to Critical*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious KSP Processor:** Significantly reduces risk. Pinning and checksums make substitution difficult.
    *   **Vulnerable KSP Processor:** Reduces risk by ensuring a known, (hopefully) patched version. Audits catch new vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dependency pinning in `build.gradle.kts`.
    *   Monthly dependency audits with OWASP Dependency-Check.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Checksum verification is *not* implemented.
    *   No private repository manager.

2.  **Configure Tools:** Include the KSP generated code directory in the analysis scope.
3.  **Customize Rules (Optional):** Create custom rules for specific KSP processor concerns.
